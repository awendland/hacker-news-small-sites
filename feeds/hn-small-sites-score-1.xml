            <p>Earlier today, I had the misfortune of reading a blog post about the dangers of the decentralized web and how we should not partake in or encourage it's development. Hacker News had a pretty <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25312854" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">active discussion</a> about the post.</p><p>Ideological takes on this always turn ugly, and I'm at a point in my life where I avoid that at all costs. I can only talk about my preferences about the world, not about how things ought to be, implying some sort of inherent value or divine moral good.</p><p>Here's what I prefer: a world where ideas, no matter how silly or dangerous, are allowed to be expressed, shared, ignored, attacked and laughed at. I don't imagine a world like this can ever exist easily, but a more decentralized web can help us get halfway there.</p><h3 id="ok-so-what-about-gurlic-then">Ok so what about Gurlic then?</h3><p><a href="https://gurlic.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Gurlic</a> is roughly just over two months old now, and at a point where I am relatively comfortable with the basic features it has. In the coming weeks and months, I want to focus on modifying the backend to either adopt an existing decentralized protocol, or think about how to approach writing a new one. Perhaps it would have been smarter to do this before building it first, but that would have limited how I envisioned Gurlic to be and it would've turned out differently.</p><p>Right now I'm looking into the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">activitypub</a> spec, and the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">matrix</a> spec - here are some initial thoughts I have about how Gurlic should approach decentralization/federation.</p><ul><li><p>Decentralization can be a priority, but must never be promoted as a feature, or made to be a selling point. When decentralization becomes the main selling point of a product or service, the usability and polish tend to suffer. Not always, but nearly always. None of the marketing copy should include the words 'decentralization', 'privacy' etc. <strong>Normal users don't care about any of this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>User experience should be seamless. The user shouldn't have to generate a key, remember an extra password, remember weird URL schemes, or download utilities and clients just to be part of an online community or to write an article. Above all, the user must not be confused, as one usually is when looking at Mastodon instances, which one to sign up to, and so on. My mom should be able to use it without having to call me, just like she does with Facebook. <strong>Normal users do care about this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The protocol must be flexible enough to allow for all of Gurlic's current features. This means communities, user profiles, publications, articles, galleries, rich media posts, sharing/responding and so on. All seamlessly without any rough edges.</p></li><li><p>Any and all cryptocurrency/blockchain must be avoided.</p></li></ul><p>I'll have more to write about this in the near future.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="main-content"><article><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517400508447-f8dd518b86db?w=1226&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=edges" alt=""><div><section><p>We wrote about <a href="https://security.christmas/2019/21">"Safe travels for the road warrior"</a> last year. This year we offer one more trick, and expand our list for staying safe and secure on the road.</p>
<p>Watch out for shoulder surfers, and protect your equipment if you have to leave it in for example your hotel room.</p>
</section><article><section><p><em>PANDEMIC WARNING: Stay at home if you can. A virus has for the better part of 2020 attacked physical infrastructure (people). We have no patch or hotfix, so while that is being worked out, we advice you to travel as little as possible.</em> </p>
<h2>Shoulder surfers:</h2>
<p>Be aware of your surroundings and reduce the risk of shoulder surfers. A shoulder surfer is someone who is peaking over your shoulder to get information. We can spot people prone to this type of social engineering attack all the time. When people are visiting a cafee, are on public transport, or on air planes they will use their laptop for work stuff. And they don’t notice, or care if someone is looking.</p>
<p>To protect your information, you can, and should invest in a privacy shield for you screen. They cost next to nothing, but reduce/limit the viewing angle of your display.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/privacy-screen-protector-angle-2.jpg" alt="privacy screen protector"></p>
<p>Reduce the number of apps visible on your computer. On a Mac I recommend that you use <a href="https://www.macbartender.com/">Bartender</a>, but there are Windows and *Nix options as well. The point of this application is that it hides all the running apps from the menu bar, so that it looks like this: </p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QsbNjHu.png" alt="a neat menu bar"></p>
<p>rather than this abomination of a menu bar: </p>
<p><img src="https://eshop.macsales.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1password1280.jpg" alt="an untidy and talkative menue bar"></p>
<p>The reason for hiding this information from shoulder surfers is that it reveals many of your attack vector. If someone knows what applications you are running, they know a lot about you. Developer tools, Automator scripts, and a password manager? You presumably work in IT. Bluetooth enabled, an old version of Outlook and a TorrentClient? The bad guys already have tools for these applications.  </p>
<h2>Mikado security</h2>
<p>The other tip is to not leave your computer laying around. This may seem obvious, but there are times when this is impossible. There will be events where you have super secret stuff on your computer, and must step away for a period of time. For instance in a hotel room while you are away for an hour, or go to a resturant.</p>
<p>If an adversary has physical access to your device, they can do all sort of damage. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/12/11/poker_pros_call_shenanigans_over_hotel_malware_infections/">A poker player had this happen to him</a>, where someone broke into his hotel room to install malware on his laptop. This is only one of the cases, but we suspect there are many more based on  the fact that hotel room locks are <a href="https://youtu.be/-Bazy3Ew6D4">ridiculously insecure</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/RX-O4XuCW1Y">easy to bypass</a>.<br>
So to combat this problem, we have devised a nice little trick to help you stay safe if you have to leave your device behind.</p>
<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/5475/9350249910_6aeb4b5d85_h.jpg">
<a href="https://flic.kr/p/ffftxm">Mikado</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kobakpontorg/">Balazs Koren</a>, on Flickr</p>
<p>Mikado (also known as “pick-up sticks game”) is a game where players drop a bundle of sticks as a loose bunch onto a table top. Each player in turn tries to remove a stick from the pile without disturbing any of the others.</p>
<p>MikadoSecurity is where you spread the sticks over the object that you want to protect. You then take a picture of it, and when you return, you can verify that no one has tampered with your device.
In the event that the sticks are not as you left them, you can escalate the problem. Either to do forensics, or discard the computer if you need to.</p>
<p>This trick relies on the same principles as we rely on for computer security. Prime number factoring, traveling salesman problem and SAT are hard to solve if P != NP, but easy to verify.
An example of this is a sudoku board. It is hard for both humans and computers to solve, but if I hand you a board, it is easy for you to verify if I did it correct. </p>

<p>Corrections added to the Creator/Type code section thanks to user "Somebody" on Hacker News</p>

<p>Suppose you double-click on a file on your computer. You're doing this so you can open the file and work with it. But does your operating system know what that means? How does it know <em>what</em> to open the file <em>in</em>? Let's look at some solutions that have been proposed over the years to solving this issue.</p>
<p>(fun fact: this originally started as a touchup of <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/2/">one of my oldest articles</a> before just kinda becoming this whole <em>thing</em>, so expect a bit of retreading.)</p>
<h2>Nothing</h2>
<p><img alt="IBM 709 in use" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/IBM709.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: Early mainframes such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_704">IBM 704</a>, etc.</p>
<p>(Image credit: <a href="https://www.computer-history.info/Page4.dir/pages/IBM.704.dir/">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>)</p>
<p>What's a "file", anyways? It's a sequence of bytes on a disk, possibly floppy. Or a tape. (Cassette or paper, your choice.) Or on stacks of cards with holes in them. Or toggled in by hand on a front panel.</p>
<p>File types weren't relevant because <em>files</em> weren't really a thing. In the mainframe era, you typically 
1. loaded a program on to your computer from punch cards or a tape
2. fed input into that program either from a teletype terminal or from a different tape/card deck
3. received output from the teletype, a line printer, or yet another tape/card deck</p>
<p>Computers weren't complicated enough where there was any confusion as to what a file on a certain medium <em>was</em>, simply because there was so little to work with. If you had a stack of punchcards, that was your "file". Hope you labeled the box you put it in!</p>
<p>Tapes are more interesting, because they hold substantially more data. (A whopping 5.76 megabytes, stored on 3/4 of a kilometer of magentic tape. How exciting!) That said, storing more than one file on a tape was a strange task. Operating systems weren't really a <em>thing</em> yet. The best that existed were programming languages such as FORTRAN or COBOL that had statements for hardware tasks such as reading from or writing to a tape or punch card. For example, <a href="http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Fortran/102649787.05.01.acc.pdf">here's the manual for FORTRAN for the IBM 704.</a> We have several commands such as <code>READ</code> (from the punch card reader), <code>READ TAPE</code>, <code>PUNCH</code> (new cards), <code>PRINT</code> (to the printer), etc.</p>
<p>On the IBM tape units of the time (ex: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_727">IBM 727</a>), tapes were separated into <em>files</em> and <em>records</em>. In FORTRAN, records were created on every <code>WRITE TAPE</code> command, and could be read with <code>READ TAPE</code> later. Records could be overwritten by using the <code>BACKSPACE</code> statement and then writing again. Files were collections of records, and could be created with an <code>END FILE</code> command.</p>
<p>As an aside, later programming languages such as C still share their heritage from this era. This is why we draw text to the screen with <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/"><code>printf</code></a> which long ago would have literally printed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33">teletype terminal</a>, why we read files using <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/rewind/"><code>rewind</code></a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fseek/"><code>fseek</code></a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fread/"><code>fread</code></a>, and <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fwrite/"><code>fwrite</code></a> as if we were on a tape drive still. Even <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII</a>, the encoding most commonly used for the basic Latin alphabet, has code points for file, group, record, and unit separators. (This may also be related to block terminals, something that will be discussed in a future article.)</p>
<p>As mainframes moved onto more advanced batch processing and later interactive time-share operating systems like UNIX, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/360_and_successors">OS/360</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Terminal_System">Michigan Terminal System</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_Timesharing_System">ITS</a>, etc., they gained more sophisticated methods of dealing with files than raw tape drive access. But then came the microcomputers.</p>
<h2>Type Codes</h2>
<p><img alt="Apple DOS file listing" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/appledos.gif"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_DOS">Apple DOS for Apple II</a> (1978-1980), <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp28c.htm">HP-28</a> and <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp48s.htm">HP-48</a> series, etc.</p>
<p>We have floppy disks now. They can store a lot of files, rename them, delete them, etc. without too much issue. There's this neat computer called the Apple II that just came out. It uses these new-fangled disks, so it needs to figure out how to store files on it.</p>
<p>The way that Apple DOS (the Apple II's disk operating system for most of it's life) stored files is somewhat interesting. Each file has a name (up to 30 characters) and also a <em>type code</em>. 8 of them were defined but only 4 of them mattered:</p>
<ul>
<li>I (Integer BASIC program)</li>
<li>A (Applesoft BASIC program)</li>
<li>B (Binary files; either assembled programs or data)</li>
<li>T (ASCII text files)</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple DOS had some specific commands that interacted with these types. For instance, the <code>RUN</code> command worked on both Interger BASIC and Applesoft BASIC programs, and chose which one to use. <code>BRUN</code>, <em>binary run</em>, only worked on binary files. <code>OPEN</code>, <code>READ</code>, <code>WRITE</code>, and <code>CLOSE</code> all worked only on ASCII text files.</p>
<p><strong>The types more served as a way to help the operating system more so than you.</strong> This is especially evident in the late 80's and early 90's HP calculators such as the HP-28c and the HP-48GX. These calculators didn't have disks, but they did have persistent memory that could store objects into folders much like a computer.</p>
<p>These calculators used Reverse Polish Notation. Essentially, you do math by placing objects on the stack and then executing commands, which take things from the stack and put a new thing on. An <em>object</em> in RPN is something you placed on the stack. The HP-48's Advanced User's Reference Manual lists 32 distinct types, including real numbers, complex numbers, character strings, arrays, lists, variable names, executable programs, graphics objects, directories, etc. A <em>command</em> could be, say, <code>ADD</code> or some fancy plotting calculus stuff. Whatever they were, they needed to know what types they were dealing with so that they could either reject the input or properly work with it.</p>
<p>Like the Apple II, just having an integer for a type is perfectly okay because the types don't serve the user. They're just there so the operating system knows what a given chunk of bytes on the stack <em>is</em>. There are a few reserved spots for custom types, but for the most parts new types aren't expected to ever be added, nor should they be.</p>
<h3>File Extensions</h3>
<p><img alt="CP/M disk listing as seen on an Amstrad CPC" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/cpm.gif"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: AMSDOS (Amstrad CPC), CP/M, MS-DOS, etc.</p>
<p>Microcomputers really started to gain in popularity with the likes of the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC and the Commodore 64 among others. These were fairly cheap and simple computers. When first launched, these came with nothing but cassette tape inputs, as disks were too expensive.</p>
<p>On these computers, you'd attach a cassette player using a standard AUX cord (although some, like the CPC, had a cassette player built in), and the computer would instruct you when to start and stop the tape. These cassette players usually came with a little counter that rolled up as the tape progressed, to help you tell where the tape was. When you insert a tape, you reset the counter to zero. When you want to <em>make</em> a file, you'd write down what the counter read, then save the file. To <em>load a specific file</em>, you'd seek the tape until you're at the location you've written down, then start reading.</p>
<p>More advanced computers such as the Amstrad CPC instead saved <a href="http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/AMSDOS_Header">a header</a> with each file containing, among other things, a file name and extension. If asked for a specific file it could just read the tape until it found it. Later these computers gained disk drives, and any ad-hoc tape fiddling was replaced with a proper file system such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table">FAT</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_File_System">MFS</a> that stored <em>where</em> a file was on a given disk and <em>what is was called</em>.</p>
<p>File codes are limited. It is nigh-on impossible to add more ones. What you have is what you got. So... what if we just made the codes out of letters? A couple of them? And they could be anything. Then programmers could come up with whatever file extensions they want and that's okay.</p>
<p>Suppose, in MS-DOS, you have a file named <code>REPORT.TXT</code>. <code>REPORT</code> is the file name, <code>TXT</code> is the extension. <strong>File extensions give an easy, consistent indicator of what a file contains.</strong> A <code>TXT</code> file contains text, a <code>BMP</code> file is a bitmap, etc. </p>
<p>Some file extensions, like <code>EXE</code>, <code>BAT</code>, <code>SYS</code> and <code>COM</code> had special meaning much in the same way that the Apple DOS codes had special meanings, but other than that they're just there to help the user. <strong>The user had to manually choose which program to use.</strong> This allowed for the user to choose what view or editor to use depending on what would be the most helpful. Unfortunately, there were no default programs. If the user didn't know which program, say, a <code>VIZ</code> file is for, they're out of luck. Is it a visualization? Some manga thing? The digital manifestation of a cute internet ghost who's staying up way too late geeking out about old computers? <em>The world may never know...</em></p>
<h3>Creator Codes</h3>
<p><strong>Used in:</strong> Classic Mac OS</p>
<p><img alt="File properties dialog on Classic Mac OS" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/macinfo.gif"></p>
<p>Let's hop on over to the Macintosh for a quick second. It was a newfangled thing in 1984, and it had the opportunity to reinvent the wheel and break compatibility with CP/M and mainframe traditions. And so it did.</p>
<p>The original 128K Macintosh used 400K floppy disks, a not-completely-terrible amount of space for the time. It used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_File_System">MFS</a>, which didn't support directories but <em>did</em> support files. It was also completely graphically driven. The Finder was supposed to be the primary way of interacting with files, and the <code>File &gt; Open</code> command could launch the program that made the file. How'd it do that?</p>
<p><strong>Instead of file extensions, the Macintosh used type and creator codes</strong>. These were 4-byte identifiers, much like file extensions, but there were two of them each with a different meaning. The type code was mean to represent the format the data was stored in, used to filter files in the Finder's "Open" dialog. The creator code was meant to indicate the application that created the file, and used by the Finder to choose which specific application to launch. Now, these weren't normally visible to the user. They just saw the file name and a icon for that type.</p>
<p>To do that, the system kept a database of codes and their associated icons and programs. When ran for the first time or moved from disk to disk, <strong>the Finder would read the program data and register in a database what creator codes and file types it supported.</strong> The Finder would then save this information on the disk containing the application. Later, <strong>when the user opened a file, the OS would check its type and creator code against its stored list to determine which application to use.</strong> This worked pretty well.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>All is quiet at Greta Thunberg's home on Kungsholmen in Stockholm. On this day one year ago she was at sea, on a catamaran in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Now she has just come home from school. Labrador Roxy is asleep on the couch, and Moses, the golden retriever, has crashed out on the floor. A thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle is spread out over the kitchen table on which Greta lays edge pieces while waiting for Sir David to appear on the computer monitor.</p>
        
    
  
    

        
    
  
    

      <p><strong>This fall, she is the main character</strong> in Nathan Grossman's feature film Greta. He has recently released the film and the book A Life on our Planet.</p>
      <p>In the introduction to the film, Sir David says:</p>
      <p>”The natural world is disappearing. The evidence is all around us, it is happened in my lifetime. I have seen it with my own eyes.”</p>
      <p>The story starts in 1937, the year he turned 11.</p>
      <p>Then: Wilderness on 66 percent of the Earth, a carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere of 280 ppm.</p>
      <p>And now? Wilderness on 35 percent of the Earth, a carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere of 415 ppm.</p>
      <p>Just like climate change and the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/11/covid-19-pandemics-nature-scientists/">ongoing pandemic</a>, the loss of biodiversity is part of a major sustainability crisis caused by humans.</p>

      <p><strong>The computer pings</strong>, and Gretas kitchen is filled with a familiar voice coming from the speakers. A voice usually accompanied by pictures of vast savannas, colorful coral reefs and mighty animals cheerfully says:</p>

      <p>DN's Head of Culture Björn Wiman leads the conversation by link from home.</p>
      <p><strong>Björn Wiman: ”Sir David, how is life for you during the pandemic?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>David Attenborough:</strong> ”Well, it is not so bad. I am lucky to have a garden. It is not a big garden, but it is a garden, and it has a pond. I get food delivered once a week. And I have a lot to do: I can write here and I record, doing my voiceovers while watching the programs on a screen. So I have been pretty active... I have not actually left the house in eight and a half months, which is extraordinary. But I cannot complain.”</p>
      <p><strong>”Greta, I know that films and documentaries like the ones Sir David has made were what got you interested in this subject from the start.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Greta Thunberg:</strong> ”Yes, that is right. It was by watching documentaries and films that I was introduced to the climate crisis and the environmental crisis. That is how I learned and linked the facts to start with. It was a big eye-opener for me.”</p>

      <p><strong>”This conversation is about two parts of the same major crisis: Climate change and the mass extinction of other species on Earth. My impression is that the climate crisis sometimes takes up a disproportionate amount of space and that too little attention is focused on the interaction between these two crises. Do you agree?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”These crises are interconnected. We cannot communicate one crisis without communicating the other. Unfortunately, the media today works in such a way that we want simple and click-friendly headlines. That can make it difficult to explain complex issues, and this is a very complicated issue. We need to connect the information: This is not one crisis, it is not two or three separate crises. This is a symptom of a much bigger issue.”</p>

      <p><strong>”Do you think, Greta, that there is too much focus on the ”nature side” of this issue – and too little on the consequences for human civilization and the future of humanity?”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”No, I do not think there is too much focus on nature. I think there is too little focus on nature.”</p>
      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”Yes, that is right.”</p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”There is too little focus on all aspects of this crisis.”</p>
        
  
  

      <p><strong>”Does that also apply to the ”solution side” of this problem? You sometimes hear ‘the solution can be found in new technological systems’ or ‘the solution is that we change our way of life’.”</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”There is not one single solution. There are a number of different solutions because there are a lot of problems. Fishing has a set of problems, carbon dioxide emissions have different problems, the way we treat agricultural land. The fuel and energy industries have their own challenges. So there is not just one miraculous action that allows us to say, ‘Right, bingo, there we have it! We have resolved the issue.’ It is not like that! There are millions of issues.”</p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”Exactly. Sometimes it feels like we are wasting the little time we have now by arguing about what solution is best. ‘We shouldn not be doing this because this is better.’ As if we had a choice! As if we can decide for ourselves what we need to do, and as if there is one magical solution that will fix everything. We need to get away from that narrative, we need to leave that idea behind us.”</p>
      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”Yes, I agree. And at the end of the day, you know, it is a big world. The only thing we can do – what you, Greta, are particularly good at – is to ensure that people around the world see what the problem is. We have to be persistent, and we have to make sure there is a large democratic multitude of voices saying 'do something, do something, do something'. We have to keep that choir alive, or those with power will not react. But even when they do react, it is extremely difficult to reach agreement on how we should treat the oceans or the atmosphere.”</p>
      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”Yes. For a crisis as complex as this one, which we do not fully understand – for there will always be things we are unaware of – we must bring together all the experts. We have to deal with the crisis as a crisis and work together from there. We cannot expect to have all the answers delivered to us, for someone to say, ‘This is what we need to do. This is going to solve the problem.’ We have to find the answers along the way.”</p>

      <p><strong>GT:</strong> ”I think we simply need to tell the truth. We should be adult enough to handle the truth. And the truth can be quite frightening in some ways – but it is also hopeful. There is hope. And we should simply communicate the truth to get the whole picture.”</p>
      <p><strong>DA:</strong> ”Yes. And we cannot expect it to happen overnight, or in a year, or even in a decade. That we are going to solve all the problems. But there have been major changes already... I remember that ten years ago it was considered strange to invest in wind power and solar panels. But it actually happened! And veganism – you are a vegan, Greta – I mean: It has happened! So changes are happening, they are not sufficient, and they are not dramatic enough, but... We all move in our own circles, so it is hard to generalize. But in my circles I meet far more people who understand the problems now, far more people who do what they can in their own lives.”</p>

<p><strong>Monopoly Technology Platforms are Colonizing Education</strong></p>
<p><strong>By Larry Kuehn</strong></p>
<p>The exposés of abuse by social media corporations like Google and Facebook have finally brought attention to the dangers of monopolies over our communications. The way these monopolies have been colonizing public education has, however, gone almost unnoticed. This is rampant privatization sneaking in as essential to “21<sup>st</sup> Century learning.”</p>
<p>The top five global capital corporations are technology platforms—Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. Platforms are a host for a variety of services and uses. All of the big five platform corporations have become too large in a short period of time to have any significant competition outside of this group. They compete against one another, adding services to secure their monopoly by offering users everything they do online.</p>
<p>If a new service is developed that seems to be gaining users, or that competes with an element of their platform, it is purchased and integrated into the platform—avoiding new competitors. Alternatively, they use their massive resources to develop a comparable app and push the potential competitor aside.</p>
<p>Snicek, in <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Platform+Capitalism-p-9781509504862"><em>Platform Capitalism</em></a>, points out that the development of these monopolies “introduces new tendencies within capitalism that pose significant challenges to a post-capitalist future.” Building public cooperative platforms becomes an impossible dream.</p>
<p>No surprise—these platforms have moved to colonize education. Public education represents a big chunk of potential revenue. Just as importantly, schools are where one can find most of the future potential consumers and users of the platform services.</p>
<p>Colonization is a process where a significant force moves into an area and dominates. It takes over not only the production and resources, but imposes—often by stealth and power—the processes and approaches and even values of the social and cultural environment. And, dominate is what the monopoly platforms are on track to do in public education.</p>
<p><img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-400x200.png" alt="" width="262" height="131" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-400x200.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-768x384.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px">The most successful colonizer has been Google. A recent report indicates that Google’s <em>G-Suite for Education</em> is being used by half the teachers and students in the U.S. Canada is fast approaching the same level of use. It includes a range of free software tools that can be used by students and teachers—word processing, presentations, spread sheets and the like. G-Suite incorporates “Classroom,” an integrated learning management system that keeps track of grades, attendance and more. And, of course, YouTube is linked to student use.</p>
<p>New elements are added frequently. “Google Sites” is promoted for student e-portfolios, because “every student should publish for the world.” Google acquired Workbench, integrated with Google Classroom to give “lessons connected to a variety of ‘maker’ activities focused on STEM.” It is part of Google’s plan to “help schools and educators address their universal needs around education content.”</p>
<p>Google, rather than democratic public institutions, therefore shapes what is on offer. Google’s position as colonizer is strengthened by the hardware increasingly used in schools—the Google Chromebook. <img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-400x222.png" alt="" width="346" height="192" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-400x222.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-768x425.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px">It is less expensive than other computers because much of what it needs to operate is supplied by Google in the cloud—operating software, applications and memory. No need to build those into the computer.&nbsp; According to market reports, Chromebooks make up the majority of all computers sold to schools in the U.S. and are marketed globally.</p>
<p>However, one must have a gmail account to use these Google tools—so if a parent wants to protect the privacy of their child and refuses a gmail account that kid is left out while the rest of the class works away on their Chromebook and other Google tools. (See <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4497822/GAFE-Information-Letter-and-Consent-Form-page2.pdf">here</a> the kind of consent form parents are asked to sign, giving Google access to acquire and store student information outside of Canada.)</p>
<p><img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-400x70.png" alt="" width="657" height="115" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-400x70.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-768x135.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-1024x180.png 1024w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM.png 1238w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px"></p>
<p>Google has even taken up teaching “internet safety,” with a program aimed at reaching 5 million students. Its core is a game for students in Grades three to six to teach them to avoid “schemers, hackers and other bad actors.” However, as critics point out, it doesn’t talk about privacy concerns when users’ personal information and actions are tracked online. Google conveniently ignores its role as a “bad actor.”</p>
<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1474904116654917">Swedish study </a>of Google’s strategy concluded that “By making an implicit demarcation between two concepts (your) ‘data’ and (collected) ‘information’ Google can disguise the presence of a business model for online marketing and, at the same time, simulate the practices and ethics of a free public service institution.”</p>
<p>In “<a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/data.html">The Weaponization of Education Data</a>,” Audrey Watters points out “the risk isn’t only hacking.&nbsp; It’s amassing data in the first place. It’s profiling. It’s tracking. It’s surveilling.”</p>
<p>Google isn’t alone in the business of colonizing education and student data—just the most successful so far. One competitor is Microsoft 365 Education, with a promise of “empowering every student on the planet to achieve more” and that it will “unlock limitless learning.”</p>
<p>It’s not an accident that it is “Microsoft 365” that is being pushed. It offers a cloud-based software and cloud storage for your work. It is the new business model for Microsoft: they don’t sell you software, you rent it—and you keep paying for it. And your work isn’t saved on your own computer, so you have to keep up your subscription. Like Google, they are hoping that students will keep using their tools when they finish being students.</p>
<p>Microsoft is imitating much of what Google offers, but by charging for the service rather than trading it for data. It offers apps, educator training and STEM lessons “to enrich science, technology, engineering and math classes.” They offer “budget friendly” Windows 10 devices with licences for Microsoft 365 Education.</p>
<p>The other major tech corporations have programs as well. Apple, for example, was the first into education with the Apple IIe and the “Apple Classroom of Tomorrow” way back in the 1980s. More recently it depended on the ease of use of the iPad, despite its cost, to sell classroom sets along with Pearson curriculum in an <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/05/los-angeles-edtech/">ill-fated project with Los Angeles schools</a>.</p>
<p>Venture capitalists are hoping to find the magic app that will make a fortune. The potential market is indicated by expenditure of hundreds of millions each year on developing new products. The “winners” are likely to be bought up by one of the major corporations—or find their product idea taken by the monopolies.</p>
<p>Not enough attention is paid by education authorities or researchers to the shaping and distortion of education that is possible—even likely—by this colonization of education by technology monopolies.</p>

     <span>VisiData</span> is an easy-to-use multipurpose tool to explore, clean, edit, and restructure          
     data. Rows can be selected, filtered, and grouped; columns can be rearranged, trans-           
     formed, and derived via regex or Python expressions; and workflows can be saved, doc-          
     umented, and replayed.

<p>I used <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> for years in Russia, Germany, and the United States. All the time, the experience was great. At some point, I read a <a href="https://amzn.to/3o9JywH">book about Airbnb</a> to understand the company better.</p>

<p>For Thanksgiving week (November 21-29), five of my friends and I rented a house in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>The total price for nine days: <strong>$2543</strong>.</p>

<p>Previously people went to Vegas to spend time in casinos or walk on The Strip. This year, <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">the pandemic</a> made it impossible.</p>

<p>It was not a problem for us. We did not plan to socialize; we were going rock climbing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105731932/red-rock">Red Rocks</a>, located next to Vegas, is an excellent place for traditional, sport, bouldering, multi-pitch climbing.</p>

<p>The plan was for some people to take days off and climb every day, and for others to work three days remotely and join the gang during the rest.</p>

<h2 id="incident">Incident</h2>

<p>We moved in on Saturday night. The next morning, excited, we woke up at 6am, had breakfast, verified that we closed back and front doors and at 7am drove to the Red Rocks Park.</p>

<p>We had a fantastic day of climbing, but after the sunset, we went home to realize that the window in one of the rooms was open and some of our belongings had disappeared.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Three work Macbook Pro (I do not include the price, they are replaced by our employees for free)</li>
  <li>One personal <a href="https://amzn.to/33uWB3F">Macbook Pro</a> ($1550)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2JCZWqE">Oculus Quest 2</a>. I just bought it. Really cool. Wanted to share the experience. ($399)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2VnyrUt">GoPro Hero 6</a> ($194)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/36oMMGz">Lenovo Tab 4, 10.1in Android Tablet</a> ($190)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3lms9is">Sony WH1000XM3 Noise Cancelling Headphones</a> ($348)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3qbPNSm">Bose Quietcontrol 30 Wireless Headphones</a> ($169)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3fVzzIh">Bose Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Headphones 700</a> ($339)</li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/37qgsSN">BlueTooth ledger</a> ($118)</li>
  <li>Two backpacks. (2 x $100)</li>
</ul>

<p>I called the host, told her about the situation. She shared a set of images from the cameras and the next day sent the whole video.</p>

  </p>

<p>We believe this is what happened:</p>

<p>At 8:55am, two hours after we left, someone</p>
<ol>
  <li>Openly came to the front door.</li>
  <li>Knocked in the door.</li>
  <li>Waved Lexus car keys at the camera. (We do not have Lexus.)</li>
  <li>Ringed the bell.</li>
  <li>Waited to verify that no one was at home.</li>
  <li>Got to the back of the house.</li>
  <li>Put gloves and balaclava on.</li>
  <li>Checked if the back door was open. It was not.</li>
  <li>Checked if he can open the window. And it was possible.
10 Moved the pool chair below the window.</li>
  <li>Got into the house.</li>
</ol>

<p>We called the police, and in two hours an officer came. He was polite and professional. He got the list of the stolen items, our version of the incident in the written form, and left.</p>

<p>I was curious, how did the burglar open the window? I checked, and the answer was simple: <strong>the lock on the window was not operational.</strong> No need to break anything, anyone can open the window from the outside!</p>

<p>If the weather was warmer, we would probably try to open windows the night we came. In that case we would discover the problem, but the night was cold and we did not touch the windows.</p>

<p>Till this moment, I was chill. Bad things happen. Burglars get into houses, and no one could be protected from it. We were safe in this incident, and from the money perspective, our loss was not huge.</p>

<p>But the fact that the lock on that window was not functioning is an issue (few more windows had the same problem). If the front door lock was broken it would be worse but even windows that could not be locked are sketchy.</p>

<p>In general, I prefer to blame myself for bad things that happen to me. This time I cannot figure out what was my fault. For sure, we could check all the locks in the house, but it is an overkill.</p>

<p>I am ok with making mistakes and paying for them. But this time, we paid for the host’s errors and Airbnb’s as a company.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Host</strong>: the house was not ready for hosting the guests.</li>
  <li><strong>Airbnb</strong>: limitations of the onboarding policy. I believe there is a list of things that the house owner needs to mark to become a host, and either functioning window locks are not on the list, or it is not enforced.</li>
</ul>

<p>After we told the host about our discovery, she sent a person to lock all the windows completely. From now on, no one would be able to open them from inside or outside.</p>



<p>I wanted to reach out to Airbnb, tell them about the situation, and ask about the next steps.</p>

<p>Safety comes first. Hence I assumed that even if you are under stress and your brain is not functioning well, it is obvious how to contact the support team.</p>

<p>To my surprise, it is not the case.</p>

<p>I spent some time on the Airbnb website but could not figure out which phone number I should call.</p>

<p><strong>Message to AirBnb</strong>: It would be great if you simplify the design of the support page. When we talk about safety, it should be about efficiency and not about the visual appeal or cuteness level.</p>

<p>I would like it to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I open the Airbnb website =&gt; I see an obvious button/link to the support page.</li>
  <li>I open the support page =&gt; I see an obvious button/link to the hotline phone number.</li>
</ul>

<p>I posted the tweet about the incident and tagged Airbnb and Las Vegas police in it.</p>

<blockquote>— Vladimir Iglovikov (@viglovikov) <a href="https://twitter.com/viglovikov/status/1330741490759266304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>A miracle happened. Airbnb contacted me and asked for my email to identify the account and to get more details.</p>

<p>My guess is that the Marketing team at Airbnb has alarms that trigger when someone mentions the company on social media.</p>

<p>Finally, after two hours, we got into the conversation about the incident, but the path to get there was not obvious at all.</p>

<p>Imagine how many people got into trouble in similar situations and did not leverage this communication channel?</p>

<p>I got an email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My name is XXX, from the Airbnb claims team.</p>

  <p>I am contacting you regarding the incident that occurred during your reservation with YYY.</p>

  <p>As my colleague informed you in the previous email, we are only able to offer up to $500 for any stolen property. In order to proceed with this refund, I will need the following:</p>

  <p>*Original purchase invoice for the stolen items.</p>

  <p>This is requested as “proof of ownership”, if you don’t have the original purchase invoice, a picture of you where the item can be seen will also be accepted as proof of ownership.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this story is not about money. But getting compensated for the host’s and Airbnb’s mistake with cash or AirBnB credits would be nice. It does not address the issue with window locks but sweetens the situation.</p>

<p>We interpreted the email as: “We will compensate up to $500 per stolen item”. Using the numbers from the invoices, it summed to $2600.</p>

<p>We collected invoices, sent them to Airbnb, and got the reply with words: “After additional review, I’m happy to report that we have just released a payout in the amount of $500 to your Airbnb account. You can confirm in your Airbnb Transaction History.”</p>

<p>The guess about up to $500 per item was overly optimistic.</p>

<p>After the end of the stay, I got a message from the host:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi Vladimir,</p>

  <p>Thank you again for choosing our home for your vacation stay.</p>

  <p>I hope the home met (and even surpassed) your expectations. It was a sincere pleasure hosting you, and I really hope to host you again in the near future. I would be truly grateful for a 5 star review of your stay when you have a spare moment and I would definitely do the same for you.</p>

  <p>Also, please in the private comments if there is something, the home or myself can approve of please let me know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that this is a standard template, but under the circumstances, it sounds strange and
does not fit the story and overall experience.</p>

<p>I did not plan to share the actual address of the property. The harm to the renting business could be material. But after this text, I changed my mind. It does not look like the host plans to revise the house and look for things that can and should be fixed. For example, the front door lock is barely working. The door could be open with a good push.</p>



<p>We had a great vacation. The weather was good, and the red rocks are remarkable. We had a lot of fun and plan to come back sometime soon.</p>

<p>Work laptops were replaced. We accepted the loss of personal items.</p>

<p>The Airbnb experience was not as smooth as we expected. Our things got stolen, and even on the other days, we did not feel comfortable leaving belongings in the house.</p>

<p>The host was responsive, but it is not enough. Communicating with guests and collecting money should not be the only responsibility. It is worth inspecting the house and fixing things that do not work as expected proactively, without waiting till the universe gives you feedback.</p>

<p>Overall, I believe that staying at AirBnB is safe, and such incidents are the exception rather than the rule, but, for sure, Airbnb has some work to do to improve communication and increase the guests’ safety. The compensation of $500 for all the stolen items does not look fair either.</p>

<p>I would like to end the story with some action items like: “<strong>Next time, when I rent a place, I will do XXX</strong>.” Nothing reasonable comes to my mind.</p>

<p>When I sit in front of the computer in San Francisco, the only thing that comes to my mind is to build a Face Recognition system and check the burglar’s face in it. Something similar to Clearview. Machine Learning is my expertise; creating such a system is straightforward but will take some time. Tempting. Thinking about it.</p>

<p>What would be your action item after such an experience?</p>

            		<p>Often changes in the business side implies large changes in the corresponding code of the app to support it. Like changing business models from one-time purchase to subscription. Or that time when the business asked to provide that exclusive holiday app icon promotion for $1.99. All of these makes unit testing and integration testing of the app more challenging since in-app purchase code often interact heavily with the feature switches of corresponding products.</p>
<p>Won’t it be great if your in-app purchase code can keep working flawlessly as faced by business challenges?</p>
<p>How about having the ability to offer “<a href="https://cutecoder.org/business/time-limited-app-purchase/">exclusive limited-time availability</a>” special features as if they were physical products?</p>
<p>How to offer fully-functional <a href="https://cutecoder.org/business/free-trial-app-store/">time-limited trials</a> in Apple’s App Stores?</p>

<p>In Segmentâ€™s early days, we hit countless problems as a founding team. And at the time, I thought those problems were unique to our own special snowflake of a founding journey. I chalked it up to us being new grads and first-time founders.</p><p>But as I've worked with more and more startups, I've realized just how wrong I was.</p><p>Over the past five years, I've made about 25 different seed-stage investments. In doing so, it's taught me a <em>LOT</em> about the common errors that startup founders make. Even across different industries and levels of experience, I see founders hitting the exact same set of problems we encountered in the early days of Segment!</p><p>This post shares a handful of the top lessons that benefit todayâ€™s early stage founders. Itâ€™s a list of the things I wish weâ€™d figured out earlier at Segment. [1]</p><p>This sounds incredibly boring... but the #1 mistake I see startups making is that they donâ€™t set goals. If you take one thing from this post, it's that you should set goals for where you want to be.</p><p>For the longest time at Segment, we didn't have goals. We moved ahead in various (often random) directions, and we would launch features consistently... but we never really set goals at all.</p><p>As we grew the company, we started to lose momentum. Teams were spending time on a bunch of stuff that frankly just didn't really matter to the overall business.</p><p>It wasn't until we hired our VP Eng, Tido, that we finally started setting focused and audacious product goals. Just by verbalizing where we wanted to go and then grading our results, our velocity improved by an order of magnitude.</p><p>I don't care if you call them OKRs, sprints, or something else entirely. Just set a deadline when you want to have something done and a metric you want to move or some other concrete result.</p><p>When early stage founders do attempt to set goals, I often see them agonize over what specific goals to choose. In practice, a "pretty good goal" is way better than "no goals at all". Perfect is the enemy of good.</p><p>If you don't yet have product-market fit, your goal should probably be getting your first 3-5 customers using the product. If you've hit the level where you now have dozens of users, your goal should be growing by an order of magnitude. It's better to get in the habit of setting and driving towards goals rather than being too worried about their exact semantics. Worst case, you just pick a better goal later.</p><p>A great set of goals answers the question: <em><strong>"what would have to be true in order for us to feel good about our progress at the end of the month?"</strong></em><em> [2]</em></p><p>If each teammate can independently answer "what are our goals for the month?" in the same way, you'll know you've succeeded. If youâ€™re looking for prior art, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure What Matters</a>. </p><p>If you strictly focus on making things true by a certain date, you are bound to make at least some progress towards your end result. </p><p>At the end of the day, every billion-dollar startup is really just the sum of many small deltas.</p><p>Let's get one thing straight: your investors won't know everything. But investors won't know <em>anything</em> if you don't keep them updated on how things are going.</p><p>For the longest time, we were fearful of our Segment investors, to the point that we wouldn't bother sending them emails unless they asked about us. I can say now with confidence that this was 100% the wrong approach.</p><p>We worried that investors would think that we were screwing up (true) and failing (true as well!). And while that might be the case, a founder-friendly investor won't think that way. Investors, especially angels, invested because they believe in <em>you</em>. If I didn't think a team would go somewhere, I wouldn't put money in.</p><p>With each investor, <strong>include the goals you're working towards, as well as the asks for them</strong>. I think monthly is about the right cadence for this in the early days, moving to quarterly around Series A/B time when you start partnering more with a few board members.</p><p>Simply writing the updates should clarify your own thinking tremendously. If it takes you more than 1-2h to put together an update on the most important things happening at the company, it's probably a sign that you should be doing more thinking about the big picture.</p><p>When asking for help, the things that our investors have been able to help us with evolved quite a bit over time. But here's a good rule of thumb for what to ask for:</p><ul><li><p><u>Seed/Pre-seed</u>: user-testing, intros to beta users, hiring</p></li><li><p><u>Series A</u>: hiring, early customers, go-to-market</p></li><li><p><u>Series B/C+</u>: comparables at other companies, senior/exec hires, specific expertise around things like management, infrastructure, systems, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Not all investors will be able to help with everything. But at the very least, sending them information will help you be top of mind. I've lost track of how many times a moment of serendipity where I'm catching up with an old friend has led to a meaningful conversation for a company I've invested in.</p><p>As an extra bonus, the strongest startups send these updates to everyone on their team. It's amazing how much putting the goals in writing helps everyone stay on the same page about what's most important.</p><p>One other note here: take pictures. I now wish we had far more pictures of Segment at every stage of the company. They help turn investor updates into cherished memories.</p><p>Okay, this lesson is taken directly from the YC playbook. And YET, I see so many founders (including YC founders) fail to launch their product. </p><p>If no one notices your launch... just ignore it and then launch again. If you're doing things right, you'll never run out of stuff to launch! [3]</p><p>Why is launching so important? Let me share a personal story...</p><p>We spent about 1.5 years building different iterations of analytics tools. For every iteration, we had a waitlist that users could sign up to use. We personally reached out to the users who we thought were the best fits, and then tried to set up time to use the product. </p><p>The result? Nobody cared. We had no users. We never launched. </p><p>When we finally launched Segment in it's current incarnation, we threw out that approach entirely. We put up a self-service flow, and let anyone who wanted to sign up for it.</p><p>That's when something strange happened... we attracted an entirely new set of developers who just were crawling out of the woodwork and excited to use the new product we'd built. They were coming from companies far outside of SV that we'd never heard of.</p><p>It floored me.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned: the people you happen to be talking to now are probably not the people who have the biggest problem in your space. Do everything you can to reach the folks with the biggest problem, and then, reduce any barriers they might encounter.</strong></p><p>I expect a bunch of you reading this post to ignore this advice, just like we did in the early days. It takes a certain confidence to launch something you've built and put it out there for the world to see. Ultimately though, the rewards are worth it. You'll see users coming from communities you've never even heard of.</p><p>Let me tell you a tale of two startups.</p><p><strong>Startup A</strong> is constantly putting up interesting content on their blog. Their founders are sharing product launches, engineering posts, and creatively brainstorming about what it takes to solve problems in their market.</p><p><strong>Startup B</strong> is operating in stealth. You can't find much about them online, but one of the founders reached out with a nice personalized email mentioning their funding by a top-tier VC. </p><p>Suppose you're looking for a job... do you pick Startup A or Startup B? In my experience, A almost always wins. Momentum is a compounding force.</p><p><strong>Unless you are working in a space that heavily depends on IP, you should probably be publishing more content about what you are doing.</strong> This could be open source, it could be a weekly newsletter, it could be a changelog. [4]</p><p>Whatever it is, it's going to help you both hire <em>and</em> attract customers.

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Semantic scene understanding is crucial for robust and safe autonomous navigation, particularly so in off-road environments. Recent deep learning advances for 3D semantic segmentation rely heavily on large sets of training data; however, existing autonomy datasets represent urban environments or lack multimodal off-road data. We fill this gap with RELLIS-3D, a multimodal dataset collected in an off-road environment containing annotations for <strong>13,556 LiDAR scans</strong> and <strong>6,235 images</strong>. The data was collected on the Rellis Campus of Texas A\&amp;M University and presents challenges to existing algorithms related to class imbalance and environmental topography. Additionally, we evaluate the current state of the art deep learning semantic segmentation models on this dataset. Experimental results show that RELLIS-3D presents challenges for algorithms designed for segmentation in urban environments. Except for the annotated data, the dataset also provides full-stack sensor data in ROS bag format, including <strong>RGB camera images</strong>, <strong>LiDAR point clouds</strong>, <strong>a pair of stereo images</strong>, <strong>high-precision GPS measurement</strong>, and <strong>IMU data</strong>. This novel dataset provides the resources needed by researchers to develop more advanced algorithms and investigate new research directions to enhance autonomous navigation in off-road environments.</p>

<h3 id="ontology">Ontology:</h3>
<p>With the goal of providing multi-modal data to enhance autonomous off-road navigation, we defined an ontology of object and terrain classes, which largely derives from <a href="http://rugd.vision/">the RUGD dataset</a> but also includes unique terrain and object classes not present in RUGD. Specifically, sequences from this dataset includes classes such as mud, man-made barriers, and rubble piles. Additionally, this dataset provides a finer-grained class structure for water sources, i.e., puddle and deep water, as these two classes present different traversability scenarios for most robotic platforms. Overall, 20 classes (including void class) are present in the data.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Metaphors are everywhere;&nbsp;in literature, visual arts, poetry, and films. Language, in a way, itself&nbsp;is a metaphor. But try to make one on the fly, and you will find out it is not easy. Creating a metaphor requires ingenuity and care. A small mistake can make a metaphor clumsy. So how does one write a good metaphor?&nbsp;Let’s find out.</p><h2>Why Metaphors are Important</h2><p>Metaphors make us understand things better. When feelings are involved or when something happens which has no proper words in our vocabulary, we need something to communicate our experience. Metaphors come in handy in such situations. For example, author F. Scott Fitzgerald wanted to describe good writing. He could simply say that good writing was hard or good writing is very difficult. But he chose to say it like this:</p><p><em>All good writing is swimming underwater and holding your breath.</em></p><p>The metaphor&nbsp;“swimming underwater while holding breath” opens a door for us into the experience of Fitzgerald as a writer. That was a very difficult thing to convey in plain words. A whole paragraph might have not sufficed. But here a metaphor has conveyed the meaning completely in a single sentence. Metaphors help us convey meaning by using similarities in different objects and experiences. They relate things with one another and the result is a new understanding of a certain thing. All good poetry and literature do this to create new meanings. Another example is this beautiful metaphor by Shakespeare:</p><blockquote><p>All the world's a stage,<br>And all the men and women merely players;<br>They have their exits and their entrances;<br>And one man in his time plays many parts.</p><p><em>As You Like It</em>, William Shakespeare</p></blockquote><p>Metaphors help us use all of our senses in reading a sentence. They make the experience of language more immersive. Take this sentence as an example:</p><blockquote><p>Time has not stood still. It has washed over me, washed me away as if I'm nothing more than a woman of sand, left by a careless child too near the water.</p><p><em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>, Margaret Atwood</p></blockquote><p>The writer could simply have said that time has changed me. But the use of sand and water as metaphors has given the whole experience a life of its own. We can hear in our minds the sound of waves when reading the sentence. We can imagine a woman of sand. Therefore, metaphors give a deeper meaning to our words. They can convey meanings for which sometimes whole pages are necessary and sometimes even a book is not enough.</p><blockquote><p>I'm a little pencil in the hand of a writing God.</p><p>Mother Teresa</p></blockquote><p>In this small sentence, Mother Teresa has conveyed the whole of her faith. We can get a glimpse of her intimate relationship with God. We can sense her metaphysical experience. This was not possible without the use of a metaphor.</p><p>Along with that, plain words can be boring for our minds. Our minds hate repetitiveness and mundaneness and loves newness and ingenuity. Metaphors give us this freshness and livens ordinary language. Language becomes more interesting.</p><blockquote><p>She herself is a haunted house. She does not possess herself; her ancestors sometimes come and peer out of the windows of her eyes and that is very frightening.</p><p><em>The Bloody Chamber, </em>Angela Carter</p></blockquote><p>Simply saying that there is an eerie feeling attached to her the writer could have told us about the character but using a metaphor makes it more interesting and memorable. In addition to that, Metaphors add vagueness and abstractedness to our language. This gives readers free rein to make their own interpretations.</p><blockquote><p><em>There's a bluebird in my heart that<br></em><em>wants</em><em> to get out<br></em><em>but</em><em> I'm too tough for him,<br></em><em>I say, stay in there, I'm not going<br></em><em>to</em><em> let anybody see<br></em><em>you</em><em>.</em></p><p><em>Bluebird</em>, Charles Bukowski</p></blockquote><p>Nobody has a clear idea of what the bluebird is in this poem and so people make their interpretations. Metaphors give us the freedom to read works in the context of our own Worldview.</p><h2>How to Write Good Metaphors?</h2><p>First of all, start thinking about the thing or experience you want to express. Concentrate on the idea and think about it deeply. Understand it thoroughly. How do you feel about the whole idea?</p><p>For example, you want to describe the scene of someone waking up for the first time to the sound of the coming train. Lean into the experience of someone peacefully sleeping in a cozy room under blankets in a comfy bed. Now imagine a train passing over with an ear-shattering sound. What will the character feel like? Imagine it. Now can you compare it to something else that is similar in its sudden experience?</p><p>For me, the scene of a car suddenly breaking through the bedroom wall is similar so I would construct my metaphor around that imagery.</p><p><em>He woke up and thought a car had crashed in his bedroom. Everything was moving. His heart was pumping. "Oh! It's the train!" he let out a sigh and shook his head.</em></p><p>Secondly, try using original metaphors in your writing or ones that are rare. Commonly used metaphors are dead in a sense. Some dead metaphors are given here as an example:</p><ul><li>It's raining cats and dogs.</li><li>I'm visiting an old flame.</li><li>He's loose cannon.</li><li>She found herself behind the eight balls.</li><li>He drives me up a wall.</li><li>She saw the light at the end of the tunnel.</li><li>Ticking time bomb</li><li>Tip of the iceberg</li><li>Slippery slope</li><li>Going the extra mile</li><li>Early bird</li><li>Icy personality</li><li>Turning in one's grave</li><li>About to explode (from anger)</li></ul><p>Here are some more complex examples of metaphors. Read them carefully so you can get an idea of how a metaphor works.</p><p><em>1. Books are the mirrors of the soul.</em></p><p>Virginia Woolf describes here the connection between an author and his/her books. Books describe the inner thoughts of the author's mind. That is an experience similar to seeing one's soul. A mirror reflects everything that is in front of it. It does not lie. This small sentence combines these two concepts perfectly to convey a beautiful meaning.</p><p>2. <em>"</em><em>But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!"</em></p><p>Shakespeare is trying to describe the feeling of love that Romeo had for Juliet. The sun is a classic metaphor used in ancient literature to describe a lover.</p><p>3. <em>The parents looked upon Matilda in particular as nothing more than a scab. A scab is </em><em>something you have to put up with until the time comes when you can pick it off and flick </em><em>it away.</em></p><p>The author here depicts the anger Matilda's parents felt for their child using “a scab on skin”. A person puts up with it because it's painful and messy to remove it before time.</p><p>4. <em>"O Lord, You are our Father, We are the clay, and You, our potter; And all of us are the work of Your hand."</em></p><p>In this verse of the Bible, the feeling of helplessness and the might of the All-Mighty God is described. Helplessness is compared with the inertness of the clay. And the potter's hands are the workings of God.</p><p>5. <em>Alas,</em><em> and yet what are you, my written and painted thoughts! It is not long ago that you were still so many-</em><em>coloured</em><em>, young, and malicious, so full of thorns and hidden spices you made me sneeze and laugh and now? You </em><em>have already taken off your novelty and some of you, I fear, are on the point of becoming truths: they already look so immortal, so pathetically righteous, so boring! And has it ever been otherwise? For what things do we write and paint, we mandarins with </em><em>Chinese brushes, we immortalizers of things which let themselves </em><em>be</em><em> written, what alone are we capable of painting? Alas, only that which is about to wither and is beginning to lose its fragrance! Alas, only storms departing exhausted and feelings grown old and yellow! Alas, only birds strayed and grown weary in flight </em><em>who</em><em> now let themselves be caught in the hand in our hand! We immortalize that which cannot live and fly much longer, weary and mellow things alone! And it is only your afternoon, my written and painted thoughts, for which alone I have the </em><em>colours</em><em>, many </em><em>colours</em><em> perhaps, many many-</em><em>coloured</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>tendernesses</em><em> and fifty yellows and browns and greens and reds: but no one will divine from these how you looked in your morning, you sudden sparks and wonders of my solitude, you my old beloved wicked thoughts!</em></p><p>Here Nietzsche is describing the thoughts in the human mind which are immortal, ever-changing with infinite possibilities, and how impossible it is to define them truly words.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Good metaphors spice up any piece of art, be it a painting or a poem or a novel. Some writers use whole characters as forms of metaphors, others use symbolism. Learning to write a good metaphor can be a difference between a good piece and a great piece.

<p>This question often pops up, when you need a random direction vector to place things in 3D or you want to do a particle simulation.</p>



<p>We recall that a 3D unit-sphere (and hence a direction) is parametrized only by two variables; elevation <span data-display="false">\theta \in [0; \pi]</span> and azimuth <span data-display="false">\varphi \in [0; 2\,\pi]</span> which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system#Coordinate_system_conversions">can be converted to Cartesian coordinates as</a></p>



<p><span data-display="false">\begin{aligned}  x &amp;= \sin\theta \, \cos\varphi \\  y &amp;= \sin\theta \, \sin\varphi \\  z &amp;= \cos\theta \end{aligned} </span></p><p>If one takes the easy way and uniformly samples this parametrization in numpy like</p>



<pre><code>phi = np.random.rand() * 2 * np.pi
theta = np.random.rand() * np.pi</code></pre>



<p>One (i.e. you as you are reading this) ends with something like this:</p>

<p>While the 2D surface of polar coordinates uniformly sampled (left), we observe a bias of sampling density towards the poles when projecting to the Cartesian coordinates (right).<br>The issue is that the cos mapping of the elevation has an uneven step size in <em>Cartesian</em> space, as you can easily verify: <span data-display="false">cos^{'}(x) = sin(x)</span>.</p>



<p>The solution is to simply sample the elevation in the Cartesian space instead of the spherical space – i.e. sampling <span data-display="false">z \in [-1; 1]</span>. From that we can get back to our elevation as <span data-display="false">\theta = \arccos z</span>:</p>



<pre id="block-6ecb681a-6f13-49b9-8783-cebd81f25d08"><code>z = 1 - np.random.rand() * 2 # convert rand() range 0..1 to -1..1
theta = np.arccos(z)</code></pre>



<p>As desired, this compensates the spherical coordinates such that we end up with uniform sampling in the Cartesian space:</p>

<h2>Custom opening angle</h2>



<p>If you want to further restrict the opening angle instead of sampling the full sphere you can also easily extend the above. Here, you must re-map the cos values from <span data-display="false">[1; -1]</span> to <span data-display="false">[0; 2]</span> as</p>



<pre id="block-f289f7b0-bd4e-4ad9-9ebc-38537536d919"><code>cart_range = -np.cos(angle) + 1 # maximal range in cartesian coords
z = 1 - np.random.rand() * cart_range
theta = np.arccos(z)</code></pre>

		<li>excerpt from page-13 of the book <strong>OpenVMS with Apache, OSU, and WASD</strong>
		<p>
				The idea with WASD was to be a really good VMS-only server: Mark Daniel says, "I 
suffered a bit of a VMS cringe when amongst my UNIX colleagues (VMS was perceived 
to be a bit slow and cumbersome), so I have also endeavored to make WASD as fast 
and efficient as I could, avoiding C run-time library and even RMS code layers 
where it was feasible and worth it. I also wanted a similarly tight scripting 
environment and have spent a lot of time honing this aspect"</p>
		</li>
		<li><span>Trivia:</span> <strong>WASD</strong> = "Wide Area 
		Surveillance Division". WASD was previously known as <strong>HFRD</strong> 
		(High Frequency Radar Division) of Australia's Defense, Science and 
		Technology Organization</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

		have worked on to date.<br>I am currently supporting web servers on these

	https://wasd.vsm.com.au/wasd/</a> (or the various mirror sites)<ul>
		<li><span>caveat:</span> do not skip any CUP (cumulative

		I was doing something wrong). I was only successful after I noticed, 
		then installed, the CUP file (probably need new 
		eyeglasses) </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>none of these files offer executables so you will need to download a 
	vanilla package (necessary to "compile-link" or just "link") as well as the 
	architecture-specific files</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody">  <p>For several reasons, emulation has always fascinated me. A program that executes other programs sounds like such a cool concept. It really feels like you’re getting your money’s worth out of writing it! Beyond that, it definitely feels like you’re <em>building</em> a computer within software. I really enjoyed learning about computer architecture and writing some basic HDL code, but emulation is a much more straightforward way of achieving a similar feeling of generating a machine. I’ve also always had this goal of knowing exactly how <em>Super Mario World</em> worked, ever since I first saw it as a kid. Because of this, writing a SNES/SFC emulator has been on my mind for a while. I decided recently that it was time to take a <a href="https://github.com/rivergillis/chip-8">step forward</a> towards making this happen.</p> <p>So let’s take a look at writing an emulator. A simple, but complete example would involve CHIP-8.</p> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8">CHIP-8</a> is actually a programming language. It’s really simple too, there’s only <a href="http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#3.0">35 opcodes</a>. To write an interpreter for it, we pretty much just need to write a program that can execute all 35 different instructions. The <em>emulation</em> aspect of this comes from the bits you wouldn’t normally find in a programming language interpreter. We need a way to display graphics, process user input, play audio, and we need to simulate the hardware mechanisms of a CHIP-8 machine. Things like registers and memory need to be taken into account during execution, and we also need to be careful about timing.</p> <p>Let’s start! For this project, we’ll be using C++. This should be fairly trivial to translate into other languages. If you want to take a look at the complete source, see the <a href="https://github.com/rivergillis/chip-8">project repository</a>.</p> <p>First, a basic main loop. We’ll ignore emulating timing for now.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// main.cpp</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Our <code>CpuChip8</code> class will encapsulate the state of our virtual machine and interpreter. Now if we implement <code>RunCycle</code> and <code>Initialize</code> we’ll have ourselves a basic emulator skeleton. We now need to discuss the phsyical system we’re emulating.</p> <p>Our CHIP-8 system will be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telmac_1800">Telmac 1800</a>. We’ve got ourselves a pool of 4K of memory, a 64x32 1-bit display, and the ability to beep. <em>Nice</em>. The CHIP-8 interpreter itself is implemented via a virtual machine. We need to keep track of a stack, sixteen 8-bit registers (named V0 through VF), a 12-bit index register (named I), a program counter, two 8-bit timers, and a 16-frame stack.</p> <p>The canonical memory map looks like this:</p> <div><div><pre><code>0x000 |--------------------|
      | Interpreter memory |
      |                    |
0x050 | Built-in fontset   |
0x200 |--------------------|
      |                    |
      |                    |
      | Program memory     |
      | and dynamic allocs |
      |                    |
      |                    |
0xFFF |--------------------|
</code></pre></div></div> <p>You’ll notice there’s no explicit stack here. The program actually doesn’t have a stack to address, that’s only used by the interpreter to implement jumping to functions and back. With this in mind we can draw up a header.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// cpu_chip8.h</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>We use excplicit integer types to ensure values are over/underflowed correctly. We need to use 16-bit types for 12-bit values. We also have 16 digital input keys, which we store as either on or off within this class. When we hook up input, we’ll find a way to feed that into the class between cycles. The opcode is made easy by the fact that all CHIP-8 instructions are 2 bytes long.</p> <p>So that gives us 0xFFFF=64k possible instructions (though many are unused). We can actually store every possible instruction in a map so that when we fetch an opcode we are able to immediately execute it by calling the associated <code>Instruction</code> in <code>instructions_</code>. Since we don’t bind much data to the functions, which should be able to fit the entire instruction map in cache!</p> <p>Our <code>Initialize</code> function is where to set up the memory map described above:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// cpu_chip8.cpp</span>

The gist of it here is that we set everything to 0 and load things into memory that need to be loaded. The fontset here is a series of 16 built-in sprites that programs can reference as they want. We’ll go over how that memory forms sprites later on when we worry about graphics. Our goal is that once <code>Initialize</code> complete we’re set up to execute a user program.</p> <p>Let’s build out a basic <code>RunCycle</code> so that we have a better idea of out to write <code>BuildInstructionSet</code>. If you remember any basic computer architecture, a cycle has a few phases. First you fetch the instruction, then you decode it, then you execute it.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// cpu_chip8.cpp</span>

This requires more work in the initial set-up, but means we completely remove the instruction-decode phase on <code>RunCycle</code>.</p> <p>Let’s dig into the meat of the interpreter, <code>BuildInstructionSet</code>. I wont list the implementations for every function here, but you can find that in the <a href="https://github.com/rivergillis/chip-8">repository for this project</a>.

<p>It’s the year 2020 and we have the immense benefit of thousands of years of history, literature, and technological progress at our fingertips.</p>

<p>Why does this matter? Because with time comes context. Consideration and reconsideration. Deconstruction and reconstruction. Adaptation, further research, new findings, and new examination. Impact. Consequences. Lessons.</p>

<p>Anything old comes with context. Context is gold. Old is gold.</p>

<p>Context helps us evaluate things thoughtfully. It helps us debate things on their merits. In this way we can become better people—and a better people.</p>

<p>Without time, we lose context. Tweets received within seconds have virtually zero context. So what happens? Things are evaluated carelessly because there is no context for thoughtfulness. People attack each other because they don’t have any merits to debate. We become worse people—and a worse people.</p>

<p>Focusing on the immediate tip of the timeline of history—to this extreme—is nonsensical. <em>Now</em> is the least-understood moment in history. If we’re looking to become more informed, is <em>now</em> really the moment we should be examining to the degree we do?</p>

<p><em>Now</em> is a tornado of conjecture with little underlying value and much potential harm: hysteria.</p>

<p>I contend that there is more value in understanding the past in order to understand the present. As an experiment, I’m launching <a href="https://hystoria.100millionbooks.org/" target="_blank">Hystoria</a>, a reddit-like website for rediscovering ideas from the past.</p>

<p>I’ll be posting book snippets and other interesting tidbits I find on it as I work on 100 Million Books, and I hope you do too. You can upvote posts and comment on posts, and the best posts will float to the top.</p>

<p>So what’s different about Hystoria?</p>

<p><strong>Only items produced 5 years ago (or more) will be allowed on the site.</strong></p>

<p>Anything else will be removed. My hope is that this medium will harness the competitive, gamified dynamic of social media to resurface the best ideas of the past. Let’s see if that pans out. I’ll also be pointing people to Hystoria for all new book snippet suggestions.</p>

<p>The site is built with a free and open-source tool called <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy" target="_blank">Lemmy</a>, and I host the website myself—there’s no “big tech” involvement here. Moderation policies and terms of use will be determined if and when needed. Visit the site with an ad blocker and you’ll notice there are no ads or tracking on it either.</p>

<p>There’s another upside of this site: as you can see by the posting history of this blog, I don’t post very often. It’s been years since I last posted at all, in spite of collecting a lot of stuff worth sharing in the mean time. My excuse is that I have many things to post, and creating blog posts worth reading for each item I find would be a unreasonably onerous commitment. Posting on social media like Twitter or Facebook would be more practical but I don’t like the idea of building a following on those sites for their own sakes. I would much rather use them as conduits for sites I actually own. Hystoria enables that.</p>

<p>So I’ll post more on social sites now too. Follow on <a href="https://twitter.com/100millionbooks" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://facebook.com/l00millionbooks" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/l00millionbooks" target="_blank">Telegram</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Doppler effect has been widely used in radar to measure the relative velocity between source and the target. The radar and lidar that use Doppler effect to measure relative velocities are called Doppler radar. Many autonomous or semi-autonomous machines, such as air-plane, autonomous vehicle, are often equipped with Doppler radar.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the physics and mathematics of Doppler effect for Doppler radar.</p>

<h3 id="ordinary-radar">Ordinary Radar</h3>

<p>In the ordinary radar configurations, the transmitter of the radar sends out a wave, the wave hits a target object and gets reflected, a small portion of the reflected wave will be received by the receiver of the radar. By measuring the time gap between signal transmission and receipt $\Delta t$, we could determine the distance between the radar and the target object $r$ easily.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
r &amp;= \frac{c \Delta t}{2} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $c$ is the wave velocity. Both radar and the target object could be moving. But as long as the wave velocity $c$ is much greater than the relative velocity between the radar and the target object $\Delta v$, the above equation holds.</p>



<p>The ordinary radar is also called time-of-flight radar.</p>

<h3 id="doppler-radar">Doppler Radar</h3>

<p>Different from ordinary radar, Doppler radar could also be used for measuring the the relative velocity between the radar and the target object $\Delta v$.</p>

<h4 id="doppler-effect">Doppler Effect</h4>

<p>Letâ€™s consider the Doppler effect in the simplest 1D scenario. The wave frequency that the receiver measured $f^{\prime}$ is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\lambda^{\prime} &amp;= \lambda - \frac{\Delta v}{f}  \\
&amp;= \frac{c}{f} - \frac{\Delta v}{f} \\
&amp;= \frac{c - \Delta v}{f} \\
&amp;= \frac{c}{f^{\prime}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $c$ is the wave velocity, $f$ is the source wave frequency, $\Delta v$ is the relative velocity between the source and the target, $\Delta v &gt; 0$ when the source and the target are moving closer, $\Delta v &lt; 0$ when the source and the target are moving farther. Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
f^{\prime} &amp;= \frac{c}{c - \Delta v} f \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Apparently, when the source and target are moving closer, i.e., $\Delta v &gt; 0$, $f^{\prime} &gt; f$; when the source and target are moving farther, i.e., $\Delta v &lt; 0$, $f^{\prime} &lt; f$.</p>



<p>The Doppler frequency $\Delta f$, which is the difference between the receiver frequency and the transmitter frequency is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\Delta f &amp;= f^{\prime} - f \\ 
&amp;= \frac{c}{c - \Delta v} f -f \\
&amp;= \frac{f \Delta v}{c - \Delta v} \\
\end{align}\]

</p>

<p>Assuming $c \gg \Delta v$, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\Delta f &amp;= \frac{f \Delta v}{c} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The Doppler effect will also happen to a Doppler radar when the radar and the object are relatively moving. Letâ€™s still consider the simplest 1D scenario. The target object will reflect the wave transmitted from the source. In this case, the target object becomes the source of wave, and the radar becomes the target object since the radar has a receiver. The frequency of reflected wave will be the same as the frequency of the wave the target objects receives, which is $f^{\prime}$. Then the frequency of the wave measured from the receiver on the radar $f^{\prime\prime}$ will be</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
f^{\prime\prime} &amp;= \frac{c}{c - \Delta v} f^{\prime} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Assuming $c \gg \Delta v$, the Doppler frequency $\Delta f$, which is the difference between the receiver frequency and the transmitter frequency is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\Delta f &amp;= f^{\prime\prime} - f \\ 
&amp;= (f^{\prime\prime} - f^{\prime}) - (f^{\prime} - f) \\
&amp;= \frac{f \Delta v}{c} + \frac{f \Delta v}{c} \\
&amp;= \frac{2 f \Delta v}{c} 
\end{align}\]

</p><p>With this mathematical relationship, by measuring the the Doppler frequency $\Delta f$ on the radar, we could determine the relative velocity between the radar and the target object easily.</p>

<h4 id="phase-shift">Phase Shift</h4>

<p>In practice, instead of measuring the Doppler frequency $\Delta f$, many Doppler radar measure phase shift $\Delta \varphi$.</p>



<p>Assuming $c \gg \Delta v$, the phase difference between the transmitted signal and the received signal, i.e., phase shift $\Delta \varphi$, is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\Delta \varphi &amp;= \frac{2r}{\lambda} 2\pi \\
&amp;= \frac{4 \pi r}{\lambda} \\
&amp;= \frac{4 \pi r f}{c} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $r$ is the distance between the radar and the target object, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{d \Delta \varphi}{dt} &amp;= \frac{4 \pi f}{c} \frac{d r}{dt} \\
&amp;= \frac{4 \pi f}{c} \Delta v \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Note that $\Delta v = \frac{d r}{dt}$.</p>



<p>This means that if we could measure $\frac{d \Delta \varphi}{dt}$, we could calculate the relative velocity between the radar and the target object. In practice, $\frac{d \Delta \varphi}{dt}$ could be measured easily by transmitting lots of signals in unit time, and measuring the $\frac{\Delta \Delta \varphi}{\Delta t}$.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>Doppler radar is not that sophisticated to understand. We determine the relative velocity by measuring the change rate of Doppler effect phase shift.</p>

		<p><em>This is a guest post from Cierra Nease. Enjoy.</em></p>
<p>Dear new developer,</p>
<p>“Failures” as a new developer are plenty — but you might be asking, why is “failures” in quotes? To fail something is dependent upon one’s perspective. The only true failure is to quit working towards success. Every failure brings a small success in that you learn what the right answer is not. How can you problem solve without a way of marking off solutions that do not work? A failure is simply a solution that didn’t work at that specific time.</p>
<p>We can all talk about how learning and growth come from having failures, but it’s hard to remember that when you feel like you are a failure. Failures do not inherently make the person a failure, and it can be hard to make that distinction in the moment. Sometimes we need someone else to remind us of this.</p>
<p>I’ve had a lot of people in life reiterate this concept to me. The most recent person was a fellow developer named Mike on the Denver light rail. It’s funny what will happen when people participate in communicating and interacting with each other, but that is for another blog post entirely. For now, let’s go back to Mike. Mike overheard me talking to another passenger about being in a bootcamp. When I finished my conversation, he handed me a card and said he’d love to answer any questions I have about becoming a developer. I elaborated on some of my bootcamp experience, which happens to be full of failures.</p>
<p>Mike expressed his number one piece of advice for any developer, telling me: “whatever you do, don’t be afraid to fail.” We started talking about this in depth, and it really resonated with me for the rest of the evening. As a new developer, you really only see senior developers’ successes. Each developer goes through their own learning process which does include failures.</p>
<p>The failures that lead to success don’t stop when you become a “better” developer. If you are looking for a point when you quit failing as a developer, then you are looking for the wrong thing. The more you fail, the more you learn. The more you learn, the more you grow. The more you grow, the better the developer you become.</p>
<p>As a newer developer, I look forward to all of the opportunities to learn, grow, and accept my failures as the wrong solution instead of accepting them as a personal characteristic.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Cierra</p>

                <h3 id="who-makes-up-the-fi-re-movement">Who makes up the FI/RE Movement?</h3><p>Despite its relatively recent popularity, the FI/RE movement is still in many ways ambiguous. Who are these millionaires next door and what common traits are shared among them? Fortunately based off of data obtained from a survey conducted of nearly 1,400 individuals in the r/financialindependence subreddit, we can get a bit more insight into not only those who are pursuing FI/RE, but also those who have already achieved it. Special thanks to u/melonbalon for conducting the survey in the first place!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure><img src="https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png 600w, https://www.thriftythoughts.io/content/images/2020/12/UNCLAIMED-PROPERTY--7-.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="insights-obtained">Insights Obtained</h3><p>So much data was obtained as part of this survey and the figures reported in the above visual only scratch the surface of valuable insights that could be drawn. Of note however are a couple items:</p><ol><li><strong>Commute times are very low.</strong> Over 20% of respondents noted that it takes last than 10 minutes to get to work. Additionally, nearly 70% had a commute of less than 30 minutes. It's likely that these smaller commute times result in less transportation costs which could be a motivating factor.</li><li><strong>Individuals who have already FI/RE'd are highly educated.</strong> Not only did nearly 85% of respondents have a college degree, but an additional 7% had multiple graduate degrees. Perhaps these individuals have more time for additional schooling post-retirement. It also could be the case that this additional education helped them FI/RE in the first place. Regardless, more schooling was expected in comparison to the respondent group that had not yet FI/RE'd simply given the older average age. </li><li><strong>Respondents favored urban and suburban environments equally. </strong>Additionally this ratio remained constant in both the pursuing FI/RE and FI/RE'd populations. I would have expected far more suburban living, but perhaps the increased cost of living in an urban environment is offset enough by the reduced transportation costs to be appealing.</li></ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><hr><p><strong>Aavegotchi</strong> is a DeFi-enabled crypto collectibles game developed by Singapore-based Pixelcraft Studios that allows players to stake NFT avatars with interest-generating <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/atokens">aTokens</a> and interact with the Aavegotchi <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/metaverse">metaverse</a>. It is a unique combination of DeFi and NFTs.</p><p>Aavegotchis are pixelated ghosts living on the Ethereum blockchain, backed by the <strong>ERC-721</strong> standard.

Aavegotchis possess three attributes that determine their overall value and rarity within the Aavegotchi universe: <strong>collateral stake, traits, and wearables.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Collateral stake:</strong>
Each Aavegotchi ERC721 NFT manages an escrow contract address that holds
an Aave-backed ERC20 collateral, or “aToken”. <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/atokens">aTokens</a> generate yield via
Aave’s LendingPool, which increases the quantity of aTokens held in the
wallet. Thus, the amount of aTokens held in the Aavegotchi’s escrow address grows over time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Traits:</strong>
Aavegotchis possess multiple traits that influence their rarity, their performance in mini-games, and the wearables they can equip. Some are generated randomly upon birth, and others depend on user interactions with the Aavegotchi. <strong>See <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/traits">Traits</a>.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Random Traits</strong>: Upon birth, every Aavegotchi is assigned several random trait values using the ChainLink VRF random number generator. Trait values are distributed on a bell-curve, and each trait is assigned a value of Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, or Mythical, depending on its rarity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kinship</strong>: “Kinship” is not randomly assigned, but rather starts at a fixed value upon birth and increases or decreases based on various factors, such as how long the Aavegotchi has been with the same owner, and how often the owner interacts with it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Experience:</strong> Aavegotchis level up as they gain more experience by voting in AavegotchiDAO and participating in mini-games. Every few levels, Aavegotchis receive one Spirit Point that can be allocated towards increasing or decreasing a certain trait.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Wearables</strong>
In addition to managing the aToken escrow, Aavegotchis also extend the ERC998 Composables standard, which allows them to manage child NFTs, known as wearables in the Aavegotchi ecosystem.
Not every wearable can be equipped by every Aavegotchi. Some wearables may be exclusively equipped by Aavegotchis staked with certain collaterals, those of a certain level, and those with certain traits.
Some wearables can increase or decrease certain traits of an Aavegotchi. For example, equipping a sword may slightly boost an Aavegotchi’s aggressiveness, whereas equipping a Bob Marley shirt may decrease its energy level.</p></li></ul><h2 id="aavegotchi-value">Aavegotchi Value</h2><p>The valuation of an Aavegotchi comes from both from its intrinsic value and from its rarity value.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Intrinsic value</strong>
Intrinsic value is the denominated value of the Aavegotchi’s staked collateral. If the Aavegotchi is staked with 10 aDAI, then the intrinsic value would be 10 aDAI, plus whatever extra aDAI has accrued from the Lending Pool. Initially, only ERC20 tokens listed on the Aave platform (aTokens) will be available as collaterals. However, once AavegotchiDAO launches, the community will be able to vote on which new collaterals to allow.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rarity value</strong>
Rarity value is determined by calculating the rareness of each Aavegotchi’s traits and equipped wearables within the Aavegotchi universe. Unlike other NFT games, rarity is not a fixed value in Aavegotchi. It can change over time as Aavegotchis level up and equip different wearables. Thus, a rare Aavegotchi one week could become common, and vice versa, depending on the overall distribution of traits and wearables within the Aavegotchi universe. This enables a novel concept known as “rarity farming”, which is explained in more detail in the Aavegotchi official whitepaper to be released soon.</p></li></ul><h2 id="the-aavegotchi-universe">The Aavegotchi Universe</h2><p>The Aavegotchi Universe encompasses all the elements that allow Aavegotchis to operate, including Portals, the $GHST Utility Token, AavegotchiDAO, and the Aavegotchi Realm.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>UPDATE: While these are valid reasons, <a href="https://www.arencambre.com/iphones-are-inferior-to-android-phones-the-value/">scoring them suggests I should still switch to the iPhone</a>.</strong></p>



<p>I am on day 10 of using an iPhone. I came from the Android world.</p>



<p>The iPhone is deficient. I am leaning towards returning it.</p>




<h2><span id="Context"></span>Context<span></span></h2>



<p>Ten days ago, I switched from a Pixel 4 XL to the iPhone 12 Pro Max. I went with this iPhone model because it’s similarly sized to the Pixel 4 XL, plus I value photography.</p>



<h3><span id="Why_I_switched"></span>Why I switched<span></span></h3>



<p>I made the switch due to intellectual curiosity, to overcome limitations of the Pixel 4 XL, and to get on board with the rest of my family.</p>



<p>I am questioning this decision. While the iPhone helps me escape two Pixel 4 XL limitations, iOS’s regressions from Android feel like a heavy burden.</p>



<p>I am inside Apple’s return window, so I can return the iPhone for a full refund. It is tempting.</p>



<h3><span id="Android_only_has_two_worthwhile_brands"></span>Android only has two worthwhile brands<span></span></h3>



<p>My analysis relies heavily on my experience with the Pixel 4 XL. Much of what I say about Android applies to to top-tier Android manufacturers. Among the requirements of top-tier manufacturers is they deliver highly vanilla Android. This includes <a href="https://store.google.com/us/magazine/compare_pixel">Pixel </a>(Google’s in-house brand), <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/">OnePlus</a>, and more.</p>



<p><strong>Samsung is not a top-tier phone manufacturer.</strong> Its hardware is decent, but it has bad software. Samsung replaces Android’s best features with <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00078945/">poor, fussy substitutes</a>. It also adds annoying, pointless bloat. In other words, just to differentiate its brand, it <em>devalues its brand </em>by trashing up its core software.</p>



<p>The Bixby assistant is the best example of Samsung’s stupidity. It’s awful. Samsung killing Bixby might signal that it’s ready to take Android seriously. Until then, Samsung is simply not a top-tier manufacturer.</p>



<p>The Samsung example is important because Apple is the same: <strong>great hardware, bad software</strong>.</p>



<h2><span id="A_note_about_definitions"></span>A note about definitions<span></span></h2>



<p>The article’s language is sometimes imprecise. Truly, if you’re comparing Android to something in the Apple ecosystem, it would be iOS. But that is not how people talk about their phones, so I am using loose terminology in places.</p>



<p>If you’re a True Nerd™ and find my word use upsetting, just associate my word with its parent ecosystem.</p>



<p>This is how several terms are correctly used:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Word category</strong></td><td><strong>Android phone ecosystem</strong></td><td><strong>Apple phone ecosystem</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Operating system</td><td>Android</td><td>iOS</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturers</td><td>Google, OnePlus, and more</td><td>Apple</td></tr><tr><td>Phone brand</td><td>Pixel (Google), OnePlus, and more</td><td>iPhone</td></tr><tr><td>Phone model (current generation)</td><td>For Pixel: Pixel 4A, Pixel 4A 5G, Pixel 5. For OnePlus: OnePlus 8T, OnePlus 8 Pro, OnePlus 8, OnePlus 7T. There are more current model from other manufacturers.</td><td>iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPhone SE, and more</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Also, some Android features I enjoy are Pixel-specific. While Google freely distributes Android to other manufactures, it reserves some newer features for its own Pixel phones. Sometimes I may mistakenly generalize a Pixel-specific feature as an Android feature. Since Pixel-specific features often eventually end up on other phones, associating Pixel with Android is probably correct in the long run.</p>



<h2><span id="Where_Android_is_better"></span>Where Android is better<span></span></h2>



<p>Android is well thought out. It has a great UX. I really miss its great design.</p>



<h3><span id="Call_screening_Android_wins"></span>Call screening: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Android’s <a href="https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/9118387?hl=en">built-in call screener</a> is excellent. It blocks calls it is confident are garbage. If the caller is in a gray area, it will ask the caller first to state the reason for calling, then show that to me on the screen where I can accept the call. And even if does nothing to the call, I can still use a <strong>Screen Call </strong>button to kick the call to a digital assistant, where the caller is invited to state the reason for the call.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2019/11/call_screen_assistant.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Example call-screen opportunity. (This image shamelessly <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/automatic-call-screen-google-pixel-phones/">stolen</a> from XDA Developers.)</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This may be mostly a Pixel feature right now. Google plans to <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/09/08/google-phone-will-soon-be-downloadable-from-play-store-verified-calls-feature-rolling-out/">extend</a> this to more Android brands. Because Samsung uses its own, poor quality dialer, it’s unclear how Samsung will get this feature.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Apple only has a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099">crude tool</a>: block callers not in your contacts. You can’t report calls or texts as spam.</p>



<p>If you want to be more selective than Apple’s crude tool, and instead block specific spammers, you must add the spammers to your contacts. That’s dumb; it just clutters your contacts!</p>



<p>You can also subscribe to a third party service. That’s grating, because the phone should manage that itself, given that this is a years-old problem.</p>



<h3><span id="Browser_ad_blocking_Android_wins"></span>Browser ad blocking: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>On Android, browser ad-blocking is easy: Switch to the free <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Mozilla Firefox browser</a>. Inside Firefox, add the free <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock Origin extension</a>. Then set Firefox as your default browser for happy browsing. Simple! (Android’s Chrome browser does not support extensions.)</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Install the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adguard-adblock-privacy/id1047223162">AdGuard app</a>, jump through several fussy hoops in the <strong>Settings </strong>console’s <strong>Safari </strong>area, and get nagged about going to paid AdGuard. </p>



<p>Maybe I am fussing too much. The hassle is a one-time step, and AdGuard seems to work decently.</p>



<p>Part of the point of ad-blocking is to make YouTube worthwhile. That leads to my next point…</p>



<h3><span id="YouTube_ad_blocking_Android_wins"></span>YouTube ad blocking: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>To block YouTube’s ads on Android, just view all YouTube content in Firefox with the uBlock Origin extension. Easy!</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> While Safari + AdGuard = ads blocked on YouTube, it’s still a major regression from Android:</p>



<ul><li>Video quality <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/aom6ge/why_does_youtube_only_go_up_to_720p_on_mobile/">maxes out at 720p</a>.</li><li>Every YouTube video in Safari starts as low quality (360p). To change it, on <em>every video you watch</em>, you must wade through the settings menu, and it has to be done before you switch to full screen, because of the next bullet’s deficiency.</li><li>When you’re viewing a video in a browser and switch to full screen, Apple cancels the website’s native video player and forces you to use iOS’s default, bad, native video player. Want to double-tap and skip 10 seconds? Want to access the site’s in-video settings? Want any feature not supported by iOS’s dumbed down video control? Forget it! iOS nukes it in full-screen mode.</li></ul>



<p>Firefox Focus is not a solution. It doesn’t fix iOS’s deficiencies.</p>



<h3><span id="Universal_back_button_Android_wins"></span>Universal back button: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>For at least a decade, Android has had a back button at the bottom of all windows. This means the valuable concept of “take me back” is baked into the Android paradigm. Need to return where you were, in <em>any</em> app? Just tap the back button, on bottom left of the screen. Or use the back gesture (next section).</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> The back button is a mess.</p>



<p>In Safari, it’s on bottom left.</p>



<p>In most other apps, top left.</p>



<p>To get to the prior app that sent you to the current app, find a tiny button between the app’s top-left back button and the clock. And good luck on that; too much of the time, iOS lists a wrong or irrelevant prior app, especially if you got to your current app from a system notification.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="449" src="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x449.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x449.png 1024w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-300x132.png 300w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-768x337.png 768w, https://www.arencambre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image.png 1225w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Even though the mini back button says otherwise, I was not sent to GroupMe by NPR One! I was sent there by a notification I tapped while NPR One was active.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even worse, because the non-Safari back buttons are on the opposite end of the phone from where you hold it, you’re less precise with finger positioning. Therefore, when you intend to use a “back” feature, you’ll instead make the phone think you’re trying to pull down the notification area.</p>



<h3><span id="Gestures_Android_wins"></span>Gestures: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>Building on its native strengths, Android’s <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6073614?hl=en">gestures</a> are excellent. They edge out iOS with the back gesture, which I use a lot. No matter what app you’re in, swipe in from the phone’s right to go back. Simple!</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Without a “back” gesture, you’re stuck fumbling with iOS’s haphazard back buttons.</p>



<h3><span id="Exiting_apps_Android_wins"></span>Exiting apps: Android wins<span></span></h3>



<p>In Android, you can exit apps with the back gesture or swiping up from the bottom. The back gesture is superior, because it can’t be confused with other gestures.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> Your only choice is the swipe-up gesture, which sometimes conflicts with normal swipes one does in apps.</p>



<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>I don’t literally mean app-exiting in the computer-science sense. I mean more in a common-parlance sense: you’re out of the app and back to the home screen, or in another app that may have called the current app. One an app is no longer visible, and running in the background, Android and iOS both do fine managing it.</p>

<p>The Pixel has a great feature: even when you’re not using the phone, it shows the current time on the screen, along with some other useful information. This takes minimal power: thanks to the OLED screen, the main power use is when it lights up the specific pixels that show the time.</p>

<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> While the iPhone also has an OLED screen, Apple has no similar feature. You have to tap the phone to see the time, which lights up the whole screen.</p>

<p>Android’s UX language is simply clean. It’s intuitive, simple, and it just works.</p>



<p><strong>Why iPhone sucks:</strong> iOS’s UX feels like a cartoon spoof of a phone OS. Naturally garish colors, toddler-like corner-rounding, goofy font sizes, etc. It’s like iOS’s design semantics were intended to tussle with our innate senses. Barf!</p>

<p>All newly installed Android apps go into the app drawer. This is an alphabetized list of apps, accessed by swiping up from a home screen (when you’re not inside an app).</p>

<p>If you are looking for a simple, cheap data pipeline to pull small amounts of data from a stable API and store it in a cloud storage, then <code>serverless functions</code> are a good choice. This post aims to answer questions like the ones shown below</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My company does not have the budget to purchase a tool like <code>fivetran</code>, What should I use to pull data from an API ?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do I really need an orchestration tool like Airflow for one simple data pull from an API ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the post we cover what a <code>serverless</code> function can and cannot do, what its pros and cons are and walk through a simple API data pull project.</p>

<p>Chances are that you have heard of the term <code>serverless</code>. The term <code>serverless</code> may be misleading. In fact, there is a server on which your code will be running. <code>Serverless</code> refers to the fact that you do not have to manage any servers, but just the code. We will use <code>AWS Lambda</code> for this simple project. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/?c=ser&amp;sec=srv"><code>AWS Lambda</code></a> can be used to run a function without having to provision and maintain a server.</p>
<p>You write a function and deploy it to AWS Lambda. There you can set the function to run based on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/understanding-the-different-ways-to-invoke-lambda-functions/">external triggers</a>. The lambda function will execute the logic and end. Note that you will have a limited time (current max execution time for lambda code execution is 15min) for your code logic to complete. There is also a limit on the memory size(current max is at 3.008GB). In this post we will</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the lambda function.</li>
<li>Download data from a dummy API to local file system.</li>
<li>Copy the downloaded files to AWS S3.</li>
<li>Stop the lambda function.</li>
<li>The lambda function will be scheduled to run every 5 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://www.startdataengineering.com/images/pull-data-from-API-using-lambda-s3/api_data_pull.png" alt="Simple API Data Pull"></p>

<p>Let’s assume you work for a company that wants to pull some data from an API that you have access to and assess the quality of that data. Your responsibility is to pull this data and make it available via cloud storage for other systems to consume and assess quality. Let’s assume that this is your first and only data pull(for now). There is not enough time/ money to set up/buy a data orchestration tool. This project is to validate the value that this data may provide, based on which your company can choose to either continue paying for this data or not.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS Account</a></li>
<li>AWS CLI <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html">installed</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html">configured</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="api-documentation">API Documentation</h3>
<p>Let us assume that our API has the following documentation.</p>
<ol>
<li>API endpoint: GET <code>http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts</code> to get user post data.</li>
<li>Query parameters: The data returned from the API is sorted by user_id. Using <code>start_user_id</code> and <code>end_user_id</code> we can query for a range of data based on user ids.</li>
<li>API metadata endpoint: GET <code>http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/number_of_users</code>, will return the total number of user posts.</li>
</ol>
<p>The GET endpoint will return a list of JSON with the format</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
    <span>"userId"</span>: <span>1</span>,
    <span>"id"</span>: <span>1</span>,
    <span>"title"</span>: <span>"some title here"</span>,
    <span>"body"</span>: <span>"some test here"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><h2 id="paginate">Paginate</h2>
<p>When pulling a “lot” of data from an API, it is general best practice to make multiple requests to pull data in chunks. The definition of a lot of data depends on the amount of data being pulled and the API stability. Based on the <code>API Documentation</code> above, we need to</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the total number of user posts.</li>
<li>Split the number into N number of calls, depending on a predefined <code>CHUNK</code> size. Which is the amount of data you want to pull per API call.</li>
<li>Make the API call, pull the data and write it to a local disk storage. You can also store in memory if the data size is sufficiently small.</li>
<li>Some APIs may fail due to network or other issues, add a retry parameter to account for this. In reality this will depend on the stability of the API and the network.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Depending on the size of data and the allocated lambda memory, it may be more efficient to keep data in memory instead of writing to disk and then uploading to S3.</p>
<p>Lets create a folder called <code>dataPull</code> in your project directory and within it a python script called <code>lambda_function.py</code>, starting with the content below</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">CHUNK_SIZE <span>=</span> <span>10000</span>  <span># determined based on API, memory constraints, experimentation</span>

        data <span>=</span> get_data(i, i <span>+</span> CHUNK_SIZE)
        write_to_local(data, i <span>//</span> CHUNK_SIZE)
</code></pre></div><p>In the above code snippet, we have the functions</p>
<ol>
<li><code>get_num_records</code> to simulate the GET call to your API to get the total number of user posts.</li>
<li><code>download_data</code> to make multiple calls to the API and only accessing 10,000 data records per API data pull. This 10,000 is defined as a global variable <code>CHUNK_SIZE</code>. In your project you will need to determine what this size is depending on API stability, memory constraints, network connection and general best practice size for that API.</li>
<li><code>parse_data</code> to convert the json data into a row format string, which gets written to a local file.</li>
<li><code>write_to_local</code> to write the downloaded chunk of data into the local file system. In our case if we have 100,000 records we will generate 10 files name <code>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</code> with the data for user ids <code>0-10000, 10000-20000,...90000-100000</code> correspondingly. Note the local file system location <code>/tmp</code> will only be available for the duration of a single run of your function.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h4>
<p>In the above snippet, since we are downloading chunks independently we can also make it concurrent using python’s <code>asyncio</code> library. If you are using concurrency be very aware of the number of open connections/ file handlers, etc. You can also manage concurrency at the lambda function level as shown <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_console">here</a>.</p>
<p>Note some API may not provide the exact number of records, instead you will have to query until no more data is available (usually using some sort of <code>search_after</code> query parameter). In such cases concurrency will be difficult to achieve since you will need the output from the previous call to make the next API call. An example of this is <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/search-request-search-after.html"><code>ElasticSearch's</code> search_after</a>. There is also the <code>from, size</code> type API endpoints which requires the size of data to pull and an id from which to start pulling data as query parameters to the API call.</p>

<p>Since lambda functions are temporary, so are their local storage. We need to make sure our locally stored data (at <code>/tmp</code>) gets stored in a persistent storage system such as <code>AWS S3</code>. Add the below code to <code>lambda_function.py</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Not interested in the back story? </strong>Jump ahead to <a href="#introducing-localizer">Introducing Localizer</a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Before we get into the details of what localizer is and how it came to be, it's crucial that we look at what developer environments were and the motivations behind the ones I create.</p><p>Ever since I wrote my first ever <a href="https://github.com/staymarta/dev">developer environment</a> for the now-defunct <a href="https://github.com/staymarta">StayMarta</a>, I've always focused on one thing: ease of use. For a docker-compose based development environment, this was a relatively simple task. Create Docker containers, write a compose file, declare ports, and they'd be available on my local machine. It was as simple as <code>docker-compose up</code>. While this approach didn't necessarily match what production looked like, it was really the best option available for containers at the time. Options that exist now, such as Kubernetes, weren't available, which rendered <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/announcing-docker-machine-swarm-and-compose-for-orchestrating-distributed-apps/">equality between production and development a work-in-progress dream</a>.</p><p>Fast forward to 2017, at my first larger-scale startup, <a href="https://azuqua.com/">Azuqua</a>, I had a chance to reimagine what a developer environment looked like under a whole new set of constraints. While Docker Compose works for small teams, it falls apart when you map it to production systems. At the time, our production system was based on Chef. Docker Compose doesn't map to Ruby-based Chef configuration files. When I joined Azuqua, the pain around having separate tooling for infrastructure had become incredibly clear. It wasn't sustainable to have an entire team; write the configuration for our services, communicate with developers why infrastructure can't infinitely scale without good software design, and do it all without blame or single points of failure. Fundamentally this is why I take issue with DevOps teams and prefer promoting the <a href="https://sre.google/">Google SRE Model</a> instead. While at Azuqua, we started a transition to an SRE model and used Kubernetes as a way to help facilitate that.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.jaredallard.me/content/images/2020/12/kind-1.png" alt="KinD Logo"></figure><p>While at Azuqua, I identified the need to run Kubernetes to ease cloud resources' scalability and improve the developer experience. At the same time, this <strong>drastically decreased the developer experience</strong>. While this may seem contradictory at first, it's essential to consider the multiple ways that developer experience presents itself. While at first, it may seem like it's just tooling to test/write code, it's a combination of testing code, writing code, and deploying that code. With the Docker Compose environment at StayMarta, we made the test/build cycle incredibly simple but shifted the deploy aspects onto a bespoke team, the DevOps model. That approach works for small teams, but as you grow, this quickly doesn't scale. If you can't deploy code efficiently, the developer experience is frustrating and promptly turns to an unhealthy relationship with the team responsible for that cycle.</p><p>Going back to how Kubernetes <em>improved the developer experience</em>, which I assure you it does. The benefit to Kubernetes was that it brought a control plane into the mix and focused on being just a container orchestrator. The DSL it does have is highly specific to orchestrating containers and making them work. The control-plane allows self-healing and building tooling to enable all different types of use-cases consistently. While it lacks abstractions, it brings something to developers they've never had before, the ability to deploy code reproducibly. With the introduction of <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">minikube</a>, <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">KinD</a>, and others, you could now run the same stack you run in production, but locally.</p><p>The ability to reproducibly deploy helps both deployment confidence and the amount of time needed to get from nothing to running in production. However, it's not without its faults. Whenever you start moving deployment tooling onto developers, you've decreased the developer experience. It's unavoidable because you're introducing net new materials, DSLs, and more for the developers to learn. While <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">KinD</a> and <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">minikube</a> are great projects, they all suffer from needing developers to understand how to work with Kubernetes. You need to be able to build a Docker image, push the docker image into the cluster, delete the application pod, verify if it's even using the correct tag, wait for Kubernetes to recreate the container, and make sure you've configured an ingress route to access it outside of your cluster or use <code>kubectl port-forward</code> to access it. The second that breaks, you're now required to dig into why service connectivity isn't working, why your Docker image isn't in the <code>containerd</code> cache, or other not so easily solved areas. While to someone who's worked with Kubernetes for years now, this isn't very difficult, this is hardly achieving the "ease of use" goal I have.</p><p>Solving these problems is not easy. Debugging Kubernetes is difficult and requires knowledge that can only be solved with education, more tooling, or a combination of both. Unfortunately, these are not cheap. Education is hard to do correctly and tends to result in lots of time writing quickly out of date material that is hard to maintain. While at Azuqua, we encountered this same problem. Very few engineers wanted to learn Kubernetes or invest time in the technology around it. We decided to go back to the basics and focus on a tooling based approach. How do we get the same developer experience level, at a minimum, of Docker Compose with Kubernetes? Our answer ended up being a tool called <a href="https://telepresence.io/">Telepresence</a>. Telepresence describes itself as:</p><blockquote>[...] an open source tool that lets you run a single service locally, while connecting that service to a remote Kubernetes cluster.<p><a href="https://www.telepresence.io/discussion/overview">https://www.telepresence.io/discussion/overview</a></p></blockquote><p>It seemed perfect, a tool that enabled your local machine to act as if it were running in Kubernetes and allow your services to be targeted from inside of Kubernetes. We rolled it out at Azuqua after initial tests showed it worked well, and we went with it. Unfortunately, it didn't last.</p><p>While Telepresence solved the problem of communicating with our local Kubernetes cluster, it spectacularly failed at letting services inside the cluster talk to our local services. When it worked, it worked amazingly, but nine times out of ten, it'd fail in a magnitude of ways. Whether that's failing to clean up after random crashing or slowly taking down the computer's internet connection, it generally wouldn't work. Luckily for us at Azuqua, we had a pretty well-defined system for service discovery and few services that needed to talk to one another directly. The few that needed that could just run outside of the cluster. That allowed us to accept those pains and be successful with Telepresence. To be clear, this is not a hit on Telepresence. It worked very well for us at Azuqua, but it's not a complete solution.</p><p>When I started developing a new development environment for <a href="https://outreach.io/">Outreach</a>, I again tried to use Telepresence as the solution to bridge the gap between our local cluster and our local machine. Unfortunately, it didn't work. We did not have a well-defined service discovery mechanism to work around the bugs, we had a much larger engineering team, and almost all services needed to talk to each other. We found more and more edge cases with Telepresence, and our developer experience was suffering. Our NPS score for our developer environment was at a low of -26, just because of Telepresence!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.jaredallard.me/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="Chart showing the NPS spread"><figcaption>For comparison, a good NPS is generally +30...&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>It was pretty clear that Telepresence was not going to solve our use-cases. It was time to look into alternatives.</p><p>Telepresence was interesting since it used a VPN to give you access to your resources. However, it also required a hack DNS injector component, which tended to be the primary source of network problems. There weren't many projects out there that seemed to solve this, but one interesting one was <a href="https://github.com/txn2/kubefwd">kubefwd</a>. If you're not aware of Kubernetes port-forwarding, there is a command that allows you to bring down a set of ports for a given service and have them be available on your local machine via <code>kubectl port-forward</code>. Think of the <code>-p</code> argument to <code>docker run</code>, but for Kubernetes. Unfortunately, this didn't support FQDNs (<code>.svc.cluster.local</code>), statefulsets, or all namespaces automatically. It also didn't support reverse tunneling. I wanted to keep the spirit of Telepresence by continuing to be a one-stop tool. Aside from <code>kubefwd</code>, there were seemingly no tools that could do this. Reverse tunneling into Kubernetes alone seemed to be an unsolved problem. To fill that gap, I decided to write <code>localizer</code>.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/jaredallard/localizer">Localizer</a> is a rewrite of Telepresence in Golang, but without the complex surface area. Its goal is to be a simple, no-frills development tool for application developers using Kubernetes. It does this by being easy to use, self-explanatory, and easy to debug. Localizer only supports what Kubernetes networking does, and acts as a daemon. This is most useful when trying to expose multiple services, developers generally had to have many terminal windows to run Telepresence or other reverse tunnel solutions. Localizer moves away from that by having all commands send a gRPC message to the daemon. More on that later. At the core of Localizer is three commands.</p><h2 id="default-creating-tunnels">Default: Creating Tunnels</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.jaredallard.me/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-04-at-1.28.31-PM-1.png" alt="Output from running the localizer daemon"><figcaption>Running <code>localizer</code> on my home Kubernetes Cluster (it's not limited to just local developer environments)</figcaption></figure><p>When you run <code>localizer</code> without any arguments, it automatically creates port-forwards for all Kubernetes Services (this is important), a loopback-interface powered IP address, and adds them to <code>/etc/hosts</code>.

Localizer then creates an OpenSSH pod with the Kubernetes service's selector, which makes Kubernetes route traffic to the created pod. Localizer creates an SSH reverse proxy over a Kubernetes port-forward (which …</p></div></div>

        <p>Dear LispWorks, Dear Usha, Dear Franz, Dear Jans,</p>

        <p>
          One of the biggest divisions within the Common Lisp community remains largely unacknowledged. That is <strong>the division between <em>Open Source and Proprietary</em></strong>.
          <br>
          There is tremendous untapped, latent energy to unlock to help make Common Lisp successful, and we just need a slight paradigm shift to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1213964177657794577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">We can make Common Lisp a top 5 programming language by 2040</a>, and this will be much easier to achieve if we unify our forces.
          <br>
          <strong><a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">Through my work</a>, I am working to dramatically expand the Common Lisp community, which is guaranteed to greatly benefit your business</strong>.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>You could boost my productivity almost beyond imagination just by providing me a tiny fraction of a normal salary!</strong>
          <br>
          For instance, 1000$/month would be basically infinite money in my current situation. How about you each contribute 500$/month for 6 months as a trial?
          <br>
          Of course, please consider starting with a large donation to the <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> before <strong>10 december 2020</strong>, as GitHub will double your contribution!
        </p>

        <p>
          I also urge you to open source more of your technology, not even necessarily out of pure generosity, but simply because it makes so much business sense!
          <br>
          For instance, you could send SHOCKWAVES throughout the world simply by open sourcing <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/products/capi.html" target="_blank">CAPI</a> and <a href="https://allegrograph.com/products/allegrograph/" target="_blank">AllegroGraph</a>!
          <br>
          Inherently, the more you open source, the more you stand to benefit from the great Open Source Marketing Machine!
        </p>

        <p>In fact, I almost wonder if you should also open source LispWorks and Allegro Common Lisp and transform yourself into a services company like Red Hat? It's really hard to compete with world-class open source implementations like <a href="http://sbcl.org/" target="_blank">SBCL</a> these days. But obviously, this would be a more long-term project, and I don't presume to understand your business better than you do or tell you what to do. I'm just suggesting ideas. We stand to greatly benefit from a healthy exchange of ideas.</p>

        <p>I have reason to believe that your understanding and appreciation for <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">my crucial work within the Common Lisp community</a> has only been growing since this historic event.</p>

        <p>I believe you have the necessary knowledge and resources to be a key ally in <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">leading Common Lisp to unprecedented success</a>.</p>

        <p>Dear Paul Graham, Dear Y Combinator,</p>

        <p><a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">I have been almost entirely dedicating my life to Common Lisp since mid-2006</a> when I discovered Common Lisp, largely thanks to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/" target="_blank">your essays</a>, especially <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank">Beating the Averages</a>. After spending 2 weeks reading your essays and researching Common Lisp, I went all-in on Common Lisp and completely abandoned Java. <strong>To this day, this has been the best and most determinant event in my life and I am deeply thanking you for it!</strong></p>

        <p>Basically, I've been running <a href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">an unregistered Common Lisp startup</a> for 14 years. I am planning to register in 2022 at the latest. I have finally started experiencing <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/#hexstreamsoft-alexa-stats" target="_blank">some visible success</a> this year, as I am finally reaching the interesting point in the exponential curve. <strong>I am requesting your help to further accelerate and embolden this process.</strong></p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, I believe the traditional Y Combinator process would not be a good fit for me, due to various reasons.
          <br>
          I am requesting a fairly insignificant amount of funding compared to your usual investments, but this would completely change my life.
        </p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">I am the chief architect of the looming Common Lisp revolution.</a> The revolution would still happen even if you just decided to watch it unfold from afar, but I thought I would highlight your opportunity to lend it a bit of your vast resources and influence, thereby greatly empowering it. Everyone has much to gain from this happening. This is a traditional win-win-win scenario.</p>

        <p>I trust that your world-class expertise in startups will easily detect the amazing intrinsic value and potential of me and my startup.</p>

        <p>Dear Ergodox/ZSA, Dear Erez, Dear Tisha, Dear Florian,</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is truly revolutionary and life-changing! I predict that it (or its close descendants) will remain the best keyboard on the planet for decades to come!</p>

        <p>Thank you for implementing custom labels in <a href="https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/planck-ez/layouts/ABWNG/latest/0" target="_blank">Oryx</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1237462417577295873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">as I requested</a>. Your email support is truly amazing, and I was surprised to find that indeed, we have already exchanged <strong>more than 100 emails in 9 months!</strong> I greatly value our great relationship, and here is a perfect occasion to go to the next level!</p>

        <p>
          The <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is so damn great that I couldn't resist making <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/hardware/planck-ez/#my-config" target="_blank">an advanced presentation for my custom keyboard layout</a>.
          <br>
          You were so impressed with it that you quickly offered to <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/" target="_blank">interview me</a>, and I then proceeded to really pour my soul into that article, with quite impressive results I might say!</p>

        <p>
          The kicker? <strong>I did this while I was already late to launch <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a>! <em>Oh noes!!</em></strong> 🤣
          <br>
          But seriously, I just <em>couldn't wait</em> to share my passion for the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> with the world! That's how goddamn amazing it is!!
        </p>

        <p>I had already been using the TypeMatrix 2030 (a somewhat similar keyboard) for more than a decade, and the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is at least 20x better! It's easy to infer that I'm probably going to stick to the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> or a close descendant for the next decade at least... As <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/#alternative-to-qmk" target="_blank">previously stated</a>, I am planning to build much more powerful alternatives to <a href="https://qmk.fm/" target="_blank">QMK</a>, <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/wally" target="_blank">Wally</a> and <a href="https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/" target="_blank">Oryx</a>, all written in Common Lisp, of course. Admittedly, it would take at least a few years before I can start working on this, due to <a href="https://roadmap.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">more pressing priorities</a>. My <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/hardware/planck-ez/#my-config" target="_blank">awesome Planck EZ layout presentation</a> is already a good first step towards an Oryx alternative, although it is not yet written in Common Lisp. (I would probably only support the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a>, since that's the only keyboard I find interesting...) <strong><a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/#stenography" target="_blank">I believe the Planck EZ will be the key to unlocking 100x productivity!</a></strong></p>

        <p>
          I think there is already an inherent and fundamental link between Common Lisp and the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a>:
          <br>
          <em>It's only fair to expect that the best programmers would gravitate not only towards the best programming language, but also the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">best keyboard</a>!</em>
          <br>
          Thankfully, we have a tremendous opportunity to make that connection even more concrete today!
        </p>

        <p><strong>As such, I would be extremely honored if you made a large donation to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> <em>before 10 december 2020</em> to help kickstart the Common Lisp revolution right now!

            <p>
Naval Ravikant, founder of AngelList, describes his companyâ€™s shipping culture in one of his <a href="https://nav.al/build-a-team-that-ships">blog posts</a>. 
</p>
<p>
They like to keep projects to one person. And every person is responsible for shipping something every single week. 
</p>
<p>
Itâ€™s quite a polarizing culture. So much so that Naval makes explicit that their environment is wrong for most people. Theyâ€™re looking for independent people who can ship code and if you donâ€™t fit that type, you should go look elsewhere:
</p>


<blockquote>
    If they canâ€™t ship, release them. Our environment is wrong for them. They should go find someplace where they can thrive. Thereâ€™s someplace for everyone.
    <span>Naval Ravikant</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
I wish more companies would do this. When youâ€™re able to clearly outline your values, you tend to attract individuals that stick. 
</p>
<p>
And sometimes, itâ€™s just as important to list all the reasons why someone <em>wouldnâ€™t enjoy</em> working at a company as it is to list everything good about the company. 
</p>
<p>
Hereâ€™s an example from <a href="https://www.notion.so/Join-Levels-Remote-Head-of-Marketing-Growth-6e64dba240404eaea9160a48f1c5f24f">Levels Healthâ€™s</a> recent job description:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_angellist/job_description.png" alt="">
</center>

<p>
Information like this is gold dust. Think about the countless <em>years</em> people waste working at companies that theyâ€™re not suited for. 
</p>
<p>
For instance, the role above would be a bad fit for me. Iâ€™m at a stage of my career where mentorship would be helpful and Iâ€™d like to execute on projects that are clearly defined in scope. 
</p>
<p>
If a company is not able to explain to me what would make someone a bad candidate for the role, then that would worry me. If youâ€™re not able to eliminate <em>anyone</em> for a role, then the job position itself has likely not been set up for success. 
</p>
<h2>Build a team that ships</h2>


<p>
I want to talk a bit more about AngelListâ€™s prolific shipping culture.
</p>
<p>
It reminds me of a ceramics experiment that was done (can be traced back to this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0961454733/?tag=codihorr-20">book</a>) in which the teacher divided the class into two groups. 
</p>
<p>
One group would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, whilst the other solely on its quality.
</p>
<p>
The grading procedure was simple:
</p>
<p>
<em>â€œOn the final day of class, the instructor would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the "quantity" group: fifty pound of pots rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on. Those being graded on "quality", however, needed to produce only one pot - albeit a perfect one - to get an "A".â€�</em>
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to grading time. Can you guess what happened? 
</p>
<p>
It turns out that the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity:
</p>
<p>
<em>â€œIt seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of work - and learning from their mistakes - the "quality" group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.â€�</em>
</p>
<p>
Naval acknowledges that shipping at the velocity they do is not ideal. They make mistakes and many of the features they release are half-baked. 
</p>
<p>
But it is also precisely <em>because</em> they ship so much that theyâ€™re able to get it right. Just like the â€œquantityâ€� group, the engineers at AngelList are constantly iterating and testing out their assumptions. 
</p>
<p>
Rather than always being in paralysis mode, they just build the damn thing. And if it doesnâ€™t work, they try again until it does. 
</p>

December 5, 2020 | https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/brown-location-surveillance | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/brown-location-surveillance">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In September 2020, Brown University <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/09/28/remote-students-receive-emails-brown-accusing-violating-code-student-conduct">accused students</a> of lying about their location; e.g.:</p>
<p><img src="https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/brown-location-surveillance/notice.png" height="auto" width="100%" alt="The University has learned that between September 14, 2020 and September 21, 2020 you were allegedly in the Providence area during which time your location of study was listed as remote. This alleged behavior is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct and the COVID-19 Campus Safety Policy. A copy of the Student Commitment to COVID-19 Community Health and Safety Requirements is attached for your review, along with this link to the COVID-19 Campus Safety Policy. failure to abide by these requirements is a violation of the Code of Student Conduct. 
Based on the details of the incident and your student conduct history, the Office of Student Conduct &amp; Community Standards has decided to allow you the opportunity to accept responsibility for the following prohibited conduct without having a COVID-19 Dean's Review Meeting:
• D.8 Failure to Comply
• D.13 Misrepresentation
"></p>
<p><strong>What was Brown's basis for these accusations?</strong></p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/09/28/remote-students-receive-emails-brown-accusing-violating-code-student-conduct">interview with The Brown Daily Herald</a>, University Spokesperson Brian Clark said the University evaluated a variety of indicators, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>indications of building access,</li>
<li>indications of accessing private electronic services,</li>
<li>indications of accessing secure networks, and</li>
<li>reports from community members.</li>
</ol>
<p>The mechanics of that last indicator are pretty self-explanatory, but what about the others? <a href="https://it.brown.edu/services/type/canvas-learning-management-system">Canvas</a> <em>doesn't</em> <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/google-wants-to-know-your-location">Want To Know Your Location</a>. <strong>In this post, I'm going to break down the technical mechanisms behind each of these indicators.</strong></p>
<p>For the most part, I do not have insider knowledge on how Brown reached its decisions. Rather, I'm going to consider each of the indicators Brian Clark named, and describe the technical mechanisms to which Brown <em>could</em> have availed itself to generating location data.</p>
<h2 id="indications-of-building-access">Indications of Building Access</h2>
<p>This is an easy one. Brown's buildings are located on Brown's campus. Brown's campus is in Providence. If you are in Brown's buildings, you are on Brown's campus, in Providence. QED.</p>
<p>At Brown, building access is primarily regulated with electronic control systems (namely Software House's <a href="https://www.swhouse.com/products/software_CCURE9000.aspx"><strong>C•CURE 9000</strong></a> system), not mechanical keys.</p>
<p>Encoded on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_stripe_card#Track_2">track 2</a> of the magnetic stripe on every University ID card is a sixteen digit number that uniquely identifies the card:</p>
<p><img src="https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/brown-location-surveillance/brown-id-card-back.jpg" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Image of back of Brown ID card. A tall magnetic stripe runs across the entire width of the card."></p>
<p>Well, that's underwhelming — of <em>course</em> you can't <em>see</em> it! However, up until 2017 or 2018, this number was also <em>printed</em> on the front of ID cards, just above the card-holder's name:</p>
<p><img src="https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/brown-location-surveillance/brown-id-card-front.jpg" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Image fo the front of a Brown ID card, displaying the building access code: 6009553660926201"></p>
<p>This pseudo-random identifier (well, its last ten digits) are what uniquely identify you whenever you swipe your Brown ID card <em>anywhere</em>. And, if you lose your Brown ID card, this is the <em>only</em> thing that's changed when you're issued a replacement. Convenient! In contrast, when you lose your dorm room's mechanical key, Brown must replace (or rather, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rekeying">rekey</a>) the locks.</p>
<p>But, <em>also</em> unlike a mechanical key, <em>every</em> swipe of a Brown ID card is logged in a central database. <strong>The C•CURE 9000 lets administrators view the complete historical building access history of a person.</strong> Last Spring, Brown used this mechanism to identify and prod students who were slow to evacuate Providence.</p>
<h2 id="indicators-from-electronic-services">Indicators from Electronic Services</h2>
<p>University web services like Canvas <em>don't</em> directly ask you for your location. Nonetheless, accessing these services leaves a location finger print: your IP address.</p>
<p>Your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP address</a> is a number that identifies your device (computer, phone, etc.) for the purposes of network routing. In principle, nobody but you and your internet provider know the <em>exact</em> mapping of your IP address to your physical address.</p>
<p>In practice, IP addresses can be used to <em>roughly</em> geolocate a device. Batches of IP addresses are associated <em>loosely</em> with geographic areas. Since every web service access leaves an IP address as a trace, there are tremendous incentives for advertisers to be able accurately identify what city or town an IP address is probably associated with.</p>
<p>Brown probably <em>isn't</em> analyzing the access logs of its <em>individual</em> web services (like Canvas). Rather, they need only to audit the access logs of its three identity access management (IAM) systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://workspace.google.com/">Google Workplace</a> IAM system is used to control access to your @brown.edu email, and to the various Google Drive services. <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/4580120?hl=en"><strong>Google Workplace</strong> provides administrators with login audit logs that include users' IP addresses.</a></li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.shibboleth.net/">Shibboleth</a> IAM system controls access to all <em>other</em> Brown web services, such as Canvas. It's what you think of as your "Brown account". Shibboleth is <em>very</em> flexible, and can be <a href="https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/IDP30/AuditLoggingConfiguration#AuditLoggingConfiguration-GenericFields">configured to log IP addresses</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://duo.com/">DUO</a> is used to provide two-factor authentication for Shibboleth logins. <a href="https://help.duo.com/s/article/1023?language=en_US#docs-internal-guid-0aa3b4ce-c686-7559-8814-1377592fce4a:%7E:text=Access%20Device">It too provides administrators with detailed access logs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can partly view your Google Workplace login history for yourself by opening your Brown email and clicking "Details" in the bottom right-hand corner of the page; e.g.:</p>
<p><img src="https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/brown-location-surveillance/gmail-account-activity.png" height="auto" width="100%"></p>
<p>With <em>either</em> of these access logs in hand, Brown could then turn to any number of geolocation services (<a href="https://tools.keycdn.com/geo">like this one</a>) to guess your physical location.</p>
<h2 id="indicators-from-secure-networks">Indicators from Secure Networks</h2>
<p>This is another easy one. Brown's WiFI network <a href="https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/blog/brown-location-surveillance/Campus_Wireless_Coverage_Map_24x36_1.pdf">blankets Brown's campus</a>. Brown's campus is in Providence. If you are on Brown's WiFi network, you are on Brown's campus. QED.</p>
<p>What might surprise you is the sheer depth of surveillance that's capable with WiFi alone. This section will <em>barely</em> scratch the surface.</p>
<h3 id="identification">Identification</h3>
<p>Brown's WiFi routers each broadcast three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_(802.11_network)">service sets</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://it.brown.edu/services/type/wireless-network-brown">Brown</a></li>
<li><a href="https://it.brown.edu/services/type/wireless-network-eduroam">eduroam</a></li>
<li><a href="https://it.brown.edu/services/type/wireless-access-brown-guest">Brown Guest</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The Brown and eduroam networks require that you authenticate with your Brown account credentials. Brown University is thus able to identify the owner of any device connected to these networks.</p>
<p>While Brown Guest does <em>not</em> require authentication, it still provides mechanisms of identification. Your network devices broadcast a unique identifier called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address"><strong>MAC address</strong></a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://drawings.jvns.ca/mac-address/"><img type="image/svg+xml" src="https://drawings.jvns.ca/drawings/mac-address.svg" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Comic by Julia Evans. Text: Every computer on the internet has a network card. When you make HTTP requests with Ethernet/WiFi, every packet gets sent to a MAC address. (&quot;Wait, how do I know someone else on the same network isn't reading all my packets?&quot; &quot;You don't! That's one reason we use HTTPS &amp; secure WiFi networks.&quot;) Your router has a table that maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.  (Read about ARP for more.)
"></a></p>
<p>Brown <a href="https://it.brown.edu/computing-policies/network-connection-policy#32:%7E:text=CIS%20maintains%20a%20database%20of%20unique,a%20computer%20when%20it%20is%20necessary.">maintains databases of the MAC addresses of all connected devices</a>.</p>
<p>If you have ever connected to an authenticated network, Brown will be able to de-anonymize your connections to Brown Guest — <em>unless</em> your device implements <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address#Randomization">MAC address randomization</a>, which (as the name suggests) randomizes your device's MAC address on a per-network basis.</p>
<h3 id="localization">Localization</h3>
<p>Brown's access points log the MAC addresses of the devices that have connected to them. As of 2015, Brown retained these logs for at least several years — possibly indefinitely. Since there are so many access points on campus, which access point you are connected to can narrow your location down to a particular room. <strong>Combined, these logs paint a <em>very</em> accurate picture of your location on campus at any time.</strong></p>
<p>You do not need to be <em>actively</em> browsing the internet for Brown to know where you are via this mechanism. As you walk through campus, your phone likely <em>automatically</em> reconnects to the nearest available access point. If you are within a literal stone's throw of campus, you should assume that Brown can (roughly) identify your location.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you are in range of three or more of Brown's ARUBA access points, Brown can, in principle, precisely triangulate your location. This functionality is <a href="https://www.arubanetworks.com/pdf/technology/whitepapers/wp_Hybrid_WIDS.pdf">common</a> in enterprise-grade WiFi infrastructure. (If you've ever tried to run a "rogue" WiFi router in your dorm room and receive an angry knock on your door — this is the mechanism by which you were located.)</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-find-out-more">How do I find out more?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Educational_Rights_and_Privacy_Act"><em>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act</em></a> empowers students to request their education records from their University.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWzBrC8dVnw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you are a current Brown student and would like to go beyond my blog post and learn <em>exactly</em> how Brown University knows your location, <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/student-information-rightsferpa">file a FERPA request</a>. Brown University is obligated to respond within 45 days. You'll need to be specific with your request. I suggest requesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>the timestamps, MAC addresses and BSSIDs associated with your devices' connections to Brown University's wireless access points</li>
<li>the timestamps and locations associated with all building accesses conducted with your ID card</li>
<li>the login audit data associated with all Google Workplace, Shibboleth, and DUO authentications conducted by your accounts</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation"><em>General Data Protection Regulation</em></a> gives EU citizens and residents expansive control over how their personally identifiable information (PII) is used, and the right to request a copy of or the destruction of collected data. I believe these requests should be directed to <a href="https://compliance.brown.edu/">Brown's compliance office</a>. You might be able to do this even if you're a Brown alumni.</p>
<p><strong>If you attempt either of these steps, <a href="mailto:jack@wrenn.fyi">please get in touch</a>!</strong> I'm very curious as to what Brown is <em>actually</em> doing.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-surveillance-cameras">Bonus: Surveillance Cameras</h2>
<p>As of February 2020, <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/02/21/cameras-installed-hegeman-hall/#post-2838338:%7E:text=The%20University%20uses%20approximately%20800%20cameras,with%20high%20crime%20activity%2C%20Porter%20said."><em>eight hundred</em> surveillance cameras monitor campus 24/7</a>. Brown has as about as many surveillance cameras as it has full-time faculty! This map documents a <em>mere seven percent</em> of Brown University's total camera surveillance capacity:</p>

<p><small>This map displays data from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a>. <a href="https://pietervdvn.github.io/Staging/surveillance.html?z=17&amp;lat=41.82681&amp;lon=-71.4016">Help improve its accuracy!</a></small></p><p>Brown University has a longstanding policy governing the appropriate uses of its surveillance cameras. <strong>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/2008/01/10/surveillance-cameras-on-campus-triple/#post-1679525:%7E:text=DPS%20would%20not%20release%20the%20University%E2%80%99s%20full%20policy%20on%20the%20surveillance%20camera%20system">this policy is secret</a>.</strong></p>
<p>While Brown probably does not <em>currently</em> have the capacity to both broadly and deeply inspect the firehose of data produced by these cameras, expect this to change in the near future. Axis Communications, Brown's primary supplier of surveillance cameras, <a href="https://www.axis.com/customer-story/3767">now touts cameras that can perform <em>on-board</em> facial recognition</a>. And Software House, the provider of the C•CURE 9000 access control system, has begun marketing the integration of facial recognition with its access control systems:</p>

<p>PostgreSQL, or Postgres for short, comes with many out-of-the-box features that make it very popular among developers and data engineers. Among the numerous benefits of implementing Postgres are that there are many approaches to take to scale your database horizontally or vertically—but that is a discussion for a whole different article. Postgres comes with plenty of add-ons and a strong community of developers behind it too for open-source support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aside from plugins that you can quickly add a variety of tools and resources to your Postgres suite to expand the many functionalities of your Postgres database system to help you take your use of Postgres to the next level. This article shares the top 62 tools, plugins, and add-ons in that suite for you to improve your Postgres operations and productivity quickly and efficiently.</p>



<h2><strong>Graphical User Interface</strong></h2>



<p>Postgres doesn’t come with a native GUI, but that doesn’t mean you cannot manage your Postgres databases using a simple user interface. Web-based GUIs and tools for this specific purpose are easy to find.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/plt54JgoE56tK9XTfy0n77S5kbUU3yOsxHuFncLuPYsC32QWHl9NQUTVulFjqJupJRB5i-Uvwy3u9NF0liPb4C2BCrEjvxNcZfSaUe2kJtPap4fiC3INTgPJubPtRHRhwi3zFGTl" alt="#DataGrip" width="254" height="113"></figure>



<ol><li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Datagrip</a></li></ol>



<p>DataGrip is a tool that helps simplify managing multiple databases. It is compatible with multiple database systems, including PostgreSQL. You get a graphical interface for managing databases, running queries, and completing routine maintenance tasks. This tool is very popular at Cherre.</p>

<ol start="2"><li><a href="https://dbeaver.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DBeaver&nbsp;</a></li></ol>



<p>The latest version of DBeaver, 7.1.4, includes data editing features that are designed to be intuitive. DBeaver, however, offers more than data editing. It supports PostgreSQL and many other database systems.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EIl8uFSl3bnrnLWOE5xbNYy_PLs0Gb1g5xC3CuhqGN_6Snr8DmyO0NI7BDxhRuKqqreLGm4hPwMTfA970hSC--k1D3UKg_xsNYk6qgnX5bTM9HFDX5IlPQhLTXC98UN3eEzLWuJu" alt="#Navicat" width="267" height="108"></figure>



<ol start="3"><li><a href="https://www.navicat.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Navicat for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>Navicat is not a new name in the database landscape. Its product for Postgres is designed to offer you all the tools you need to manage complex databases. There are also data visualization tools available within.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FQ2Tdygv9EVAvWLrJo8Ab9jA-L1cBtv3ek41rVaaVmCKLfYyHpJewvoy6dlmIiuNaLFODhsDHFdMfeotCx9cmcoBzxLFbpAN_efDh5s13Qzn2xFSXFfQkAmqlucDgfMf4wPhxzT6" alt="#Pgadmin" width="113" height="117"></figure>



<ol start="4"><li><a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pgadmin</a></li></ol>



<p>When it comes to keeping Postgres maintenance and management simple, Postgres has pgADmin. The web-based option now supports external configuration files and runs completely in the cloud. You can use it as a way to manage database clusters. However, it feels a little limited compared to a full gui.</p>



<ol start="5"><li><a href="https://www.valentina-db.com/en/studio-for-postgresql" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valentina Studio for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>Valentina Studio comes in different flavors, but even the free version is capable enough for managing multiple Postgres databases. It supports forms, can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines, and simplifies data transfer between databases.</p>



<ol start="6"><li><a href="http://phppgadmin.sourceforge.net/doku.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">phpPgAdmin</a></li></ol>



<p>MySQL has phpMyAdmin, and PostgreSQL has phpPgAdmin. If you are familiar with phpMyAdmin, then you will have no trouble using the Postgres version. The features and tools are relatively the same with a few adjustments.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FHiWWzHKdvKOGEwdNi_FFJ4cmSFLW208aREpKrHw-fdNhR0AnIx7N5Rpe5_wVhnVpbGYfrF3dZJFVSjdse4ye7fXvVna-WxaW8oP94ZPEwl6VH5mOYfTCfoo12EQOp5mq8FgAc8A" alt="#Metabase" width="195" height="146"></figure>



<ol start="7"><li><a href="https://www.metabase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metabase</a></li></ol>



<p>Metabase is more of a data processing tool with advanced UIs. Rather than complex queries, it allows you to answer questions by visualizing insights collected from the PostgreSQL databases that you maintain.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Z1m1CLoiqrVOz1S1LHm1SJDB5RkgizMFx8mqRC-GWyMs7gfrhAMoCHwOe9yGqKGJpWYPxJM62NgdJVAKJy6NwbYcszplUaCl0o1SOs68VgNsjFIc_sljbRRimFGeJPIodS_Zqn3_" alt="#Slemma" width="240" height="80"></figure>



<ol start="8"><li><a href="https://slemma.com/connectors/database-reporting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slemma</a></li></ol>



<p>Slemma is far from just another GUI for Postgres. It takes data visualization to another level by introducing automation. Reports from a series of entries can be generated automatically based on parameters and the kind of insights you want to get in return.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vDAmrWbVqi9izoCkHpRiHKd7KC8sbos8p_L7tgBOLz-2EuI12hFg1BuhY9vgDfdyUGd__ChCmc37rpimb4LMqXPYnzLP7RHDqnU6_5PWA_B4UK5SZu6lEHxfZAwqSKcNxrGZF7CP" alt="#windwardstudios" width="331" height="76"></figure>



<ol start="9"><li><a href="https://www.windwardstudios.com/datasource/postgresql" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windward Studios</a></li></ol>



<p>Windward is the last GUI tool on our list with a special trick up its sleeve: it can be integrated with Microsoft Office natively. You can use Office apps to design templates for reports or to visualize your report using data stored in Postgres.</p>



<h2><strong>Utilities</strong></h2>



<p>Utilities for Postgres are usually designed to do specific things. While PostgreSQL doesn’t require special maintenance, it is still a good idea to integrate good utilities into your database management workflow. The best utilities tools will certainly make your life as a database engineer easier.</p>



<ol><li><a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/pg_catcheck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pg_catcheck</a></li></ol>



<p>System catalog corruption can be a huge problem that can bring an entire Postgres database down when it happens. Depending on the severity of the corruption, you may also lose entries and valuable information. Use pg_catheck to monitor for system catalog corruption.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><a href="http://www.pgbouncer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pgBouncer</a></li></ol>



<p>As the name suggests, pgBouncer acts as the bouncer that prevents unauthorized access. The common use case for this tool is to manage connections, similar to a load balancer. While Postgres is relatively secure as long as you follow the best practices, having encrypted SCRAM secrets used for storing passwords is a good idea.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><a href="https://hypopg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HypoPG</a></li></ol>



<p>Hypotheticals are not always possible—and are certainly difficult to keep track of—and HypoPG is here to solve those challenges. It is basically a virtual index that doesn’t really consume cloud resources. It can also handle hypothetical partitioning.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><a href="https://www.postgis.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PostGIS</a></li></ol>



<p>PostGIS fills one specific hole, lack of native support for spatial information. Postgres users can now use PostGIS to use location information in queries. If your app relies on location data, this utility certainly helps.</p>



<ol start="5"><li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/postgres-fdw.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Postgres_fdw</a></li></ol>



<p>Foreign-data wrapper makes accessing external Postgres databases possible. Postgres_fdw takes that idea one step further and makes the whole process easier.&nbsp; In short you can use objects from other databases, without having to sync the two together, Postgres_fdw inexpensively makes it look like it’s in both. After installing the utility, you can create a foreign server object and work with user mapping accordingly.</p>



<ol start="6"><li><a href="https://www.yohz.com/dbdoc_details.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DB Doc for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>While launching a new app or distributing it to a client is a fairly straightforward process, making sure that the app is used properly—and is developed with care—is still difficult. DB Doc for PostgreSQL takes care of creating documentation for your projects.</p>



<h2><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong></h2>



<p>Being able to utilize Postgres without having to manage the entire cloud infrastructure supporting it is something that many development teams want these days. Organizations turn to managed database services so that they can utilize the features of Postgres without the usual complications. Fortunately, there are several solutions being offered as Platform as a Service or PaaS.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gxEUzL5xD9FYbEf-O1dSweSDqCeuqH29GAw6U5GyrdwRC_SO5VV4V9XPG3JysT_7F9kcsa-iE0r265pi6RwU5uzXM-tpSnsRHqLHsKTX7VlyNJC4Vx1grypmnH3oFvmQwyzQo2nW" alt="#AmazonRDSforPostgreSQL" width="118" height="132"></figure>



<ol><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>Amazon’s RDS is perhaps the most popular option of them all, offering cloud relational databases as managed services. It has Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, which allows you to forget about storage, deployment cycles, availability, and backup while taking full advantage of what Postgres has to offer.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nS9uoXzAn68iKWqAXzTgHzMuvjQHn1hmVqNshUIYCWstM0cHCt6EbVAdiormaASkc-li1fJ1JWz71885r6tTmODgpyRt6J_gYBjbT1W3jaQwoOjMMg7HPYBOBYhqb5UfvyS8QJro" alt="#aiven" width="173" height="91"></figure>



<ol start="2"><li><a href="https://aiven.io/postgresql" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aiven for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>Aiven for PostgreSQL is another option when it comes to fully managed SQL databases. You can give the platform a try for free before switching to one of the paid plans that suit your needs best. Even better, Aiven runs on AWS, GCP, Azure, and other cloud ecosystems for better availability.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/iIeJzX5JFZAPYm24YDmJo3HzHIUgSfrhyGhrm15jrIPLNWot_qIWi3UDmEf7_2l2fn4Pxa2TsGECybWOVjqhOPiuRlNSyXiURZjhJT_Z9TAMg8bPSNEwyCrey_1jpPUCby_w8bAE" alt="#CloudSQLforPostgreSQL" width="137" height="128"></figure>



<ol start="3"><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL is Google’s version of managed relational databases in the cloud. As part of Google Cloud, Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL integrates well with other GCP services, plus it can be used to support apps running in a multi-cloud environment thanks to its comprehensive API.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7ZleaQxKb5wx4XkzKSr7GNtUS2UEch28DRlFutxf3iS4Ai5-0qsFIv-M8oImaGQwLIKoWDxychrTKrgQebP-30aEA_AMuHy_prL3botCzH5qX5F9IrCTu0F2dvxaqY6olaoRk3Ww" alt="#AzureDatabaseforPostgrSQL" width="143" height="143"></figure>



<ol start="4"><li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/postgresql/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure Database for PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>Amazon has one. Google has one. So it is not surprising to see Microsoft offering the Azure Database for PostgreSQL. Azure doesn’t just offer another PaaS for Postgres users, though. It leans heavily on scalability and offers intelligent performance recommendations—powered by machine learning—as one of its features.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oEUtjqnAJ03bOJYbQwkiRuvcTTNe2Rd0hXx90YTR4ksZy60WEsiOeoAqZh6soY89yz2ifXnSwyryIuNfQSc_Ytrbo-7JeXi4Qs1wjdM3m20Ir-MtgmsHbU8baiND5WBHxTDHQ95s" alt="#DigitalOcean" width="132" height="132"></figure>



<ol start="5"><li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DigitalOcean Managed Databases</a></li></ol>



<p>For a more affordable option, DigitalOcean Managed Databases is the service you want to look into. It starts at only $15/month, but It offers easy setup, seamless maintenance, daily backups, and multiple redundancies to support your apps and microservices.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/E59LDZy3uUEiBAnPPFauhfT3q6tyvzWyWtrC0xKGyp_pbVurrhrCDo4ZQW2eTvVX03fdD8MsegQvb0VlaobAgX5R_pY60qItNr8b9ZweovwCHE-2wZNeKnvohMiXKmDLZ9yitemq" alt="#Heroku" width="198" height="110"></figure>



<ol start="6"><li><a href="https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heroku PostgreSQL</a></li></ol>



<p>Heroku PostgreSQL offers all the Postgres features you will ever need, but without making the entire platform cluttered or too complicated. Available in the United States and Europe, Heroku PostgreSQL is also affordable thanks to its nano and micro plans.</p>



<h2><strong>Applications</strong></h2>



<p>There are a lot of tools designed to make designing Postgres databases, creating relationships, managing tables, and organizing the entire PostgreSQL platform easier, but most of them are designed to offer specific features. In this part, we are going to take a look at the two Postgres applications that you can use for end-to-end database design and management.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BNG9GB5GDj0UgmVKyLRJ2PFYbJBXPHemZTxuUfYYy3_WrsOTDydLH4eORC3gQwSQ6Bu38EGkcxzKd6N6yJ4emc88wRIhz9rQIZ-U6FrdXtxxRF21JdT2Toj9_vOWosaLeyTDG-ZA" alt="#agileBase" width="129" height="115"></figure>



<ol><li><a href="http://www.agilebase.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agileBase</a></li></ol>



<p>AgileBase is famous for its low-code or no-code approach. You don’t have to be a database specialist—or any specialist for that matter—to build your own platform and support the application you want to deliver. AgileBase’s PostgreSQL features are designed as blocks and can be customized to your liking.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/4COODpGprHglQA440b4to0ipwxVG3SIqAZJNOyqHQ_aERyOUZENL9c6nFzn5ue05rXnVomRuQRV9pkeF_m9T6l8cX9vZ2ojPzYanMVYL2HJgjWgDa3ZfrRrFk2AXoCqmXb28SKF-" alt="#Dataedo" width="255" height="78"></figure>



<ol start="2"><li><a href="https://dataedo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dataedo</a></li></ol>



<p>Dataedo is all about simplicity. You can manage even the most complex Postgres database through the app’s simple user interface. Even relationships are displayed visually and can be edited as such. This is a great app to use if you don’t want complex database management to be a bottleneck in your pipeline.</p>



<h2><strong>High-Availability</strong></h2>



<p>A database always sits at the core of the application that uses it. Database failures and unreliable database systems are unacceptable because they tend to bring the entire application down with them. That is why PostgreSQL is best implemented in a highly available environment, and these tools are the ones to use if you want to monitor high availability.</p>



<ol><li><a href="https://daamien.github.io/PostgreSQL-Dashboard/">B</a><a href="https://daamien.github.io/PostgreSQL-Dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">G</a><a href="https://daamien.github.io/PostgreSQL-Dashboard/">R</a></li></ol>



<p>The PostgreSQL Dashboard offers access to key metrics that make ensuring high availability easier. There is no need to go through logs manually. Insights are displayed visually and you can go straight to refining your cloud infrastructure to boost the reliability of your database system.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/THt0_k5TJV7ZBN8Evk-T8SDq_RMjV9WLgxMAHzjkfxFDer19sBClE-GQDwPNUtSqg3lclTrPQC48D46J2e6f72b4xArlJOO-SSusLTmXdNZ6FznQcBq24UGq3RDxKsHuKoroWXPy" alt="#Stolon" width="210" height="105"></figure>



<ol start="2"><li><a href="https://github.com/sorintlab/stolon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stolon</a></li></ol>



<p>Stolon is another native PostgreSQL management tool designed to make high availability more accessible. It adds features such as native support for Kubernetes and automatic service discovery, allowing multiple database instances to run …</p></div></div>

        <p><a href="https://daniel-lange.com/categories/17-Strategy"><img title="Strategy: Airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value. (Marechal Ferdinand Foch, Professor of Strategy, Ecole Superieure de Guerre)" alt="Strategy" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/strategy.serendipityThumb.jpg"></a></p><p>The Linux Foundation has published its <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report_113020.pdf">annual report</a> today. LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/838871">calls it glossy</a> and yeah, boy, it is shiny.</p>

<p>So shiny that people that work in the publishing industry immediately see this has been produced with the Adobe toolchain which - unfortunately - is one of the big suites of software not yet available for Linux.</p>

<p>Checking the PDF file metadata reveals the keywords "open source, open standards, open hardware, open data". That is what the Linux Foundation is about. Good stuff.</p>

<p><!-- s9ymdb:667 --><img width="552" height="676" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/entries/Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report-2020-cover.jpg" title="Mouseovers are for xkcd!" alt="Linux Foundation annual report 2020 cover"></p>

<p>The PDF producer meta data for the annual report PDF has been set to "Linux kernel 0.12.1 for Workgroups" and the PDF creator meta data element to "Sharp Zaurus XR-5000 (Maemo5) Edition". Somebody thought to better hide the real data and had some tongue-in-cheek ideas. Kudos.</p>

<p>But nicer would have been to use Open Source software to produce the report, not?</p>

<p>Running <code>strings 2020-Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report_113020.pdf | grep Adobe | wc -l</code> gives us 1229 lines and confirms the suspicion of the toolchain.</p>

<p>A stale <code>/Title (Annual Report 2020) /Producer (macOS Version 10.15.7 \(Build 19H15\) Quartz PDFContext)</code> has been forgotten in the document to tell us about the platform.</p>

<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, the Linux Foundation 2020 annual report has been produced on a Mac.</p>

<p>Running Adobe Creative Cloud on MacOS Catalina 10.15.7.</p>

<p>Which is proprietary software. Its kernel (and some userland pieces) are based on BSD. Not Linux.</p>

<hr>

<p>The image on the front page also struck me as a bit odd ... using a ballpoint pen on the laptop screen?</p>

<p>Unbranded laptop.
Unbranded cup in the foreground.</p>

<p>Kid in the background <em>not</em> paying attention to his tablet.</p>

<p>All of that cries stock image so loud it hurts.</p>

<p>Google currently finds ~560 uses of the picture and any <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/support/article/Do-I-need-to-credit-Shutterstock-the-artist-when-I-use-Images-or-Footage">editorial use</a> nicely tells us that it is © <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/g/draganagordic">Dragana Gordic / Shutterstock</a>.</p>

<p>The image is "Smiling mom working at home with her child on the sofa while writing an email. Young woman working from home, while in quarantine isolation during the Covid-19 health crisis".</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8683629/Staff-working-home-nearly-extra-hour-day-research-shows-send-emails.html">Daily Mail</a> for a wonderful example of the working mum in context. I hope, if her laptop had been powered on, it would have run Linux. I mean, what else would still run on an old white MacBook with an Intel "Core 2 Duo" processor from 2008?</p>

<p><!-- s9ymdb:668 --><img width="504" height="742" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/entries/DailyMail-screenshot-stock-image.png" title="O.k., here you go: Shiny, too!" alt="Daily Mail screenshot of the same stock image used"></p>

                </div><div id="extended">
        <p>Bonus round:</p>

<p>The Ethernet port, the USB ports and the headset connector are on the left side of the MacBook. The Daily Mail got it right.</p>

<p>Mirroring images is usually not a good idea. To Linux Foundation's defense ... similar pictures are available <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/image-photo/busy-young-woman-son-home-shot-1680921679">already mirrored on Shutterstuck</a> next to the <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/image-photo/smiling-mom-working-home-her-child-1680923362">correctly oriented picture</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    

<h2 id="why-do-i-care-about-this">Why do I care about this</h2>

<p>Recently I solved <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/396">this</a> delta issue,
where the maintainer asked to switch from Travis CI to GitHub actions.</p>

<p>These are all the pull requests I’ve done if you want to have a look at this journey:
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/399">#399</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/400">#400</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/409">#409</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/411">#411</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/413">#413</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/417">#417</a>
and finally <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/418">#418</a>.</p>

<p>And yes..As you can see I like small incremental work and early feedback instead of giant pull requests. 😁</p>

<p>Anyway, the delta project has a lot of compilation targets and the binaries are automatically released in the
GitHub releases <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/releases">page</a> every time the project is tagged. Sweet. 😌</p>

<p><img src="https://www.marcoieni.com/2020/12/rust-makes-cross-compilation-childs-play/delta.png" alt="delta releases" title="Releases"></p>

<p>From an x86_64 architecture (TLDR: common 64 bit Intel or AMD processors) it is really straightforward to
compile for a different operating system with <code>cargo</code> if you are targeting the same architecture.
For example if you want to compile for macOS you just need to run:</p>

<pre><code>rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo build --target x86_64-apple-darwin
</code></pre>

<p>The problems start to arise when you want to compile for a different architecture, such as i686 (32 bit) or ARM processors.
In this case, you have to install some dependencies and set some environment variables, which may be painful.
For example, in the old continuous integrations scripts of delta,
<a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/blob/15d06cbf7584570ec3b5beaba99cb8898f9ec3dc/etc/ci/before_install.sh">this</a>
was the way dependencies were installed. Ugly, I know. As rust developers we are used to great tools,
so there must be a better way right?</p>

<h2 id="meet-cross">Meet Cross</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>“Zero setup” cross compilation and “cross testing” of Rust crates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the description of the <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross">Cross</a> tool.</p>

<p>The TLDR is that it let you compile and test rust projects for architectures other than i686 and x86_64.</p>

<p>Instead of doing <code>cargo build --target &lt;YOUR_TARGET&gt;</code> you simply do <code>cross build --target &lt;YOUR_TARGET&gt;</code>.
Based on the target, in fact, cross will run a docker image that has all the right dependencies already
installed and configured by the rust-embedded team itself. 😉
And that’s it..just run <code>cargo install cross</code> and you are ready to cross-compile for all
<a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross#supported-targets">these</a> targets in rust, no other dependency
is required, except docker of course!</p>

<p>Obviously this was not an exhaustive overview about cross and I encourage you to have a look at the GitHub page
if you are interested.</p>

<h2 id="cross-in-github-actions">Cross in GitHub actions</h2>

<p>Of course, after a whole morning getting mad trying to setup weird ubuntu dependencies for the delta issue,
when I found out about cross I felt very stupid for not knowing it in advance and I tried to integrate it in the
Continuous Deployment delta pipeline.</p>

<p>It turns out that this is like the easiest thing in the world! The <a href="https://github.com/actions-rs/cargo">action-rs/cargo</a> action
I was already using had built-in <a href="https://github.com/actions-rs/cargo#cross-compilation">support</a> for cross.
Now I even felt more stupid, but anyway..you just need to set the <code>use-cross</code> variable to <code>true</code> and you are done!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta/blob/e198c0d841d9fb660e59e0329235a8601b407c69/.github/workflows/cd.yml#L32-L37">This</a>
is the step that builds the whole delta project for all its different targets..easy, right? 😀</p>

<h2 id="cross-in-rust-github-template">Cross in Rust GitHub template</h2>

<p>You may or (probably) may not be aware of <a href="https://rust-github.github.io/">Rust GitHub Template</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rust GitHub Template is a template for cargo generate that aims to be a starting point suitable for the vast majority of rust projects that will be hosted on GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beyond all its nice goodies, this template will setup Continuous Deployment for you, therefore whenever
you tag your project, it will be published on <code>crates.io</code> and the binaries will be released in the GitHub Releases page,
just like in delta. 😁</p>

<p>Until today, Rust GitHub template only supported x86_64 windows, linux and mac, but after I found out Cross I couldn’t resist
and I added support for i686 and aarch64 linux architectures, which are both two <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">tier 1</a> rust targets.
In practice, this means your “old thinkpad” and “raspberry pi” users will thank you a lot. 😛</p>

is an example of the resulting Continuous Deployment step.</p>

<p>And that was it, after I spent a lot of <em>very useful</em> time trying to setup compilation dependencies basically I just wanted to share my love for the <code>cross</code>
tool with the rest of the world in order to avoid this pain to as many people as possible. 😅</p>

Transcend makes privacy laws easy for engineers and lawyers alike. In that spirit, we've transcribed this law into something easily referenceable.</p></span></p></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><div name="Section1"><h2>SEC. 1. Title.</h2><p>This measure shall be known and may be cited as "The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020."</p></div><div name="Section2"><h2>SEC. 2. Findings and Declarations.<!-- --> </h2><p>The People of the State of California hereby find and declare all of the following:</p><p>A. In 1972, California voters amended the California Constitution to include the right of privacy among the "Inalienable" rights of all people. Voters acted in response to the accelerating encroachment on personal freedom and security caused by increased data collection and usage in contemporary society. The amendment established a legal and enforceable constitutional right of privacy for every Californian. Fundamental to this right of privacy is the ability of individuals to control the use, including the sale, of their personal information.</p><p>B. Since California voters approved the constitutional right of privacy, the California Legislature has adopted specific mechanisms to safeguard Californians' privacy, including the Online Privacy Protection Act, the Privacy Rights for California Minors in the Digital World Act, and Shine the Light, but consumers had no right to learn what personal information a business had collected about them and how they used it or to direct businesses not to sell the consumer's personal information.</p><p>C. That changed in 2018, when more than 629,000 California voters signed petitions to qualify the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 for the ballot. In response to the measure's qualification, the Legislature enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) into law. The CCPA gives California consumers the right to learn what information a business has collected about them, to delete their personal information, to stop businesses from selling their personal information, including using it to target them with ads that follow them as they browse the internet from one website to another, and to hold businesses accountable if they do not take reasonable steps to safeguard their personal information.</p><p>D. Even before the CCPA had gone into effect, the Legislature considered many bills in 2019 to amend the law, some of which would have significantly weakened it. Unless California voters take action, the hard-fought rights consumers have won could be undermined by future legislation.</p><p>E. Rather than diluting privacy rights, California should strengthen them over time. Many businesses collect and use consumers' personal information, sometimes without consumers' knowledge regarding the business's use and retention of their personal information. In practice, consumers are often entering into a form of contractual arrangement in which while they do not pay money for a good or service, they exchange access to that good or service in return for access to their attention, or access to their personal information. Because the value of the personal information they are exchanging for the good or service is often opaque, depending on the practices of the business, consumers often have no good way to value the transaction. In addition, the terms of agreement or policies in which the arrangements are spelled out, are often complex, unclear, and as a result most consumers never have the time to read or understand them.</p><p>F. This asymmetry of information makes it difficult for consumers to understand what they are exchanging and therefore to negotiate effectively with businesses. Unlike in other areas of the economy where consumers can comparison shop, or can understand at a glance if a good or service is expensive or affordable, it is hard for the consumer to know how much his or her information is worth to any given business, when data use practices vary so widely between businesses.</p><p>G. The State therefore has an interest in mandating laws that will allow consumers to understand more fully how their information is being used, and for what purposes. In the same way that ingredient labels on foods help consumers shop more effectively, disclosure around data management practices will help consumers become more informed counterparties in the data economy, and promote competition, Additionally, if a consumer can tell a business not to sell his or her data, then that consumer will not have to scour a privacy policy to see whether the business is, In fact, selling that data, and the resulting savings in time is worth, in the aggregate, a tremendous amount of money.</p><p>H. Consumers need stronger laws to place them on a more equal footing when negotiating with businesses in order to protect their rights, Consumers should be entitled to a clear explanation of the uses of their personal information, including how it is used for advertising, and to control, correct, or delete it, Including by allowing consumers to limit businesses' use of their sensitive personal information to help guard against identity theft, to opt-out of the sale and sharing of their personal information, and to request that businesses correct inaccurate information about them.</p><p>I. California is the world leader in many new technologies that have reshaped our society. The world today is unimaginable without the internet, one of the most momentous inventions in human history, and the new services and businesses that arose on top of it -- many of which were invented here in California. One of the most successful business models for the internet has been services that rely on advertising to make money as opposed to charging consumers a fee. Advertising-supported services have existed for generations, and can be a great model for consumers and businesses alike. However, some advertising businesses today use technologies and tools that are opaque to consumers to collect and trade vast amounts of personal information, to track them across the internet, and to create detailed profiles of their individual interests. Some companies that do not charge consumers a fee, subsidize these services by monetizing consumers' personal information. Consumers should have the information and tools necessary to limit the use of their information to non-invasive, pro-privacy advertising, where their personal information is not sold to or shared with hundreds of businesses they've never heard of, If they choose to do so. Absent these tools, it will be virtually impossible for consumers to fully understand these contracts they are essentially entering into when they interact with various businesses.</p><p>J. Children are particularly vulnerable from a negotiating perspective with respect to their privacy rights. Parents should be able to control what information is collected and sold or shared about their young children and should be given the right to demand that companies erase information collected about their children.</p><p>K. Business should also be held directly accountable to consumers for data security breaches and notify consumers when their most sensitive information has been compromised.</p><p>L. An independent watchdog whose mission is to protect consumer privacy should ensure that businesses and consumers are well-informed about their rights and obligations and should vigorously enforce the law against businesses that violate consumers' privacy rights.</p></div><div name="Section3"><h2>SEC. 3. Purpose and Intent.</h2><p>In enacting this Act, It is the purpose and intent of the people of the State of California to further protect consumers' rights, including the constitutional right of privacy. The implementation of this Act shall be guided by the following principles:</p><h3>A. Consumer Rights</h3><p>1. Consumers should know who is collecting their personal information and that of their children, how it is being used, and to whom it is disclosed, so that they have the information necessary to exercise meaningful control over businesses' use of their personal information and that of their children,</p><p>2. Consumers should be able to control the use of their personal information, Including limiting the use of their sensitive personal information, the unauthorized use or disclosure of which creates a heightened risk of harm to the consumer, and they should have meaningful options over how it is collected, used, and disclosed.</p><p>3. Consumers should have access to their personal information and should be able to correct it, delete it, and take it with them from one business to another.</p><p>4. Consumers or their authorized agents should be able to exercise these options through easily accessible self-serve tools.</p><p>5. Consumers should be able to exercise these rights without being penalized for doing so.</p><p>6. Consumers should be able to hold businesses accountable for falling to take reasonable precautions to protect their most sensitive personal information from hackers and security breaches.</p><p>7. Consumers should benefit from businesses' use of their personal information.</p><p>8. The privacy interests of employees and independent contractors should also be protected, taking into account the differences in the relationship between employees or independent contractors and businesses, as compared to the relationship between consumers and businesses. In addition, this law is not intended to interfere with the right to organize and collective bargaining under the National Labor Relations Act. It is the purpose and intent of the Act to extend the exemptions in this title for employee and business to business communications until January 1, 2023.</p><h3>B. The Responsibilities of Businesses</h3><p>1. Businesses should specifically and clearly inform consumers about how they collect and use personal information and how they can exercise their rights and choice.</p><p>2. Businesses should only collect consumers' personal information for specific, explicit, and legitimate disclosed purposes, and should not further collect, use, or disclose consumers' personal information for reasons incompatible with those purposes.</p><p>3. Businesses …</p></div></div></div></div></section></main></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>The corner of the internet that I read is awash with posts about feature stores: systems that aim to be <a href="https://blog.feast.dev/post/what-is-a-feature-store">“the interface between models and data.”</a></p>

<p>This idea has been around for quite a while, but there are now an increasing number of companies that are building feature store platforms or products–the concept is becoming established in the machine learning system <em>operations</em> arena.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I built a feature store at <a href="https://monzo.com/">Monzo</a>; in light of that, I thought I’d share some of the thinking that motivated my team to need to build one and how I designed it.</p>

<p>As a broad summary: the feature store that I built does not solve for the many different use cases that you may hear about feature store products–our feature store focuses on regularly and safely transferring data between our analytics and production stacks.</p>

<p>Let’s begin!</p>

<h2 id="-isnt-a-feature-store-just-a-database">🤔 Isn’t a feature store just a database?</h2>

<p>Well, yes. But also no.</p>

<p>When I first started talking about the idea of a feature store internally, some feedback that I received was ‘we already do this–we just haven’t been calling them feature stores.’ Indeed, the emphasis of the name “feature store” has often been on the “<strong>store</strong>” aspect, which does make the whole thing sound like it is just a database. The word “<strong>feature</strong>” is often used to mean “some type of data” (e.g., a column in a table).</p>

<p>At Monzo, you can’t look at any corner of our <a href="https://qconlondon.com/london2020/presentation/modern-banking-1500-microservices">production infrastructure</a> without running into the key-value store we use, Cassandra. In our systems, it’s common for each microservice to have its own keyspace, and for individual services to collect, aggregate, and store the different types of data that they need.</p>

<p>We already had two patterns across several systems which looked like “feature stores:”</p>

<ol>
  <li>Services that receive a request, fan out a bunch of calls to other services, and then munge and store the resulting features. For example, we have a system that filters help articles, and caches features about users, who will be actively navigating the content.</li>
  <li>Services that consume events from streams to construct features about different entities. For example, we have a system that consumes events that occur when chat messages are sent and received, and can then serve requests for features about conversations (e.g., the number of turns).</li>
</ol>

<p>What this means is that data across our keyspaces is typically organised around the systems that they serve: we design a system first (e.g., a system for user accounts), and the features it holds follows from that design (data about user accounts).</p>

<h2 id="-whats-different-about-feature-stores">🧐 What’s different about “feature stores?”</h2>

<p>The idea of a feature store is different because it is a system that is meant to prospectively hold a <em>wide diversity</em> of data–nearly anything that could be valuable input to machine learning models. The “features” could even be the output of <em>other</em> machine learning models (predictions or embeddings).</p>

<p>I think this is an important point because this inverts how data is organised in a production system. With a feature store, you can build a separation of concerns between the systems that generate data and the aggregations of that data that are input into ML models. If you want stats about user accounts, you no longer need to know about user account system– you <em>just</em> query the feature store.</p>

<p>The main reason that is often stated for having a centralised place for features is that they are <em>meant to be reused</em> to solve different problems. For example, let’s say that I’m building a feature, like “average number of transactions in the last 7 days.” This feature could potentially be very useful to a whole host of <em>different</em> machine learning models. If we were going to store this data inside of the system that uses it, we may end up:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Having to rebuild the same feature in more than one place, and</li>
  <li>Making it very difficult to discover what features are available for reuse across problems.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="-pause-do-these-two-problems-actually-matter">⏸ Pause: do these two problems actually matter?</h3>

<p>Before I carry on to describe our feature store, I’ll pause to reiterate a word of warning that I mentioned in <a href="http://nlathia.github.io/2020/11/Why-ML-code.html">my last blog post</a>. Building something <em>twice</em> may, at first glance, sound like a waste of time. Folks pitching feature stores often tend to drive home that point. However, in some critical use cases, building something twice can help to validate the system’s correctness.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/danielchatfield">one of our Staff Engineers</a> told me, “the types of mistakes that you can make when writing SQL <em>are very different</em> from the types of mistakes you can make when writing Go.” Reimplementing a feature from SQL to Go provides us with two outputs which we can use for reconciliation: if both spit back the same number, we can be more confident the implementations are correct.</p>

<p>In short: the “only code things once” pitch doesn’t actually work for all use cases.</p>

<p>The second point, regarding discovering features for reuse across problems, is also contentious. You could imagine putting all of your features into a set of wide relational tables. At some point, centralising all of the data would come hand-in-hand with a loss of context about what that data means, and how it should be used. Once you have 1000s of features, a central list of them becomes difficult to navigate.</p>

<p>For example, if you had a feature that describes a user as <code>is_inactive</code>, what does that <em>actually</em> mean, and does that definition fit with the new use case?  How do you ensure that the feature store’s documentation for this remain lined up with the upstream system that is generating the raw data? How do you avoid ending up with multiple implementations of the same <em>concept</em>, expressed as variants of the same code, ad nauseam?</p>

<p>So the “discover all your features” is also a slightly trickier problem that “just put them all in one place.”</p>

<h2 id="-narrowing-down-the-problem-space">🔍 Narrowing down the problem space</h2>

<p>If you open up the website of your favourite company that is offering a feature store, it’s more than likely that they’ll have a list of five to ten (sometimes more!) problems that their feature store solves: integrations, data sources, consistency, monitoring, versioning, meta-data and documentation, training dataset creation, production serving, and so on.</p>

<p><em>It’s mind boggling.</em></p>

<p>Up front, I decided that I had no desire to migrate any of our existing systems to sit behind any kind of centralised “feature store” API. I didn’t want the feature store to become a replacement for things that already existed, or a behemoth that is owned by my (small) team. Instead, I learned about what we needed by looking for patterns in the machine learning models that we were shipping.</p>

<p>Specifically, we didn’t need a feature store until this year, when we ramped up how often we were designing and shipping machine learning models that were trained on tabular data (systems we built prior were very NLP-heavy).</p>

<p>When shipping tabular-based models, we kept finding that many of the features we would input into a model while training it were <em>not</em> readily available in our production infrastructure. A large part of this is because our <a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/monzo">analytics stack</a>, where all of our Data Scientists and Analysts contribute, sits separately from our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/monzo/">production stack</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s a toy example: a customer’s account balance, accurate to this specific moment, is already available in production–so doesn’t need to be in a feature store. <em>But</em> aggregations on a customer’s balance (e.g., a customer’s 7-day average balance) were not, even though these numbers were already available in our <em>analytics</em>, based on SQL queries that Data Scientists had previously written.</p>

<p>We found that we already had an abundance of features in our analytics tables that, if used in production, would specifically be characterised by:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Having values that change “slowly.” These are different types of aggregations, like averages and counts, that we wanted to use, but specifically did not need them to be accurate up to the latest microsecond.</li>
  <li>Being easy to implement in BigQuery SQL, on our historical data, but would be harder (or, more simply, a lot of work) to rebuild and backfill in our production environment.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our problem, therefore, narrowed down to “we need a subset of the numbers, that only exist in our analytics, in production.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first couple of times that anyone in my team ran into this, we queried BigQuery directly from our services, and cached the results. Job done. Over time, the pattern started becoming clearer: we were bound to regularly need this <em>bridge</em> between BigQuery and Cassandra, and didn’t want to rebuild it every single time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This narrowed down the purpose and value-add for a building a feature store in our system: <em>enabling</em> the safe reuse of slow-changing features from our analytics, in production.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="-our-analytics-feature-store">🏪 Our analytics feature store</h2>

<p>What we have today is a system that automates the journey of shipping features between our analytics (BigQuery) and production (Cassandra) databases.</p>

<p>The process starts with a Data Scientist writing some SQL, as they usually do. They tag it as a query that builds a feature table. These tables are automaticaly scheduled and generated alongside all of our other analytics tables, at varying frequencies (daily, hourly, etc.), using Airflow. We use <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a>, and so each query will be written with <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests/">tests</a>.</p>

<p>By design, feature tables must specificy a <code>subject_type</code> column. This defines the entity that the feature described, such as a “user” feature or a “sort code” feature. The table must also have a corresponding <code>subject_id</code>, which is the actual ID of the user for that row. The schema of this table is replicated in the feature store Go service, because we do not want it to “blindly” ingest data.</p>

<p>The creation of feature tables is monitored: a cron jobs regularly checks whether those tables should be sync’ed into Cassandra. A table should be sync’ed if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It has been recreated (compared to the last time it was sync’ed), and;</li>
  <li>It passes data validation tests (i.e., it doesn’t accidentally have garbage in it);</li>
</ul>

<p>When a table needs to be sync’ed, it gets partitioned into batches and then exported as line-delimited JSON into …</p></div></div>

            <p>Earlier today, I had the misfortune of reading a blog post about the dangers of the decentralized web and how we should not partake in or encourage it's development. Hacker News had a pretty <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25312854" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">active discussion</a> about the post.</p><p>Ideological takes on this always turn ugly, and I'm at a point in my life where I avoid that at all costs. I can only talk about my preferences about the world, not about how things ought to be, implying some sort of inherent value or divine moral good.</p><p>Here's what I prefer: a world where ideas, no matter how silly or dangerous, are allowed to be expressed, shared, ignored, attacked and laughed at. I don't imagine a world like this can ever exist easily, but a more decentralized web can help us get halfway there.</p><h3 id="ok-so-what-about-gurlic-then">Ok so what about Gurlic then?</h3><p><a href="https://gurlic.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Gurlic</a> is roughly just over two months old now, and at a point where I am relatively comfortable with the basic features it has. In the coming weeks and months, I want to focus on modifying the backend to either adopt an existing decentralized protocol, or think about how to approach writing a new one. Perhaps it would have been smarter to do this before building it first, but that would have limited how I envisioned Gurlic to be and it would've turned out differently.</p><p>Right now I'm looking into the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">activitypub</a> spec, and the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">matrix</a> spec - here are some initial thoughts I have about how Gurlic should approach decentralization/federation.</p><ul><li><p>Decentralization can be a priority, but must never be promoted as a feature, or made to be a selling point. When decentralization becomes the main selling point of a product or service, the usability and polish tend to suffer. Not always, but nearly always. None of the marketing copy should include the words 'decentralization', 'privacy' etc. <strong>Normal users don't care about any of this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>User experience should be seamless. The user shouldn't have to generate a key, remember an extra password, remember weird URL schemes, or download utilities and clients just to be part of an online community or to write an article. Above all, the user must not be confused, as one usually is when looking at Mastodon instances, which one to sign up to, and so on. My mom should be able to use it without having to call me, just like she does with Facebook. <strong>Normal users do care about this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The protocol must be flexible enough to allow for all of Gurlic's current features. This means communities, user profiles, publications, articles, galleries, rich media posts, sharing/responding and so on. All seamlessly without any rough edges.</p></li><li><p>Any and all cryptocurrency/blockchain must be avoided.</p></li></ul><p>I'll have more to write about this in the near future.</p>

<p>How many psychiatrists does it take to change a lightbulb?</p>



<p>It’s a dumb joke, and I’ll let you suffer through it. But first, let’s talk about relationships.</p>



<p>Every relationship is more than just two people. There is an unspoken middle ground called the <em>relationship system</em>, a constantly evolving construct defined by the interactions between two people. In other words: how I act influences you, and how you behave affects me. Relationship systems have a memory, and past events color how we see each other. A good relationship system can produce trust, shared experience, and so much more. And when people have problems with each other, it’s usually best to start looking at flaws in the relationship system before trying to find fault in either party.</p>



<p>How do you improve a relationship? You have some control over your own behaviors, a little control over the relationship system, and absolutely no control over the other person.</p>



<p>To strengthen relationships, it helps to understand what I call <em>the cardinal rule of mental health</em>: your only real option to improve any situation is to change your behavior. That doesn’t mean that everything is your fault. It’s an acknowledgment that you wait for something unexpected to happen, change your approach, or leave. But you’ll never, ever, be able to force real change in someone else. You can ask them for change, support them, antagonize them, or even cut them off. No one strategy works in every situation. And yet all reasonable options start and end with you.</p>



<p>I’m not trying to minimize the capacity for change in others. I am fundamentally optimistic about our capacity to improve, despite the very real forces of <a href="https://feelbetterlater.com/why-is-it-so-hard-to-change/">ambivalence and habit</a>. There are reasons why we do what we do, and reasons we want to do better. A good therapist digs deep to uncover motivation, but they can’t build on something that isn’t there. It’s rare outside of therapy to have the permission, skill, and safety to probe others this way. Instead, you get to decide if you can tolerate what’s happening right now.</p>



<p>That is the textbook definition of a boundary: “you can’t do this to me and expect our relationship to continue as it is.” How do you enforce a boundary? By changing your part in the relationship. You don’t have the power to do anything else.</p>



<p>How many psychiatrists does it take to change a lightbulb? How many people does it take to have a positive influence? One. But some small part of the lightbulb has to want to change itself. You don’t have to spend the rest of your life clinging to lightbulbs that refuse to budge. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Sometimes people ask me what they should learn to become a better programmer. I feel like the default recommendation here is usually an obscure programming language or a textbook on some high-powered machinery like ML. So I always feel a little bit embarrassed and boring when I instead suggest going really deep on what you already know: your main programming language, web framework, object-relational mapper, UI library, version control system, database, Unix tools, etc. It’s not shiny or esoteric, but for me, building a detailed mental model of those (and how they compare to alternatives) might be the learning that’s contributed most to my effectiveness as an engineer.</p><p>A coworker coined the phrase “blub studies” to refer to this sort of mundane, ultra-specific-seeming knowledge. “Blub” comes from a Paul Graham essay, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank">Beating the Averages</a>, in which Blub is a hypothetical middlebrow language whose programmers get defensive when Graham asserts that Lisp is superior. Blub studies is the study of what goes on in the guts of these boring, everyday systems—not the kind you get tenure for inventing, but the kind people actually use.</p><p>Blub studies is a never-ending treadmill of engineering know-how. It’s the fiddly technical details of how Git stores data, or how Postgres locking semantics <a href="https://gocardless.com/blog/zero-downtime-postgres-migrations-the-hard-parts/" target="_blank">caused your migration to bring down prod</a>, or why <code>pip install</code> failed <em>this</em> time. It’s what goes on inside the boiler rooms of your computer. There’s a seemingly infinite amount of it, full of bespoke details for you to stumble over, and that makes it, often, unbelievably frustrating. Experts in shiny fields like machine learning write shiny-sounding articles like <em><a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/01/31/a-theory-of-the-learnable/" target="_blank">A theory of the learnable</a></em>; experts in blub studies emit screeds like <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/" target="_blank">The Law of Leaky Abstractions</a> and <a href="https://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks" target="_blank">Programming Sucks</a>.</p><p>In short, if you’re in search of generalizable knowledge that <a href="https://fs.blog/2019/02/compounding-knowledge/" target="_blank">compounds exponentially over time</a>, then blub studies looks like the crap you have to wade through to get to the good stuff. So it’s easy to see why people give up on understanding all the blub they’re surrounded by, except what they need to get the job done.</p><p>But for me, the opposite attitude has been more productive. <a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/post/computers-can-be-understood/" target="_blank">Computers can be understood</a>—even if it’s hard and takes a while. Blub studies is more generalizable than it seems, and has its own way of compounding over time, too. That makes it a lot more useful than you’d expect.<sup><label for="sn0">✻</label><span><span><sup>✻</sup>
Of course, there are useless parts of blub studies: if this essay gets you excited to memorize a bunch of command-line flags, consider <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/" target="_blank">reversing this advice</a>. But in my experience, it’s more common to neglect the useful parts of blubs, than to over-index on trivia.</span></span></sup></p><hr><p>The most straightforward benefit of blub expertise is that it saves you time. <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1305214228991750144" target="_blank">“You can’t apply those brilliant insights you learned from SICP if you don’t have the knowledge base and emotional fortitude to fight through <code>pip install</code> first."</a> If you know how Git’s internal model works, you can get your repository out of its borked state without spending hours on Stack Overflow.</p><p>This effect is larger than it might seem. If you’re working with a system you don’t understand, you’re limited to debugging via guess-and-check, which can be arbitrarily slow. A more efficient method would be to <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1265360282513281025?lang=en" target="_blank">get as much information as possible about your program’s execution</a> and then use that information to exclude most of the hypothesis space. But this requires a good understanding of both the system, and the tools available for inspecting it. If you’re tracking down, say, a networking problem, staring at some <code>tcpdump</code> output will often get you most of the way there, but only if you know how to interpret it and what to look for.</p><p>If you spend half your programming time debugging, and being a blub expert lets you debug twice as fast, then just the speed gain from blub expertise will let you increase your output by a third.<sup><label for="sn1">†</label><span><span><sup>†</sup>
If you think “half of programming time debugging” sounds high, imagine how much faster you’d be if all your code worked the first time.<p>Doubling debugging speed is probably a conservative estimate—you can save pretty much unlimited time via things like <a href="http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/10/14/lag/" target="_blank">“hmm, 40 milliseconds sounds like the timeout for Nagle’s algorithm, try setting <code>TCP_NODELAY</code>”</a>. I somewhat frequently debug tricky things 5x+ faster than coworkers, just because I’ve been working with our stack for a long time, so I know where to look for problems and how to quickly test hypotheses.</p></span></span></sup> That justifies a lot of time staring at <code>tcpdump</code> output! But there are also more subtle reasons I’ve gotten so much from blub studies. It’s both more general, lasts longer, and has more of a compounding effect, than I expected.</p><hr><p>Blub studies are surprisingly broadly applicable because, even if you’re learning about the details of some specific blubby system, that system’s design will contain a juicy non-blubby core of extractible general principles. Unlike many “general principles” people try to teach you, the ones you learn via blub studies are guaranteed to be important to at least one real-world system (the one you’re learning about). And you’ll see them realized in all their messy detail, which academic presentations often leave out.</p><p>Suppose your blub of choice is React. You might worry that learning the gory details will be useless if you ever move to a different part of the stack, or even a different web framework. And, yes, some of them will. But the core idea of React—writing pure render functions, using <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html" target="_blank">reconciliation</a> to make updates fast—is extremely powerful and general. In fact, it’s now been copied by the next generation of UI frameworks on both iOS (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/" target="_blank">SwiftUI</a>) and Android (<a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose" target="_blank">Jetpack Compose</a>). Learning the principles behind React makes it easier to learn those other frameworks. In fact, it can even be a useful source of ideas to “import” from one to the other. At Wave, for instance, we’ve gotten a lot of mileage out of importing ideas from <a href="https://relay.dev/" target="_blank">Relay</a> into our mobile apps.</p><p>This is a good example of an idea that, as far as I know, you can <em>only</em> learn about through blub studies. Academia didn’t give much attention to React-style UI programming. In fact, it doesn’t seem to view user-interface programming paradigms as a particularly interesting object of study at all. People do sometimes publish on it but, for instance, I couldn’t find any courses on it in MIT’s extensive course catalog.<sup><label for="sn2">‡</label><span><span><sup>‡</sup>
You could argue that this is because UI programming is “too applied” and one shouldn’t expect it to be covered in an academic curriculum. But computer science covers many other equally-“applied” areas, like networking, databases, operating systems, and graphics.</span></span></sup></p><hr><p>Blub studies also compound more than you’d naively expect, in two ways. First, knowing about one blub makes it easier to learn about alternative blubs that serve the same purpose—like the React/SwiftUI example above. Second, knowing more about one blub helps you learn blubs in <em>adjacent</em> parts of the stack more quickly.</p><p>Once, while pair programming with a more junior coworker, we were writing a complicated SQLAlchemy query. My coworker used <code>user.name</code> (the <code>name</code> field of an object stored in the <code>user</code> variable) instead of <code>User.name</code> (the <code>name</code> field of the <em>class</em> <code>User</code>) and was wondering why her query gave the wrong results. I tried to explain the “magic” by which <code>User.name</code> was an instance of <code>Column</code> while <code>user.name</code> was a simple <code>str</code>. I went around in circles for a little while until I eventually explained Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html" target="_blank">descriptor protocol</a> to her (the language feature SQLAlchemy uses to enable the “declarative” ORM syntax). At that point, everything clicked—and I realized that Python’s <code>__dunder__</code> methods are the key to decoding quite a lot of “magical” seeming code. If you learn the Python language features well, lots of complicated libraries will become a lot easier to understand.</p><p>I had a similar experience myself with Kubernetes. The first time I tried to learn it, it was a bewildering morass of jargon—all those namespaces and containers and Pods and Deployments and Services and Ingresses just to get a simple HTTP server running! Then I read <a href="http://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/" target="_blank">a networking textbook</a> and everything made much more sense. The (arguably) most complicated parts of Kubernetes exist to solve networking-related problems—allowing hundreds of containers to talk to each other independently while hosted on a much smaller set of computers—so the networking textbook gave me a schema onto which I could hang all my Kubernetes factoids. Once I knew how Linux’s IP routing, iptables, and network namespaces worked, it was much easier for me to understand what exactly something like “kube-proxy” was doing.</p><p>If you know enough different blubs, you can end up at the point where you don’t even need to look things up to figure out how they’re (probably) implemented. An experienced Python programmer can guess immediately how SQLAlchemy’s “declarative” ORM works under the hood. That’s the point when your blub expertise will really start compounding—almost as soon as you start working with something new, you’ll start figuring out how it works and extracting the kernel of generally-interesting ideas.</p><hr><p>Because of this compounding effect, the most important step toward becoming a blub master is to kickstart your “blub flywheel”—the virtuous cycle of blub accumulation—however you can. That means starting with whichever blubs are the easiest or most motivating to learn, and branching out from there. For me, the easiest place to start has been with blubs I’m already using at my day job. I have a couple strategies for getting the most out of those.</p><p>First, I’ll try to <em>go deeper than necessary</em>. If I really want to ship something, it’s easy to give into temptation to, say, Google an error message, copy-paste a fix from Stack Overflow, and move on with my day. But it often doesn’t take that much longer to actually read the error message, understand what it means, and try to figure out <em>why</em> that Stack Overflow answer fixed my problem. Similarly, if I’m stuck in a tricky yak shave, I’ll bias against “guess-and-check” style …</p></article></div>

          <p>List comprehensions are a more meaningful and efficient way to generate lists in python. A list comprehension provides a concise way to create a list using a for loop.</p>

<p>Mostly problems that are tackled with list comprehensions can also be implemented using a normal for loop, but with a list comprehension, code quantity is less and efficient.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Generating a list with for loop</h2>

<pre><code>fruit = "apples"
newlist = []

for char in fruit:
    newlist.append(char)
    
print(newlist)             #['a', 'p', 'p', 'l', 'e', 's']</code></pre>

<p>This for loop iterates over the characters in "apples" and them to a list, newlist. But this is too much code for such a simple task, we can achieve this easily and concisely with list comprehensions.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Generating a List with list comprehensions</h2>

<pre><code>fruit = "apples"
newlist = [char for char in fruit]
           
print(newlist)    #['a', 'p', 'p', 'l', 'e', 's']</code></pre>

<p>You can see that a list comprehension creates a list more easily and concisely than using only a for loop.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>Suppose you have a list of fruits, and you want to create a new list containing only the fruits which have an 'e' in it:</p>

<p><strong>with a for loop only, </strong></p>

<pre><code>fruits = ["apple", "banana","date", "orange", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = []

for fruit in fruits:
    if "e" in fruit:
        newlist.append(fruit)
        
print(newlist)        # ['apple', 'date', 'orange', 'cherry']</code></pre>

<p>This can also be achieved in List comprehensions with the use of <strong>filters</strong>.</p>



<h2>Filtering list comprehensions</h2>

<p>Filters in list comprehensions are just conditions(if else elif) in a list comprehension.</p>

<p>The above process of creating a new list with fruits having the letter 'e' can be simplified as</p>

<pre><code>fruits = ["apple", "banana","date", "orange", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]

newlist = [fruit for fruit in fruits if "e" in fruit]
        
print(newlist)        # ['apple', 'date', 'orange', 'cherry']</code></pre>



<p>If you want a list of fruits that have more than 5 letters:</p>

<pre><code>newlist = [fruit for fruit in fruits if len(fruit) &gt; 5]
print(newlist)        # ['banana', 'orange', 'cherry']</code></pre>



<p>If you want a new list containing the fruits in uppercase:</p>

<pre><code>newlist = [f.upper() for f in fruits]
print(newlist)        # ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'DATE', 'ORANGE', 'CHERRY', 'KIWI', 'MANGO']</code></pre>



<p><strong>More Examples:</strong></p>

<p>To create a new list containing the squares of numbers in another list:</p>

<pre><code>nums = [2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 4, 12, 3]

squares = [i*i for i in nums]
print(squares)                # [4, 9, 1, 25, 36, 16, 144, 9]</code></pre>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br>
To generate a list containing the squares of even numbers in another list:</p>

<pre><code>nums = [2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 4, 12, 3]

squares = [i*i for i in nums if i%2==0]
print(squares)                # [4, 36, 16, 144]</code></pre>



<h2>Functions and List comprehensions</h2>

<p>With list comprehensions,<span> you can generate a list from the values returned from a function</span>. Let's take a look at a function that takes in a person's name and returns it in uppercase with a greeting:</p>

<pre><code>def greet(name):
    greeting = "Hello " + name.upper()
    return greeting

people = ["John", "Doe", "Prince", "Abdul", "Isaac"]

greet_everyone = [greet(p) for p in people]

print(greet_everyone)</code></pre>

<p><strong>output</strong></p>

<pre><code>['Hello JOHN', 'Hello DOE', 'Hello PRINCE', 'Hello ABDUL', 'Hello ISAAC']</code></pre>

<p>It was in the ’90s and shareware was still cool. I had written a couple of small shareware programs and I was worried about bugs related to dates and times.</p>

<p>So I wrote a new program called DateDesist.</p>

<p>DateDesist allowed me to test how my program would behave on specific dates. It was a fairly simple command line program. What it did was change the date on the machine, execute the program to be tested, wait a few seconds, then restore the date and exit.</p>

<p>It worked incredibly well for testing date-based shareware and making sure that programs expired when they were intended to.</p>

<p>I found it useful for my own testing and wanted to release it for other developers. So I package it up and released it on a bunch of shareware sites such as Tucows, SoftSeek and Freeware Home.</p>

<p>Sometime later I went looking for a <em>crack</em> for a piece of software that I was having trouble getting. I pulled up HotBot (my preferred search engine at the time) and quickly found what I was looking for. I downloaded the archive and took a look at the files inside.</p>

<p>There, I found the typical readme file with a short description of the program it was intended to crack and some ASCII art with the name of the cracking crew. Also included was a copy of my original DateDesist executable and a batch file to launch the target program on a specific date.</p>

<p>Now curious, I searched the web again for other cracks made by the same crew. To my surprise DateDesist had been used in dozens, maybe hundreds, of different cracks that were released by this group. I checked other cracks from other groups on the same sites and found DateDesist used in a significant number of them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5423" role="main"><div><div><div><p>A new (and non peer-reviewed) <a href="https://www.royalpanda.com/ca/most-intelligent-gamers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study conducted by online gambling company Royal Panda</a> compared the IQ scores of video gamers on number of categories.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>The company had a team of psychologists administer an online IQ test to a sample of 1,001 gamers. The results will doubtless infuriate some, and assuage others.</p><h2>IQ scores by gaming system: PC vs. PlayStation vs. Xbox vs. Nintendo vs. “mobile”</h2><p>Their study revealed that PC gamers had the highest IQ scores among the gaming platforms tested, with an average IQ of 112.3. Next came users of the <a href="https://amzn.to/33P8Msn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">PlayStation</a>, whose average IQ was 110.7. Xbox users took third place with an average IQ of 103.8, followed by Nintendo Switch users with 101.3. In fifth and last place was the vague category of “mobile gamers,” who averaged 99.4 on the IQ test.</p><p>The test was broken down into four categories: verbal intelligence, mathematical ability, logical reasoning, and visual reasoning. PC gamers took the top spots in verbal intelligence and mathematical ability, while PlayStation users won in logical reasoning and visual reasoning. <a href="https://amzn.to/3ghd9BK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Xbox users</a> took third place in all four categories, and pulling up the rear, again, were the Nintendo Switch users and “mobile gamers.”</p><h2>IQ scores by choice of game: Rainbow Six Siege takes first place</h2><p>The survey also ranked 15 popular games by their users’ IQ scores. The winning game was T<em>om Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege</em> — its players had an average IQ score of 120.3. They were followed close behind by players of <em>Among Us </em>(IQ of 118.9) and <em>Minecraft </em>(116.3). In last pace were <em>Sage Candy Crush</em> (IQ of 96.4) and <em>Angry Birds</em> (95.8).<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>In between, in descending order, were: <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare </em>(average IQ of 111.2), <em>EA Sports FIFA </em>(106.5), <em>Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout </em>(105.8), <em>Animal Crossing </em>(104.8), <em>Fortnite </em>(103.6), <em>Mariokart </em>(99.9), <em>Grand Theft Auto </em>(99.6), <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>(99.6), and <em>Rocket League </em>(99.3).</p><h2>Ranking IQ by operating system</h2><p>The study also found that Android gamers have higher IQs than iOS (iPhone and iPad) gamers. The average IQ score among study participants whose main mobile device runs on Android was 110.3, and the IQ score for iOS users was a mere 102.1.</p><p>On the other hand, the study also found that gamers who use Apple Mac computers had slightly higher IQ scores than Windows users (108.2 vs 106.7). One explanation for this finding is that there are many more Windows users than Mac users. In fact, the survey included six times more Windows users than Mac users.&nbsp; And that larger sample of Windows users might just be more accurately reflecting the great variety in IQ scores in general.</p><h2>Female gamers smarter than male gamers</h2><p>In addition, the study also revealed that female gamers had substantially higher IQ scores than male gamers. The average IQ of the female gamers was 108.4, versus the male average of 102.3. The female participants also got higher average scores on each of the four sub-scales: verbal intelligence, mathematical ability, logical reasoning, and visual reasoning.</p><p>The study does not indicate the ratio of male to female participants who took part in the research. Likewise, it omits lots of other key demographic information that you would expect such a study to include. For example, the study says nothing about the location, age, or education levels of its participants.</p><p>Nonetheless, despite its rather non-scientific nature (no peer review, no mention of the study’s authors or affiliations, no demographic information on the participants), this study is still an interesting look at some of the putative differences in intelligence between various groups of gamers.</p><p>In fact, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=nl&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=video+games+and+intelligence&amp;btnG=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the links between video games and intelligence</a> have become a topic of increasing popularity in academic research over the past few years.

You'll find other helpful articles, detailed tutorials, and videos in this all-things-Serverless content collection. New articles from community members and cloud advocates are published every week from Monday to Thursday through September. </p>
<p>Find out more about how Microsoft Azure enables your Serverless functions at <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/?WT.mc_id=servsept20-devto-cxaall">https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/</a></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Serverless functions are microservices which run on preconfigured servers that scale according to demand. Serverless functions are used to perform tasks such as running chatbots and database sanitization.</p>
<p>Azure and Firebase both offer serverless functions as part of their cloud offering. Firebase functions can be seen as part of Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I tested the code on this article directly on GCP. You should obtain the same results if you go through Firebase. We would compare the speed, ease of development and ease of deployment of serverless functions than run on Azure and Google Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="computation-speed">Computation Speed</h2>
<p>When comparing the execution speed, we must note that one machine running the function may be closer to us than the other. We must also note that different machines are used to execute the function. Therefore, we would run the function several times, then calculate the percentage range of their results.</p>
<p>We would use this long-running task function in both scripts</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>longRunningTask</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span>(<span>(<span>resolve, reject</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    <span>const</span> start = <span>new</span> <span>Date</span>();

    <span>let</span> a = <span>0</span>;
    <span>for</span> (<span>let</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; <span>90000000</span>; i++) {
      a += i;
    }

    <span>const</span> end = <span>new</span> <span>Date</span>() - start;
    resolve(end / <span>1000</span>);
  });
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="serverless-function-on-google-cloud">Serverless function on Google Cloud</h3>
<p>Here's the function that will execute on gcloud.</p>
<pre><code>{Add longRunningTask <span><span>function</span> <span>here</span>}

<span>exports</span>.<span>longRunningFunction</span> = <span>async</span> (<span>req, res</span>) =&gt; </span>{

  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span>(<span>(<span>resolve</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    <span>const</span> loopCount = req.query.loopCount || <span>10</span>
    <span>const</span> runTimes = [];

    <span>for</span> (<span>let</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; loopCount; i++) {
      longRunningTask()
        .then(<span>(<span>data</span>) =&gt;</span> {
          runTimes.push(data);
        })
        .catch(<span>(<span>error</span>) =&gt;</span> {
          <span>console</span>.error(error);
        });
    }

    resolve(runTimes)
  }).then(<span>(<span>data</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    res.status(<span>200</span>).send(data);
  })
};
</code></pre>
<p>Ensure you set your entry point as <code>longRunningFunction</code></p>
<h3 id="serverless-function-on-azure">Serverless function on Azure</h3>
<p>Below is the function that will execute on Azure</p>
<pre><code>{Add longRunningTask <span><span>function</span> <span>here</span>}

<span>module</span>.<span>exports</span> = <span>async</span> <span>function</span> (<span>context, req</span>) </span>{
  <span>const</span> runTimes = [];

  <span>for</span> (<span>let</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; <span>10</span>; i++) {
    longRunningTask()
      .then(<span>(<span>data</span>) =&gt;</span> {
        runTimes.push(data);
      })
      .catch(<span>(<span>error</span>) =&gt;</span> {
        <span>console</span>.error(error);
      });
  }

  context.res = {
    <span>body</span>: runTimes,
  };
};
</code></pre>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Running these functions and testing their results on <a target="_blank" href="https://repl.it/@Vicradon/relative-range#index.js">this repl</a> gives this result</p>
<pre><code><span>Azure</span>
<span>Min:</span> <span>0.278</span>

<span>Percentage Range:</span> <span>108</span><span>%</span>
<span>GCloud</span>
<span>Min:</span> <span>0.619</span>
<span>Max:</span> <span>0.705</span>
<span>Percentage Range:</span> <span>12</span><span>%</span>
</code></pre><p>From the result, we can conclude that azure runs the function faster than google cloud.</p>
<p>Status
Azure: 1
GCloud: 0</p>
<h2 id="ease-of-development">Ease of development</h2>
<p>In this section, we compare how easy it is to write, test and debug functions on the two platforms. Azure offers an intuitive interface for editing and testing functions.</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/w0unsgnvqtvpzq5of6vz.png" alt="Azure function development interace"></p>
<p>GCloud's interface doesn't allow for immediate testing. You must redeploy a function after edits are made.</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/x4xwpgq3wzmpnorg8b6n.png" alt="Google cloud functions edit interface"></p>
<p>Status:
Azure: 2,
GCloud: 0</p>
<h2 id="ease-of-deployment">Ease of deployment</h2>
<p>Deploying functions on these platforms depends on your deployment pipeline. If we solely compare deployment using the dashboard, we can conclude that they are both intuitive. So we have a tie.</p>
<p>Status:
Azure: 3,
GCloud: 1</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, we made an attempt to compare the speed, development and deployment of serverless functions on Google Cloud and Azure. Using the metrics above, we can conclude that working with serverless functions on Azure gives you a better experience than Google Cloud. This isn't the absolute conclusion. We didn't consider a whole lot of metrics. But this can be a start. Thank you for reading. ✌🏽🧡</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Now and then, when you click on a link on a website, the link will be opened in a new tab, but the old tab will also be redirected to some other phishing website where it asks you to login or starts downloading some malware to your device. In this blog post, I will explain how something like this is achieved, and how to easily prevent this from happening in your own websites. </p>
<p>We see values like <code>noopener</code>, <code>noreferrer</code> and <code>nofollow</code> attached to <code>rel</code> attribute of <code>anchor</code>(<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) tags. We usually see these values along with <code>target=_blank</code>. Many of us do not know what each of the value means, and what happens when we set or do not set any of the values. In this blog post, I will explain what these values mean, and also explain what set of values to use for anchor tags in your website.</p>
<p>Before diving into the post, let's see what security implications will be there when you set <code>target="_blank"</code> on an anchor tag in your website.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span>=<span>"https://google.com"</span> <span>target</span>=<span>"_blank"</span>&gt;</span>Google<span>&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When you create a hyperlink in the above way on your website with no <code>rel</code> attribute, clicking on it will open <a href="http://google.com/" target="_blank">google.com</a> in a new tab. But there are some security risks in doing so. There is a property called <code>window.opener</code> which is set to the window of the opening tab, in this case, your website. </p>
<p>Let's see more of what I mean here in detail below.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you have a link in <a href="https://hashnode.com/@hashnode">Hashnode</a> with the target set to <code>_blank</code>, but no <code>rel</code> attribute, then <code>window.opener</code> property in the opened tab(new tab) is automatically set to the window of the opening tab(<code>Hashnode</code> tab). </p>
<p>Phishing attacks are often carried out in this way. Since the new tab has now access to the window of the previous tab, the new tab can set the location of the old tab using <code>window.opener.location.href = 'link-of-some-fake-site-that-looks-almost-same-as-original-site'</code>, and a login page can be shown in that fake site saying "<strong>You have been logged out, please reenter your login credentials to login</strong>". Then if the user doesn't check that the domain name has changed and enters the login credentials, the attacker will now have access to the user's login details to <strong>Hashnode</strong> site. The fake site may also make you download malware on to your device. <strong>See the code in below section if you do not yet understand properly of what I mean.</strong></p>
<p>This popular attack which a lot of websites are a victim to is called <code>Reverse Tabnabbing</code>.</p>
<p>So, what is the solution to this? The solution is very simple. You just have to set the <code>rel</code> attribute of your <code>anchor</code> tag to <code>noopener</code> whenever there is <code>target="_blank"</code> set. What this means is simple, when you click on the link, it opens the page in a new tab, and also <code>window.opener</code> value in the new tab is set to <code>null</code>. Now, the new link has no access to the tab that this new link is opened from.</p>
<p>Let's see in detail what each of the values mean and also see what values you should use in your website.</p>
<h3 id="noopener">noopener</h3>
<p>When you set this value along with <code>target=_blank</code>, you are instructing the browser to open the link in a new tab, but do not give access to the page that opened it(<code>window.opener = null</code> in new tab).</p>
<p>I don't see any use-case where you would ever want to give access to the <code>window</code> of your website to some other external website. So it is always best to have <code>noopener</code> value in the <code>rel</code> attribute of your anchor tag, whenever you set the <code>target</code> to <code>_blank</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span>=<span>"some-external-link"</span> <span>target</span>=<span>"_blank"</span>&gt;</span>Some External Website<span>&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code>
<span>&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span>window</span>.opener.location.href = <span>'link-to-some-phising-website-that-looks-almost-same-as-your-own-website'</span>
</span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>To prevent the above attack, you just have to add <code>rel=noopener</code> to your link.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span>=<span>"some-external-link"</span> <span>rel</span>=<span>"noopener"</span> <span>target</span>=<span>"_blank"</span>&gt;</span>Some External Website<span>&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code>
<span>&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;</span><span>

<span>window</span>.opener.location.href = <span>'link-to-some-phising-website-that-looks-almost-same-as-your-own-website'</span>

</span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="noreferrer">noreferrer</h3>
<p><code>noreferrer</code> is very much similar to its function as <code>nopener</code>. This also prevents the newly opened site to manipulate the window of the opening tab.(<code>window.opener</code> will be set to <code>null</code>). The extra thing that <code>noreferrer</code> will have in addition to <code>noopener</code> is that it will hide the referrer information when the link is clicked. For example, if you have a link to your website with <code>noreferrer</code> and <code>target="_blank"</code>, then when the user clicks on that link, they will be taken to your website, but your website will not have access to where the users coming from. Your analytics software like <code>Google Analytics</code> will consider these users as direct traffic and not as a referral. </p>
<p>Based on this explanation, I hope you have a clear idea of what <code>noreferrer</code> means and when to use it and when not to use it. If you don't want to pass on any referrer information to the external links, then consider using <code>noreferrer</code> value, otherwise do not use it. </p>
<p>You will often see the anchor tags with both <code>noopener noreferrer</code>. Since <code>noreferrer</code> also does what <code>noopener</code> is doing, why to have <code>noopener</code> along with <code>noreferrer</code>. This is mainly to support old browsers. Some of the old browsers do not support <code>noopener</code> value, so whenever you want to use <code>noopener</code>, you also see people using <code>noreferrer</code> value along with it.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span>=<span>"some-external-link"</span> <span>rel</span>=<span>"noopener noreferrer"</span> <span>target</span>=<span>"_blank"</span>&gt;</span>Some External Website<span>&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="nofollow">nofollow</h3>
<p>To have good SEO on your website, it is crucial to have backlinks to your website. All links are not equal in value. Some will be valued more than others. Search engines use something called <code>Page Ranking</code> algorithm to determine the value of a link or website. When you link another website from your website, you are endorsing that other page, so the value of other page will be increased in proportion to what value your website has. Similarly, the value of your website is determined by the backlinks that are pointed to your website, and again all the values of all the backlinks are not the same. I will talk more about Google's Page Ranking algorithm, and in detail in some other blog post. Let's just get back to what setting <code>rel=nofollow</code> value to your link means.</p>
<p>When you set <code>nofollow</code> to a link in your website, you are telling Google that you are not endorsing the link and also telling it not to pass the page rank value of your website to it. </p>
<p>You will typically use <code>nofollow</code> when linking to internal pages or when you are linking to a less valuable site from your more valuable site.</p>
<p>Google recently introduced some other values like <code>rel=sponsored</code>, <code>rel=ugc</code> etc, which are out of scope for this blog post. </p>
<pre><code>
<span>&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span>=<span>"some-external-link"</span> <span>rel</span>=<span>"nofollow"</span> <span>target</span>=<span>"_blank"</span>&gt;</span>Some External Website<span>&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can even set the three values to <code>rel</code> attribute.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span>=<span>"some-external-link"</span> <span>rel</span>=<span>"noopener noreferrer nofollow"</span> <span>target</span>=<span>"_blank"</span>&gt;</span>Some External
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can(and probably should) use rel="noopener" on all links that have <code>target="_blank"</code>.</li>
<li>rel="noreferrer" does the same thing as <code>noopener</code> especially in older browsers which do not support <code>noopener</code>. In addition to it, setting rel="noreferrer" will affect analytics of the external website.</li>
<li>You should use rel="nofollow" when you don't want to endorse links on your websites. This affects the SEO of the external website.</li>

<![CDATA[Running Erlang Releases Without EPMD on OTP 23.1]]>

December 5, 2020 | https://blog.erlware.org/epmdlessless/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.erlware.org/epmdlessless/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <div>
        <p>Erlang/OTP deployments that want to provide shell access or cluster nodes relied
on something called the Erlang Port Mapper Daemon (EPMD), a separate process
that handled all distribution mechanisms. Previous attempts at working around
this requirement used third party dependencies such as
<a href="https://github.com/tsloughter/epmdless">epmdless</a> and required specific
configuration arguments to the VM to setup. This was not ideal and was easy to
get wrong.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.erlang.org/news/141">Erlang/OTP 23.1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/erlware/relx/releases/tag/v4.2.0">relx 4.2</a> (included in <a href="https://blog.erlware.org/epmdlessless/">Rebar3 3.14.3</a>) it is now possible
to conveniently run Erlang releases without relying on EPMD for opening a
remote shell or clustering nodes. This is particularly going to make Erlang releases
simpler to configure in locked down environments, and easier to use with containers.</p>
<p>EPMD is a separate process that is started, if
not already running, when an Erlang node boots with distribution enabled –
meaning <code>-sname</code> or <code>-name</code> is passed to the boot command. The new node <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_dist_protocol.html#epmd-protocol">talks to
the EPMD process</a> to register its name with a port that the node will also bind
to. When a node wants to connect to another one it must look up the port the other
node is listening on through EPMD. This is required both for
clustering nodes together and connecting a remote shell on the command line –
which is essentially the same as clustering because a new node is started before
attaching to the remote node to bring up a shell on that node.</p>
<p>Bypassing EPMD has been made possible through a couple new options added to <code>erl</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/c21bbb6136a1f4d343c3cf53476107e78221a68f"><code>-erl_epmd_port P</code></a>: Configures the port this node will listen on and use when
connecting to remote nodes.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/7a7c90be0e87cb3b4920de5aaf215c4b9cebcb30"><code>-dist_listen false</code></a>:
Setting this keeps the node from binding to the port, preventing it from
acting as a server, and instead uses the port only for connecting to remote
nodes. The use case for this is when opening a remote shell <code>-remsh &lt;node&gt;</code>
(<code>remote_console</code> in the release script) to a local node.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/61b1ad3c57f4e92fb9b55f97b9ffd9dee80067e2"><code>-[s]name undefined</code></a>:
Passing <code>undefined</code> for the short or long name of a node generates a unique node
name and sets additional flags, <code>-dist_listen false -hidden -dist_auto_connect never</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>An extra option has also been added to <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl_call.html"><code>erl_call</code></a> :</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/ce4fcf0640d81a268c15af339a888406b757ced5"><code>-address P</code></a>:
Sets the address and/or port to connect to the running Erlang node. This
removes the need to look up the remote node or to even specify its name when
running <code>erl_call</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/3a57ed212befae5d0e03569408849e8a72122911"><code>-R</code></a>: Tells <code>erl_call</code> to use a dynamic random name for the hidden node it starts.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of OTP 23.1+ the <code>relx</code> generated release script uses <code>erl_call</code> instead of
the custom <code>escript</code> <code>nodetool</code> when the commands <code>rpc</code> and <code>eval</code> are used to
run code on a running node.</p>
<p>These options are used automatically by the release shell script when starting a
node, opening a remote shell or interacting with the running node through <code>rpc</code>
and <code>eval</code>. The only change you as a user must make to run your release without
<code>epmd</code> is to set the OS environment variable <code>ERL_DIST_PORT</code>.</p>
<p>When <code>ERL_DIST_PORT</code> is set in the environment the option to not start EPMD
(<code>-start_epmd false</code>) is added to the <code>erl</code> arguments automatically, along with
<code>-erl_epmd_port ${ERL_DIST_PORT}</code>. The <code>ERL_DIST_PORT</code> is also used by
<code>erl_call</code> with <code>-address ${ERL_DIST_PORT}</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tsloughter/epmdlessless">epmdlessless</a> is an example project
that comes with a
<a href="https://github.com/tsloughter/epmdlessless/blob/main/docker-compose.yml">docker-compose.yml</a>
setup that makes it simple to play with these new features. Note that no changes are
required to <code>vm.args.src</code> to disable EPMD or set a port to use, the only
configuration done is through the environment variable <code>ERL_DIST_PORT</code> in
<code>docker-compose.yml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    ...
    environment:
      - ERL_DIST_PORT=8001
    ...
</code></pre><p>Note that each node must listen on the same port because setting
<code>-erl_epmd_port P</code> tells Erlang both what port to listen on and what port to use
when connecting to other nodes.</p>
<p>After cloning the repo, build the Docker image and start 3 nodes (<code>node_a</code>, <code>node_b</code>, <code>node_c</code>):</p>
<pre><code>$ docker-compose up
</code></pre><p>Then, use <code>docker exec</code> to open a remote shell on <code>node_a</code> and connect to
<code>node_b</code> (be sure to disconnect from the remote shell with <code>Ctrl-g</code> followed by
<code>q</code>, if you use <code>q().</code> it will shutdown the remote node):</p>

<p>It is important to note that this requires every node to listen on the same
port, which requires every node to have its own IP. If this isn’t an option, or
for whatever reason you need to use separate ports for nodes, then <a href="https://github.com/tsloughter/epmdless">epmdless</a>
is an option to replace EPMD and track the node to port mapping. But if you are
running with containers in an environment like Kubernetes you can now keep EPMD
from running in each container by simply upgrading Erlang and Rebar3, and
setting the <code>ERL_DIST_PORT</code> environment variable.</p>

<p>Security researchers are alarmed: the already-notorious Trickbot malware has been spotted probing infected computers to find out which version of UEFI they're running. This is read as evidence that Trickbot has figured out how to pull off a really scary feat.</p>
<p>To understand why, you have to understand UEFI: a fascinating, deep, philosophical change to our view of computers, trust, and the knowability of the universe. It's a tale of hard choices, paternalism, and the race to secure the digital realm as it merges with the physical.</p>
<p>Computers were once standalone: a central processing unit that might be augmented by some co-processors for specialized processes, like a graphics card or even a math co-processor.</p>
<p>These co-pros were subordinate to the CPU though. You'd turn on the computer and it would read a very small set of hardcoded instructions telling it how to access a floppy disk or other storage medium for the rest of the boot sequence, the stuff needed to boot the system.</p>
<p>The hardwired instructions were in a ROM that had one job: wake up and feed some instructions to the "computer" telling it what to do, then go back to sleep. But there's a philosophical conundrum here.</p>
<p>Because the world of computing is adversarial and networked computing is doubly so: there are people who want your computer to do things that are antithetical to your interests, like steal your data or spy on you or encrypt all your files and demand ransom.</p>
<p>To stop this, you need to be able to examine the programs running on your computer and terminate the malicious ones. And therein lies the rub: when you instruct your computer to examine its own workings, how do you know if you can trust it?</p>
<p>In 1983, Ken Thompson (co-creator of C, Unix, etc) was awarded a Turing Award ("computer science's Nobel Prize"). He gave a fucking bombshell of an acceptance speech, called "Reflections on Trusting Trust."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf</a></p>
<p>Thompson revealed that he had created a backdoor for himself that didn't just live in Unix, but in the C compiler that people made to create new Unix systems.</p>
<p>Here's what that means: when you write a program, you produce "high-level code" with instructions like "printf("Hello, World!");". Once your program is done, you turn it into machine code, a series of much shorter instructions that your CPU understands ("mov  dx, msg" etc).</p>
<p>Most programmers can't read this machine code, and even for those who can, it's a hard slog. In general, we write our code, compile it and run it, but we don't examine it. With nontrivial programs, looking at the machine code is very, very hard.</p>
<p>Compilers are treated as intrinsically trustworthy. Give 'em some source, they spit out a binary, you run the binary. Sometimes there are compiler bugs, sure, and compiler improvements can be a big deal. But compilers are infrastructure: inscrutable and forgotten.</p>
<p>Here's what Thompson did: he hid a program in his compiler that would check to see whether you were compiling an operating system or a compiler. If you were compiling an OS, it hid a secret login for him inside of it.</p>
<p>If you were compiling a compiler, it hid the program that looked for compilers or operating systems inside of it.</p>
<p>Think about what this means: every OS you compiled had an intentional security defect that the OS itself couldn't detect.</p>
<p>If you suspected that your compiler was up to no good and wrote your own compiler, it would be compromised as soon as you compiled it. What Thompson did was ask us to contemplate what we meant when we "trusted" something.</p>
<p>It was a move straight out of Rene Descartes, the reasoning that leads up to "I think therefore I am." Descartes' "Discourse on the Method" asks how we can know things about the universe.</p>
<p>He points out that sometimes he thinks he senses something but is wrong – he dreams, he hallucinates, he misapprehends.</p>
<p>If all our reasoning depends on the impressions we get from our senses, and if our senses are sometimes faulty, how can we reason at all?</p>
<p>Descartes wants a point of certainty, one thing he <em>knows</em> to be absolutely true. He makes the case that if you can be certain of one thing, you can anchor everything else to this point and build up a massive edifice of trustable knowledge that all hangs off of this anchor.</p>
<p>Thompson is basically saying, "You thought you had descartesed your way into a trustable computing universe because of the axiom that I would never poison your lowest-level, most fundamental tools.</p>
<p>"<em>Wrong</em>.</p>
<p>"Bwahahahaha."</p>
<p>(But, you know, in a nice way: an object lesson to serve as a wake-up call before computers fully merged with the physical world to form a global, species-wide digital nervous system whose untrustworthy low-level parts were foolishly, implicitly trusted).</p>
<p>But processors were expensive and computers were exploding. PCs running consumer operating systems like Windows and Mac OS (and more exotic ones like GNU/Linux and various Unices) proliferated, and they all shared this flawed security model.</p>
<p>They all relied on the operating system to be a faithful reporter of the computer's internals, and operated on the assumption that they could use programs supervised by the OS to detect and terminate malicious programs.</p>
<p>But starting in 1999, Ken Thompson's revenge was visited upon the computing world. Greg Hoglund released Ntrootkit, a proof-of-concept malware that attacked Windows itself, so that the operating system would lie to antivirus programs about what it was doing and seeing.</p>
<p>In Decartesspeak, your computer could no longer trust its senses, so it could no longer reason. The nub of trust, the piton driven into the mountainface, was made insecure and the whole thing collapsed. Security researchers at big companies like Microsoft took this to heart.</p>
<p>In 2002, Peter Biddle and his team from Microsoft came to EFF to show us a new model for computing: "Trusted Computing" (codenamed "Palladium").</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020805211111/https://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2002/jul02/0724palladiumwp.asp">https://web.archive.org/web/20020805211111/https://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2002/jul02/0724palladiumwp.asp</a></p>
<p>Palladium proposed to give computers back their nub of Descartesian certainty. It would use a co-processor, but unlike a graphics card or a math co-pro, it would run before the CPU woke up and did its thing.</p>
<p>And unlike a ROM, it wouldn't just load up the boot sequence and go back to sleep.</p>
<p>This chip – today called a "Secure Enclave" or a "Trusted Platform Module" (etc) – would have real computing power, and it would remain available to the CPU at all times.</p>
<p>Inside the chip was a bunch of cool cryptographic stuff that provided the nub of certainty. At the start of the boot, the TPM would pull the first stages of the boot-code off of the drive, along with a cryptographic signature.</p>
<p>A quick crypto aside:</p>
<p>Crypto is code that mixes a key (a secret known to the user) with text to produce a scrambled text (a "ciphertext") that can only be descrambled by the key.</p>
<p>Dual-key crypto has two keys. What one scrambles, the other descrambles (and vice-versa).</p>
<p>With dual-key crypto, you keep one key secret (the "private key") and you publish the other one (the "public key"). If you scramble something with a private key, then anyone can descramble it with your public key and know it came from you.</p>
<p>If you scramble it <em>twice</em>, first with your private key and then with your friend's public key, then they can tell it came from you (because only your private key's ciphertexts can be descrambled with your public key).</p>
<p>And <em>you</em> can be certain that only they can read it (because only their private key can descramble messages that were scrambled with their public key).</p>
<p>Code-signing uses dual-key crypto to validate who published some code.</p>
<p>Microsoft can make a shorter version of its code (like a fingerprint) and then you scramble it with its private key. The OS that came with your computer has a copy of MSFT's public key. When you get an OS update, you can descramble the fingerprint with that built-in key.</p>
<p>If it matches the update, then you know that Microsoft signed it and it hasn't been tampered with on its way to you. If you trust Microsoft, you can run the update.</p>
<p>But…What if a virus replaces Microsoft's public keys with its own?</p>
<p>That's where Palladium's TPM comes in. It's got the keys hardcoded into it. Programs running on the CPU can only ask the TPM to do very limited things like ask it to sign some text, or to check the signature on some text.</p>
<p>It's a kind of god-chip, running below the most privileged level of user-accessible operations. By design, you – the owner of the computer – can demand things of it that it is technically capable of doing, and it can refuse you, and you can't override it.</p>
<p>That way, programs running even in the most privileged mode can't compromise it.</p>
<p>Back to our boot sequence: the TPM fetches some startup code from the disk along with a signature, and checks to see whether the OS has been signed by its manufacturer.</p>
<p>If not, it halts and shows you a scary error message. Game over, Ken Thompson!</p>
<p>It is a very cool idea, but it's also very scary, because the chip doesn't take orders from Descartes' omnibenevolent God.</p>
<p>It takes orders from Microsoft, a rapacious monopolist with a history of complicity with human rights abuses. Right from that very first meeting the brilliant EFF technologist Seth Schoen spotted this (and made the Descartes comparison):</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021004125515/http://vitanuova.loyalty.org/2002-07-05.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20021004125515/http://vitanuova.loyalty.org/2002-07-05.html</a></p>
<p>Seth identified a way of having your cake and eating it too: he proposed a hypothetical thing called an "owner override" – a physical switch that, when depressed, could be used to change which public keys lived in the chip.</p>
<p>This would allow owners …</p></div></article></div>

<hr>

<p>Most serious programmers have heard of Donald Knuth,
the man who coined the term <em>analysis of algorithms</em> in 1968
and pioneered many of the computer science fundamentals we use today.
Knuth is perhaps most famous for his ongoing magnum opus,
<em>The Art of Computer Programming</em>.</p>

<p>When the first volume of TAOCP was released that same year,
it was printed the way most books had been since the turn of the century:
with <em>hot metal</em> type.
Each individual letter was cast from molten lead,
then arranged into its line.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Matrixcase-bembo-16pts.jpg" alt="Monotype matrix case" height="400">
<figcaption>
A case of letter molds—or <em>matrices</em>—used by the Monotype caster,
the most commonly-used machine for printing books in the days of hot metal type.
Its main contemporary, the Linotype, molded entire lines at a time,
and was often used for printing newspapers.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These lines were clamped together to form pages of the book,
which were finally inked and pressed against paper.
By March of 1977, Knuth was ready for a second run of TAOCP, Volume&nbsp;2,
but he was horrified when he received the proofs.
Hot metal typesetting was an expensive, complicated, and time-consuming process,
so publishers had replaced it with phototypesetting,
which works by projecting characters onto film.
The new technology, while much cheaper and faster,
didn’t provide the same level of quality he had come to expect.</p>

<p>The average author would have resigned themselves to the change and moved on,
but Knuth took great pride in print quality,
especially for the mathematics in his books.
Around this time, he discovered an exciting new technology:
digital typesetting.
Instead of working with metal or film,
letters and shapes were built from tiny dots,
often packed together at over 1,000 per inch.
Inspired by this burgeoning tech and frustrated with the current state of affairs,
Knuth set off on one of the greatest yak shaves of all time.
For years, he paused all work on his books to create his own
digital typesetting system.
When the dust settled in 1978, Knuth had the first version of
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It’s hard to understand how much of a revolution <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was,
especially looking back from a time where anybody with a copy
of Word can be their own desktop publisher.
Adobe’s PDF wouldn’t exist for another decade, so Knuth
invented a device-independent format, DVI.
Scalable fonts were uncommon at the time, so Knuth created a system,
<span>METAFONT</span>
, to rasterize his characters into dots on the
page.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
Perhaps most importantly, Knuth and his graduate students designed algorithms
to automatically hyphenate and justify lines of text into
beautifully-typeset paragraphs.</p>

<p>Here is where the timelines diverge.
In one, <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was just the beginning.
Computer typography evolves rapidly as the decades go by,
building on Knuth’s prior work and
taking advantage of the million-fold increases we’ve seen in computing power.
Browsers, e-readers, and word processors deliver beautiful type
to every person who looks at a screen, with almost no effort from authors.</p>

<p>In the darker timeline… none of this happens.
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 is still some of the best we’ve got for computer typesetting.
It’s seen some impressive improvements,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
but its core hasn’t changed much in decades.
To this day,
it doesn’t lay out more than one page at a time because 1980s computers didn’t
have enough RAM to do any better.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>
Almost no other software—except for a handful of professional layout
programs like Adobe InDesign—leverages any of the advances
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 made in line breaking and hyphenation.
Layout in Word, browsers, and even e-readers is a sad joke.</p>

<figcaption>
State of the art text layout in today's browsers. Mind the gaps.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I’m not sure what to make of this.
Maybe most people, outside a small cadre of designers and
enthusiasts, just don’t care about typography very much.
After all, the human brain is incredibly good glossing over minor details and
im<span>p</span>erfections when reading.
But even the design world seems largely unaware or indifferent to Knuth’s work.
Despite collaborations with famous type designers like Hermann Zapf,
you’ll find no mention of him in renowned books and documentaries on
the subject.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>
And parametric font families—just like the ones <span>METAFONT</span>
 offered in 1983—are
heralded in 2017 as “a new era of type design”.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>
It’s bizarre.</p>

<p>Good typography can make almost anything more enjoyable to read,
and it feels like such a shame that better layout isn’t
available to the masses
when so much of the groundwork was laid almost forty years ago.
In an age when the average American reads from a screen they keep in their pocket
dozens of times a day,
and where each one of those devices holds more processing power than you could
fit in several rooms back when Donald Knuth
wrote <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
, surely we can—and <em>should</em>—do better.</p>

But since there is no page reload, <code>window.onload</code> event does not get triggered for subsequent navigation.

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://itsopensource.com/"><code>itsopensource.com</code></a> blog is built using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">gatsby</a>, we wanted to add google analytics to this, but instead of using google tag manager, we tried to restrict what <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tsl143/itsopensource/blob/master/src/html.js#L32">data</a> is sent to google and in this process, we need to send XHR request on every page load. We created a function <code>sendTelemetry</code> and called it on <code>window.onload</code>. This works as expected (partially), whenever the page is loaded the XHR is sent, but gatsby do not reload the page while changing the URL when any blog link is clicked, so XHR is sent only once per session and not on subsequent page loads.<br>Javascript does not provide any native listener to path change (not hashchange).</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>The <code>history</code> API maintains complete the navigation state. Whenever a new page is navigated <code>history.pushState</code> is called and page is added to the state. That means this event is called whenever the URL changes. We hooked our function on this, and done :)</p>

        The Note is a gap analysis document.
        It identifieds the next steps
        for enabling
        Wide Color Gamut (WCG)
        and
        High Dynamic Range (HDR)
        on the Open Web Platform.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The initial commercial application of Color Science
        (principally colorimetry, rather than color appearance modelling)
        to the reproduction of color
        was concerned with surface colors
        such as painted or printed objects,
        lit by a single illuminant.
        The achievable luminance range was thus constrained
        to the luminance of a perfect diffuse reflector
        (practically, an unprinted sheet of good paper)
        at the high end,
        and the densest printed or painted black
        that could be achieved without the paper tearing or deforming,
        at the darkest end. This produced luminance ranges
        from as low as 20:1
        to as high as 90:1 (Fairchild, p.399 [[Fairchild-CAM]]).
        The achievable Chroma range was also limited
        by the vibrancy of mass-produced paints and inks,
        and the prohibitive cost of using additional spot colors
        to extend the gamut.
        <!-- add UCS diagram of coated and uncoated FOGRA21 and 39 -->
        Self-luminous displays, in that commercial environment,
        were primarily used at low luminances
        for soft proofing of an eventual printed product,
        and were intended to replicate the appearance of a viewing booth.
      </p>

      <p>Over time, self-luminous displays were seen
        as a worthy color management target in their own right:
        for computer displays,
        for the display of digital photography,
        for digital cinema,
        and for the consumption of media such as television and movies in the home.
        The luminance range increased:
        media consumed in near-dark environments such as the cinema
        could have much deeper blacks,
        while media consumed in dim to normal viewing environments
        enjoyed an increased peak white luminance of 200 to 300 cd/m².
        The darkest blacks in such environments were constrained by viewing flare,
        which is why the sRGB standard mandated a viewing flare of 5%,
        typical for glossy glass CRT displays of the time;
        coupled with a peak luminance of only 80cd/m²
        the luminance range was still relatively modest.
        The introduction of matt LCD and OLED screens,
        and the commercial success of HDTV, increased the dynamic range somewhat,
        but it was still comfortable encoded in 8 bits per gamma-corrected component.
        This is referred to as <b>Standard Dynamic Range (SDR)</b>.
        The achievable Chroma range for sRGB and Rec.709 HDTV, although extending beyond that of printed material at the primaries, was also relatively modest.
        Wider gamut displays were available professionally,
        covering most of the Adobe 1998 RGB™ colorspace,
        but wre typically not found in a home or office environment.
        <!-- sRGB gamut on UCS diagram -->
      </p>

      Commercial availability of displays covering the Display P3 gamut
      (a derivative of DCI P3 used for digital cinema,
      but altered to account for a non-dark viewing environment,
      with an sRGB transfer curve ,and D65 white point)
      meant that <b>Wide Color Gamut (WCG)</b> displays became commonplace
      on laptops, external monitors, mobile phones, and even watches.
      WCG requires a modest increase in the
      number of bits per gamma-corrected component,
      from 8 to 10 or 12 (for the widest gamut
      in common use for content delivery,
      Rec.2020).

      <p>The deployment of 4k and then 8k television,
      accompanied by digital content delivery,
      brought not only a similarly increased color gamut
      to the media space, but also a greatly increased dynamic range
      of 4000:1 or more.
      Increased phosphor efficiency and purity,
      together with bright and modulatable backlights,
      brought <b>High Dynamic Range (HDR)</b> into widespread use.
      Computers, however, remained limited to SDR for the most part.</p>

      <p>
        The human visual system can,
        with appropriate adaptation,
        function over an enormous luminance range —
        from starlight or moonlight at 0.01 cd/m² and  0.1 cd/m²,
        through the dim lighting at dawn and dusk (10 cd/m²),
        office lighting (100 cd/m²),
        modern displays (800 cd/m²),
        overcast daylight (1,000 cd/m²),
        bright daylight (10,000 cd/m²)
        and full direct sunlight (100,000 cd/m²).
        However, the full range cannot be simultaneously percieved
        in the same scene
        at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two main
        systems defined for HDR video:
        Hyprid Log Gamma (HLG), developed by BBC and NHK, and
        Dolby Perceptual Quantizer (PQ).
        While improvement in video quality has driven the innovation of HDR,
        support for content on the web more generally, e.g., for static images,
        the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element, and in CSS in general, is still
        needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add a brief description of PQ and HLG approaches, including: use of
        metadata, absolute vs relative brightness, proprietary vs open standard,
        etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The BBC has published a frequently-asked questions document
        [[hdr-hlg-faq]] that gives a high level introduction to HDR, and the
        PQ and HLG solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fredrik Hubinette from Google has written a useful document
        [[hdr-chrome]] that discusses the issues with presenting, and in
        particular compositing, SDR and HDR content. This was presented at
        TPAC 2017. It considers both PQ and HLG. (<a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/11/07-colorweb-minutes.html">minutes
          of the TPAC 2017 meeting</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
        On the web, SDR, and HDR content using both HLG and PQ is expected to
        coexist, potentially within the same page, as authors can include
        arbitrary content in their web pages. An example is a page that contains
        multiple embedded videos, or their poster images. This raises the
        question of how to composite content with different color spaces and
        dynamic range encodings.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        Support for HDR and WCG on the web is important to allow color and
        luminance matching between HDR video content and surrounding or
        overlaid graphic and textual content in web pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some specific goals include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ensure support for HDR encoded video as a first class citizen on the
          web, including both HLG and PQ, with appropriate rules defined for
          composition of content.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enable support for HDR static images, texual content, and graphics
          rendered via Canvas or SVG.
        </li>
        <li>
          Promote understanding of HDR graphics issues among the web developer
          community.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are a number of specifications potentially impacted by HDR.
        One of the purposes of this document is to identify all documents that
        are possibly affected, so that we can review them and determine any
        changes needed.

      <h2>Specifying Colors in Web Pages</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>CSS Color Module</h3>
        <p>
          CSS defines several ways of specifying the colors to use in web
          pages, in the CSS Color Module specifications. The current Recommendation is
          Level 3 [[css-color-3]], and its successor, Level 4, is becoming stable
          and starting to be implemented [[css-color-4]].
          The various methods in Level 4 cover WCG but not HDR, and are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>sRGB (Red, Green, Blue), using the <code>rgb()</code> and <code>rgba()</code> functions</li>
          <li>Named colors, from early HTML and X11, e.g., 'aqua', 'black', 'blue', 'fuchsia', etc</li>
          <li>HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness), using the <code>hsl()</code> and <code>hsla()</code> functions</li>
          <li>(*) HWB (Hue, Whiteness, Blackness), using the <code>hwb()</code> function</li>
          <li>(*) Lab and LCH (Lightness, Chroma, Hue), using the <code>lab()</code> and <code>lch()</code> functions</li>
          <li>(*) Profiled, device-dependent colors:
            <ul>
              <li>predefined colorspaces: <code>display-p3</code>, <code>a98-rgb</code> (compatible with Adobe® RGB (1998)), <code>prophoto-rgb</code>, <code>rec-2020</code> </li>
              <li>calibrated colorspaces, using <code>@profile</code> to link to an ICC profile.
              This is not limited to RGB: <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-4/#cal-cmyk">CMYK and wide-gamut print spaces</a> are also covered.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Items marked (*) are new in Level 4. <code>rgb()</code>,
          <code>named colors</code>, <code>HSL</code> and <code>HWB</code>
          all resolve to sRGB. The others are WCG.
          To date, all of these are SDR colorspaces.</p>
        <p>
          Section 12 in [[css-color-4]] is titled "Working Color Space", and
          currently empty. It is intended to cover compositing multiple colorspaces.
          There is as yet no consensus on whether this should be per-document or a per-element property;
          nor on whether a single value is appropriate for all operations.
          We need to define how should compositing work, if
          there is HLG, PQ, and SDR content present. The [[hdr-chrome]]
          discussion document provides useful input. This will require defining
          where black, media/paper white, and peak whites (full-screen and small-area hilights)
          map in the various spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The draft CSS Color Module Level 4 [[css-color-4]],
          adds WCG support. Rec. 2020 is covered, but only for SDR.
          The range of CIE Lightness (in Lab and LCH)
          is not constrained to 100,
          and a figure of 400 …</p></section></section></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In the classical world, it is quite common that we could make an exactly the same copy of something. However, in the quantum world, the laws of physics impose a severe restriction on copying: It is impossible to make a perfect copy of an unknown state.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the No-Cloning Theorem in quantum theory.</p>

<h4 id="kronecker-product-inverse-transpose-property">Kronecker Product Inverse-Transpose Property</h4>

<p>Conjugate transposition are distributive over the Kronecker product:</p><p>

\[(A \otimes B)^{\dagger} =  A^{\dagger} \otimes B^{\dagger}\]

\[\begin{align}
(A \otimes B)^{\dagger} &amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    A_{0,0}B &amp; A_{0,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{0,n-1}B \\
    A_{1,0}B &amp; A_{1,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{1,n-1}B \\

\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    \overline{A_{0,0}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,0}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,0}}B^{\dagger} \\
    \overline{A_{0,1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,1}}B^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    \overline{A_{0,n-1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,n-1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,n-1}}B^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix}

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="no-cloning-theorem">No-Cloning Theorem</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics, copy, as it is the same to other quantum operators except measurement operators, is an reversible and linear operator.</p>



<p>Given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the copy operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to copy the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before copy.</p><p>

\[| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle \xrightarrow[]{U} | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>We would like to write this transformation into equation.</p><p>

\[U (| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the copy operator.</p><p>

\[U (| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | \psi \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Note that for $| \psi \rangle$ we also used $|x\rangle$ which $| \phi \rangle$ is using, meaning that before copy, the â€œvacantâ€� system is always the same. This is something we could guarantee.</p>



<p>We examine the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ using the copy property and all the properties in the prerequisite section.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) \\
&amp;= \big(U (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |)\big) \big(U (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)\big) \\
&amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle \phi |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)^{\dagger} (| \phi \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | \psi \rangle^{\dagger}) (| \phi \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \otimes (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle$ is scalar, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Solving the above equation, we have $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum copy operator that makes copy of any unknown state.</p>

<h3 id="more-restrict-no-cloning-theorem">More Restrict No-Cloning Theorem</h3>

<p>In quantum theory, $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$, where $c$ is a non-zero complex number, represent the same physical state. If $|c \phi|^2 = 1$, then $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$ only have phase difference.</p>



<p>For example, $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ have exactly the same probability of collapsing to $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$. However, $| \phi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_1$ while $| \psi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_2$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \phi \rangle &amp;= \cos \frac{\theta}{2} | 0 \rangle + e^{i\varphi_1} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} | 1 \rangle \\
| \psi \rangle &amp;= \cos \frac{\theta}{2} | 0 \rangle + e^{i\varphi_2} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} | 1 \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>More restrict No-Cloning Theorem states that â€œcopyingâ€� any unknown state while abandoning the phase is not possible either.</p>



<p>Suppose we have such â€œcopyâ€� operator, the mathematical expression for â€œcopyâ€� will be as follows.</p><p>

\[U (| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = e^{\varphi} | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\\
U (| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = e^{\varphi^{\prime}} | \psi \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Similarly, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= e^{\varphi} e^{\varphi^{\prime}}\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
&amp;= e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}} \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The norm of the two sides should be equivalent.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle| &amp;= |e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}} \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}}| |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= 1 |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle |^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Solving the above equation, we have $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum â€œcopyâ€� operator that makes â€œcopyâ€� of any unknown state that has lost the phase information.</p>

<h3 id="transportation">Transportation</h3>

<p>Since it is not possible to do copy in quantum world, how about transportation?</p>



<p>Concretely, given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the transportation operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to transport the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before transportation.</p><p>

\[U(| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | x \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>Note that although it is called transportation, it is more like a switch, where the two system states, one unknown and one known, got switched.</p>



<p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the transportation operator.</p><p>

\[U(| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | x \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Similarly, we compute the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) \\
&amp;= \big(U (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |)\big) \big(U (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)\big) \\
&amp;= (\langle x | \otimes \langle \phi |) (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)^{\dagger} (| x \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | \psi \rangle^{\dagger}) (| x \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle^{\dagger} | x \rangle ) \otimes (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \\
&amp;= \langle x | x \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= 1 \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
  
      <p>C and C++ as languages have a few things separating them from each other, mostly in their minute details and, occasionally, larger feature sets like designated initializers. But there is a disturbingly high amount of C++ that can simply do C’s job far better than C<!--more-->, including when it comes to solving some of the biggest problems facing the evolution of C and C++.</p>

<p>Let’s take a contemporary problem plaguing both C and C++, affecting everyone from standard library maintainers to project developers, that has been going on for the last 20 or so years: <code>intmax_t</code>.</p>



<p>The concept behind <code>intmax_t</code> is simple enough: it is the largest integer type that your implementation and its standard library support in conjunction. Here is a few things <code>intmax_t</code> controls inside the implementation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>numeric literals are preprocessed according to what <code>intmax_t</code> can handle (C and C++);</li>
  <li>it is the maximum number of bits that can be printed portably, e.g. with <code>printf("%j", (intmax_t)value)</code> (C and C++);</li>
  <li><code>intmax_t</code> is the largest type for which <code>std::numeric_limits</code> applies, including most types up to and including that type (C++ only);</li>
  <li><code>intmax_t</code> underpins <code>std::chrono</code>’s casts and similar (e.g. no information is lost during conversions out of and into the system) (C++ only);</li>
  <li>and, there are a set of integer operations provided by the standard library (like absolute value and quotient / remainder operations) that can be done with the maximum bit precision available to the implementation (C and C++).</li>
</ul>

<p>These properties forge the basis of <code>intmax_t</code>’s purpose. Lossless storage, pass-through operations, and more can all be achieved by relying on this implicit contract of the type. Since it is a type definition, the “real” integer type underneath it can be swapped out and people relying on it can be upgraded seamlessly!</p>



<p>We cannot upgrade seamlessly.</p>

<p>C has a much higher commitment to not breaking old code and keeping “developers close to the machine”. What this actually translates to for most Application Binary Interfaces is very simplistic “name mangling” schemes (i.e., none), <a href="https://twitter.com/__phantomderp/status/1329960075096694790">weak linkers</a>, and other shenanigans. The end result is that we expose C developers to platform details that become invisible dependencies for their code that must be preserved at all costs. For example, let’s take a C Standard function that uses <code>intmax_t</code>, <code>imaxabs</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>intmax_t</span> <span>imaxabs</span><span>(</span><span>intmax_t</span> <span>j</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and, let’s try to figure out how we can upgrade someone off of this usage without breaking their code too badly. We will try fixing this in both C and C++.</p>



<p>Taking <code>intmax_t</code>, let’s do a no-brainer usage case: calling a function with <code>intmax_t</code> input and return types. The syntax and usage ends up looking like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>intmax_t</span> <span>original</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>intmax_t</span><span>)</span><span>-</span><span>2</span><span>;</span>
	<span>intmax_t</span> <span>val</span> <span>=</span> <span>imaxabs</span><span>(</span><span>original</span><span>);</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span>val</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Easy enough! But, there’s also a hidden dependency here, based on how the code is compiled. While many people compile their C standard library as a static library and only generate final binary code for what they use as to have a “self-contained” binary, the vast majority of the shared ecosystem depends on shared libraries/dynamically linked libraries for the standard. This means that when a program is milled through an operating system at program startup, the “loader” runs off to find the symbol <code>imaxabs</code> inside some system library (e.g., <code>/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.27.so</code> for an “amd64” system). Harmless enough, right? Well, it turns out to be a bit of a problem in practice, because the name <code>imaxabs</code> is all that’s used in C to figure out what subroutine to talk with in some shared library,</p>

<p>and that name is completely inadequate.</p>

<p>Consider the following scenario:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The glibc maintainers decide they’re going to change from <code>long long</code> as their <code>intmax_t</code> and move to <code>__int256_t</code> for most platforms, because most platforms support it and they have a lot of customers asking for it.</li>
  <li>They upgrade the <code>libc</code> to its next version for various Linux distribution, and everyone links against it when they look for the default <code>libc</code>.</li>
  <li>You have an application. Your code was not changed or updated, so it was not recompiled. It calls <code>imaxabs</code>. The argument it passes is a <code>long long</code>, because that was the type at the time you last compiled and shipped your software.</li>
  <li>The <code>imaxabs</code> used to lookup the function to call finds the version that takes a <code>__int256_t</code> in the new <code>libc</code>.</li>
  <li>Different registers are used to pass and return the function value than expected by the <code>imaxabs</code> function call in the <code>libc</code> binary, because your application is in <code>long long</code> mode but glibc expects a <code>__int256_t</code>.</li>
  <li>All hell breaks loose.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is one of the manifestations of what is called an “Application Binary Interface (ABI) Break”. ABI Breaks are generally undetectable, silent breaks that occur within the runtime of a program that completely destroy any dependency your program has on that functionality for correctness. It typically happens when a subtle detail – the registers used to negotiate a large integral value between a shared library and its application, the amount of padding a structure might have on a certain build, the ordering and layout of class members, the interpretation of bits even if the layout or passing convention of a type never changes, and even more – changes.</p>

<h2 id="but-c-is-abi-stable">“But C Is ABI-Stable?!”</h2>

<p>Not necessarily. C is a simple language, and it both sells itself on and prides itself as such. So much so, that it’s even part of the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2021.htm">language’s rolling charter</a>. There’s barely any name mangling because there’s no overloading. If you want “virtual functions” you need to hand-craft your virtual table structure and initialize it yourself. There’s barely any lookup or entity negotiation: what you write – <a href="https://twitter.com/thingskatedid/status/1328918322507706368">however scary or cursed</a> – is what you get, in a general sense. (No, it’s not “portable assembly”. Compilers tear C code apart and make it far more efficient than the code people stuff into it. It’s not even a direct model of the machine anymore: just an abstract one.)</p>

<p>Still, sometimes even C can’t get away from it. The function <code>imaxabs</code> relates to exactly one entity that, for historical reasons, was pinned to a function taking and returning a <code>long long</code>. Upgrading it means dealing with this schism between what the user expects (<code>intmax_t</code> that got upgraded and can print <code>__int128_t</code>/<code>__int256_t</code>) with old, non-recompiled code that maintains the old invariant (<code>long long</code>, a 64-bit number).</p>



<p>Okay, so symbols can be repurposed between library versions that lead to ABI breaks. What are the ways to defend against such a world, in C?</p>

<h2 id="macros">Macros?</h2>

<p>Macros! Object-like macros are fun. You could do something like this…</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define imaxabs __glibc228_imaxabs
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>… as a way to provide the <code>imaxabs</code> function. It is a bit like artisanal, hand-crafted, free-range, and organic ABI versioning (or, as I have affectionately come to call it: personal masochism to make up for language failures). This mostly works, until… it doesn’t!</p>

<h3 id="714">§7.1.4</h3>

<p>This is the “ABI Breaks Guaranteed” section in the C Standard. It’s real name is “§7.1.4 Use of library functions”. Reproduced below is the relevant piece that condemns us, emphasis mine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any function declared in a header may be additionally implemented as a function-like macro defined in the header, so if a library function is declared explicitly when its header is included, one of the techniques shown below can be used to ensure the declaration is not affected by such a macro. <strong>Any macro definition of a function can be suppressed locally by enclosing the name of the function in parentheses</strong>, because the name is then not followed by the left parenthesis that indicates expansion of a macro function name. For the same syntactic reason, it is permitted to take the address of a library function even if it is also defined as a macro. <strong>The use of <code>#undef</code> to remove any macro definition will also ensure that an actual function is referred to</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only can a user suppress a function-like macro invocation by using the same trick used on <code>&lt;windows.h&gt;</code> like <code>(max)(value0, value1)</code>, but the C Standard Library permits them to also undefine function names:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// implementer code: inttypes.h</span>
<span>#define imaxabs __glibc228_imaxabs
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// user code: main.c</span>
<span>#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;
</span>
<span>#undef imaxabs // awh geez
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>intmax_t</span> <span>val</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
	<span>intmax_t</span> <span>absval</span> <span>=</span> <span>imaxabs</span><span>(</span><span>val</span><span>);</span> <span>// awH GEEZ</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span>absval</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Mmm……</p>

<h3 id="implementation-specific-strategies">Implementation-specific strategies</h3>

<p>Alright, the C Standard basically loads a double barrel and brings our only standardized mitigation strategy out back behind the barn. What’s left? Well, implementation-specific insanity, that’s what:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>extern</span>
<span>intmax_t</span>
<span>__glibc228_imaxabs</span><span>(</span><span>intmax_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>__attribute</span><span>((</span><span>symbol</span><span>(</span><span>__MANGLE</span><span>(</span><span>__glibc228_imaxabs</span><span>))))</span>
<span>extern</span>
<span>intmax_t</span>
<span>imaxabs</span><span>(</span><span>intmax_t</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is pseudo-code. But, wouldn’t you believe it, some implementations actually do things very similar to this to get around these problems! The things they do are far more involved, like actually dropping down to the level of the linker and creating symbol maps and other exceedingly painful workarounds. The sed scripts and the awk scripts and the bash starts coming out, people are doing lots of text processing to get symbol names and match them to versioned symbol names…</p>

<p>It’s a mess.</p>

<p>Still, given the mess, it does save us from the problem. In C code you get to use “the real name” <code>imaxabs</code> as Our Lord and Savior intended, the binary gets linked to <code>___glibc228_imaxabs</code>, and everyone’s happy. There’s only one problem with this kind of fix…</p>

<p>It’s Quality of Implementation (QoI).</p>

<p>QoI is great for the pure, theoretical standard. We get to write sexy narratives in the C standard and call them “Recommended Practice”, with little footnotes furtively implying a more wonderful world while waggling our eyebrows seductively at hot, young developers in our area. Just come along, it’s going to be so great, we’re going have soooooo much fun, just go with that lovely little implementation right over there, you’re making such fine progress, enjoy yourself and come back soon my …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Being the internet-dabbling dilettante that I am, I often gaze longingly at the front page of Hacker News, wondering when my own content will reach it and <del>waste</del> merit the time of others. But alas, my time is precious, and I can't spend all day refreshing the browser to see when I've achieved my goal. Let's set something up to do that for me.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mission:</em></strong> Write a script that scans the front page of HN for the presence of this blog post. If we detect it, update this blog post, including the time from when it reached the front page. Run the script(s) periodically for a day before accepting inevitable defeat.</p>

<h2><a href="#how-is-this-going-to-work">How is this going to work?</a></h2>
<p>Nothing fancy here - let's approach each of these steps individually before gluing them together:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a <code>go</code> script that scrapes the front page of HN for our post.</li>
<li>Create a <code>bash</code> script that calls the <code>go</code> script (and can tell whether it found our post or failed).</li>
<li>Create a periodically running job that runs the <code>bash</code> script.</li>
<li>
<p>Add conditional behaviors to the <code>bash</code> script:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <code>go</code> script succeeds in finding our post: modify our post markdown (succeeded!), create a <code>git</code> commit, and push to <code>github</code> to trigger a deploy. Clear the job!</li>
<li>If the <code>go</code> script fails (and we're out of time): modify our post (failed), create a <code>git</code> commit, and push to <code>github</code> to trigger a deploy. Clear the job!</li>
<li>If the <code>go</code> script fails (and we have time left): log some information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deploy the blog post, submit it to HN, and start the script!</li>
<li>Keep my computer awake and return in 24 hours.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can test the little pieces by handing the <code>go</code> script existing or fictional targets to search for on the front page of HN.</p>
<p>Sweet! Nothing to it but to do it. A few things to keep in mind before we start:</p>
<h4>High Level Caveats</h4>
<ol>
<li>I'm going to use <code>launchd</code> as my job scheduler because I'm working on a Mac.

<li>We will consider the "front page" to be anything in the top 30, since that's what loads on desktop before paginating. I may end up keeping track of "peak height reached", to salve my bruised ego - TBD.</li>
<li>We're going to run the script every 10 minutes for a day and then give up. Judging from the front page of HN <em>at this moment</em>, it looks like nothing is up there that's more than 24 hours old. If we don't reach the front page by then, we're fine with that.</li>
<li>We're going to write the results from running the script to a log file we can check later.</li>

<p>Although there are practical applications of periodically scraping websites and doing things with the data, this is obviously not one of them. Let's get to it.</p>

<h2><a href="#spinning-up-a-periodic-job">Spinning up a periodic job</a></h2>
<p>Half the fun of this is getting my computer to check regularly for me instead of pounding <code>cmd + r</code>. I initially looked into using <code>cron</code> and <code>crontab</code>, and saw the following when I ran <code>man crontab</code>:</p>
<div><p>...(Darwin note: Although cron(8) and crontab(5) are officially supported under Darwin, their functionality has been absorbed into launchd(8), which provides a more flexible way of automatically executing commands.  See launchctl(1) for more information.)</p></div>
<p>I figure that this is a quiet way of saying "might be deprecated soon" so I'm going to use the more contemporary set of tools (<code>launchd</code>) for our script.</p>
<p>How can we create a <code>launchd</code> job? I feel like I've done this in a past life, but I followed <a href="https://medium.com/@chetcorcos/a-simple-launchd-tutorial-9fecfcf2dbb3">this useful walkthrough</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/@chetcorcos">Chet Corcos</a> to refresh my memory. For <a href="https://www.launchd.info/">reference</a>:</p>
<div><p>(launchd is) a unified, open-source service management framework for starting, stopping and managing daemons, applications, processes, and scripts.</p></div>
<p>...and <code>launchctl</code> is the command line tool we can use to start and stop those processes. We're basically going to create an <code>XML</code> file describing when to run our job and how frequently, and add it to the set of jobs that my computer is already running periodically using <code>launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/foo</code>. Unsurprisingly, we can unload the script with <code>launchctl unload ...</code>, referencing the same filepath.</p>
<p>Here's what my basic job looks like (<code>~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.gc.navel.plist</code>):</p>
<div data-language="xml"><pre><code><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</span>

  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>dict</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>plist</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Simple enough - the <code>XML</code> file is a set of key value pairs that define a script to run (<code>ProgramArguments</code>), a frequency to run at (<code>StartInterval</code>, measured in seconds), and some output paths and environment information (<code>WorkingDirectory</code>, <code>EnvironmentVariables</code>, etc.). Note that right now we've configured the job to run every 10 minutes, which we may want to tweak for debugging later. Also notice that the <span id="aside-directory-structure" aside-content="Obviously your directory structure might look completely different, so do what makes sense if you're following along at home.">working directory doesn't match<sup><a href="#aside-directory-structure-note">3</a></sup></span> the output paths I've referenced, and that I've moved the script to a separate directory too. I don't really want this code living in the repo for my blog, even though that's where we want to run the script (to possibly modify the markdown post and push with <code>git</code>).</p>
<div data-language="shell-session"><pre><code><span><span>$</span> <span><span>cd</span> ~/home</span></span>
<span><span>$</span> <span><span>mkdir</span> navel</span></span>
<span><span>$</span> <span>tree -L <span>1</span> <span>|</span> <span>grep</span> -E <span>"(navel|guycom)"</span></span></span>
<span>├── guycombinator
├── navel
</span><span><span>$</span> <span><span>mv</span> guycombinator/navel.sh navel/</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Nice. We've enabled <code>RunAtLoad</code>, so the script will run immediately. Let's see that everything still "works" by loading the job and checking <code>out.log</code> and <code>err.log</code>:</p>
<div data-language="shell-session"><pre><code><span><span>$</span> <span>launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.gc.navel.plist</span></span>
<span><span>$</span> <span><span>cd</span> ~/home/navel</span></span>
<span><span>$</span> <span><span>cat</span> out.log</span></span>
<span>Running navel.sh

</span><span><span>$</span> <span><span>cat</span> err.log</span></span>
<span>/Users/scott/home/navel/navel.sh: line 6: go: command not found
/Users/scott/home/navel/navel.sh: line 6: go: command not found</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Aha - it doesn't look like the job knows how to run <code>go</code> commands. We need to make sure that the <code>&lt;EnvironmentVariables/&gt;</code> <code>ENV</code> value includes our <code>go</code> binary. Easy enough to fix:</p>
<div data-language="shell-session"><pre><code><span><span>$</span> <span><span>which</span> go</span></span>
<span>/Users/local/go/bin/go</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So lets add <em>the directory where</em> <code>go</code> <em>is located</em> (<code>/Users/local/go/bin</code>) to the end of our set of directories to look for executables (<code>PATH</code>) in the <code>plist</code> file:</p>
<div data-language="xml"><pre><code>...
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>key</span><span>&gt;</span></span>EnvironmentVariables<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>key</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>dict</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>key</span><span>&gt;</span></span>PATH<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>key</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>string</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>&lt;![CDATA[/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/go/bin]]&gt;</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>string</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>dict</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once more, with feeling:</p>
<div data-language="shell-session"><pre><code><span><span>$</span> <span>launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.gc.navel.plist</span></span>
<span><span>$</span> <span><span>rm</span> err.log out.log</span></span>
<span><span>$</span> <span>launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.gc.navel.plist</span></span>
<span><span>$</span> <span><span>sleep</span> <span>30</span><span>;</span> <span>cat</span> out.log</span></span>

<p>It takes a few seconds on my machine to fetch the results, we're waiting a bit with <code>sleep</code> before we check for results. But it worked! So let's add some slightly more complex behaviors based on the result of the script running.</p>

You will then pay back your investors over time via an income share agreement.</p><h3>About <strong>Income Share Agreements</strong></h3><p>An Income Share Agreement (ISA) allows for individuals to seek funding without requiring their investors to take a massive risk.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br>We found that many Friends and Family funding rounds and Pre-Seed funding rounds by startup founders happen when the business is still incredibly risky. With an incredibly high chance of failure, it is almost always a bad investment to make. At these early stages of a venture, the investors are usually investing based on their confidence in the founder more than any other factor. With that in mind, we believe it makes sense to provide founders with an investment vehicle that matches investors’ thought processes. That is where Income Share Agreements (ISAs) come into play. An ISA allows for investors to invest in a founder, with the potential to profit from the founder’s success. This means that an investor could profit if the founder is successful with their second or even third venture, instead of the investor’s money completely riding on the founder’s first venture.&nbsp;<br>‍<br>While this investment vehicle is not wiped out when an entity goes out of business, it also does not put a founder into long-term debt. There is no guarantee that a founder will pay back the entire amount of the initial investment, making the investment potentially more risky than a standard loan. But, since the investment does not go away with an entity, the investment is potentially less risky than an equity investment.<br>‍<br>We believe that ISAs are most useful when a startup founder needs capital to build their Minimum Viable Product, which is typically where a Friends and Family round happens.&nbsp;<br>‍<br>We also believe that ISAs are great alternatives to loans and are versatile to fit many different applications. From our research and customer development initiatives, we have found people who want to utilize ISAs for startup funding, working capital as a freelancer, student financing, debt refinancing or consolidation, and many other applications.&nbsp;</p><h2>ISA Examples</h2><p><strong>Basic Terms of an ISA</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Dollar amount of investment</p></li><li><p>Percentage of income each year</p></li><li><p>Max duration of income sharing</p></li><li><p>Capped pay-back amount</p></li></ul><p><strong>Example of an ISA and two scenarios</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>You borrow $100k</p></li><li><p>Terms are 10% of income for 10 years, 3x pay-back cap</p></li></ul><p><em>Scenario 1</em></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>You start making money from your business 2 years after getting funded through Invest In Me’s ISA.</p></li><li><p>You make $100k/yr for the next 5 years and then sell your business, making $10m from the sale.</p></li><li><p>You have paid back $50k from your annual income and $250k from the sale of your business, hitting the 3x cap on the ISA.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><em>Scenario 2</em></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>You work on your business for 3 years, making no money.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>The “At my last place…” problem, or also commonly discussed as</p><p><em>‘xooglers always be like “at google we…”’</em> — <a href="https://twitter.com/devonbl/status/1329905383175929858">twitter</a></p><p>If you have been working at a place for a while and switch to a new gig, you may find yourself making a comparison or drawing from your past experiences about a project, tool, tech, or process you are working on. In fairness, I feel like Xooglers get a bad rap. Since in my limited experience, I have noticed this to be just as true for folks from any other tech company - AirBnb, Uber, Stripe, or similar.</p><p>It’s not uncommon for humans to draw comparisons or use past learning to inform a future decision. It’s something I faced too after my time at Intercom. Then every time, I began a sentence with “At my place…” I mentally put a dollar in a jar while feeling a rush of cringe through my body. On the one hand, I felt horrible for not bringing a rational, unbiased mind to a conversation. On the other hand, I considered the comparison a useful thought experiment to tease out the details.</p><p>Drawing from a past experience, naming a company, technology, or referencing a white paper are also some ways of bringing credibility to the table while sharing an honest opinion. In fairness, I looked back to all kinds of experiences, especially the ones with lessons learnt.</p><p>The problem to avoid here is not to get into a rut of doing something just because that’s how X company or team operated in the past. Or because it makes the decision process more comfortable, so you patch the problem at hand and move on to the next things.</p><p>You may notice that often what is also being proposed is a solution that more or less addresses the problem. Still, folks get too involved in solutionizing, so they miss the sight of the original problem. Going back to first principles is a nice way to reset the ground. Asking questions like “Does this address the problem, we are facing here today?” or “What problem is it trying to solve?” can be helpful.</p><p>One thing to remember is not giving yourself a hard time. Its also why companies hire people with past experiences so you can bring that knowledge and expertise to help solve current problems.</p><p>A smart person once said, “The important thing is not to stop questioning”. And I think that’s what matters at the end of the day is to be able to innovate while being fair.</p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>December 05, 2020</p></header><p>At scale, any failure that can happen will eventually happen. Hardware failures, software crashes, memory leaks - you name it. The more components you have, the more failures you will experience.</p><p>This nasty behavior is caused by <em>cruel math</em> - given an operation that has a certain probability of failing, as the total number of operations performed increases, so does the total number of failures. In other words, as you scale out your application to handle more load, the more failures it will experience.</p><p>To protect your application against failures, you first need to know what can go wrong. Assuming you are using a cloud provider and not maintaning your own datacenter, the most common failures you will encounter are caused by single points of failure, the network being unreliable, slow processes, and unexpected load.</p><h2 id="single-point-of-failure"><a href="#single-point-of-failure" aria-label="single point of failure permalink"></a>Single Point of Failure</h2><p>A single point of failure is the most glaring cause of failure in a distributed system - it’s that one component that when it fails brings down the entire system with it. In practice, distributed systems can have multiple single points of failure.</p><p>A service that to start up needs to read its configuration from a non-replicated database is an example of a single point of failure - if the database isn’t reachable, the service won’t be able to start. </p><p>A more subtle example is a service that exposes a HTTP API on top of TLS and uses a certificate that needs to be manually renewed. If the certificate isn’t renewed by the time it expires, then most clients trying to connect to it wouldn’t be able to open a connection with the service. </p><p>Single points of failure should be identified when the system is architected before they can cause any harm. The best way to detect them is to examine every component of the system and ask what would happen if that component were to fail. Some single points of failure can be architected away, e.g., by introducing redundancy, while others can’t. In that case, the only option left is to minimize the blast radius.</p><h2 id="unreliable-network"><a href="#unreliable-network" aria-label="unreliable network permalink"></a>Unreliable Network</h2><p>When a client make a remote network call, it sends a request to a server and expects to receive a response from it a while later. In the best case, the client receives a response shortly after sending the request. But what if the client waits and waits and still doesn’t get a response? </p><p>In that case, the client doesn’t know whether a response will eventually arrive or not. At that point it has only two options, it can either continue to wait, or fail the request with an exception or an error.</p><p>Slow network calls are the <a href="https://robertovitillo.com/default-timeouts/">silent killers</a> of distributed systems. Because the client doesn’t know whether the response is on its way or not, it can spend a long time waiting before giving up, if it gives up at all. The wait can in turn cause degradations that are extremely hard to debug. </p><h2 id="slow-processes"><a href="#slow-processes" aria-label="slow processes permalink"></a>Slow Processes</h2><p>From an observer’s point of view, a very slow process is not very different from one that isn’t running at all - neither can perform useful work. Resource leaks are one of the most common causes of slow processes.</p><p>Memory leaks are arguably the most well-known source of leaks. A memory leak manifests itself with a steady increase in memory consumption over time. Run-times with garbage collection don’t help much either - if a reference to an object that isn’t longer needed is kept somewhere, the object won’t be deleted by the garbage collector. </p><p>A memory leak keeps consuming memory until there is no more of it, at which point the operating system starts swapping memory pages to the disk constantly, all the while the garbage collector kicks in more frequently trying its best to release any shred of memory. The constant paging and the garbage collector eating up CPU cycles make the process slower. Eventually, when there is no more physical memory, and there is no more space in the swap file, the process won’t be able to allocate more memory, and most operations will fail.</p><p>Memory is just one of the many resources that can leak. For example, if you are using a thread pool, you can lose a thread when it blocks on a synchronous call that never returns. If a thread makes a synchronous, and blocking, HTTP call <a href="https://robertovitillo.com/default-timeouts/">without setting a timeout</a>, and the call never returns, the thread won’t be returned to the pool. Since the pool has a fixed size and keeps losing threads, the pool will eventually run out of threads. </p><p>You might think that making <em>asynchronous</em> calls, rather than a synchronous ones, would mitigate the problem in the previous case. But, modern HTTP clients use socket pools to avoid recreating TCP connections and pay a <a href="https://robertovitillo.com/what-every-developer-should-know-about-tcp/">hefty performance fee</a>. If a request is made without a timeout, the connection is never returned to the pool. As the pool has a limited size, eventually there won’t be any connections left to communicate with the host.</p><p>On top of all that, the code you write isn’t the only one accessing memory, threads and sockets. The libraries your application depends on access the same resources, and they can do all kinds of shady things. Without digging into their implementation, assuming it’s open in the first place, you can’t be sure whether they can wreak havoc or not.</p><h2 id="unexpected-load"><a href="#unexpected-load" aria-label="unexpected load permalink"></a>Unexpected Load</h2><p>Every system has a limit to how much load it can withstand without scaling. Depending on how the load increases, you are bound to hit that brick wall sooner or later. But one thing is an organic increase in load, which gives you the time to scale your service out accordingly, and another is a sudden and unexpected spike.</p><p>For example, consider the number of requests received by a service in a period of time. The rate and the type of incoming requests can change over time, and sometimes suddenly, for a variety of reasons:</p><ul><li>The requests might have a seasonality - depending on the hour of the day the service is going to get hit by users in different countries.</li><li>Some requests are much more expensive than others and abuse the system in ways you didn’t really anticipate for, like scrapers slurping in data from your site at super human speed.</li><li>Some requests are malicious - think of DDoS attacks which try to saturate your service’s bandwidth, denying access to the service to legitimate users.</li></ul><h2 id="cascading-failures"><a href="#cascading-failures" aria-label="cascading failures permalink"></a>Cascading Failures</h2><p>You would think that if your system has hundreds of processes, it shouldn’t make much of a difference if a small percentage are slow or unreachable. The thing about faults is that they tend to spread like cancer, propagating from one process to the other until the whole system crumbles to its knees. This effect is also referred to as a <em>cascading failure</em>, which occurs when a portion of an overall system fails, increasing the probability that other portions fail.</p><p>For example, suppose there are multiple clients querying two database replicas A and B, which are behind a load balancer. Each replica is handling about 50 transactions per second.</p><p>{width: 75%}

    </span></p><p>As replica A starts to struggle to keep up with the incoming requests, the clients experience more failures and timeouts. In turn, they retry the same failing requests several times, adding insult to injury. </p><p>Eventually, replica A is under so much load that it can no longer serve requests promptly, and becomes for all intent and purposes unavailable, causing replica A to be removed from the load balancer’s pool. In the meantime, replica B becomes available again and the load balancer puts it back in the pool, at which point it’s flooded with requests that kill the replica instantaneously. This feedback loop of doom can repeat several time.</p><p>Cascading failures are very hard to get under control once they have started. The best way to mitigate one is to not have it in the first place by stopping the cracks in your services to propagate to others.</p><h2 id="defense-mechanisms"><a href="#defense-mechanisms" aria-label="defense mechanisms permalink"></a>Defense Mechanisms</h2><p>There is a variety of best practices you can use to mitigate failures, like circuit breakers, load shedding, rate-limiting and bulkheads. I plan to blog about those in the future, but in the meantime Google is your friend. Also, I have an entire chapter dedicated to resiliency patterns in my <a href="https://distributedsystemsmanual.com/">book about distributed systems</a>. </p><hr></article></div>]]>

                    <h2>How long does it take to walk 1 mile?</h2>
<p>As both research and actual scientific measurements, an average adult will walk 1 mile in 15 to 18 minutes at moderate to a brisk pace. Or in other words, 3 to 4 miles per hour.</p>
<p>This is a general measure for a healthy adult between 20 and 50 years old, at dry weather, on relatively flat terrain, with no destruction from cars and other environments.</p>
<p>If you are either less healthy or subjected to any of the environmental distractions, your speed, of course, will be lower.</p>
<h2>Average walking speed by age group and gender</h2>
<p>There is little difference between male and female, with males walking on average 2% faster.</p>
<p>The table below shows the speed of walking based on age and gender:</p>
<pre><code>| Age      | Sex    | Meters per second | Miles per hour |
|----------|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| 20 to 29 | Male   | 1.36              | 3.04           |
|          | Female | 1.34              | 3.0            |
| 30 to 39 | Male   | 1.43              | 3.2            |
|          | Female | 1.34              | 3.0            |
| 40 to 49 | Male   | 1.43              | 3.2            |
|          | Female | 1.39              | 3.11           |
| 50 to 59 | Male   | 1.43              | 3.2            |
|          | Female | 1.31              | 2.93           |
| 60 to 69 | Male   | 1.34              | 3.0            |
|          | Female | 1.24              | 2.77           |
| 70 to 79 | Male   | 1.26              | 2.82           |
|          | Female | 1.13              | 2.53           |
| 80 to 89 | Male   | 0.97              | 2.17           |
|          | Female | 0.94              | 2.10           |

<h2>Benefits of walking</h2>
<p>There has been a great deal of research that showed that walking brings a huge advantage to humans. To both <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0013916518800798">physical, and mental well being.</a> The benefits are as follows:</p>
<p>Physical:</p>
<ul>
<li>Burning calories. A direct way to reduce and to control your weight.</li>
<li>Lower glucose level and blood sugar levels. <a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/early/2013/06/03/dc13-0084">Research</a> has focused on short walks, where it helped reduce glucose intolerance.</li>
<li><a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/45/12/987?sid=fe62a8c5-430b-4506-b854-20b62e8a5e9e">Help deal with infection and possibly Covid.</a></li>
<li>Help boost immune function.</li>
<li>Give additional energy to do other tasks due to increased efficiency of nutrients absorption and conversion.</li>
<li>Prolonging life. There is a <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/12/761">research that showed</a> evidence of having a relationship between physical activity and overall life expectancy. </li>
<li>Strengthen the heart. Even 20 minutes of daily walking has shown to reduce the risk of stroke by at least 20%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mental:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es903183r">Improving self esteem</a> by 45%.</li>
<li><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es903183r">Improving mood</a> by 54%.</li>
<li>Additional time on focusing on self-education with educational podcasts and books. <a href="https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/nyar_savannah/2020/2020/90/">Research</a> has shown that it leads to better learning of the material, longer retention, better engagement in post-walk discussions, better behaviour and mood, AND improved health literacy.</li>
<li>Improving <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10413200.2020.1815100">goal setting</a> in other areas by targeting non-specific goals which in consequence lead to better results.</li>
<li>Walking helps you get your thoughts in order. Whenever you are alone with yourself, and you are unable to really look at the phone, you are finally able to understand what is happening with yourself with no distractions.</li>
<li>Improve the creative part of the brain. While walking, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-14435-001">research showed</a>, that it is easier to come up with great ideas.</li>
<li>Save money on medications. With the amount of food, we consume and with costly medicine, walking and doing exercises can help you save money and nerves.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Covid and sitting time</h2>
<p>In the world of pandemics and covid, it has been evident that humans are sitting more and more and do less and less exercises. There is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221133552030214X">great research</a> that shows that 2020 has caused a sharp increase in average sitting time. The data is staggering.</p>
<p><code>Overall, 42.6% of participants reported sitting for &gt; 8 h/day (95% CI: 41.2%–44.0%) and 72.5% (71.2%–73.7%) reported being either sufficiently (150–300 MVPA minutes) or highly active (&gt;300 min).</code></p>
<p>If you want to boost your health and still to be able to keep up with a busy schedule walking or running can be the best idea for spending your free time. In the world where only entertainment inside your house is minimal. If being glued to the screen is no longer an option, than being outside can boost your health and your mental capabilities immensely.</p>

<h2>Tips on how to start walking</h2>
<h3>How to make walking a habit?</h3>
<p>The walk starts with the first step. It would be best if you did not put huge goals onto yourself. Start somewhere small, then later you can always adjust based on how you feel.</p>
<p>Start by putting on clothes(plus a mask) and go outside. Going back to your apartment would feel bad at that point.</p>
<p>Next, you should walk around your building or up and down the street.</p>
<p>Next, you walk around the block and later you can finally go for huge walks that can be a couple of hours long.</p>
<p>Don’t try to start at the last step that would only make you quit before you get the full benefit of the habit.</p>
<p>Peg your walking habit to something else. If you go for a coffee every morning, go to a coffee house that is further away. If you are usually riding a tube to work, start the journey at the stop further away from you</p>
<h3>Identify as a walker</h3>
<p>If you would like to start walking you need to think of <strong>how do you become a walker.</strong></p>
<p>You need to make sure you identify as someone who goes on walks, then keeping up with the habit will be much easier.</p>
<p>Next time someone asks you, whatever you do any exercises or what you love doing with your free time, you need to want to say that you love walking. At that point, you will be able to keep on walking and improving your health immensely.</p>
<h2>How much walking per week is enough?</h2>
<p>I think that it is tough to give a simple number for everyone, but if you are in the age range of 18-50, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>150 to 300 minutes per week is an ideal level if you are walking with moderate speed</li>
<li>75 to 150 minutes per week if you are walking with a brisk pace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t think that doing extra physical exercise will be useless. In contrast, anything above that time limit will give even higher benefits to your health, so take the timing above as a general guideline. Do as much as you want.</p>
<h2>Personal tips on walking more</h2>
<h3>Wake up earlier</h3>
<p>Right now it is very easy to blame everything on covid and health, but not many people <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/how-to-wake-up-early">wake up very early in the morning</a>, that gives people that live in the city an ability to walk as much as they want, even in usually crowded spaces.</p>
<p>Also, your excuse of not having enough time can not be reinforced if you have an extra hour in the morning.</p>
<h3>Get a pet (dog)</h3>
<p>Even though it can seem like a lousy idea, multiple research papers show a relationship between owning a dog and the number of steps you do daily. If you are struggling to make time, your favourite pet will make you find time for walks.</p>
<p><img alt="man and dog walking in forest autumn" src="https://i.gyazo.com/5e16de8c0474f84f4285df88fab28c14.jpg"></p>
<h3>Podcasts and Audiobooks</h3>
<p>I love learning and listening to books. I do it all the time even when I am at home at my desk, so a change of pace for me is always going for an extended walk where I can do the same thing.</p>
<p>What I discovered is that I understand and remember information much better when I have consumed it while walking. That makes me spend twice as little time and getting twice the result. </p>
<p>Podcasts have been my go-to method of getting new relevant news and information in my field of expertise. Since I have started a habit of walking, I have been on top of my field and able to implement solutions that I would have never thought of otherwise.</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I also love discovering new music. Sometimes when I really need to get my head around something I go for a brisk walk with my favourite songs. This helps me to unwind and later really understand the problem.</p>
<p>Most of the time while on the walk, I solve the problem that I had, and in my experience would off taken me much more time to solve.</p>
<h3>Walking groups</h3>
<p><img alt="walking groups picture" src="https://i.gyazo.com/26609ccb0d7ae90e9f746389479a32b0.jpg"></p>
<p>Sometimes socialising can be hard and especially when all of your friends are on the lockdown and all of the socialising places, such as restaurants, are closed. </p>
<p>That is where walking groups can come into play! You can find someone who is staying healthy and being diligent with their health and walk together! That will allow you to catch up and have social interaction, that we humans require.</p>
<h5>So what this means?</h5>
<p>Now you have a social responsibility in your habit, and the whole activity can let you be more motivated to do it.</p>
<p>Also, walking groups normally allow you to meet new people and to bond better with existing relationships.</p>
<p>Also, walking groups is a great way to speed up your walking pace and improve your health.</p>
<h2>How do I get better at walking?</h2>
<p>If you would like to improve the speed at which you walk, there are multiple ways to do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned above, walking groups are amazing for giving you a speedup of pace, just make sure to not overdo it.</li>
<li>Walking poles (tracking poles) are an easy way to speed up the pace. They are especially useful for those with back or leg injury, that immensely help reduce the stress on joints and back as well as speed up the pace. There is a lot of research behind use cases and benefits of using them.</li>
<li>Treadmills. If you are unable to properly walk in the wild or in the park, get yourself a treadmill. Although they can be expensive, some are very cheap and immensely powerful alternatives provide the same result. You don’t need something overly expensive. Treadmills are great for controlling your pace as well as letting you support yourself with the rails that are at either side of the treadmill.</li>
<li>Have an open goal. Whenever you are walking, the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10413200.2020.1815100">research has shown</a> that having an open goal to where you want to walk or for how long will extend the amount of walking that you will eventually do.</li>
<li>Keep track of your metrics. Understanding what your heart rate and your pace are, is vital for your well being and motivation. Seeing that you have improved over a period of time is the greatest motivator there is.</li>
<li>Strive towards a 13 minutes per mile goal. The 13 minutes per mile has been shown to be the meeting point between fast walkers and the joggers. As …</li></ul></div></div>

        <p><time>Friday, December 4th, 2020</time></p>
    </header>
    <hr>
    <p>I was reading about 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbit" data-popup-title="Urbit" data-popup-title-html="Urbit" data-popup-author="Eng­lish Wikipedia" data-popup-date="2020-12-04" data-popup-abstract="<p><img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Urbit_Logo.svg/1920px-Urbit_Logo.svg.png&quot; style=&quot;width:30%; float:left; margin-right:15px;&quot;>Urbit is a decentralized personal server platform. The platform seeks to deconstruct the client-server model in favour of a federated network of personal servers in a peer-to-peer network with a consistent digital identity.<p>">Urbit</a> the other day. I recommend giving the wiki article a quick read if you're not familar with it, 
        but the core (and this is very watered-down) is that Urbit is how one might imagine computing
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity" data-popup-title="Technological singularity" data-popup-title-html="Technological singularity" data-popup-author="Eng­lish Wikipedia" data-popup-date="2020-12-04" data-popup-abstract="The technological singularity—also, simply, the singularity—is a hypothetical point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization. According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, called intelligence explosion, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a &quot;runaway reaction&quot; of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an &quot;explosion&quot; in intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively far surpasses all human intelligence.">post-singularity</a>. Computing power and bandwidth are infinite, so inefficiencies are irrelevant and one needn't bother with worrying about them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Urbit takes many strange paths, but when viewed through this 
        lens, I find it <span>slightly</span> more understandable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Urbit is many things, but a core part is the concept of an <span>Operating Function</span>, a take on the term, <span>Operating System</span>.
        The Operating Function fulfills the role of an operating system (e.g. orchestrating applications, talking to the outside world, etc), but in a pure, functional manner:
    </p>
    <code>
        (event, old state) ⟶ (effect, new state)
    </code>
    <p>
        All the incoming events are automatically saved by the Urbit runtime.
        Occasionally, the list of events is squashed down and the most recent state is saved instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        The applications running inside of Urbit don't have to explicitly save their data,
        they just modify their state over time, receiving events and producing effects.
        But, when the computer is shut down, the urbit system can resume exactly in the same state.
    </p>
    <p>This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)#Orthogonal_or_transparent_persistence" data-popup-title="Orthogonal or transparent persistence" data-popup-title-html="Orthogonal or transparent persistence" data-popup-author="Eng­lish Wikipedia" data-popup-date="2020-12-04" data-popup-abstract="<p>Persistence is said to be &quot;orthogonal&quot; or &quot;transparent&quot; when it is implemented as an intrinsic property of the execution environment of a program. An orthogonal persistence environment does not require any specific actions by programs running in it to retrieve or save their state.</p><p>Non-orthogonal persistence requires data to be written and read to and from storage using specific instructions in a program, resulting in the use of persist as a transitive verb: On completion, the program persists the data.</p><p>The advantage of orthogonal persistence environments is simpler and less error-prone programs.</p>"><span>Orthogonal Persistence</span></a>.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><span>Orthogonal persistence</span> refers to persistence of data without explicitly saving it.</p>
    <img src="https://charted.space/static/images/non-orthogonal-vs-orthogonal.jpeg">
    <p>
        There's no need to use the filesystem or a database.
        Just store data the way you would in a running application. e.g. in lists, tables, or anything else.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <span>So</span>, I like the idea of orthogonal persistence. The "business" logic of the application is probably significantly clearer and simpler
        when saving and loading data isn't part of it.
        <!-- <span class="italics">But</span>, Urbit is too weird of a hump to get over <span class="italics">and</span>, despite the collective
        insistence of futurists, the singularity isn't right around the corner, so concepts like performance do, in fact, matter. -->
    </p>
    <!-- <p>Urbit is admittedly elegant despite (or perhaps because of) the obscurist veneer, but if we have</p> -->
    <p>Is it possible to have this without the obscurist veneer of Urbit? Yes, it is.</p>
    <p>
        Webassembly provides a (mostly) deterministic execution environment and I have a hunch that it'll be just flexible
        enough for the cursed things we'll have to do to it. As a plus, wasm can run quite fast!
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Webassembly</h2>
    <p>What's in a wasm module anyhow?</p>
    <img src="https://charted.space/static/images/wasm-module.jpeg">
    <p>
        Doesn't look like much, does it? (I'm not referring to my drawing skills.) The code section is self-explanatory, and there's nothing there
        we need to work with for this project. Globals, tables, and memory are the important parts here. However, because this
        is a proof-of-concept, we're not going to worry about tables, which hold things like function references.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                The globals section contains data that's, well, global. The shadow stack pointer, and other miscellaneous pointers tend
                to hang out here when the module has been generated by llvm.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The memory is where most data gets stored. It's generally represented by a big slab of contiguous bytes.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>With those in mind, there are two things we need to do to persist the state then:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Save the wasm memory</li>
        <li>Save the mutable globals (e.g. that the program can change at runtime)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        However, we run into a hiccup here. Oftentimes, the module keeps many of its globals private and inaccessible from outside.
        Even native wasm runtimes, like <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">wasmtime</a>, don't let you get at them.
        The solution to this is to actually modify the wasm module itself to make the right items accessible.
        The <a href="https://crates.io/crates/walrus">walrus</a> crate works well for this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's get started with what we want the wasm module to be. I'll write it in Rust, though other languages would work fine.
    </p>
    <code>
        <pre><span>static</span> <span>mut</span> N: <span>usize</span> = <span>0</span>;

<span>#[no_mangle]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>extern</span> <span>"C"</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>set</span></span>(x: <span>usize</span>) {
    <span>unsafe</span> { N = x }
}

<span>#[no_mangle]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>extern</span> <span>"C"</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>get</span></span>() -&gt; <span>usize</span> {
    <span>unsafe</span> { N }
}</pre>
    </code>
    <p>
        Rust really doesn't like mutable global variables, like <code>N</code>, so we have to use <code>unsafe</code> to access it.
    </p>
    <p>Let's compile that to webassembly:</p>
    <code>
        <pre>❯ rustc --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown --crate-type=cdylib -O test.rs</pre>
    </code>
    <p>
        Now for actually loading and unloading the wasm module, I threw together a rust crate that makes it pretty easy.
        This uses <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">wasmtime</a> internally to load and execute the webassembly.
    </p>
    <p>Here's how you instantiate a module and then save the state to the filesystem!</p>
    <code>
        <pre><span>let</span> store = Store::default();
<span>let</span> (_, instance) = PersistentInstance::new_from_file(
    &amp;store,
    <span>"test.wasm"</span>
)?;

<span>let</span> set = instance
    .get_func(<span>"set"</span>)
    .ok_or(anyhow::format_err!(<span>"failed to find `set` function export"</span>))?
    .get1::&lt;<span>u32</span>, ()&gt;()?;

<span>println!</span>(<span>"Calling exported wasm function: `set(42)`"</span>);
set(<span>42</span>)?;
instance.save(<span>"globals.json"</span>, <span>"memory.bin"</span>)?;</pre>
    </code>
    <p>Here's the contents of the <code>globals.json</code> file we just generated:</p>
    <code>
        <pre>{<span>"__heap_base"</span>:{<span>"I32"</span>:<span>1049664</span>},<span>"$probed_global:0"</span>:{<span>"I32"</span>:<span>1048576</span>},<span>"__data_end"</span>:{<span>"I32"</span>:<span>1049664</span>}}</pre>
    </code>
    <p><code>memory.bin</code> ends up being a 1.1Mb file of mostly zeros. This could be very easily compressed to save space.</p>
    <p>And here's how to reload it!</p>
    <code>
        <pre><span>let</span> store = Store::default();
<span>let</span> (_, instance) = PersistentInstance::load_from_file(
    &amp;store,
    <span>"test.wasm"</span>,
    <span>"globals.json"</span>,
    <span>"memory.bin"</span>
)?;

<span>let</span> get = instance
    .get_func(<span>"get"</span>)
    .ok_or(anyhow::format_err!(<span>"failed to find `get` function export"</span>))?
    .get0::&lt;<span>u32</span>&gt;()?;

<span>let</span> x = get()?;
<span>println!</span>(<span>"calling exported wasm function: `get()` =&gt; {}"</span>, x);
<span>assert_eq!</span>(x, <span>42</span>);</pre>
    </code>
    <hr>
    <h2>Okay, so how is this Orthogonal Persistence?</h2>
    <p>
        Well, what I have here isn't orthogonal persistence exactly, but it represents a necessary building block
        for building a system that enables webassembly modules to orthogonally persist their data.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think there are some interesting possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        For applications with an event loop, which is almost every application if you squint your eyes a little,
        that event loop could be moved outside the module into the runtime itself. When the program is not on the call-stack,
        the runtime can simply persist it to disk (possibly through a memory mapped file, more research is necessary).
    </p>
    <p>
        When <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/blob/master/proposals/interface-types/Explainer.md">webassembly interface types</a> eventually land, I think a whole system, operating system even, could consist
        of these orthogonally persistent programs all talking to each other through strongly-typed interfaces. It's a beautiful, elegant vision in my eyes.

<p>I’ve long been frustrated by the task of code reviews. Often, the pull request (PR) I’m reviewing involves a part of the codebase I’m not intimately familiar with. I read it, not quite understanding it, looking to see if I can offer some sort of useful feedback, and typically that feedback would be on the micro level (e.g., “you can simplify this function by calling this other library function instead”).</p>



<p>I recently started experimenting with a new review approach that I’m going to call <em>top down code</em> <em>review.</em> Here’s how it works: <strong>I start by understanding the code well enough so that I can write my own version of the pull request message, describing the PR in my own words.</strong> After I’ve done this, then I provide feedback.</p>



<p>I call this approach “top down” because the review that I end up generating starts with a “top down” description of the PR: the problem it’s trying to solve, and the solution approach, before diving into describing notable implementation details. Here are the reviews I’ve done in this style so far:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/spinnaker/keel/pull/1681#pullrequestreview-543335454" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/spinnaker/keel/pull/1681#pullrequestreview-543335454</a> </li><li><a href="https://github.com/spinnaker/keel/pull/1674#pullrequestreview-537791392" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/spinnaker/keel/pull/1674#pullrequestreview-537791392</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/spinnaker/keel/pull/1673#pullrequestreview-536820748" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/spinnaker/keel/pull/1673#pullrequestreview-536820748</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/spinnaker/keel/pull/1657#pullrequestreview-534881241" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/spinnaker/keel/pull/1657#pullrequestreview-534881241</a></li></ul>



<p>I’ve been finding this approach useful because it forces me to come to terms with how well I really understand the PR. If I can’t explain the PR in my own words, then I don’t really understand it. It also helps me figure out what questions to ask the original author to help clarify things for me.</p>



<p>I also get more of a sense of closure after doing the review. Even if I had no feedback to give, I understand the changes in a way that I didn’t before.</p>

      <b>Improbable Inspiration</b><p>
      The future of software may lie in the obscure theories of an
      18th century cleric named Thomas Bayes.

      </p><p>

      By LESLIE HELM, Times Staff Writer

      </p><hr>
      <p>

      When Microsoft Senior Vice President Steve
      Ballmer first heard his company was planning to make a huge
      investment in an Internet service offering movie reviews and
      local entertainment information in major cities across the
      nation, he went to Chairman Bill Gates with his concerns.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, Ballmer has billions of dollars of
      his own money in Microsoft stock, and entertainment isn't
      exactly the company's strong point.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Gates dismissed such
      reservations. Microsoft's competitive advantage, he responded,
      was its expertise in "Bayesian networks."

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asked recently when computers would finally
      begin to understand human speech, Gates began discussing the
      critical role of "Bayesian" systems.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask any other software executive about
      anything "Bayesian" and you're liable to get a blank
      stare.

      </p><p> 

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Gates onto something? Is this
      alien-sounding technology Microsoft's new secret weapon?

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite possibly.
      
      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bayesian networks are complex diagrams that
      organize the body of knowledge in any given area by mapping out
      cause-and-effect relationships among key variables and encoding
      them with numbers that represent the extent to which one
      variable is likely to affect another.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Programmed into computers, these systems can
      automatically generate optimal predictions or decisions even
      when key pieces of information are missing.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Microsoft in 1993 hired Eric Horvitz,
      David Heckerman and Jack Breese, pioneers in the development of
      Bayesian systems, colleagues in the field were surprised. The
      field was still an obscure, largely academic enterprise.

      </p><p>
 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today the field is still obscure. But scratch
      the surface of a range of new Microsoft products and you're
      likely to find Bayesian networks embedded in the software. And
      Bayesian nets are being built into models that are used to
      predict oil and stock prices, control the space shuttle and
      diagnose disease.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Artificial intelligence (AI) experts, who saw
      their field discredited in the early 1980s after promising a
      wave of "thinking" computers that they ultimately
      couldn't produce, believe widening acceptance of the Bayesian
      approach could herald a renaissance in the field.

      </p><p>
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bayesian networks provide "an
      overarching graphical framework" that brings together
      diverse elements of AI and increases the range of its likely
      application to the real world, says Michael Jordon, professor of
      brain and cognitive science at the Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft is unquestionably the most
      aggressive in exploiting the new approach. The company offers a
      free Web service that helps customers diagnose printing problems
      with their computers and recommends the quickest way to resolve
      them. Another Web service helps parents diagnose their
      children's health problems.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The latest version of Microsoft Office
      software uses the technology to offer a user help based on past
      experience, how the mouse is being moved and what task is being
      done.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If his actions show he is distracted,
      he is likely to need help," Horvitz says. "If he's
      been working on a chart, chances are he needs help formatting
      the chart."

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gates likes to talk about how computers
      are now deaf, dumb, blind and clueless. The Bayesian stuff helps
      deal with the clueless part," says Daniel T.  Ling,
      director of Microsoft's research division and a former IBM
      scientist.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bayesian networks get their name from the
      Rev. Thomas Bayes, who wrote an essay, posthumously published in
      1763, that offered a mathematical formula for calculating
      probabilities among several variables that are causally related
      but for which--unlike calculating the probability of a coin
      landing on heads or tails--the relationships can't easily be
      derived by experimentation.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early students of probability applied the
      ideas to discussions about the existence of God or efforts to
      improve their odds in gambling. Much later, social scientists
      used it to help clarify the key factors influencing a particular
      event.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was the rapid progress in computer
      power and the development of key mathematical equations that
      made it possible for the first time, in the late 1980s, to
      compute Bayesian networks with enough variables that they were
      useful in practical applications.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bayesian approach filled a void in the
      decades-long effort to add intelligence to computers.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the late 1970s and '80s, reacting to the
      "brute force" approach to problem solving by early
      users of computers, proponents of the emerging field of
      artificial intelligence began developing software programs using
      rule-based, if-then propositions. But the systems took time to
      put together and didn't work well if, as was frequently the
      case, you couldn't answer all the computer's questions clearly.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later companies began using a technique
      called "neural nets" in which a computer would be
      presented with huge amounts of data on a particular problem and
      programmed to pull out patterns. A computer fed with a big stack
      of X-rays and told whether or not cancer was present in each
      case would pick out patterns that would then be used to
      interpret X-rays.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the neural nets won't help predict the
      unforeseen. You can't train a neural net to identify an incoming
      missile or plane because you could never get sufficient data to
      train the system.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In part because of these limitations, a slew
      of companies that popped up in the early 1980s to sell
      artificial intelligence systems virtually all went bankrupt.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many AI techniques continued to be
      used. Credit card companies, for example, began routinely using
      neural networks to pick out transactions that don't look right
      based on a consumer's past behavior. But increasingly, AI was
      regarded as a tool with limited use.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in the late 1980s--spurred by the early
      work of Judea Pearl, a professor of computer science at UCLA,
      and breakthrough mathematical equations by <a href="http://www.hugin.dk/">Danish researchers</a>--AI
      researchers discovered that Bayesian networks offered an
      efficient way to deal with the lack or ambiguity of information
      that has hampered previous systems.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Horvitz and his two Microsoft colleagues, who
      were then classmates at Stanford University, began building
      Bayesian networks to help diagnose the condition of patients
      without turning to surgery.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The approach was efficient, says Horvitz,
      because you could combine historical data, which had been
      meticulously gathered, with the less precise but more intuitive
      knowledge of experts on how things work to get the optimal
      answer given the information available at a given time.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Horvitz, who with two colleagues founded
      Knowledge Industries to develop tools for developing Bayesian
      networks, says he and the others left the company to join
      Microsoft in part because they wanted to see their theoretical
      work more broadly applied.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the company did important work for
      the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and on medical
      diagnostics, Horvitz says, "It's not like your grandmother
      will use it."

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft's activities in the field are now
      helping to build a groundswell of support for Bayesian ideas.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "People look up to Microsoft," says
      Pearl, who wrote one of the key early texts on Bayesian networks
      in 1988 and has become an unofficial spokesman for the
      field. "They've given a boost to the whole area."
                     
      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A researcher at German conglomerate Siemens
      says Microsoft's work has drawn the attention of his superiors,
      who are now looking seriously at applying Bayesian concepts to a
      range of industrial applications.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott Musman, a computer consultant in
      Arlington, Va., recently designed a Bayesian network for the
      Navy that can identify enemy missiles, aircraft or vessels and
      recommend which weapons could be used most advantageously
      against incoming targets.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Musman says previous attempts using
      traditional mathematical approaches on state-of-the-art
      computers would get the right answer but would take two to three
      minutes.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you only have 30 seconds before the
      missile has hit you," says Musman.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General Electric is using Bayesian techniques
      to develop a system that will take information from sensors
      attached to an engine and, based on expert opinion built into
      the system as well as vast amounts of data on past engine
      performance, pinpoint emerging problems.

      </p><p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft is working on techniques that will
      enable the Bayesian networks to "learn" or update
      themselves …</p></span></td></div></div>

Types work the <strong>same way</strong>, we classify program values based on the behaviour we’d like them to have. E.g. <code>int</code> for numbers that can be multiplied together, <code>string</code> for streams of characters that can be concatenated together.</p><p>The role of the type-checker is to prevent undesirable behaviour from happening - like concatenating <code>int</code>s or multiplying <code>string</code>s together - these operations make no sense so shouldn’t be allowed.</p><p>Most practical languages use types in one form or another. Some languages like Haskell are <em>statically</em> typed, meaning that the compiler checks the types at <em>compile-time</em>. You might argue, what about languages like JavaScript? There’s no compile-time type-checking there. These languages are <em>dynamically</em> typed, that is values are tagged with types and we check types at <em>runtime</em>, and throw a runtime error if types are mismatched. The runtime error acts as a very late safety check, stopping you just before you try to access a field of something that is <code>undefined</code>. So even JavaScript has types under the hood.</p><p>This all means that at some point, your fancy new language will likely implement some form of type-checking. With Bolt, I’ve chosen to implement <em>static</em> type-checking, i.e. the type-checking is another stage of our compiler.</p><p>Right now this all feels a little hand-wavey. What we need to do is take our high-level goal of “preventing undesirable behaviour” and formalise this. We want a list of rules to check a program against, and then if it passes those, we know our program is safe.</p><p>Enter <em>type systems</em>.</p><h2 id="type-systems"><a href="#type-systems" aria-label="type systems permalink"></a>Type Systems</h2><p>A type system consists of a set of rules, or <em>typing judgements</em>, that assigns a type <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to an expression <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>e</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">e</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

We could have equally written this as <code>let x : t = e</code> - where the programmer <em>annotates</em> <code>x</code> with type <code>t</code>. e.g. <code>let x : int = 1 + 2</code>.</p><p>These lead to different typing algorithms - in the first case the compiler <em>infers</em> that <code>1+2</code> has type <code>int</code>, and in the second case, the compiler has to <em>check</em> that <code>1+2</code> has type <code>int</code> (since we specified the type <code>int</code> of <code>x</code>).</p><p>As you might imagine, type inference means that the programmer has to write fewer type annotations, but it is much more complex for the compiler - it’s like filling a Sudoku from scratch versus checking a Sudoku solution is valid. OCaml and Haskell are examples of languages with type inference baked in.</p><p>In practice, most statically-typed languages do require some type annotations, but can infer some types (e.g. the <code>auto</code> keyword in C++). This is like completing a partially solved Sudoku puzzle and is much easier.</p><p>For Bolt, we’re going to infer types <em>within</em> a function or method definition, but require programmers to annotate the parameter and return types. This is a nice middle ground.</p><div><p><span>example_function.bolt</span></p><div><pre><p><span>function</span><span> int </span><span>something</span><span>(</span><span>int x</span><span>,</span><span> bool y</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> z </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>...</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Okay, enough theory, let’s get to implementing this type-checker!</p><h2 id="implementing-a-type-checker"><a href="#implementing-a-type-checker" aria-label="implementing a type checker permalink"></a>Implementing a Type-checker</h2><h3 id="just-give-me-the-code"><a href="#just-give-me-the-code" aria-label="just give me the code permalink"></a>Just give me the code!</h3><p>You’ll need to clone the Bolt repository:</p><div><div><pre><p><span>git</span><span> clone https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt</span></p></pre></div></div><p>The <a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt">Bolt repository</a> <code>master</code> branch contains a more complex type-checker, with support for inheritance, function/method overloading and generics.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As in the lovely child’s quote found on the internet —</p><blockquote><p>I know everything. Except anything I don’t.</p></blockquote><p>— we think that we see everything around us. But we don’t. There are so many things that greatly affect our lives, yet we don’t aware of them. One type of such things is deep inside us — the flaws of our own thinking. Here is my top list of those flaws.</p><h2 id="1-wishful-thinking-conservatism-and-conformism"><strong>1. Wishful thinking, conservatism and conformism</strong></h2><p>By <em>wishful thinking</em> I don’t mean optimism, which is rather speculation about the future. Wishful thinking is when we put more weight on the present knowledge that is pleasant to us, and at the same time ignore the knowledge that is not so nice. For example, people like to ignore the knowledge that puts them in a bad light. This is clearly seen in toxic relationships, where an abuser justifies his actions by “the care” of its victim. A dictator probably thinks that he is doing the best for its nation, while completely ignoring his incapabilities and bad doings. The same is true for groups of people or even nations. An invasion is commonly portrayed as liberation.</p><p>On the other hand, anyone who had experienced an addiction probably knows how it can alter decision-making. “Vodka is an antiseptic, didn’t you know? Let’s drink those bottles so we’ll be healthier!” Gambler thinks that he is going to make money, so his family will be happy. An ordinary gamer thinks that other real affairs are not that important, so it’s ok to spend more time on the game.</p><p>This is just few examples, but such thinking is so common that I don’t think a single book will be enough to collect all different “use cases”.</p><hr><p>Another flaw of our thinking is <em>conservatism</em> — an insufficient ability to change our common views and beliefs with the new data, new evidence. This is understandable — changing basis views leads to a reconsideration of all related knowledge. An enormous amount of rebuilding is required. Our biological brains just can’t do that in a short time, also it’s much harder with age. Because of this, we give much more weight to old knowledge rather than new evidence, thus making a conservatism bias.</p><p>In our rapidly changing world, this problem will have even more impact.</p><hr><p><em>Conformism</em> is when we weigh our knowledge in accordance with our community. The effect of this is highly underrated. An ordinary human thinks that “her thoughts are her own”, without realizing to what extent they are shaped by a community. I think that we’re all conformists to some degree. And it’s hard to imagine what’s that means not to be. This is proved by numerous experiments with a group of actors and one unsuspicious testee, where actors trick the testee to make some ridiculous statements or to do some crazy actions, like the one described <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP22DpYYh8">here</a>. We are social creatures.</p><p>An extreme version of conformist thinking is the one imposed by religion. I’m not against religions in general, they can be useful, but a blind belief, an unquestioning subordination to “sacred” authorities — that’s just a disaster for a clear mind. A clear mind should have the ability to stress any dogmas.</p><h2 id="2-binary-black-and-white-thinking-overgeneralization"><strong>2. Binary (black-and-white) thinking, overgeneralization</strong></h2><p>Good-evil, smart-stupid, beautiful-ugly, tall-short, fast-slow, and so on and on. We think in binary terms. Our language reflects that. And some people are stuck very hard in such thinking. The worst case of it is <em>all-or-nothing</em> thinking, when any result other than the best is considered as a failure. It causes stress and depression in people. They don’t realize anymore why the world is so mean to them. They stop seeing how many gradients are there, and also how colorful our world is.</p><p>A similar flaw is <em>overgeneralization</em>. We put into the same category very broad types of information. Prejudice, labeling, stereotypes are all related to overgeneralization.</p><h2 id="3-self-projecting-thinking"><strong>3. Self-projecting thinking</strong></h2><p>Mind reading is an ability that everyone would like to have. It would be so easier to communicate. Also, it’s an advantage if we could read the thoughts of our rivals. While we can’t do it in reality, we’re still trying to predict other people’s thoughts, both in collaboration and confrontation.</p><p>To make such predictions we use two main assumptions:</p><ol><li>Other people see the same things as we do.</li><li>Other people are like us, thus their way of thinking is similar to ours.</li></ol><p>Based on these assumptions we use our way of thinking to deduce the thoughts of others. And this is very natural since we have to model another person’s thinking somehow. But the only model that we have is ours. It’s the only model that we can use. So, we essentially project our mind into another person’s head.</p><p>This has a fatal flaw. Because both main assumptions are only half true. While we see the same bits of the world, perception is a way more complex process. From bits we see high-order patterns, but they can be very personal. People could see different patterns and focus on different things. Also, the same bits (e.g. colors) can cause different emotions. Associations are also personal. The way we do conclusions is also very different in people because every person has its own experience, principles, beliefs, preferences, etc. We do not understand how unique the mind of every human.</p><p>And this causes a lot of trouble. People are fighting because of misunderstandings. In most situations they don’t realize, that they are fighting against their own reflection (from a distorting mirror).</p><h2 id="4-human-centric-thinking"><strong>4. Human-centric thinking</strong></h2><p>Humans are extremely focused on their own businesses. Yes, we are successful as a whole, in comparison to other creatures. But we are still part of nature. We follow its laws. Despite this, we neglect nature and the life of other species at scale.</p><p>Moreover, we value leaders, rulers and heroes amongst us much more than others. Even in fiction secondary characters usually die (who cares), while all hail goes to the main performers. We think that leaders are responsible for like 99% of the job done. Thus, we are trying to analyze them, rather than abstract patterns, situations and laws of nature. For example, from the popular culture it may look like Hitler was solely responsible for WWII and the Holocaust. Yeah, sure. How about WWI? Or any other war, genocide, mass conflict in human history? It’s silly to think that all these things were mainly because of leaders. This is just how humans work. In every moment in history there is a mix of wishes, intentions, beliefs, possibilities, thoughts of a total population. It could be that nature just picks a random guy as a leader that represents the mass.</p><p>On the other hand, we think that human is a singular, indivisible unit. That’s also not true. We are a composition of attributes, that are selected by evolution. Any child has some attributes from its mother and some attributes from its father. Human is a composable organism, the same is true for its mind. I’m sure that everyone experienced competing thoughts in his head. There is a natural selection of thoughts ongoing in the mind of every human.</p><h2 id="5-false-associations-confusion-of-causation-and-correlation"><strong>5. False associations, confusion of causation and correlation</strong></h2><p>Our thinking is associative, and we can make connections very fast based on very small data. A typical example is superstition, which is clearly seen in <a href="https://www.psychologistworld.com/superstition">pigeon experiments</a>.</p><p>Survival bias and filtering are accompanying flaws that lead to false associations. In probability theory, this is related to the fact that independent events are not necessary conditionally independent.</p><p>Even when our associations are quite objective we can make false conclusions about the causes. In fact, in probability theory and statistics the notion of a <em>cause</em> is not even defined. Events can be either correlated or independent in this theory. To deduce <em>what causes what</em> we use other tools, like common sense, physics, etc. Typically, to deduce a causation from two correlated events, we check two main things:</p><ol><li>One event is earlier in time than another one.</li><li>There is no common cause that could explain the correlation.</li></ol><p>This is hard stuff even for scientists. Because you have to exclude any possible common cause. Earlier we could use physical locality of events to exclude a lot of possible common causes. But with the advance of quantum mechanics, even locality is not a reliable factor anymore.</p><h2 id="final-words"><strong>Final words</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of other flaws, if you want to learn more you can start <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias">here</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion">here</a>. But those described above I find the most impactful. I feel them myself and meet them all the time.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>While every IT environment is not the same, secret management is one of the things that remains constant.<br>
Whether it is an application, automation script, CI/CD pipeline, they all rely on some form of credentials to access other services or data.</p>

<p><strong>HashiCorp Vault</strong> is a prominent tool in this particular area. It is used for securely storing tokens, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys, while it tightly controls access to that data by authenticating against trusted sources of identity.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to install Vault with <a href="https://github.com/jsiebens/hashi-up" target="_blank"><strong>hashi-up</strong></a>, a small tool I’m working on from time to time, to install the HashiCorp tools on any remote host via SSH.<br>
At the start of the project, only Consul and Nomad was supported, but with the latest release, Vault can be installed as well.</p>

<h2 id="set-up-a-single-vault-server-on-digitalocean">Set up a single Vault server on DigitalOcean</h2>

<p>There are several ways to provision the resources we need for the tutorial, like using the DigitalOcean dashboard or CLI, or tools like <a href="https://terraform.io/" target="_blank">HashiCorp Terraform</a>.</p>

<p>Because we only need a few resources, I’ll continue using the CLI (<code>doctl</code>).</p>

<p>Add your SSH key to your DigitalOcean dashboard, then find out the ID of the SSH key. We will need it later when we are using SSH to install Vault.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ doctl compute ssh-key list
ID          Name          FingerPrint
<span>28960471</span>    operator      3b:6e:09:b7:d8:ac:84:e1:cf:15:89:e3:3d:13:9e:39</code></pre></div>
<p>And make it available for the next commands:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">export SSH_KEY<span>=</span><span>'28960471'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Provision a new VM with a compatible operating system such as Ubuntu or something else and make sure you a register your SSH key to this new host.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ doctl compute droplet create --image ubuntu-18-04-x64 --size s-1vcpu-2gb --region lon1 vault --tag-names vault --wait --ssh-keys $SSH_KEY

<p>Next, use hashi-up to bootstrap a Vault server over SSH:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ hashi-up vault install --ssh-target-addr <span>165</span>.232.109.36 --version <span>1</span>.6.0
Uploading Vault configuration and certificates...
Installing Vault...

<blockquote>
<p><strong>How does hashi-up install Vault?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it starts an SSH session to your target host<br></li>
<li>it generates a Vault configuration file, based on the commandline flags, and uploads the result via SCP<br></li>
<li>on the remote host, it downloads the Vault distribution and places the binary in the correct directory<br></li>
<li>it creates a vault user and some directories, like <code>/etc/vault.d</code> and <code>/opt/vault</code><br></li>
<li>it generates a systemd service file for Vault<br></li>
<li>it enables and starts this new systemd service<br></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Open a browser and go to http://&lt;public ip&gt;:8200 and, eureka! Time to unseal this freshly installed Vault and start managing those secrets.</p>

</figure>


<p>But wait a minute… a secret management tool running with plain HTTP and no HTTPS? That doesn’t sound like a good idea, right?</p>

<p>Grab yourself a certificate or generate a self-signed one with hashi-up:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ hashi-up cert create --host <span>165</span>.232.109.36 --host vault.example.com
<span>2020</span>/12/02 <span>17</span>:39:06 wrote server.pem
<span>2020</span>/12/02 <span>17</span>:39:06 wrote server-key.pem</code></pre></div>
<p>And rerun the previous install command with some extra flags to upload the key and certificate. No worries, it will just update the Vault configuration and restart the service:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ hashi-up vault install --ssh-target-addr <span>165</span>.232.109.36 --version <span>1</span>.6.0 --key-file<span>=</span>server-key.pem --cert-file<span>=</span>server.pem
Uploading Vault configuration and certificates...
Installing Vault...
<span>[</span>INFO<span>]</span>  User vault already exists. Will not create again.
<span>[</span>INFO<span>]</span>  Vault binary already installed in /usr/local/bin, skipping downloading and installing binary

<span>[</span>INFO<span>]</span>  Enabling vault unit
<span>[</span>INFO<span>]</span>  Starting vault</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that’s more like, HTTPS enabled!</p>

<h3 id="set-up-an-ha-vault-cluster-on-digitalocean">Set up an HA Vault cluster on DigitalOcean</h3>

<p>A single Vault server is already nice to get started, but if our VM crashes for some reason, our secret management service will suffer a total failure. Vault supports a multi-server mode for high availability. This will protect you against outages and is automatically enabled when using a storage that supports it.</p>

<p>By default, hashi-up will install Vault configured with a Filesystem Backend which lacks support for high availability. But with hashi-up, you have the possibility to select the Consul Storage Backend.</p>

<p>The architecture we aim for is a Vault HA setup consisting of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cluster of 3 Consul servers<br></li>
<li>2 Vault servers: 1 active and 1 standby</li>
</ul>

        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>For this Vault cluster, we will use a dedicated VPC:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ doctl vpcs create --name vault-ha --region ams3
ID                                      URN                                            Name        Description    IP Range         Region    Created At                                 Default

<p>Create 3 nodes for the Consul servers:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">doctl compute droplet create --image ubuntu-18-04-x64 --size s-1vcpu-2gb --region ams3 consul-01 --tag-names consul-server --vpc-uuid $VPC_ID --ssh-keys $SSH_KEY
doctl compute droplet create --image ubuntu-18-04-x64 --size s-1vcpu-2gb --region ams3 consul-02 --tag-names consul-server --vpc-uuid $VPC_ID --ssh-keys $SSH_KEY
doctl compute droplet create --image ubuntu-18-04-x64 --size s-1vcpu-2gb --region ams3 consul-03 --tag-names consul-server --vpc-uuid $VPC_ID --ssh-keys $SSH_KEY</code></pre></div>
<p>Consul will use the tags attached for automatically joining other nodes using cloud metadata. This feature is called Consul Auto-join.</p>

<p>Create 2 nodes for the Vault servers:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">doctl compute droplet create --image ubuntu-18-04-x64 --size s-1vcpu-2gb --region ams3 vault-01 --tag-names vault --vpc-uuid $VPC_ID --ssh-keys $SSH_KEY
doctl compute droplet create --image ubuntu-18-04-x64 --size s-1vcpu-2gb --region ams3 vault-02 --tag-names vault --vpc-uuid $VPC_ID --ssh-keys $SSH_KEY</code></pre></div>
<p>Now first bootstrap the Consul cluster:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">export DO_API_TOKEN<span>=</span>&lt;your token&gt;

export SERVER1<span>=</span><span>$(</span>doctl compute droplet list | grep consul-01 | tr -s <span>' '</span> | cut -d <span>' '</span> -f <span>3</span><span>)</span>
export SERVER2<span>=</span><span>$(</span>doctl compute droplet list | grep consul-02 | tr -s <span>' '</span> | cut -d <span>' '</span> -f <span>3</span><span>)</span>
export SERVER3<span>=</span><span>$(</span>doctl compute droplet list | grep consul-03 | tr -s <span>' '</span> | cut -d <span>' '</span> -f <span>3</span><span>)</span>

hashi-up consul install --ssh-target-addr $SERVER1 <span>\
</span><span></span>  --server <span>\
</span><span></span>  --advertise <span>"{{ GetInterfaceIP \"eth1\" }}"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --bootstrap-expect <span>3</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --retry-join <span>"provider=digitalocean region=ams3 tag_name=consul-server api_token=</span>$DO_API_TOKEN<span>"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --client <span>0</span>.0.0.0

hashi-up consul install --ssh-target-addr $SERVER2 <span>\
</span><span></span>  --server <span>\
</span><span></span>  --advertise <span>"{{ GetInterfaceIP \"eth1\" }}"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --bootstrap-expect <span>3</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --retry-join <span>"provider=digitalocean region=ams3 tag_name=consul-server api_token=</span>$DO_API_TOKEN<span>"</span>

hashi-up consul install --ssh-target-addr $SERVER3 <span>\
</span><span></span>  --server <span>\
</span><span></span>  --advertise <span>"{{ GetInterfaceIP \"eth1\" }}"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --bootstrap-expect <span>3</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --retry-join <span>"provider=digitalocean region=ams3 tag_name=consul-server api_token=</span>$DO_API_TOKEN<span>"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>At this moment, you should have a Consul cluster running.</p>

<p>For the Vault cluster, besides a Vault service, also a Consul client needs to be installed:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">export SERVER1<span>=</span><span>$(</span>doctl compute droplet list | grep vault-01 | tr -s <span>' '</span> | cut -d <span>' '</span> -f <span>3</span><span>)</span>
export SERVER2<span>=</span><span>$(</span>doctl compute droplet list | grep vault-02 | tr -s <span>' '</span> | cut -d <span>' '</span> -f <span>3</span><span>)</span>

export PRIVATE_IP1<span>=</span><span>$(</span>doctl compute droplet list | grep vault-01 | tr -s <span>' '</span> | cut -d <span>' '</span> -f <span>4</span><span>)</span>
export PRIVATE_IP2<span>=</span><span>$(</span>doctl compute droplet list | grep vault-01 | tr -s <span>' '</span> | cut -d <span>' '</span> -f <span>4</span><span>)</span>

hashi-up consul install --ssh-target-addr $SERVER1 <span>\
</span><span></span>  --advertise <span>"{{ GetInterfaceIP \"eth1\" }}"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --retry-join <span>"provider=digitalocean region=ams3 tag_name=consul-server api_token=</span>$DO_API_TOKEN<span>"</span>

hashi-up consul install --ssh-target-addr $SERVER2 <span>\
</span><span></span>  --advertise <span>"{{ GetInterfaceIP \"eth1\" }}"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --retry-join <span>"provider=digitalocean region=ams3 tag_name=consul-server api_token=</span>$DO_API_TOKEN<span>"</span>

hashi-up vault install --ssh-target-addr $SERVER1 --version <span>1</span>.6.0 --api-addr http://$SERVER1:8200 --cluster-addr http://$PRIVATE_IP1:8201 --storage consul
hashi-up vault install --ssh-target-addr $SERVER2 --version <span>1</span>.6.0 --api-addr http://$SERVER2:8200 --cluster-addr http://$PRIVATE_IP2:8201 --storage consul</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, you can initialize Vault and unseal each server.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ vault operator init
$ vault operator unseal &lt;unseal_key_x&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>This prepares the storage in Consul, which is then addressed by the active Vault server. It also generates a master key and disassemble that master key in several key shares. Each Vault server in the cluster can use these unseal keys, and each Vault server must be unsealed before it can be used.</p>

<p>Unseal both servers and finally verify the HA status.</p>

<p>As a startup founder, you get pulled in a million different directions from the moment you start your company. It can be overwhelming to have to learn so many new skills at once: raising funds, hiring a team, managing people.</p>
<p>Before I started <a href="https://draft.dev/">Draft.dev</a> earlier this year, I spent almost a decade working with startups, reading, and preparing myself to run a business. I worked with some great people, met fantastic mentors, and read some outstanding books that gave me the confidence to go out on my own. In this post, I’ll give you my list of the best startup books available today.</p>
<h2 id="early-stage-startups">Early-Stage Startups</h2>
<p>This category includes books for people who are just starting out. If you are building your first product or raising the first round of funding, these books will provide you with a good starting point.</p>
<h3 id="founders-at-work-stories-of-startups-early-days"><a href="https://amzn.to/390FASS">Founders at Work: Stories of Startups’ Early Days</a></h3>
<p>What I love about this book is that it shows you how several popular technology companies started out. The book is a collection of interviews with founders of Paypal, Hotmail, Apple, and other giants of our era. It’s interesting to see where they got the ideas that eventually made them household names and how they recovered from various difficulties along the way.</p>
<p>“If you’re thinking about entrepreneurship you should read this book to get familiar with the possibilities, both the positives and the challenges. From the success arrived by a detour to the success of following a dedicated plan. There’s much to absorb and it’s just plain interesting.”</p>
<h3 id="the-innovators-dilemma"><a href="https://amzn.to/3nxL9fs">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a></h3>
<p>Written by the Harward professor and businessman Clayton Christensen, The Innovator’s Dilemma is one of the most important business books on the market. It explains how mammoth, successful companies can lose market leadership in a blink of an eye as new competitors rise and become dominant in emerging segments of their market.</p>
<p>“Christensen shows that successful innovation is not unpredictable. This comes with the recognition, however, that “data only exist about the past” and hence what is working in the present for leading firms need not apply to disruptive firms of the future. This paradigm necessarily applies to all companies and is not exclusive to technological ones.”</p>
<h3 id="the-lean-startup"><a href="https://amzn.to/2KhETKk">The Lean Startup</a></h3>
<p>We live in an age where technology changes rapidly and quickly changes the market around it. This means that sometimes, you have to move fast to avoid getting swallowed up by innovation. In The Lean Startup, Ries talks about his own business failure and how he spent too much time on the initial product launch instead of focusing on validating the market.</p>
<p>“This book focuses on giving an overview of Lean methods and convincing you why you should use them. It uses a lot of examples, mainly from startups. Some of the best examples come from the author’s own experience, and his company continues to do well.”</p>
<h3 id="zero-to-one-notes-on-startups-or-how-to-build-the-future"><a href="https://amzn.to/3fg4EWN">Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3fg4EWN"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eN4XABh.jpg" alt="Zero to One book cover"></a></p>
<p>I don’t love Peter Thiel’s politics, but I do like how he pushes readers to think for themselves. He explains that you don’t necessarily have to fight the competition to be the leader in the market. Instead, by thinking out of the box and creating a brand new market, you can become a leader with no competition at all. With a unique idea, you can escape the rivals and focus completely on your unique value proposition.</p>
<p>“Let me assure you that Zero to One is worth reading, even if you’re not engaged in the world of startups and venture capital. It’s worth reading in the same way a triple espresso is worth drinking: it makes you feel superhuman, at least for the moment. You can almost hear the caffeine coursing through your veins as you absorb the ideas.”</p>
<h3 id="the-art-of-the-start"><a href="https://amzn.to/38YBhXT">The Art of the Start</a></h3>
<p>Although named “The Art of the Start,” this book covers various business areas, including the art of launching, positioning, socializing, and marketing your startup. In 13 easy-to-read chapters, Guy Kawasaki talks about crucial topics for startup founders like finding a business idea, finding the right co-founder, writing a vision statement, and defining your business model.</p>
<p>“Never assume you’re done. Recruiting doesn’t stop when a candidate accepts your offer, nor when he resigns from his current employer, nor on his last day at his current employer—not even after he starts at your organization. In actuality, recruiting never stops. Every day is a new contract between a startup and an employee.”</p>
<h3 id="the-startup-owners-manual"><a href="https://amzn.to/3nxLiQ2">The Startup Owner’s Manual</a></h3>
<p>With over a hundred charts, graphs, and valuable checklists, this book helps startup founders in many ways. For example, it teaches you how to avoid “deadly sins” that lead your business to failure and how to drive your company to repeatable and scalable profits. The methods in this book were created by Steve Blank, a famous Silicon Valley startup, and were tested by him for more than a decade.</p>
<p>“Best entrepreneur book period. If you liked Lean Startup (another great read/education) you’ll love this one by Steve Blank. He taught those guys. I love how the author really reset your approach and lays out a clear plan on how to test and scale.”</p>
<h2 id="growth-stage-startups">Growth Stage Startups</h2>
<p>Books in this category will teach you how to grow your business from the first few customers to wider adoption. These will also help you sell high-dollar products and scale your sales to the next level.</p>
<h3 id="crossing-the-chasm-marketing-and-selling-high-tech-products-to-mainstream-customers"><a href="https://amzn.to/2UL4oWm">Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling High-Tech Products to Mainstream Customers</a></h3>
<p>I first read this classic over a decade ago. It explains the way products move to progressively more mainstream markets and how you can cross the “chasm” from early adopters to these lucrative mass markets. Although technology changes rapidly, the principles in Crossing the Chasm can still be applied in the software industry today.</p>
<p>“The author’s emphasis is on distinguishing between the selling and marketing tactics for the early innovators versus mainstream customers. There is a chasm between the innovators and mainstream market and the author dedicates the book outlining the various steps a high tech company should perform to successfully navigate through the chasm.”</p>
<h3 id="hacking-growth-how-todays-fastest-growing-companies-drive-breakout-success"><a href="https://amzn.to/35Mrz99">Hacking Growth: How Today’s Fastest-Growing Companies Drive Breakout Success</a></h3>
<p>Ever wonder why Facebook unseated early entrants like MySpace to become the number one social network? Or how Uber succeeded despite seeming to have no chance against New York’s Yellow Cabs? With the proper methodology - known as “growth hacking” - they became the giants of our era. Sean and Morgan’s stories inspired me, and I recommend this book to any founder who will handle marketing.</p>
<p>“The authors walk the reader through each stage of building a growth machine, give examples from real companies, and, the best part, they apply this process to a hypothetical scenario/product so you can see what it would look like from beginning to end.”</p>
<h3 id="the-hard-thing-about-hard-things"><a href="https://amzn.to/3fjCUAS">The Hard Thing About Hard Things</a></h3>
<p>This book is a collection of stories from the career of Ben Horowitz, one of the most respected entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley. It reveals problems that he faced during his journey from being a founder to becoming an investor. It analyzes difficulties that confront leaders every day, related to management, selling, investment, and staying balanced.</p>
<p>“If you’re planning to start a company, whether it’s a high-tech company or the kinds of companies that I started and ran, read this book. If you’re going to be someone in charge of anything in any kind of a company, read this book.”</p>
<h3 id="great-at-work-how-top-performers-do-less-work-better-and-achieve-more"><a href="https://amzn.to/2IXvYNp">Great at Work: How Top Performers Do Less, Work Better, and Achieve More</a></h3>
<p>Early in my career, I worked too much on too many projects. It took me nearly a decade to figure out that putting hours into <em>the right</em> things was the key. This book debunks the myth of multitasking, talks about coordinating between priorities, and reveals how to make your work time more productive.</p>
<p>“With the massive amount of business books published every year, it’s tough to find a book with some original ideas. This book is one of those. What’s great about it is that there isn’t a lot of fluff and the book gets to the points of what can help one become a great performer. I would recommend this book to any leader out there who wants to help his or her team grow and become more, with less of the wrong kind of work.”</p>
<h2 id="hiring-and-management">Hiring and Management</h2>
<p>At some point in running a business, you will have to build a team of professionals around you. You will likely move into management, which requires an entirely new set of skills. These books helped me out, and I’m sure you will find them useful, too.</p>
<h3 id="recruit-rockstars-the-10-step-playbook-to-find-the-winners-and-ignite-your-business"><a href="https://amzn.to/3fjDuP4">Recruit Rockstars: The 10 Step Playbook to Find the Winners and Ignite Your Business</a></h3>
<p>I learned the hard way that <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/hiring-process">many business-related problems have their roots in poor hiring practices</a>. Instead of hiring consistent A-players, many startup founders rush to assemble half-hearted teams that are bound to fail. Hyman shows his ten practical steps to recruiting top talent in this book. My favorite part was about choosing employees based on data instead of gut feeling, and I used this to create <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/posts/hiring-rubric">my first hiring rubric at Draft.dev</a>.</p>
<p>“This is the recruitment guide that every startup needs to read. It’s especially valuable for people who might not have a background in recruiting but find themselves in a position where they need to hire the best. Recruit Rockstars is a clear and concise guide that won’t waste your time and gives you the recruitment background you need. I can’t recommend this book enough!”</p>
<h3 id="high-output-management"><a href="https://amzn.to/393d7eX">High Output Management</a></h3>
<p>Written by the former chairman of Intel, this book shows startup founders how to build highly productive teams that lead the company to peak performance. Management isn’t about posturing or power-struggles. It’s about getting results.</p>

<p>“The author emphasizes the importance of judging managers based on the output that they achieve, which is an accumulation of the outputs of the people that work for them. He also focuses on the importance of continuing to improve yourself and strive to be better. He rightly points out that nobody owes you …</p></div></article></section></div>

The sheer amount of outlandish things that left the kitchen of providence ruined a lot of appetites, but made for some excellent servings of memes.</p><p>And some, me included, wonder if the year is done with its menu of &nbsp;surprises.</p><p>Here's a small sample of some of the crazy shit that happened;</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-07/world-war-3-qassem-soleimani-trump-us-and-iran/11841254">Threats of WW3 </a></li><li><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-50951043">Crazy wild fires in Auz</a></li><li><a href="https://abc7news.com/bay-area-skies-smoke-in-the-air-today-orange-apocalyptic/6416218/">Crazy wild fires in California</a></li><li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-timeline-idUSL1N2GN04J">A world-wide pandemic</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_lockdowns">world-wide, months-long lockdowns</a></li><li><a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2165713/statement-by-the-department-of-defense-on-the-release-of-historical-navy-videos/">The pentagon officially releasing UFO videos</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/07/disappearing-star-supernova-galaxy/613699/">A huge, old star just poofed out of existence</a></li><li><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/harry-meghan-to-quit-royal-jobs-give-up-highness-titles#:~:text=Prince%20Harry%20and%20his%20wife,announced%20Saturday%20by%20Buckingham%20Palace.&amp;text=They%20will%20be%20known%20as,and%20Meghan%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Sussex.">Prince Harry quit the royal family</a></li><li><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/inside-twitter-hack-election-plan/">A random teenager hacked the twitter accounts of Joe Biden, Joe Rogan, Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Kanye West</a></li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.riknieu.com/content/images/2020/11/jokes-about-2020-5edf2d2423557__700.jpg" alt="2020: Very bad, would not recommend."><figcaption>2020: 1 star. Very bad, would not recommend</figcaption></figure><p>This year proved that uncertainty is always around, ready to pounce. With this post, I want to explore uncertainty and how it affects our experience of life. </p><p>Why are we always surprised by uncertainty and change? Why do we hope for some things to change and expect others to never change at all. Why do we inflict pain on ourselves and others by identifying with things and assuming them to be permanent truths when they are, in fact, neither?</p><h3 id="covid">COVID </h3><p>An obvious place to start would be an exploration of this little pandemic we're all experiencing. COVID19 has rolled out quite a lot of turbulence over our global society. </p><p>Mask-wearing is no longer something that only a select few Asian countries do. Last year this time, in most places in the world, you would have been regarded with suspicion if you entered public spaces with half your face deliberately hidden.</p><p>Security would have surely tailed you in the malls, and young mothers with infants would have scampered out of your way in the dairy isle. But now, practically everywhere, it's legally <em>mandated</em> that you peer at strangers over a piece of cloth in public, like a bandit or dentist.</p><p>Working remotely has also become commonplace, where it had previously been something only the weird and vagabond do. I myself now perform my duties this way for a company that previously did not even consider it a remote possibility. </p><p>The lockdown came and taught us a lot of things. Some of it good, like that remote work is possible, realistic, and even, perhaps, more productive. <a href="https://www.insider.com/photos-videos-earth-planet-thriving-coronavirus-2020-4">That nature can recover quite quickly</a>, if we but gave her a chance.</p><p>But we also learned that governments could and would force everyone to stay at home, stop working, and stop interacting with friends and family. They could and would force conditions that threatened to kill entire industries and a scary amount of companies and jobs. And we learned that populations, as a whole, will simply comply and go along with these directions.</p><p>And COVID is likely not done yet, and I'm not even referring to a second wave. Quite a lot of people I've spoken with reckon that most of the economic and societal fallout due from even the first one is still yet to come. Like electricity in the air, everyone can feel a storm is brewing.</p><p>COVID has was pretty effective in its disruption of whole societies and cultures in an instant. But there are other more mundane ways uncertainty and change expresses itself if our lives, whether we like it or not.</p><h3 id="moving-can-be-quite-disruptive">Moving can be quite disruptive</h3><p>For instance, I moved to a new residence recently. It was sudden and unexpected, and revealed exactly how much I personally rely on routine and the familiar to feel relaxed and in control of my life.</p><p>Having to change where you call home and mentally adjust who you consider your community can be quite disruptive. It's like it dislodges little pieces of your identity that you didn't consider before.</p><p>What you like, dislike or get used to about your everyday life are like pieces of Lego blocks, and these little conceptualisations eventually assemble themselves into what you consider yourself. They click together into a tapestry of assumed identity and you take them to be statements of who <em>you</em> are. "I am someone who gets up and exercises at 5am", "I am Californian", "I like this brand of coffee", "I listen to that podcast on my commute", "I am happy when it rains in the afternoon".</p><p>These are little behavioural heuristics we adopt to help smooth out and automate decision-making in our daily lives, creating concealed yet interlinked chains of dependencies that we experience as a sense of control and consistency. They are webs of reassurance. They make us feel that things are as they should be, we can relax. </p><p>This is how they catch and trap us. </p><p>Out of ignorance we weave together an assumed reality and take it for a dependable Truth.</p><p>When you move, a portion of that goes out of the window. You'd be surprised how many of those little circumstantial components you unconsciously adopted as part of your identity gets shaken loose when you just move your domicile. It's can be a little bit like going to a foreign country and experiencing severe culture shock. Your very identity is now suddenly on shaky ground and full of holes.</p><p>You need to actually think about things again that, just a day before, were so certain and True that they were not even worth a second of reflection. </p><p>I now need to deal with mosquitos all hours of the day where this wasn't an issue I needed to contend with last week. Then I was a peace loving being, in harmony with nature. Now I can be an annoyed, angry person that wants to deal out death with slaps of spite. That's extra mental energy and patience I'm having to expend, and it forms into internal conflict.</p><p>Cumulatively these form daily drips of discomfort. And discomfort can eventually build up into pain and suffering.</p><p>But let's get back to larger scale changes again. What if the stability of our entire society and community crumbles?</p><h3 id="worlds-that-were-eternal-but-now-aren-t">Worlds that were eternal but now aren't</h3><p>Think about the world. Who are the major powers, what conclusions can you draw about how things will likely play out in the future, and what is your own community's place is in this world?</p><p>These are assumptions that you use to make long-term decisions to try and ensure the safety and happiness of your self, your family, and community.</p><p>Now take those assumptions, crumble then up and throw the lot in the trash, because as I shall explain, nothing in the world is for sure, not even the world order as you know it.</p><p>History is rife with examples of the seemingly invulnerable superpowers and empires crumbling into dust in mere decades, if not faster. Recent examples include Yugoslavia and the USSR. I have friend who personally lived through the disintegration and disappearance of the former. In the 60s and 70s, the complete collapse of the latter in <em>a mere 30 years</em> would have seemed very, <em>very</em> unlikely.</p><p>What happened to the British Empire? The Austria-Hungary Empire, the Ottoman Empire? All of these were major, world-shaking powers only a lifetime or so ago.</p><p>But let's go back a bit further and look at societies that must have felt to be even more eternal to their citizens. </p><p>Would it have been conceivable to the Aztec's Montezuma, that the strange-looking European Hernán Cortés and his odd band of men would in 8 months be able to lay utter waste to an almost 180 year old empire? That their entire culture, religion and history would be swept away in what must have felt like an instant torrent of blood, tears and immeasurable misery. </p><p>And it wasn't just them, the Spanish invasion of the New World would eventually destroy the entire way of life and culture of many people that had first ventured into the Americas 20K+ years ago.</p><p>In the old world, more examples; Assyria lasted 756 years as one of the most powerful superpowers in its region. That is a long-ass time. How could it end? What did it feel like for citizens when Assyria fell?</p><p>The Roman empire, if you include Byzantium, lasted just under 1500 years! Can you even comprehend that? Can you imagine living in that society and someone suggested that, one day, the Roman Empire would be no more. No Roman citizen would have believed such nonsense. It would have been inconceivable.</p><p>Even more so Sumer, which existed for 2000 years before it was in ruins. Egypt was a de facto world power of the 'known' world for 30 centuries. Where are they now? </p><p>And take my word for it, the current batch of powerful and "invincible" countries will all be gone one day too. Current incarnations of the US, China, Germany, Russia - all of them will one day be no more, and replaced with other, different societies.</p><p>Consider your own country. If you strongly identify with your nation and your culture, and feel <em>particularly</em> nationalistic, think about what it could mean if one day your country would be no more too. </p><p>And consider that your decedents who would be around then would also be very proud to belong to whatever community would have come into existence then. They would be proud to be <em>something </em>completely different to<em> </em>that that which you now hold so dear. They will be part of another nation, another people. They would be like foreigners, your children's children's children.</p><p>You might feel particularly proud and protective of your culture and religion, but consider that your ancestors would possibly be aghast that you, their kin, their very bloodline, now cling to and defend a religion and culture that awful, merciless enemies came and forced unto them, when they came and conquered their lands and destroyed their communities. This happened countless times throughout history and almost certainly happened to your own family if you go back far enough.</p><p>I'm writing this in Roman characters, living in a society who's laws were built on Roman law, and who's very fabric is structured around things invented by the Romans. But my ancestors were mostly from the barbarians up in northern Europe, who got conquered, decimated, and sold into slavery by the Romans. </p><p>What would they think of me now, this bastardised Roman-Germanic decedent of theirs, living in a far-off land, with a culture, language, values and word view so foreign to …</p></section></div>

                    <h2 id="i">I</h2><p>When Sweden announced their laissez-faire approach to COVID-19, experts, and politicians around the world, were in disbelief. Without a lockdown and mandatory masks, this could only end in a disaster. The famous model used to justify the lockdown in the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/neil-ferguson-transformed-uk-covid-response-oxford-challenge-imperial-model-2020-4?r=DE&amp;IR=T">UK and many other countries</a>, predicted 100.000 deaths by June if Sweden did not follow all the other countries and institute strict measures. It is now November, and at the time of writing, 6,972 people have died in Sweden from COVID-19. So what happened?</p><h2 id="ii">II</h2><p>Let’s take a step back and look at the famous model, which was the basis for many of the government measures back in March as well as for the 100.000 death prediction: The Imperial Model. It was developed by Neil Fergusson and his team at the Imperial College London.</p><p>The involvement of Neils Fergusson should already have raised doubts about the validity of the model because his track record, and there is no other way to say this, is terrible. If you think it cannot be that bad, you are in for a surprise.</p><p>We will do what <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/neil-ferguson-transformed-uk-covid-response-oxford-challenge-imperial-model-2020-4?r=DE&amp;IR=T">Business Insider</a> promised back in April:</p><blockquote>Here's what we know about “Professor Lockdown” and the gold standard in science that is Imperial College.</blockquote><p>Of course, they did not mention his past predictions, and the “gold standard” turned out to be fake gold, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. His past predictions:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Ferguson-Estimating-the-human-health-risk-from-possible-BSE-infection-of-the-British-sheep-flock.pdf">In 2002</a>, Ferguson predicted that up to 150,000 people could die from exposure to BSE (mad cow disease) in the U.K. There were only 177 deaths.</li><li><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/professor-lockdown-modeler-resigns-in-disgrace/">In 2009</a>, Ferguson predicted that the bird flu could kill 150 million people. 282 people died worldwide.</li><li><a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/six-questions-that-neil-ferguson-should-be-asked">In 2009</a>, Ferguson predicted as a “reasonable worst-case scenario” that the swine flu would kill 65,000 people in Britain. It killed 457.</li></ul><p>I think that is enough about our “Professor Lockdown.” We want to focus more on the model and “the gold standard in science that is Imperial College.”</p><h2 id="iii">III</h2><p>One reason why nobody doubted the model was that it was secret—always a smart move. When on March 16, 2020, Neil and his team published their paper, they did not publish their code. Yes, you read that correctly. Their paper made several policy recommendations based on predictions of a model <em>they did not publish</em>. So there was no way of knowing if their claims were true or false. They were simply baseless claims without any evidence.</p><p>To me, this destroys any trustworthiness Neil Ferguson might have had left. One hallmark of science is independent verifiability. Without others being able to verify the claims and run the model themselves, it is not science; it is pseudo-science with a strong appeal to authority.</p><p>On April 27, over one month after the paper in question was published, they finally released their code on <a href="https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim">GitHub</a>. However, it turns out that they did not release the original code used to generate the predictions in their paper. The released version was edited by software engineers of GitHub to make it acceptable:</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Before the GitHub team started working on the code it was a single 15k line C file that had been worked on for a decade, and some of the functions looked like they were machine translated from Fortran. There are some tropes about academic code that have grains of truth, but \</p>— John Carmack (@ID_AA_Carmack) <a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1254872369556074496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>As you can read in this Tweet, the original code was “a single 15k line C file that had been worked on for a decade.” Everyone with a little bit of knowledge about software engineering should be shocked. A single 15000 line C file is beyond bad practice.</p><p>But even GitHubs’s engineers could not salvage the code. The released version is still riddled with bugs and random equations that literally nobody can explain. Moreover, even if the released code were exactly the code used in the paper, no one could have replicated the results because the input parameters used in the paper were not published. As the <a href="https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim/tree/master/data">GitHub page</a> reads:</p><blockquote>IMPORTANT: The parameter files are provided as a sample only and do not necessarily reflect runs used in published papers.</blockquote><p>At this point, we are long past science, with a small s, and far into the world of Science, with a capital S. The latter is the world where the term “Believe the Science” makes sense. While science (small s) is the process of doubting everything, disregarding authority, and searching for the truth, Science (capital S) is where the truth is determined by fiat, and your job is to believe, not question it. But I digress.</p><h2 id="iv">IV</h2><p>After several issues around the non-deterministic behavior of the model were brought up on GitHub, the team responded with an <a href="https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim/issues/116#issuecomment-617304550">interesting answer</a>:</p><blockquote>We are aware of some small non-determinisms when using multiple threads to set up the network of people and places. (Look for the omp critical pragmas in the code). This has historically been considered acceptable because of the general stochastic nature of the model.</blockquote><p>Non-deterministic means that given the same input, you do not always get the same output (non-deterministic behavior is not necessarily bad; only in cases like this where it is not explainable). Their answer to this problem was that it does not matter because the model is “stochastic,” which is just a fancy word for saying that they run the model multiple times and average over all the outcomes.</p><p>Every time a new issue around non-determinism came up or a different bug was discovered, the team’s answer was the <a href="https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim/issues/30">same</a>:</p><blockquote>This isn’t a problem running the model in full as it is stochastic anyway.</blockquote><p>But is this really true? You do not have to worry about bugs because “it is stochastic anyway”? The answer is, obviously, no.</p><p>To understand this stochastic magic better, let’s take a look at an example: baking a cake. If we weigh flour, we might weigh it several times and then average over all these measurements—only if we are nerds and want to follow the recipe particularly closely, of course. But why does this give us a more accurate result? The answer is that if, for example, we make an error when reading from the scale (imagine an old analog scale), then an error in one direction (more) is as likely as an error in the other direction (less). In other words, if the flour weighs 100 grams, you are just as likely to mistake it for 102 g the first time, and 98 g the next. Only if we make mistakes sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another, averaging out works. Otherwise, <em>it does not</em>. If your scale is broken, and always shows five grams more, averaging does not help you.</p><p>The same is true for bugs. If, and only if, we could be sure that the bugs distort the output sometimes upwards and sometimes downwards (preferably with equal probability and magnitude), we could solve the problem by running the model “stochastically.” However, this is not the case because, by definition, we do not know how bugs affect the code; otherwise we would understand them and probably be able to fix them. The point is that nobody, including the “scientists” who produced this model, can know how those bugs affect the code.</p><p>Do not get me wrong, stochastic models are not necessarily like this. Most of the time, if the model is not too complicated (we will get to this point later), small changes in the input create small changes in the output, and the randomness in the output stems from intentionally included pseudo-randomness. However, this model is not non-deterministic in the predictable (explainable) mathematical sense. It is non-deterministic in the angry-toddler-in-a-toy-store sense: nobody knows what is going to happen, and there is no way to replicate it. <a href="https://medium.com/@allenfarrington/simple-truths-and-complex-nonsense-2e1c28ae6f29">Put differently</a>:</p><blockquote>It has nondeterministic outputs that do not follow from seeded pseudorandomness but are rather an inexplicable part of the process. I am not using “inexplicable” rhetorically here: nobody can explain this. This is one of the great issues in Complexity Science. Clearly there is a stark mathematical difference between deterministic and non-deterministic. But there is also a fuzzy, and arguably more important, difference between non-deterministic and really, really, really NON-DETERMINISTIC.</blockquote><p>Unfortunately, the Imperial Model falls into the latter category.</p><h2 id="v">V</h2><p>Alright, a summary of what we have learned so far: the code was not released with the paper; the released code is not the code used in the paper; the original code was a single 15 thousand line C file; the model is non-deterministic bordering on chaotic; the parameters released are not the parameters used in the paper; the code is riddled with bugs. An impressive list for a “scientific” model that informed government decisions on life and death.</p><h2 id="vi">VI</h2><p>But what about the model without the code? Sure, the code that implements the model is awful, but maybe they have figured out a great way to model pandemics and just need better software engineering to make it work. Sadly, this is not the case.</p><p>Do you remember the parameters that were <em>not</em> provided so nobody could replicate the results of the paper? It turns out that the model has 450 input parameters. Let me say it again: the model depends on <em>450 (!!!)</em> parameters. Nobody can understand a model with this many parameters. And it gets even worse because as it turns out, complex systems like pandemics have many interdependencies, which complicates everything. As described by Allen <a href="https://medium.com/@allenfarrington/simple-truths-and-complex-nonsense-2e1c28ae6f29">here</a>:</p><blockquote>Now I should be clear that, maybe, the virus is that complicated. But it doesn’t matter. Because we can’t possibly understand this. And actually I lowballed it by a factor of 450 (Oh, God …). Because if this system is linear, which it surely is not, what this really means is that a single set of parameters can be represented as a 450-dimensional column vector acting on a 450x450 matrix with 450² = 202k independent numbers. Because, remember, the parameters can be anything. Katya suspects they are totally made up. So it’s not just the dimensions we need to account for. The surface of the earth has 2 dimensions but more than 2 locations. Assuming every entry in this matrix has only two possible states, which it surely does not, this model maps a system with at least …</blockquote></div></div>

<h3>How Neobanks Should Monetize Status Signaling</h3>



<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you probably know by now that one of my favorite topics to think and write about is “status signaling”.</p>



<p>Signaling explains most of our everyday actions: what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, I described the implications signaling has on the monetization of software businesses. For many traditional industries, monetizing the display of status is not a new concept. A Rolex watch, for example, is not better at telling the time than a cheap Casio watch. But a Rolex reveals something about its owners’ wealth and, thus, their status in society. It’s that status message that explains the difference in price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/equaltime.png"></p><p>Similarly, driving a Prius says something about your views on climate change. A <em>Make America Great Again</em> cap reveals something about your political affiliations. And Nike athletic wear signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle.</p>



<p>Software is at a crucial disadvantage compared to these physical products because of its intangibility. A fitness app also signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle, but no one can see it because it only lives on your phone. Everyone can see your Nike gear whenever you wear it in public. Software can’t offer the same benefit. It doesn’t have a signaling distribution channel.</p>



<p>This is why there is no software equivalent of a Rolex watch or a Louis Vuitton handbag. People aren’t willing to spend money on things other people can’t see they spent money on.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. As software is eating the world, the lines between physical and digital products are becoming increasingly blurry. As I have pointed out in my original essay, one way for software companies to solve the signaling distribution problem is to add a physical element to their software product.</p>



<p>In this post I want to explore this idea a little bit further. Specifically, we’ll look at neobanks – and their opportunity to monetize credit card signaling.</p>



<p><span>02</span> Neobanks</p>



<p>In the last couple of years we have witnessed the birth and rise of a new startup vertical: neobanks.</p>



<p>Neobanks differ from traditional banks in two ways:</p>



<p>1) Rather than relying on a physical branch network, the entire banking experience is managed via an app</p>



<p>2) Instead of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-q4bEULG64">“how do you do, fellow kids”</a>-cringiness that ad campaigns of traditional banks usually invoke when they try to appeal to a younger audience, neobanks are actually perceived as cool. In fact, many of them feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_26qGBSGmB3yaPD7nZJrFIg.gif">



<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lifestylebrand-1.png"></p><p>Interestingly though, neobanks still use one very traditional banking element: physical cards.</p>



<p>At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive. If you are building a mobile-first bank, why not offer virtual cards and let users pay with their phone? Why go through the hassle of producing and shipping physical cards?</p>



<p>The answer is – you guessed it – signaling.</p>



<p>Think about it: Paying for things (offline) is a social activity. It’s an interaction between at least you and a cashier or waiter. But ideally, in a dinner scenario for example, you are surrounded by other people you want to impress: a date, a group of friends, or work colleagues.</p>



<p>This makes the moment you take out your card to pay the bill a great opportunity to make a statement and build social capital.</p>



<p>If you look at neobanks out there today, it’s pretty obvious that signaling is in fact one of the main benefits they offer – and almost the only thing they monetize <span>(apart from interchange, of course)</span>:</p>



<ul><li>The premium subscriptions neobanks offer usually don’t win on features but solely on nicer looking cards. The <a href="https://n26.com/metal">N26</a> or <a href="https://revolut.com/metal">Revolut</a> Metal plans, for example, don’t offer any additional features that <em>really</em> justify the ~€15 / month price tag. They do include a nice looking metal card though – that’s what people pay for.</li><li>Relatedly, it seems like most of the innovation in the industry is happening in card design. The actual banking products are more or less interchangeable, what differs is whether the card comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">titanium</a>, <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">wood</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832">glow-in-the-dark yellow</a>.</li><li>You may have noticed that the credit card number has moved from the front to the back of the card. This makes it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.</li></ul>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nocardnumber-1.png"></p><p>Neobanks are popping up like mushrooms after the rain at the moment and it’s unlikely that this trend will end any time soon. Thanks to banking-as-a-service providers, we’ll likely see a lot of non-banking-companies add banking functionalities and cards to their product offering.</p>



<p>There’s an old Twitter joke that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a chat app. The 2020 version of that joke is that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a bank.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1295024066869567488">I did some research on credit card designs</a> recently, I was surprised by the sheer amount of different neobanks already in existance. And yet, even though almost all of them offer well-designed cards, it’s shocking how similar they all are. It seems like all of them are focusing on the same target audience instead of differentiating their signaling messages.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>03</span> In-Groups, Out-Groups and Artificial Scarcity</p>



<p>In every signaling scenario there are two possible target audiences: An in-group and an out-group.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/groups.png"></p><p>The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90391587/why-we-dont-want-you-and-your-android-green-bubbles-in-our-imessage-chat">iMessage is a great illustration of this</a>: the chat bubble colors clearly indicate who belongs to the in-group (blue = iOS) and who is part of the out-group (green = Android). </p>



<p>It’s important to note that signaling in iMessage is limited to the in-group since these color codes are only visible for iOS users – Android users can’t see who in the group is using which operating system. </p>



<p>Signaling, however, grows stronger the larger the out-group is – as long as the out-group knows about the in-group. This is why luxury car manufacturers deliberately extend their advertising campaigns to people who will never be able to afford their cars: they are increasing the size of the out-group by educating people about the in-group.</p>



<p>At the same time, brands need to control the size of the in-group. The more exclusive the in-group, the higher the signaling strength and, thus, the monetization potential of a customer. </p>



<p>The easiest control mechanism for the size of the in-group is price. If you set the price high enough, few people will be able to afford the product. Ironically, this, in turn, justifies the high price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/priceloop.png"></p><p>Alternatively, companies create artificial scarcity by setting a hard number on supply. Limited supply creates FOMO and hype which increases the size of the out-group and results in higher social status for members of the in-group. Artificial scarcity explains the price of Bitcoin, Pokémon trading cards and why people spend hours queuing in front of Supreme shops.</p>



<p>The problem with keeping the in-group small is that it also limits the number of potential customers and, thus, overall revenue potential. Companies need to walk a fine line between maximizing the number of customers while simultaneously maximizing the number of people they can (afford to) exclude.</p>



<p><span>04</span> What Neobanks Should Build</p>



<p>The problem with neobanks today is that they all focus on the same in-group. Here are the premium cards of some of the largest European challenger banks – notice any difference?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/metalcards.png"></p><p>It seems like everyone is trying to become the Apple of Banking – including <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple itself</a>. The signaling messages are all about displaying economic power.</p>



<p>But we are slowly seeing new banking apps that are focusing on different audiences. For example, there are now a <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/">handful of</a> <a href="https://blog.gohenry.com/uk/gohenry-news/meet-our-new-biodegradable-eco-card/">“green”</a> <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">neobanks</a> that help users signal environmental altruism. </p>



<p>Or how about <a href="https://www.razer.com/razer-card">this Razer Card</a> targeted at the gamer community?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/environment.png"></p><p>The question for these companies and their investors is whether the in-group is big enough to justify building an entire bank around it. Making the unit economics of a bank work requires a certain amount of users, but as we discussed earlier, the signaling strength decreases as the size of in-group increases.</p>



<p>So how do you solve this problem?<br>By introducing multiple in-groups.</p>



<p>See, the current model looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup01.png"></p><p>(In fact, given how undifferentiated most of the offerings and cards are, there are actually multiple neobanks within the same small in-group bubble.)</p>



<p>But what if one bank would target multiple, different in-groups?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup02.png"></p><p>For example, what if N26 had dedicated cards for soccer fans, hip-hop enthusiasts and gamers? Instead of focusing on just one signaling audience, their total addressable market would massively increase. </p>



<p>The way they would target these audiences is via brand collaborations. N26 does not have the necessary reputation in any of the above-mentioned areas to build credible signaling messages. It would not be able to build attractive in-groups on its own – but other brands could lend N26 their social capital. </p>



<p>Apple has long worked with <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/product-red/">RED</a>, IKEA recently <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/virgil-abloh-ikea-collaboration-best-look/">teamed up with Virgil Abloh</a>, and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/partners/nike-partnerships">Nike partners with Headspace</a>. Why wouldn’t this concept work for neobanks?</p>



<p>What would <strong>N26 x Manchester United</strong> look like? <br>Or <strong>Chime x Supreme</strong>? <br>Or <strong>Revolut x 100 Thieves</strong>?</p>



<p>Because of a bigger target audience overall, individual in-groups could be kept smaller. Cards could be <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/scarcity-as-an-api">released as limited edition drops</a> transforming them into collectibles, which would justify a higher price tag per card.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that different signaling audiences are not mutually exclusive. We don’t just subscribe to a single in-group – our <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">identities are prismatic</a>. This means that some users might …</p></div></div>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I noticed something really cool about NASA's classic "Worm" logo:</p>

<p><img src="https://shaungallagher.pressbin.com/blog/img/nasa.svg"></p>

<p>If you flip it upside down, it produces a new acronym: VSVN.  I'm not sure what those letters might stand for, 
   but this little discovery was Very Surprising and Very Neat.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that it might be fun to come up with some sort of design that incorporates the letters VSVN,
   and my first thought was to put a cheeky twist on the
   <a href="https://www.etsy.com/market/nasa_worm_logo">multitude of apparel items</a>
   that feature the NASA "Worm" logo.</p>
   
<p>I created a mock-up of a VSVN design and uploaded it to <a href="https://teespring.com/">Teespring</a>,
   which allows designers to sell apparel online:</p>
   
<p><img src="https://shaungallagher.pressbin.com/blog/img/vsvn-shirt.jpg"></p>

<p>But a few minutes after publishing the design, I received an email from Teespring notifying me that my listing had been removed:</p>

<blockquote>
    Your campaign has been terminated early due to content concerns.
    It appears your campaign may be using content owned by a third party.
</blockquote>
   
   
<p>That was strange.  Were they talking about the NASA "Worm" logo?</p>

<p>Normally, under the U.S. Copyright Act, any creative works produced by the U.S. government automatically become part of the public domain.</p>

<p>So, for instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:NASA_images">these NASA images</a> of the moon, the Earth, and the stars
   can be freely used, even commercially, without having to get permission from the agency.</p>
   
<p>But after doing some research, I learned there are <a href="https://www.usa.gov/government-works">a few specific exceptions</a> to that general rule.
   And one of them pertains to agency logos:</p>
   
<blockquote>
    You cannot use government trademarks or government agencies' logos without permission.
</blockquote>
      

<p>If federal agencies' logos are not in the public domain, what explains the proliferation of T-shirts,
   sweatshirts, and other apparel that prominently feature the NASA logo?</p>
   
<p>It turns out that NASA does routinely grant permission for its logo to be used on apparel, subject to
   some <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/Merchandising_Guidelines.html">rather restrictive regulations</a>.
   When permission is granted, there are no licensing fees involved,
   which can make NASA-themed apparel a lucrative line of business.</p>

<p>But does this VSVN design actually infringe on NASA's logo?</p>

<p>On the one hand, it is certainly true that if you flip VSVN upside down, you get the NASA logo, which is the agency's trademark.</p>

<p>But within copyright and trademark law, there is a concept known as <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html">fair use</a>.
   Fair use is a defense against a claim of infringement; when a work is covered under the fair-use defense,
   it can be used without a license from the copyright or trademark holder.</p>

<p>There are multiple factors that go into determining whether an unlicensed use of a work
   is covered under the fair-use defense, and in general fair use is broader for copyright than trademarks,
   but one key factor is whether the work is 
   <a href="https://www.justia.com/intellectual-property/copyright/fair-use/transformative-use/">transformative</a>,
   meaning that the new work has fundamentally changed the meaning, interpretation, or nature of the original work.</p>

<p>While in many cases merely flipping a logo 180 degrees is not sufficiently transformative to survive
   a claim of infringement, there are some rare cases where an upside-down representation of a logo is indeed transformative,
   such as when the new work is clearly perceived as something that stands on its own, and is not merely perceived as
   the original work flipped upside-down.</p>
   
<p>In the case of VSVN, I'm going to wager that the average person does not immediately recognize the design as an
   upside-down version of the NASA logo.  Instead, what they are likely to immediately perceive are the letters VSVN.</p>
   
<p>Indeed, the entire novelty of the design is predicated on the fact that VSVN stands on its own — unlike, say,
   an upside-down version of the agency's iconic "Meatball" logo:</p>
   
<p><img src="https://shaungallagher.pressbin.com/blog/img/nasa-logo.svg"></p>
   
<p>Are there other cases where flipping something is transformative?</p>

<p>Well, what if I were to begin selling T-shirts with this design?</p>
   
<p><img src="https://shaungallagher.pressbin.com/blog/img/shell-oil.png"></p>   

<p>That's arguably an infringement of Shell Oil's intellectual property.</p>

<p>But what about this?</p>

<p><img src="https://shaungallagher.pressbin.com/blog/img/shell-oil.png"></p>   

<p>That's the same image upside-down, but it "transforms" the previous design into the numbers 710 77345.  Do those numbers
   violate any copyright or trademark held by Royal Dutch Shell?  I think it would be quite a stretch to say they do.</p>
   
<p>Several artists have also produced transformative works by re-orienting physical objects.
   For instance, Marcel Duchamp, who specialized in conceptual art, created a work called
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp)">Fountain</a> by taking an ordinary porcelain urinal
   and turning it 90 degrees:</p>
   
<p><img src="https://shaungallagher.pressbin.com/blog/img/fountain.jpg"></p>   
   
<p>Given the fact that VSVN stands on its own and is arguably covered under fair use,
   I decided to reach out to NASA about the Teespring design.</p>

<p>I had hoped that they would agree with me that the design is transformative enough that no permission was needed from the agency.</p>

<p>But a representative from NASA's communications department, which handles such requests, responded to my inquiry and said
   the design <i>did</i> require NASA's authorization, but the design as presented would not be approved,
   because the agency does not permit the logo to be presented upside-down.</p>
   
<blockquote>
    It is patently obvious that your intent is to render the NASA Logotype upside down, else the clever premise is non-sensical.
    Our Merchandising Guidelines clearly state that the NASA Logotype cannot be altered, and you have rendered it upside down.
    Accordingly, it does not conform to the Guidelines so cannot be approved.  
    Alternatively, if you insist that VSVN is arbitrary, or an acronym for another entity/item,
    and that the premise is not related to the Agency, then we request you execute the premise using a different acronym and font
    since this use is obviously confusingly similar to NASA’s Logotype.
</blockquote>
  

<p>Unfortunately, although I think there is a case to be made for my design being considered non-infringing,
   I will not be pursing this any further.  I created the design just for giggles, and I have no interest
   in investing the time or money to successfully defend the design against a claim of copyright infringement
   from a federal agency.</p>

<p>I hope, though, that my experience has helped illuminate some of the intricacies of copyright law,
   and maybe even led you to think more deeply about what it means for a creative work to be transformative.</p>
   
<hr>

<p><i>
    Note: This essay presents both the NASA "Worm" logo and the NASA "Meatball" logo, in various orientations.
    This falls very firmly under fair use, because the essay is non-commercial in nature, involves commentary
    pertaining to the original works and how they relate to the VSVN work, and the logos are presented at
    relatively small size, just big enough to get the point across.  There are a variety of news articles
    (e.g. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/nasa-worm-logo-scn/index.html">1</a>,
          <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/nasa-logo-worm-spacex.html">2</a>, and
          <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90536737/nasas-worm-logo-lay-dormant-for-28-years-so-why-are-people-so-obsessed-with-it">3</a>)
    that similarly reproduce the logos for the purpose of commentary about them, and my use is very similar.

December 5, 2020 | https://functional.christmas/2020/4 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://functional.christmas/2020/4">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Today I want to give you an introduction to the programming language Elixir, some of its features and why you might want to check it out!</p>
</section><article><section><h2>The basics</h2>
<p>First things first: Elixir is a concurrent functional language that runs on the Erlang VM. It is inspired by many different languages where Ruby and Erlang are most obvious ones based on the syntax.</p>
<p>Elixir is a <a href="https://thinkingelixir.com/elixir-in-the-type-system-quadrant/">strong, dynamically typed language</a>. This puts it in the same category as Ruby and Python and it has optional functionality for compile time type checking as well.Elixirs data structures are immutable, but variables can be reassigned/rebound. <sup><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></sup> This was a bit strange for me in that I got started with FP through Elm where there are no variables, just constants.</p>
<p>Elixir inherits a lot its data structures and related syntax from Erlang which in many ways is its biggest influence. <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2013/08/08/elixir-design-goals/">Elixir Design Goals</a> describes the relation to Erlang like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elixir is meant to be compatible with the Erlang VM and the existing ecosystem. When we talk about Erlang, we can break it into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A functional programming language, called Erlang</li>
<li>A set of design principles, called OTP (Open Telecom Plaform)</li>
<li>The Erlang Virtual Machine, referred to as EVM or BEAM</li>
</ul>
<p>Elixir runs in the same virtual machine and is compatible with OTP. Not only that, all the tools and libraries available in the Erlang ecosystem are also available in Elixir, simply because there is no conversion cost from calling Erlang from Elixir and vice-versa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great feature of Elixir that we will talk more about later.</p>
<p>As for other inspirations Elixir has docstrings from Python, polymorphism and protocols from Clojure, macros and meta-programming from different Lisps, just to name a few. <sup><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></sup></p>
<h3>Hello World!</h3>
<p>As I said, Elixir is a concurrent functional programming language. For the functional part it means that Elixir mainly uses functions and modules for code structure and has other features that are associated with functional languages. We'll talk about the concurrent part later. </p>
<p>A hello world example in Elixir might look something like this:</p>
<div data-language="elixir"><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> HelloWorld
  <span>def</span> hello_world <span>do</span>
    IO<span>.</span>puts<span>(</span><span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we define a module with a function that simply writes "Hello, World!" to the console.</p>
<h2>Killer applications</h2>
<p>Many programming languages has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application">"killer apps"</a>; libraries, frameworks and use cases, that in themself are enough to justify the transition to the language or try it out. For Ruby it was the web framework Ruby on Rails and in many ways Elixir has its own Rails: Phoenix.</p>
<h3>Phoenix web framework</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> is inspired by Rails (the team originally behind Elixir was previously a Ruby shop) and was an early addition to the Elixir community. The creators of Phoenix has learned from years of Rails development and made their own opinions in addition to the natural changes needed when going from an object oriented language to a functional language.
Compared to Rails Phoenix has with the help of the Erlang VM great performance. Some of you might have heard about Phoenix' amazing <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/the-road-to-2-million-websocket-connections">2 million simultaneous web sockets</a> benchmark!</p>
<h3>The Nerves Project</h3>
<p>Another interesting project in the Elixir ecosystem is the embedded/IoT project <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves</a>. Nerves makes it possible to use Elixir code to create embedded system where previously you would have had to use a low level language like C. This does not stop you from bringing your own code (like C, C++, Python, Rust, and more) while using Nerves as a platform for your IoT project.
The project web site says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nerves is a complete IoT platform and infrastructure for you to build and deploy maintainable embedded systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The BEAM and OTP</h2>
<p>When talking about the advantages of Elixir it is hard to not talk about the advantages of Erlang and its virtual machine, the BEAM (Bogdan's Erlang Abstract Machine). It is in many ways the biggest selling point for Elixir. We are now talking about the concurrent part of Elixir. Erlang and the BEAM has shown its resiliency over many years, exemplified in giving Ericsson 9 nines (99.9999999%) availability in their AXD301 switch.<sup><sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></sup> It is known for its "let it break" philosophy and self-healing properties and by being compatible with Erlang, Elixir inherits a lot of these traits.</p>
<p>Elixirs creator, Jose Valim, attributes one of the motivational factors for the creation of Elixir to the rise of multi-core CPUs and the need to utilize these. Ruby and other languages with a global interperter lock (GIL) limits this, but the Erlang VM and the tools and design prinsiples of OTP have proven to be a great choice for creating concurrent, performant and resilient applications.</p>
<h3>Everything is a process</h3>
<p>Everything in the BEAM is a process. These are not OS processes, but lightweight processes which can be cheaply spawned and killed. In his PhD thesis the co-inventor of Erlang, Joe Armstrong, summarized Erlangs principles regarding processes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Everything is a process.</li>
<li>Processes are strongly isolated.</li>
<li>Process creation and destruction is a lightweight operation.</li>
<li>Message passing is the only way for processes to interact.</li>
<li>Processes have unique names.</li>
<li>If you know the name of a process you can send it a message.</li>
<li>Processes share no resources.</li>
<li>Error handling is non-local.</li>
<li>Processes do what they are supposed to do or fail.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sidenote: For some this may sound vaguely familiar. Some object oriented languages has had similar principles, but instead of processes they are applied to objects. Smalltalk is reported to be one of the inspirations to Erlang and it is fun to think about Erlang being a functional language but still be more object oriented than some object oriented languages. This is of course not the case as the definition of OOP has changed over time and Erlang is a functional language, but it is fun to ponder the similarities. 😄 Back to the main story! 😅</p>
<p>These unique principles for processes where they communicate through messages lays a great foundation for creating concurrent application, but there is one more piece to the puzzle: OTP.</p>
<h3>OTP - The Open Telecom Platform</h3>
<p>As with so many other parts of this article OTP is a big topic and could be a separate article, but I'll try make it short! Today the name is a bit strange but it was created by Ericsson for their telephone switches in the 80s and 90s so in that context in makes more sense.</p>
<p>OTP is an integral part of many Erlang applications. In essence OTP is a set of design principles and standards including tools and libraries to make it easier to create applications that adheres to them.<sup><sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></sup> </p>
<p>Since Elixir is compatible with OTP we can leverage these principles and technologies that has been battle tested in high-pressure and critical applications for decades!</p>
<h2>The take-away</h2>
<p>Luckily you don't need to understand or know much about Erlang, BEAM and OTP.
Without deep knowledge of these topics you can still reap the benefits of highly performing web applications and resilient IoT applications. It would certainly help but it is not a prerequisite. This is the great thing about Elixir: it is an approachable language with battle tested underpinnings! 💪</p>
<p>It might not be your idea of a perfect language. It is not mine either, but that does not stop me from using the great tools at my disposal. If you are all into Haskell or the likes it might not be something you would use and that is OK. Whatever your preferences are you might now know a little more about Elixir and Erlang and some more knowledge is always a good thing. 😄</p>
<p>If you would like to check Elixir out I recommend checking out <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">the official Getting started guide</a> or the interactive guide <a href="https://try-elixir.herokuapp.com/">Try Elixir</a> and then trying out a project with Phoenix or Nerves. Hands-on experience is always better than something you read on the internet! 🤓</p>
<p>Psst! By the way: there are other languages that run on the BEAM. <a href="https://lfe.io/">Lisp variants</a> and lately some work on <a href="https://gleam.run/">strong statically compiled ML-like languges</a> if you are into that!</p>

Sorry once again for the infrequent posts.
I've been busy.
Originally, because I was supposed to get married this summer.
Then because my fiancée cheated on me while I was watching my grandfather die
and moved in with the other guy the following week.
So that's been fun, but I'm trying to get back into some more productive habits.
Hopefully that includes blogging regularly.

<h2 id="sum-types-and-you">Sum Types and You</h2>

<p>Let’s talk about a simple, yet powerful concept in programming: <em>sum types</em>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>A sum type, also called a <em>discriminated union</em>,
can hold one (and only one) of several types of things.
For example, consider some settings in an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">INI</a>-like configuration file.
Let’s say that each setting must be a string, an integer, or a Boolean value.
If we wanted to roll our own solution in C++, we might write something resembling:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Setting</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>union</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>string</span> <span>str</span><span>;</span>
        <span>int</span> <span>num</span><span>;</span>
        <span>bool</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
    <span>};</span>
    <span>enum</span> <span>Type</span> <span>{</span> <span>Str</span><span>,</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>};</span>
    <span>Type</span> <span>tag</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>// Map settings to their names.
</span><span>using</span> <span>Settings</span> <span>=</span> <span>unordered_map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>Setting</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Here be dragons, though, since we must always remember to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Update <code>tag</code> whenever assigning a new value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only retrieve the correct type from the union (according to <code>tag</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Call constructors and destructors at appropriate times for all non-trivial types.
(<code>string</code> is the only one here, but you could imagine similar
scenarios with others.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a step is ever forgotten, the object falls into an
inconsistent state and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
You could encapsulate all this trickery and interact with the type
through a series of methods—e.g., <code>getType()</code>, <code>asBool()</code>,
<code>asString()</code>, and so on—but this is quite verbose.
It also just shifts the problem onto whoever implements these methods; they
still need to carefully maintain the invariants with no help from the language.</p>

<p>It would be much nicer if a general-purpose sum type was provided by the standard
library.
In C++17, we finally get one!
It’s called <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant"><code>std::variant</code></a>.
Let’s take a look.</p>

<h2 id="using-stdvariant">Using <code>std::variant</code></h2>

<p><code>variant</code> is a class template that takes, as template parameters, the types
it could hold.
For the example above,
we could define a setting as a <code><span>variant</span><span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span></code>.
Assigning a value to a <code>variant</code> works just like you might expect:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>variant</span><span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>mySetting</span> <span>=</span> <span>string</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello!"</span><span>);</span> <span>// Or,
</span><span>mySetting</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span> <span>// Or,
</span><span>mySetting</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Once we put a value into a <code>variant</code>, we’ll eventually want to look at what that
value is, and just as importantly, what the type of the value is.
This is where the fun begins.
Some languages offer dedicated <em>pattern matching</em> syntax for the task,
such as:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>theSetting</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Setting</span><span>::</span><span>Str</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"A string: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Setting</span><span>::</span><span>Int</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"An integer: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Setting</span><span>::</span><span>Bool</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"A boolean: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>),</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>but this didn’t make the cut for C++17.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
Instead we’re given a companion function called <code>std::visit</code>.
It takes the <code>variant</code> you want to examine, along with
some <em>visitor</em> that is callable for each type in the variant.</p>

<p>How do we define such a visitor?
One way is to create an object that overloads the call operator
for relevant types:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>SettingVisitor</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"A string: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>c_str</span><span>());</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"An integer: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>operator</span><span>()(</span><span>const</span> <span>bool</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"A boolean: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This seems terribly verbose, and it gets even worse
if we want our visitor to capture or modify some other state.
Hmm—<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/7627218">lambdas</a> are perfect
for capturing state.
What if we could build a visitor from those?</p>
<div><pre><code><span>make_visitor</span><span>(</span>
    <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>](</span><span>const</span> <span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"string: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>c_str</span><span>());</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>},</span>
    <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>](</span><span>const</span> <span>int</span> <span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"integer: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>d</span><span>);</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>},</span>
    <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>](</span><span>const</span> <span>bool</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"bool: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>
        <span>// ...
</span>    <span>}</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>That’s a bit better, but the standard library doesn’t provide any sort of
<code>make_visitor</code> to combine the lambdas into a callable object for us.
We’ll need to define it ourselves.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span><span>...</span> <span>Fs</span><span>&gt;</span>

<p>Here we use C++11’s <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/parameter_pack">variadic templates</a>.
They must be defined recursively, so we create some base case <code>F0</code>,
then use that to define a cascading set of constructors for <code>overload</code>,
each of which peels off a lambda argument and adds it to the type
as a call operator.</p>

<p>If this seems troublesome, fear not! C++17 will offer a new syntax
that reduces all of the above to:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>template</span><span>&lt;</span><span>class</span><span>...</span> <span>Ts</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>struct</span> <span>overloaded</span> <span>:</span> <span>Ts</span><span>...</span> <span>{</span> <span>using</span> <span>Ts</span><span>::</span><span>operator</span><span>()...;</span> <span>};</span>
<span>template</span><span>&lt;</span><span>class</span><span>...</span> <span>Ts</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>overloaded</span><span>(</span><span>Ts</span><span>...)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>overloaded</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Ts</span><span>...</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Easy, right? But if don’t like any of these options, you could
use C++17’s compile-time conditionals instead:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>[](</span><span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>using</span> <span>T</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>decay_t</span><span>&lt;</span><span>decltype</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>

</span>    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Much better, no?</p>

<h2 id="no">No.</h2>

<p>The rigmarole needed for <code>std::visit</code> is entirely insane.
We started with a simple goal: look at the contents of a sum type.
To accomplish this meager mission, we had to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Define a function object, which requires a lot of
boilerplate, <em>or</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>Define our behavior with lambdas, which required:
    <ul>
      <li>An understanding of variadic templates, in all their recursively-defined fun, <em>or</em></li>
      <li>A familiarity with variadic <code>using</code> declarations, fresh on the scene from C++17.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>or</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>Use compile-time conditionals, which require you to know
about—and grok—the new <code><span>constexpr</span> <span>if</span></code> syntax, along with
<code>type_traits</code> fun like
<code>std::decay</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>None of these concepts are too enigmatic if you’re an experienced C++ developer,
but several are certainly “advanced” features of the language.
Things have really gone sideways if we need to know so much
to do something so simple.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-we-get-here">How did we get here?</h2>

<p>My goal isn’t to disparage the folks on the ISO C++ committee
who picked this approach.
I’ve had beers with some of them,
and they’re smart, kind, hardworking people.
I’m sure that I’m missing important context since I’ve never sat in on a
standards meeting or read all of the relevant
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/">committee papers</a>.
But from an outsider’s perspective, the disparity in complexity between the
problem being solved (“What’s in here?”)
and the solutions is just nuts.
How do you teach this without overwhelming a beginner with all this other…
stuff?
Is it expected to be common knowledge for your everyday programmer?
(And if the goal of adding <code>variant</code> to the standard library <em>isn’t</em> to
make it a tool for the masses, shouldn’t it be?)
The very least C++17 could do—if the committee didn’t have the time or resources
to get pattern matching into the language—is provide something akin to <code>make_visitor</code>.
But that too is left as an exercise for the user.</p>

<p>If I had to guess how we ended up this way,
I’d assume it comes down to confirmation bias.
Maybe when a bunch of really smart people who know how
<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae">SFINAE</a> works offhand
and don’t flinch when they see the likes of</p>

<div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>F</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>typename</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>enable_if</span><span>&lt;!</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>is_reference</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>type</span>
<span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>F</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>// ...
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>get together, the result is something like <code>std::visit</code>.
Nobody proclaims that the emperor has no clothes, or that it’s completely
bonkers to expect the average user to build an overloaded callable
object with recursive templates just to see if the thing they’re looking at
holds an <code><span>int</span></code> or a <code><span>string</span></code>.</p>

<p>I’m also not here to claim that C++ is too complicated for its own good,
but it’s certainly more complicated than it has to be.
Scott Meyers, the guy who wrote <em>Effective&nbsp;C++</em> and <em>Effective Modern&nbsp;C++</em>,
has made similar noises in <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/47947981">recent</a>
<a href="https://youtu.be/RT46MpK39rQ?t=29m51s">talks</a>.
To paraphrase Meyers, I’m sure each member of the committee cares very much
about avoiding needless complexity and making the language easier to use.
But if you look at the results of their work, it’s hard to tell.
The accidental complexity just keeps stacking up.</p>

<h2 id="where-are-we-headed">Where are we headed?</h2>

<p>There’s a reason C++ is so widely used, especially in systems programming.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
It can be incredibly expressive, yet gives you nearly full control of your hardware.
The tooling around it is some of the most mature of any programming language
out there, bar C.
It supports a ridiculous number of platforms.</p>

<p>But even if you set aside all the historical baggage, it has some serious shortcomings.
Spend any amount of time messing with D and you’ll quickly realize that
metaprogramming needn’t require self-flagellation and insane syntax.
Play with Rust and <!-- Hi, PCJ --> you’ll feel like <code>unique_ptr</code>
and <code>shared_ptr</code>—which themselves have been a breath of fresh air—are
a bad joke.
The fact that we still handle dependencies in 2017
by literally copy-pasting files into each other with <code><span>#include</span></code>
macros is <em>obscene</em>.</p>

<p>You get the impression, based on what ends up in the ISO standards and what
you hear in conference talks,
that those driving C++ are trying to eliminate some of these shortcomings by
glomming nice bits from other languages onto it.
That’s a great idea on its face,
but these features often seem to arrive half-baked.
While C++ isn’t going away any time soon,
it feels like the language is constantly playing a clumsy game of catchup.</p>

<hr>

<p>In spite of all of this,
I’ll be busy encouraging my coworkers to use <code>variant</code> if anybody needs me.
Sum types are such a useful concept that they’re worth the pain,
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvtFGa6XJDU">to quote Jon Kalb</a>,
“If you can’t program in a language with ugly warts, maybe C++ isn’t the language
you should be programming in.”</p>

    <p>Constructing the MNIST-1D dataset. As with the original MNIST dataset, the task is to learn to classify the digits 0-9. Unlike the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 images, each of these examples is a one-dimensional sequence of points. To generate an example, we begin with 10 digit templates and then randomly pad, translate, add noise, and transform them as shown above.</p>
  	</div>
</div>





<p>By any scientific standard, the Human Genome Project <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/62798">was enormous</a>: it involved billions of dollars of funding, dozens of institutions, and over a decade of accelerated research. But that was only the tip of the iceberg. Long before the project began, scientists were hard at work assembling the intricate science of human genetics. And most of the time, they were not studying humans. The foundational discoveries in genetics centered on far simpler organisms such as peas, molds, fruit flies, and mice. To this day, biologists use these simpler organisms as genetic “minimal working examples” in order to save time, energy, and money. A well-designed experiment with Drosophilia, such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10746727/">Feany and Bender (2000)</a>, can teach us an astonishing amount about humans.</p>

<p>The deep learning analogue of Drosophilia is the MNIST dataset. A large number of deep learning innovations including <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html">dropout</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980">Adam</a>, <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-89e.pdf">convolutional networks</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">generative adversarial networks</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114">variational autoencoders</a> began life as MNIST experiments. Once these innovations proved themselves on small-scale experiments, scientists found ways to scale them to larger and more impactful applications.</p>

<p>They key advantage of Drosophilia and MNIST is that they dramatically accelerate the iteration cycle of exploratory research. In the case of Drosophilia, the fly’s life cycle is just a few days long and its nutritional needs are negligible. This makes it much easier to work with than mammals, especially humans. In the case of MNIST, training a strong classifier takes a few dozen lines of code, less than a minute of walltime, and negligible amounts of electricity. This is a stark contrast to state-of-the-art vision, text, and game-playing models which can take months and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08900">hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> of electricity to train.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of its historical significance, MNIST has three notable shortcomings. First, it does a poor job of differentiating between linear, nonlinear, and translation-invariant models. For example, logistic, MLP, and CNN benchmarks obtain 94, 99+, and 99+% accuracy on it. This makes it hard to measure the contribution of a CNN’s spatial priors or to judge the relative effectiveness of different regularization schemes. Second, it is somewhat large for a toy dataset. Each input example is a 784-dimensional vector and thus it takes a non-trivial amount of computation to perform hyperparameter searches or debug a metalearning loop. Third, MNIST is hard to hack. The ideal toy dataset should be procedurally generated so that researchers can smoothly vary parameters such as background noise, translation, and resolution.</p>

<p>In order to address these shortcomings, we propose the MNIST-1D dataset. It is a minimalist, low-memory, and low-compute alternative to MNIST, designed for exploratory deep learning research where rapid iteration is a priority. Training examples are 20 times smaller but they are still better at measuring the difference between 1) linear and nonlinear classifiers and 2) models with and without spatial inductive biases (eg. translation invariance). The dataset is procedurally generated but still permits analogies to real-world digit classification.</p>

  <p>Visualizing the MNIST and MNIST-1D datasets with tSNE. The well-defined clusters in the MNIST plot indicate that the majority of the examples are separable via a kNN classifier in pixel space. The MNIST-1D plot, meanwhile, reveals a lack of well-defined clusters which suggests that learning a nonlinear representation of the data is much more important to achieve successful classification.

<h2 id="example-use-cases">Example use cases</h2>

<p>In this section we will explore several examples of how MNIST-1D can be used to study core “science of deep learning” phenomena.</p>

<p><strong>Finding lottery tickets.</strong> It is not unusual for deep learning models to have ten or even a hundred times more parameters than necessary. This overparameterization helps training but increases computational overhead. One solution is to progressively prune weights from a model during training so that the final network is just a fraction of its original size. Although this approach works, conventional wisdom holds that sparse networks do not train well from scratch. Recent work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a> challenges this conventional wisdom. The authors report finding sparse subnetworks inside of larger networks that train to equivalent or even higher accuracies. These “lottery ticket” subnetworks can be found through a simple iterative procedure: train a network, prune the smallest weights, and then rewind the remaining weights to their original initializations and retrain.</p>

<p>Since the original paper was published, a multitude of works have sought to explain this phenomenon and then harness it on larger datasets and models. However, very few works have attempted to isolate a “minimal working example” of this effect so as to investigate it more carefully. The figure below shows that the MNIST-1D dataset not only makes this possible, but also enables us to elucidate, via carefully-controlled experiments, some of the reasons for a lottery ticket’s success. Unlike many follow-up experiments on the lottery ticket, this one took just two days of researcher time to produce. The curious reader can also <a href="https://bit.ly/3nCEIaL">reproduce these results</a> in their browser in a few minutes.</p>

  </p>
  <p>Finding and analyzing lottery tickets. In <b>a-b)</b>, we isolate a "minimum viable example" of the effect. Recent work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02773">Morcos et al (2019)</a> shows that lottery tickets can transfer between datasets. We wanted to determine whether spatial inductive biases played a role. So we performed a series of experiments: in <b>c)</b> we plot the asymptotic performance of a 92% sparse ticket. In <b>d)</b> we reverse all the 1D signals in the dataset, effectively preserving spatial structure but changing the location of individual datapoints. This is analogous to flipping an image upside down. Under this ablation, the lottery ticket continues to win.</p>
</div>

  <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/scaling-down/lottery_b1.png">
  </p>
  <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/scaling-down/lottery_b2.png">
  </p>
    <p>Next, in <b>e)</b> we permute the indices of the 1D signal, effectively removing spatial structure from the dataset. This ablation hurts lottery ticket performance significantly more, suggesting that part of the lottery ticket's performance can be attributed to a spatial inductive bias. Finally, in <b>f)</b> we keep the lottery ticket sparsity structure but initialize its weights with a different random seed. Contrary to results reported in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635">Frankle &amp; Carbin (2019)</a>, we see that our lottery ticket continues to outperform a dense baseline, aligning well with our hypothesis that the lottery ticket mask has a spatial inductive bias. In <b>g)</b>, we verify our hypothesis by measuring how often unmasked weights are adjacent to one another in the first layer of our model. The lottery ticket has many more adjacent weights than chance would predict, implying a local connectivity structure which helps gives rise to spatial biases.</p>

<p><strong>Observing deep double descent.</strong> Another intriguing property of neural networks is the “double descent” phenomenon. This phrase refers to a training regime where more data, model parameters, or gradient steps can actually <em>reduce</em> a model’s test accuracy<sup id="fnref:fn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn1">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fn2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn2">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fn3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn3">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fn4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn4">4</a></sup>. The intuition is that during supervised learning there is an interpolation threshold where the learning procedure, consisting of a model and an optimization algorithm, is just barely able to fit the entire training set. At this threshold there is effectively just one model that can fit the data and this model is very sensitive to label noise and model mis-specification.</p>

<p>Several properties of this effect, such as what factors affect its width and location, are not well understood in the context of deep models. We see the MNIST-1D dataset as a good tool for exploring these properties. In fact, we were able to reproduce the double descent pattern after a few hours of researcher effort. The figure below shows our results for a fully-connected network and a convolutional model. We also observed a nuance that we had not seen mentioned in previous works: when using a mean square error loss, the interpolation threshold lies at \(n * K\) model parameters where \(n\) is the number of training examples and \(K\) is the number of model outputs. But when using a negative log likelihood loss, the interpolation threshold lies at \(n\) model parameters – it does not depend on the number of model outputs. This is an interesting empirical observation that may explain some of the advantage in using a log likelihood loss over a MSE loss on this type of task. You can reproduce these results <a href="https://bit.ly/2UBWWNu">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>05/12/2020</strong></p>

<p>TLDR: use <code>gen_random_uuid</code> to generate v4 uuids.</p>

<p>There are two main functions to generate v4 uuids in postgres, <code>uuid_generate_v4</code> and <code>gen_random_uuid</code>. In postgres 13, <code>gen_random_uuid</code> is a built in function. Otherwise you will need to install the <code>pgcrypto</code> extension. <code>uuid_generate_v4</code> requires the <code>uuid-ossp</code> extension. Depending how postgres is configured, postgres may actually use different libraries for the <code>uuid-ossp</code> extension (ossp-uuid, libc, libuuid) see <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/uuid-ossp.html">postgres doc</a> for more info.</p>

<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>

EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT gen_random_uuid() FROM generate_series(1, 10000);
</code></pre>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

  <li>All benchmarks used postgres 12.x.</li>
  <li>On windows, postgres was installed using https://www.enterprisedb.com.</li>

<p>More investigation is required to determine why <code>uuid_generate_v4()</code> is so slow on windows server. It’s unclear what underlying lib the enterprisedb postgres is using for <code>uuid-ossp</code>. Regardless of why it’s slow on windows server, the best option for now is to use <code>gen_random_uuid</code> which is significantly faster on all platforms tested and comes built in on postgres 13.</p>

<p><strong>update</strong></p>

<p>To be sure the windows issue was not limited to the edb postgres 12.4 version, I did one quick benchmark on the latest edb postgres 13 and found similar execution times for uuid_generate_v4.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><span><i></i></span> <strong>Welcome Hacker News readers!</strong><br>
<strong>•</strong> Thank you to <a href="https://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~mmazhar/">M. Hammad Mazhar</a> for his <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08288.pdf">research</a> that inspired this guide.<br>

<strong>•</strong> The HN <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25313480">comment thread</a> is full of insightful comments from individuals who work on IoT hardware and other embedded devices, and is well worth a read.<br>

<p>If you’re using PiHole on your network to block ads and prevent your various smart devices from sending tracking information to their manufacturers, <strong>you might be surprised to find out that some of these devices are using a sneaky tactic to bypass your PiHole entirely.</strong></p>
<p>Smart devices manufacturers often “hard-code” in a public DNS server, like Google’s 8.8.8.8, and their devices ignore whatever DNS server is assigned by your router - such as your PiHole.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08288.pdf">Nearly 70% of smart TVs and 46% of game consoles</a> were found to contain hardcoded DNS settings - allowing them to simply ignore your local network’s DNS server entirely. On average, Smart TVs generate an average of 60 megabytes of outgoing Internet traffic <em>per day</em>, all the while bypassing tools like PiHole.</p>
<h2 id="force-all-dns-queries-through-pihole">Force all DNS queries through PiHole</h2>
<p>Fortunately, with a few simple firewall rules, you can intercept these hardcoded DNS queries and redirect them to your PiHole. These instructions are for pfSense, however you should be able to adapt them for Sophos XG, Ubiquiti EdgeRouter, etc.</p>
<h3 id="create-nat-rules">Create NAT Rules</h3>
<p>Log in to your pfSense admin interface, and navigate to <em>Firewall</em> &gt; <em>NAT</em> &gt; <em>Port Forward</em>.</p>
<p>We’re going to create two Port Forward NAT rules - one to redirect any DNS queries originating from devices on the LAN to PiHole, and another to allow PiHole to commmunicate with external DNS servers. We will also create an additional outbound NAT rule that will make this process invisible to any clients on the network with hardcoded DNS.</p>
<p><strong>NAT Rule 1: Redirect DNS queries to PiHole</strong></p>
<p>Click the <em>Add</em> button to create your first new NAT Port Forward rule.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interface:</strong> LAN</li>
<li><strong>Protcol:</strong> TCP/UDP</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> LAN net (you may need to click the blue show advanced button to see this option)</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Invert match:</strong> Checked</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Type:</strong> Single host or alias</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Address/mask:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP address</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - From:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - To:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Redirect Target IP:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP address</li>
<li><strong>Redirect Target Port:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Intercept any outgoing DNS queries and redirect them to PiHole.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NAT Rule 2: Exempt PiHole from DNS query redirects</strong></p>
<p>Click the <em>Add</em> button to create your second new NAT Port Forward rule.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No RDR (NOT):</strong> Checked</li>
<li><strong>Interface:</strong> LAN</li>
<li><strong>Protcol:</strong> TCP/UDP</li>
<li><strong>Source - Type:</strong> Single host or alias</li>
<li><strong>Source - Address/Mask:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP address</li>
<li><strong>Destination:</strong> Any</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - From:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - From:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Allow PiHole to reach external DNS servers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> pfSense (and most other firewalls) process rules from top to bottom. Make sure you drag the second rule exempting PiHole from DNS query redirects <em>above</em> the first rule we created - otherwise PiHole will not be able to contact external DNS servers.</p>
<p><strong>NAT Rule 3: Prevent clients from giving unexpected source errors</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we need to create an outbound NAT rule. Navigate to <em>Firewall</em> &gt; <em>NAT</em> &gt; <em>Outbound</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interface:</strong> LAN</li>
<li><strong>Address Family:</strong> IPv4+IPv6</li>
<li><strong>Protocol:</strong> any</li>
<li><strong>Source - Type:</strong> Network</li>
<li><strong>Source - Network for the outbound NAT mapping:</strong> Your internal LAN network</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Type:</strong> Network</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Network for the outbound NAT Mappings:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP Address</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range:</strong> 53</li>
<li><strong>Translation:</strong> Interface Address</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Prevents hardcoded DNS clients from giving unexpected source error after DNS redirected to PiHole.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="test-it-out">Test it out</h3>
<p>You can easily test to make sure your DNS redirection is working properly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new, temporary internal DNS entry on your network (“piholetest.example.com”), and point it to 10.0.1.1. You can do this right from PiHole under <em>Local DNS Records</em>.</li>
<li>Manually set your computer’s DNS server to <em>1.1.1.1</em>.</li>
<li>Open a terminal window (or command promt on Windows), and run <code>nslookup piholetest.example.com</code></li>
<li>
<p>If you set this up correctly, <code>nslookup</code> should return 10.0.1.1. Your computer <em>thinks</em> it’s receiving DNS records from 1.1.1.1, while in reality they are coming from your PiHole.</p>
<div><div><pre><code> macbookpro:~ labzilla$ nslookup piholetest.example.com
 Server:		1.1.1.1
 Address:	1.1.1.1#53
	
 Name:	piholetest.example.com
 Address: 10.0.1.1
</code></pre></div> </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can further demonstate this by temporarily disabling the first NAT rule we created, and running the same <code>nslookup piholetest.example.com</code> command:</p>
<div><div><pre><code> macbookpro:~ labzilla$ nslookup piholetest.example.com
 Server:		1.1.1.1
 Address:	1.1.1.1#53
	
 ** server can't find piholetest.example.com: NXDOMAIN 
</code></pre></div> </div>
<p>As “piholetest.example.com” doesn’t exist on the public Internet, the real 1.1.1.1 server has no record to provide - resulting in your <code>nslookup</code> request returning a NXDOMAIN error.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Don’t forget to revert your computer’s DNS settings back to their original value, and reenable any firewall rules you temporary disabled while testing.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>If you were using computers in the ‘90s and the early 2000s, you probably had the experience of installing a piece of software you downloaded from the internet, only to discover that someone put some nasty into it, and now you’re dragging your computer to IT to beg them to save your data. To remedy this, software developers started “signing” their software in a way that proved both who they were and that nobody tampered with the software after they released it. Every major operating system now supports code or application signature verification, and it’s a backbone of every app store.But what about Kubernetes? How do we know that our Docker images aren’t secret bitcoin miners, stealing traffic away from customers to make somebody rich? That’s where Binary Authorization comes in. It’s a way to apply the code signing and verification that modern systems now rely on to the cloud. Coupled with Voucher, an open source project started by my team at Shopify, we’ve created a way to prevent malicious software from being installed without making developers miserable or forcing them to learn cryptography.</p>
<h2>Why Block Untrusted Applications?</h2>
<p>Your personal or work computer getting compromised is a huge deal! Your personal data being stolen or your computer becoming unusable due to popup ads or background processes doing tasks you don’t know about is incredibly upsetting.</p>
<p>But imagine if you used a compromised service. Imagine if your email host ran in Docker containers in a cluster with a malicious service that wanted to access contents of the email databases? This isn’t just your data, but the data of everyone around you.</p>
<p>This is something we care about deeply at Shopify, since trust is a core component of our relationship with our merchants and our merchants’ relationships with their customers. This is why Binary Authorization has been a priority for Shopify since our move to Kubernetes.</p>
<h2>What is Code Signing?</h2>
<p>Code signing starts by taking a hash of your application. Hashes are made with hashing algorithms that take the contents of something (such as the binary code that makes up an application) and make a short, reproducible value that represents that version. A part of the appeal of hashing algorithms is that it takes an almost insurmountable amount of work (provided you’re using newer algorithms) to find two pieces of data that produce the same hash value.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a file that has the text:</p>
<p><code>Hello World</code></p>
<p>The hash representation of that (using the “sha256” hashing algorithm) is:</p>
<p><code>d2a84f4b8b650937ec8f73cd8be2c74add5a911ba64df27458ed8229da804a26</code></p>
<p>Adding an exclamation mark to the end of our file:</p>
<p><code>Hello World!</code></p>
<p>Results in a completely different hash:</p>
<p><code>03ba204e50d126e4674c005e04d82e84c21366780af1f43bd54a37816b6ab340</code></p>
<p>Once you have a hash of an application, you can run the same hashing algorithm on it to ensure that it hasn’t changed. While this is an important part of the code signing, most signing applications will automatically create a hash of what you are signing, rather than requiring you to hash and then sign the hash separately. It makes the hash creation and verification transparent to the developers and their users.</p>
<p>Once the initial release is ready, the developer that’s signing the application creates a public and private key for signing it, and shares the public key with their future users. The developer then uses the private part of their signing key and the hash of the application to create a value that can be verified with the public part of the key.</p>
<p>For example, with Minisign, a tool for creating signatures quickly, first we create our signing key:</p>

<p>The public half of the key is now:</p>
<p><code>RWSs3jHbeTsmYhWlyqpDEufCe5QSGHsb1fFnglZItPwDfJ3wEZzSGyBJ</code></p>
<p>And the private half remains private, living in&nbsp;<code>/Users/caj/.minisign/minisign.key</code>.</p>
<p>Now, if our application was named “hello” we can create a signature with that private key:</p>

<p>And then your users could verify that “hello” hasn’t been tampered with by running:</p>

<p>Unless you’re a software developer or power user, you likely have never consciously verified a signature, but that’s what’s happening behind the scenes if you’re using a modern operating system.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Where is Code Signing Used?</h2>
<p>Two of the biggest users of code signing are Apple and Google. They use code signing to ensure that you don’t accidentally install software updates that have been tampered with or malicious apps from the internet. Signatures are usually verified in the background, and you only get notified if something is wrong. In Android, you can turn this off by <a href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/marketing-tools/alternative-distribution.html" target="_blank" title="Alternative distribution options - Android Developer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">allowing unknown apps in the phone's settings</a>, whereas iOS requires the device be jailbroken to allow unsigned applications to be installed.</p>
<p><img alt="A macOS dialog window showing that Firefox is damaged and can't be opened. It gives users the option of moving it to the Trash." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/FirefoxMessage.jpg?v=1606786217" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/FirefoxMessage.jpg?v=1606786217"></p>
<p><br><em>A macOS dialog window showing that Firefox is damaged and can't be opened. It gives users the option of moving it to the Trash.</em></p>
<p>In macOS, applications that are missing their developer signatures or don’t have valid signatures are blocked by the operating system and advise users to move them to the Trash.</p>
<p>Most Linux package managers, (such as Apt/DPKG in Debian and Ubuntu, Pacman in ArchLinux) use code signing to ensure that you’re installing packages from the distribution maintainer, and verify those packages at install time.</p>
<p><img alt="Docker Hub showing a docker image created by the author." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/DockerImage.jpg?v=1606786314" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/DockerImage.jpg?v=1606786314"><br><em>Docker Hub showing a docker image created by the author.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Kubernetes doesn’t have this by default. There are features that allow you to leverage code signing, but chances are you haven’t used them.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, do you really trust some rando on the internet to actually give you a container that does what it says it does? Do you want to trust that for your organization? Your customers?</p>
<h2>What is Binary Authorization?</h2>
<p>Binary Authorization is a series of components that work together:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>A metadata service: a service that stores signatures and other image metadata</li>
<li>A Binary Authorization Enforcer: a service that blocks images that it can’t find valid signatures for</li>
<li>A signing service: a system that signs new images and stores those signatures in the metadata service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Google provides the first two services for their Kubernetes servers, which Shopify uses, based on two open source projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grafeas, a metadata service</li>
<li>Kritis, a Binary Authorization Enforcer</li>
</ul>
<p>When using Kritis and Grafeas or the Binary Authorization feature in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), infrastructure developers will configure policies for their clusters, listing the keys (also referred to as attestors) that must have signed the container images before they can run.</p>
<p>When new resources are started in a Kubernetes cluster, the images they reference are sent to the Binary Authorization Enforcer. The Enforcer connects to the metadata service to verify the existence of valid signatures for the image in question and then compares those signatures to the policy for the cluster it runs in. If the image doesn’t have the required signatures, it’s blocked, and any containers that would use it won’t start.You can see how these two systems work together to provide the same security that one gets in one’s operating system! However, there’s one piece that wasn’t provided by Google until recently: the signing service.</p>
<h2>Voucher: The Missing Piece</h2>
<p>Voucher serves as the last piece for Binary Authorization, the signing service. Voucher allows Shopify to run security checks against our Docker images and sign them depending on how secure they are, without requiring that non-security teams manage their signing keys.</p>
<p><img alt="Using Voucher's client software to check an image with the 'is_shopify' check, which verifies if the image was from a Shopify owned repository." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/ImageApproved.jpg?v=1606786428" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/ImageApproved.jpg?v=1606786428"><br><em>Using Voucher's client software to check an image with the 'is_shopify' check, which verifies if the image was from a Shopify owned repository.</em></p>
<p>The way it works is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Voucher runs in Google Cloud Run or Kubernetes and is accessible as a REST endpoint</li>
<li>Every build pipeline automatically calls to Voucher with the path to the image it built</li>
<li>Voucher reviews the image, signs it, and pushes that signature to the metadata service</li>
</ol>
<p>On top of the basic code signing workflow discussed previously, Voucher also supports validating more complicated requirements, using separate security checks and associated signing keys to mix and match required signatures on a per cluster basis to create distinct policies based on a cluster’s requirement.</p>
<p>For example, do you want to block images that weren’t built internally? Voucher has a distinct check for verifying that an image is associated with a Git commit in a Github repo you own, and signing those images with a separate key.</p>
<p>Alternatively, do you need to be able to prove that every change was approved by multiple people? Voucher can support that, creating signatures based on the existence of approvals in Github (with support for other code hosting services coming soon). This would allow you to use Binary Authorization to block images that would violate that requirement.</p>
<p>Voucher also has support for verifying the identity of the container builder, blocking images with a high number of vulnerabilities, and so on. And Voucher was designed to be extensible, allowing for the creation of new checks as need be.By combining Voucher’s checks and Binary Authorization policies, infrastructure teams can create a layered approach to securing their organization’s Kubernetes clusters. Compliance clusters can be configured to require approvals and block images with vulnerabilities, while clusters for experiments and staging can use less strict policies to allow developers to move faster, all with minimum work from non-security focused developers.</p>
<h2>Voucher Joins Grafeas</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Voucher serves a need that hasn’t been provided by Google <i>until recently</i>. This is because <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/introducing-voucher-service-help-secure-container-supply-chain" target="_blank" title="Introducing Voucher, a service to help secure the container supply chain" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Voucher has moved into the Grafeas organization</a> and now is a service provided by Google to Google Kubernetes Engine users going forwards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since our move to Kubernetes, Shopify’s security team has been working with Google’s Binary Authorization team to plan out how we’ll roll out Binary Authorization and design Voucher. We also released Voucher as an open source project in December 2018. This move to the Grafeas …</p></div></div>

  <p>In my experience, discussing code coverage has always been done with an expectation of a binary conclusion; it’s either a good metric to shoot for or it isn’t. It seems to me like there’s more to be gained if the question is framed differently: how does one achieve high code coverage <em>beneficially</em>?</p>

<p>Asking it this way leads to more fruitful argumentation because the following points are no longer part of the question:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code coverage is a bad metric because it encourages writing sweeping tests that don’t test anything.</li>
  <li>Code coverage sometimes forces developers to test library code.</li>
  <li>Code coverage ultimately makes a code base more difficult to maintain because of all the extra meaningless tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>To those arguments, my answer is: the problem is not code coverage, but code that’s hard to test, a dogmatic approach to unit testing leading to their misuse, or the very fact that one often tries to increase code coverage by writing more tests.</p>

<p>So, as an exercise, let’s agree on this for the next couple of paragraphs: code coverage is a good metric as long as you’re honest about how to increase it.</p>

<p>What does it mean to be honest about increasing coverage?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t start by trying to test the uncovered lines. Start by questioning the implementation instead, and look for ways to reduce complexity.</li>
  <li>If you’re testing library code or glue code, perhaps the implementation deals with mixed-up concerns that you can distinguish and test differently.</li>
  <li>A code base full of meaningless tests is indicative of a deeper problem with the implementation. Try to find that problem instead of writing more meaningless tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>Code coverage can bear a lot of meaning or very little. If you decide to track it, you and your peers will face having to decide whether to be diligent about it or not, and I’d say that’s a good thing.</p>

Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash"></a><figcaption>(Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Slack’s life as an underdog darling of Silicon Valley ended on November 2, 2016. That’s when the upstart communication startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">published an open letter to Microsoft in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">New York Times</a></em>, offering the tech giant an insincere “welcome” to the world of workplace chat software. The occasion was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13405200/microsoft-teams-slack-competitor-launch">Microsoft’s launch of Teams</a>, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.</p><p>In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding: “we’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats">took Teams from zero to 115 million users</a>. </p><p>That disparity helps to explain why <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html">Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce</a>. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/salesforce-acquires-slack-salesforces-reasoning-salesforces-opportunity/">offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack</a>.)</p><p>But it also feels like the end of an era — one where workers gained new power to bring their own tools to the office, and decide for themselves how they wanted to get work done. Slack first succeeded with small teams who wanted to accelerate their work, and was often dragged into organizations by early adopters. But today, waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices.</p><p>The rise of smart phones in the early 2010s brought with it a new surge of workplace productivity tools that made mincemeat of everything that had come before them. Box and Dropbox brought easy file storage and sharing. Evernote introduced the idea of ubiquitous, cloud-synchronized note-taking. Sunrise created a more social calendar, while Mailbox and Acompli reimagined email for the mobile phone.</p><p>Slack tiptoed into the conversation in the middle of the decade, and almost immediately became the fastest-growing enterprise software tool of all time. In 2015, just 18 months after it launched, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8836087/slack-1-million-daily-users">Slack reported having more than 1 million daily users</a> —&nbsp;a figure then unheard-of in enterprise software.</p><p>It had a great backstory —&nbsp;a last-ditch pivot from a failed video game called Glitch —&nbsp;and, in Stewart Butterfield, one of the tech world’s most charming founders. It also had a bold pitch: it was going to “kill email” —&nbsp;or, at the very least, reduce your reliance on it. And it would do so by integrating hundreds of other services into real-time work chat, creating a kind of all-knowing command console for your organization.</p><p>The company embodied the belief, so common in Silicon Valley, that the best product would win in the end. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” the company wrote in its open letter to Microsoft. “How far you go in helping companies truly transform to take advantage of this shift in working is even more important than the individual software features you are duplicating.”</p><p>And yet if there’s a lesson of the past four years, it’s that thoughtfulness and craftsmanship only got the company about 10 percent as far as Microsoft did by copy-pasting Slack’s basic design. In its open letter, Slack famously told Microsoft: “You’ve got to do this with love.” In 2020, looking at Slack’s size, the idea seems laughable. What’s love got to do with it?</p><p>The thing is, I <em>hate</em> that this was the outcome for Slack. I love good productivity tools, and was rooting for Slack to someday become as good as the company hyped it up to be. (And perhaps it still will: like most giants Salesforce has a mixed track record when it comes to the success of its acquisitions, but some seem to be thriving. When I asked about this on Twitter, people had <a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1333891286185644032?s=21">a lot of good things to say about post-acquisition Heroku</a>.)</p><p>But Slack’s struggle to succeed as an independent company sadly mirrors that of many one-time innovators in enterprise productivity. Mailbox died and Acompli sold to Microsoft, where it became the mobile Outlook app. Evernote is a pale shadow of its former self. Of that early cohort, only Box and Dropbox became — and still remain —&nbsp;public companies.</p><p>Why is this the case? To get some insight, I called up Aaron Levie, Box’s affable CEO. In Levie’s telling —&nbsp;and he also wrote <a href="https://blog.box.com/salesforce-slack-and-future-work">a blog post about the Slack sale</a> — it all comes down to sales. The idea that workers would someday choose all their own tools was always a fantasy, he told me, in part because most workers don’t event want to think about their tools. In such a world, the winning app will almost always be one with a giant, er, salesforce behind it. </p><p>Microsoft had one. Slack didn’t. Enter Salesforce.</p><p>“The reality with the enterprise is that you can have the best product, but that’s not good enough,” Levie told me. “You need distribution. And what Salesforce has — they have the procurement officers, they have the finance people. They have all of the apparatus you need to interact with to sell software, and they have it for the top 100,000 corporations around the world.”</p><p>Levie is bullish on the acquisition, because it puts Slack and Salesforce on more even ground. </p><p>“The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage that Microsoft has had,” he said. “All of a sudden, they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity, because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.”</p><p>Assuming Levie is right — and I wouldn’t bet against him — that means the medium-term future of work is increasingly a choice between three giants: Microsoft, Salesforce, and (in a distant third) Google. And with that, the golden age of worker choice in productivity tools seems to be coming to an end.</p><p>That’s not to say that the incumbents won’t always face new challengers. But I wonder whether the low ceiling that Slack turned out to have has implications for some of the other fast-growing productivity companies of the current moment. Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable, or Notion, or Coda? Don’t get me wrong — I’m confident their investors will all get their money back, and then some. But do they have a real future outside the arms of a monolith?</p><p>If not, then the productivity market will become as consolidated as any number of other spaces on the internet, from app stores to search engines to social networks. And as our government antitrust regulators begin to awaken after a long period of hibernation, I wonder if they’ll have anything to say about it.</p><h3>The Ratio</h3><p><em>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies</em></p><p>⬆️ <strong>Trending up</strong>: <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">Google</a></strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">’s new paid deals with publishers mean that access to some paywalled content will now be available to readers for free</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you spend a lot of time on Hacker News, it’s easy to get taken by the allure of building a web app without a framework. There are a bunch of potential advantages (no bloat! bespoke to your project!) and being able to say you built something with minimal dependencies gets you Engineer Points.</p>
<p>That is, if you can pull it off.</p>
<p>I started a new side project recently. It’s a web-based graphics editor, so it needs to be a single page app. My time spent profiling <a href="https://songrender.com/">SongRender</a> for performance issues has made me a little wary of React for building interfaces that update at 60 frames per second, so I decided to avoid it. I’d go (mostly) vanilla and see how far that took me.</p>
<p>I installed <a href="https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/">lit-html</a> and got to work. “Components” were simply functions that returned lit-html template results. A big singleton at the top of the tree held onto all the application state, stored as a global variable within that module.</p>
<p>The first hurdle came when a component needed local state. I could have lifted it to the singleton, but that would have broken the component’s encapsulation. I noticed that lit-html directives can keep state, so I decided to use them to build a tiny component library — ignoring a warning from the lit-html developers that this wasn’t a supported use case.</p>
<p>My home-brewed library worked great… until I needed to run some code when a component appeared on the screen. I started digging through lit-html documentation and issues looking for a way to detect a directive’s lifecycle, but it became clear to me that going down that path would be painful.</p>
<p>At that point, I recalled <a href="https://tomdale.net/2015/11/javascript-frameworks-and-mobile-performance/">this quote by Tom Dale</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have heard from many developers who have told me that they accepted the argument that vanilla JavaScript or microlibraries would let them write leaner, meaner, faster apps. After a year or two, however, what they found themselves with was a slower, bigger, less documented and unmaintained in-house framework with no community. As apps grow, you tend to need the abstractions that a framework offers. Either you or the community write the code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fair enough. Let’s avoid that trap. What about a small framework? I’d heard a lot of good things about Svelte, and although I was slightly worried about the size of the Svelte community I figured it would be fine.</p>
<p>My migration attempt quickly ground to a halt when I wanted a parent component to apply some styles to a child component. In React, I’d pass a class name in from the parent as a <code>className</code> prop. In Svelte, that’s considered a workaround, and the actual feature is the subject of an <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0000-style-properties.md">RFC</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Maybe this is an example of <a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/160.html">dangling by a trivial feature</a>. But it’s so basic a capability that I’m surprised Svelte is on version three without an officially blessed way to do it. I ran into this limitation when I created my <strong>second component</strong>. Way before I got to try out any of the cool reactivity that earns Svelte all that buzz.</p>
<p>So I changed my mind and went with React. After an hour or so, I’d finished moving everything over — and my anxiety had vanished. I stopped worrying about having most efficient component system, and picked up work on the thing I wanted to build in the first place.</p>
<p>No, React isn’t perfect. It’s optimized for apps that make network requests and then display lists of things (i.e. most apps) which isn’t really what I’m doing here<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The performance is fine now, although I expect I’ll have to optimize as my project gets more complex.</p>
<p>But React lets me stop thinking about the framework. React gets out of my way. React is <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">boring</a>. React is actively developed. React has a giant ecosystem and a giant community. React is battle-tested on some of the most visited websites in the world.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are technically better ways to build a highly interactive interface on the web, but life is too short for me to spend hours trying to figure them out. There are things I want to create, and the only way I can actually create them is to stop spending so much time on tooling.</p>
<p>For now, I’m choosing React.</p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The solution they seem to have landed on — letting the child expose CSS custom properties as props — is actually pretty cool, though I don’t like that Svelte will silently wrap your component with an extra <code>div</code>. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<p>Although Dan, if you read this, the <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1133341485133438982">“animation pass” mode</a> you’ve mentioned offhandedly sounds very relevant! <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<p>If you’re using PiHole on your network to block ads and prevent your various smart devices from sending tracking information to their manufacturers, <strong>you might be surprised to find out that some of these devices are using a sneaky tactic to bypass your PiHole entirely.</strong></p>
<p>Smart devices manufacturers often “hard-code” in a public DNS server, like Google’s 8.8.8.8, and their devices ignore whatever DNS server is assigned by your router - such as your PiHole.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08288.pdf">Nearly 70% of smart TVs and 46% of game consoles</a> were found to contain hardcoded DNS settings - allowing them to simply ignore your local network’s DNS server entirely. On average, Smart TVs generate an average of 60 megabytes of outgoing Internet traffic <em>per day</em>, all the while bypassing tools like PiHole.</p>

<p>Fortunately, with a few simple firewall rules, you can intercept these hardcoded DNS queries and redirect them to your PiHole. These instructions are for pfSense, however you should be able to adapt them for Sophos XG, Ubiquiti EdgeRouter, etc.</p>

<p>We’re going to create two Port Forward NAT rules - one to redirect any DNS queries originating from devices on the LAN to PiHole, and another to allow PiHole to commmunicate with external DNS servers. We will also create an additional outbound NAT rule that will make this process invisible to any clients on the network with hardcoded DNS.</p>
<p><strong>NAT Rule 1: Redirect DNS queries to PiHole</strong></p>
<p>Click the <em>Add</em> button to create your first new NAT Port Forward rule.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interface:</strong> LAN</li>
<li><strong>Protcol:</strong> TCP/UDP</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> LAN net (you may need to click the blue show advanced button to see this option)</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Invert match:</strong> Checked</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Type:</strong> Single host or alias</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Address/mask:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP address</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - From:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - To:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Redirect Target IP:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP address</li>
<li><strong>Redirect Target Port:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Intercept any outgoing DNS queries and redirect them to PiHole.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NAT Rule 2: Exempt PiHole from DNS query redirects</strong></p>
<p>Click the <em>Add</em> button to create your second new NAT Port Forward rule.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No RDR (NOT):</strong> Checked</li>
<li><strong>Interface:</strong> LAN</li>
<li><strong>Protcol:</strong> TCP/UDP</li>
<li><strong>Source - Type:</strong> Single host or alias</li>
<li><strong>Source - Address/Mask:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP address</li>
<li><strong>Destination:</strong> Any</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - From:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range - From:</strong> DNS</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Allow PiHole to reach external DNS servers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> pfSense (and most other firewalls) process rules from top to bottom. Make sure you drag the second rule exempting PiHole from DNS query redirects <em>above</em> the first rule we created - otherwise PiHole will not be able to contact external DNS servers.</p>
<p><strong>NAT Rule 3: Prevent clients from giving unexpected source errors</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we need to create an outbound NAT rule. Navigate to <em>Firewall</em> &gt; <em>NAT</em> &gt; <em>Outbound</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interface:</strong> LAN</li>
<li><strong>Address Family:</strong> IPv4+IPv6</li>
<li><strong>Protocol:</strong> any</li>
<li><strong>Source - Type:</strong> Network</li>
<li><strong>Source - Network for the outbound NAT mapping:</strong> Your internal LAN network</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Type:</strong> Network</li>
<li><strong>Destination - Network for the outbound NAT Mappings:</strong> Your PiHole’s IP Address</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port Range:</strong> 53</li>
<li><strong>Translation:</strong> Interface Address</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Prevents hardcoded DNS clients from giving unexpected source error after DNS redirected to PiHole.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="test-it-out">Test it out</h3>
<p>You can easily test to make sure your DNS redirection is working properly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new, temporary internal DNS entry on your network (“piholetest.example.com”), and point it to 10.0.1.1. You can do this right from PiHole under <em>Local DNS Records</em>.</li>
<li>Manually set your computer’s DNS server to <em>1.1.1.1</em>.</li>
<li>Open a terminal window (or command promt on Windows), and run <code>nslookup piholetest.example.com</code></li>
<li>
<p>If you set this up correctly, <code>nslookup</code> should return 10.0.1.1. Your computer <em>thinks</em> it’s receiving DNS records from 1.1.1.1, while in reality they are coming from your PiHole.</p>
<div><div><pre><code> macbookpro:~ labzilla$ nslookup piholetest.example.com
 Server:		1.1.1.1
 Address:	1.1.1.1#53
	
 Name:	piholetest.example.com
 Address: 10.0.1.1
</code></pre></div> </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can further demonstate this by temporarily disabling the first NAT rule we created, and running the same <code>nslookup piholetest.example.com</code> command:</p>
<div><div><pre><code> macbookpro:~ labzilla$ nslookup piholetest.example.com
 Server:		1.1.1.1
 Address:	1.1.1.1#53
	
 ** server can't find piholetest.example.com: NXDOMAIN 
</code></pre></div> </div>
<p>As “piholetest.example.com” doesn’t exist on the public Internet, the real 1.1.1.1 server has no record to provide - resulting in your <code>nslookup</code> request returning a NXDOMAIN error.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Don’t forget to revert your computer’s DNS settings back to their original value, and reenable any firewall rules you temporary disabled while testing.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Out of all Lisps the ones I’ve come to appreciate the most are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a> and <a href="https://common-lisp.net/">Common
Lisp</a>. <!--break-->These two languages are fundamentally very different: Scheme
is a minimalist language built on the foundations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda calculus</a>, while
Common Lisp is a multi-paradigm synthesis of many Lisps before it. Common Lisp
is a large standard with many implementations, Scheme is a collection of an
evolving but minimalistic standard with many implementations. The core of Scheme
is quite small compared to Common Lisp. The latest standard <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/final/r6rs-lib.pdf">R6RS</a> is about 65
pages, while the ANSI Common Lisp standard from 1994 is about 1100 pages. The
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/">Scheme Requests for Implementation</a> process aims to standardize additional
features (like <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-64/srfi-64.html">test suites</a>) that implementations may implement.</p>

<p>Common Lisp has some wonderful features, <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-conditions-and-restarts.html">conditions and restarts</a>, the <a href="https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/clos.html">Common
Lisp Object System (CLOS)</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">the macro system</a>, among many other things. The <a href="http://joaotavora.github.io/sly/">SLY
IDE for Emacs</a> is <em>amazing</em>, and the <a href="http://www.sbcl.org/">Steel Bank Common Lisp</a> compiler is really
great. It has <a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/index.html">Quicklisp</a> and <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/">ASDF</a> for package and build management,
respectively. I find the developer experience of Common Lisp to be superior to
almost anything imaginable, and this is not an empty statement: having used all
sorts of IDEs and editors for over 25 years, I have seen <em>many</em>.</p>

<h3 id="tastes-differ">Tastes differ</h3>

<p>That said, Common Lisp is <em>weird</em>. What I find particularly jarring is that
functions and variables live in different namespaces: if you put a function into
a variable, you can’t just use it like a function, you have to <code>funcall</code> it.
Having programmed in lots of languages of the ML family this is just, well, odd;
but this is due to historical reasons and there are <a href="http://www.nhplace.com/kent/Papers/Technical-Issues.html">sound technical reasons for
it</a>.  There are other
oddities, some strange things like <code>(cdr '())</code> is not an error (in Scheme it
is), <code>()</code> and <code>nil</code> are equal (in Scheme <code>#f</code> and <code>()</code> are separate things), and
so on.</p>

<p>This isn’t really a fault in Common Lisp: other languages have impacted my taste
and preferences to bias me in the direction of Scheme, but that is not to say I
cannot work with Common Lisp’s idiosyncracies. Actually, I don’t mind them, I
just <em>notice</em> them.</p>

<p>I like the naming styles of Scheme more, as well. It has <code>string?</code> vs <code>string-p</code>
for predicate functions, <code>set!</code>  for state modifying functions, <code>foo-&gt;bar</code> for
conversions, these make code quite easier to read. Scheme has hygienic macros,
Guile has the traditional <code>defmacro</code> as well.</p>

<p>Many nice Scheme features are available in Common Lisp libraries. Pattern match
is available in the <a href="https://github.com/guicho271828/trivia">trivia</a> library. Named lets are easy to implement with a macro.</p>

<p>Common Lisp aficionados are quick to point out things Scheme <em>doesn’t</em> have:
keyword arguments, docstrings, rest arguments, but my Scheme implementation of
choice Guile has these built into the language.</p>

<h3 id="productivity-matters">Productivity matters</h3>

<p>Guile is in a strange niche is that its primary <em>raison d’être</em> is to be an
extension language for the GNU project. Like Emacs Lisp is for extending Emacs,
Guile is the <em>de facto</em> language for GNU programs for extension and scripting.</p>

<p>Guile doesn’t have Quicklisp and its package manager and build system is
basically nonexistent for the first and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">Autoconf</a> for the second. There is
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-user/2017-03/msg00168.html">sentiment</a> in the Guile community to have <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a> as the package manager for
Guile. This might sound a bit onerous, since Guix is also a complete package
management for many other things than Guile, but consider this: as Andy Wingo
points out in his message that Guile libraries often come with C extensions,
Guile packages need some sort of managed build system for building the C
extensions. Since it doesn’t have one, to solve the problem of building a
package manager you’d also have to build a build system that can manage C code
and packages needed by the C code bits. To do this elegantly is a gargantuan
task, for instance, <a href="https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Extensions#installing-eggs-that-use-libraries">chicken-install just asks you to put compiler/linker flags
on the command line before calling it</a>, so it obviously is a hard problem.</p>

<p>Now, Guix solves all that, and more, in a manner that is quite elegant and
interesting. But it’s not as lightweight as something like Quicklisp or
<a href="https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Extensions"><code>chicken-install</code></a> from <a href="http://call-cc.org/">CHICKEN Scheme</a>. What is more, Guix works only on GNU/Linux
systems really, so macOS and Windows users won’t be able to do use your library
if you plan on distributing it via Guix. Duh, it’s the GNU project, but
portability is always nice.</p>

<p>But in Common Lisp I can write <code>(ql:quickload :alexandria)</code> and voilà, it will
automatically install the <a href="http://quickdocs.org/alexandria/">Alexandria</a> library that I can use. Then again, in
Common Lisp it’s somewhat rarer to have C extensions, so I don’t know how ASDF
handles that.</p>

<p>It is unfair to compare <a href="http://joaotavora.github.io/sly/">SLY</a> to <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/geiser/">Geiser</a>, the best Emacs Scheme integration
package.  SLY is based on <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a> which has <em>decades</em> of man-years of work behind
it. Geiser is able to support multiple Scheme implementations and it is quite
impressive in this regard. But SLY obviously has much more (e.g. an interactive
debugger). That said, Geiser has nice Guile support, and Guile is in general the
most Common Lisp-y of all Schemes, in fact, it has</p>

<ul>
  <li>an imitation of CLOS in the form of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/goops/">GOOPS</a></li>
  <li>docstrings and keyword, rest, and optional arguments for function
definitions</li>
  <li>an interactive REPL and a mutable top-level (unlike many Schemes)</li>
  <li>a nice module system</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Defmacros.html"><code>defmacro</code></a> and exceptions somewhat <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Raising-and-Handling-Exceptions.html">similar to Common Lisp restarts </a></li>
</ul>

<p>and some nice things Common Lisp doesn’t have like first-class
continuations. But then again I would use those rarely.</p>

<h3 id="when-would-i-pick-one-over-the-other">When would I pick one over the other?</h3>

<p>If I were to write an extensible C/C++/Rust program that I <em>know</em> will need to use
a low-level language, I might do the low level bits using a low level language
and then write the rest in Guile. Guile makes it very easy to spin up a REPL
socket to do something like <code>myprogram --repl=12345</code> that you can connect to, and
the interop between C and Guile is fantastic, it has to be, as it’s primarily an
extension language.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if were to build a wholly standalone application, the choice is
not as obvious. I could do the whole thing in either language. Common Lisp can
build native executables, although their size will be large (who cares?) since
the binary will include the whole Lisp implementation. Guile cannot compile to
native code so you’ll have to write a script executable, but that doesn’t really
matter.</p>

<p>Scenarios where I would pick Guile:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when I’m making an extensible program that has to have some C/C++ bits but I
want to make it scriptable by users</li>
  <li>when I want to write a native binary but not write too much C/C++ code</li>
  <li>I just want to write Scheme, because Scheme is a bit more elegant</li>
  <li>the project has something to do with the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">GNU project</a></li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, Common Lisp makes the most sense if I just want to enjoy a
seriously rapid development experience, a large standard library and language,
and I don’t mind having 50MB binaries (again, who cares?) if I were to write
standalone programs. Guile can’t do that, but it’s easy to either write Guile
scripts or a C program that essentially bootstraps a binary to load a Scheme
runtime. This is how <a href="http://lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a> is written, for example.</p>

<p>So the answer to which one is decidedly <strong>both</strong>! Both languages are really fun to
write. At the moment I don’t do Lisp at my day job so it’s all for fun
anyway. If this were for professional purposes, I don’t know. Very often a
strict requirement for professional work is to be able to be productive. In that
regard I think Common Lisp has a significant edge, not only due to its superior
development experience, but its history as a real production language. There are
actual companies doing stuff in Common Lisp. I have not heard of any
professional (in the industrial sense) uses of Guile, notwithstanding that many
projects powered by Guile (Guix, etc.)  are <em>extremely</em> professional in the way
they are written and maintained. But Common Lisp has <em>more</em> libraries and
companies behind it.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-clojure">What about Clojure?</h3>

<p>I’ve actually had the pleasure to use Clojure for personal fun, and a little bit
of professional use. I wrote a couple of libraries (<a href="https://github.com/ane/vigil">vigil</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ane/task">task</a>) and my
experience with has always been positive and its development experience is
excellent. Clojure isn’t a true Lisp, or well, it is part of the <em>Lisp
family</em>. Its ability to interface with the JVM makes it easy to leverage the
thousands of JVM libraries out there.</p>

<p>I’d gladly do it again, though I feel that Common Lisp with CLOS and its module
system makes it somewhat easier to practice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_in_the_large_and_programming_in_the_small"><em>programming in the large</em></a>. Clojure
explores interesting territories with <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/spec">spec</a>, so it is interesting to see what
direction the language will take in the future.</p>

<h3 id="final-words-emacs-lisp">Final words: Emacs Lisp</h3>

<p>There’s also a parenthetical elephant in the room here: Emacs Lisp! An old
descendant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maclisp">MacLisp</a>, it’s actually quite fun to write, and the fact that Emacs
itself is the interpreter, you have superb introspectability for any Elisp
code. Most of the Lisp I write these days is probably Emacs Lisp. It’s very
close to Common Lisp. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/cl.html#Overview">cl-lib</a> adds a sufficient amount of convenience from
Common Lisp to make Elisp writing quite enjoyable. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eieio.html#Top">EIEIO</a> adds a subset of CLOS
that can be used seamlessly with cl-lib. The condition system is missing.</p>

<p>I’ve also done a fair bit of <a href="https://fennel-lang.org/">Fennel</a>, a Lisp that compiles to Lua. I used it to
write a <a href="https://github.com/ane/mudrally">small game</a> and it was fun to write since you could develop the game in a
REPL.</p>

<p>All in all, Lisp in all its variants is the most fun I’ve ever had while
programming a computer. Guile and Common Lisp are definitely the most fun I’ve
had programming in <em>Lisp</em>.</p>

                            </p>
                            
                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>The delivery of mouse and touch events in Qt Quick is complex, and it became clear a few years ago that we needed to refactor the event inheritance hierarchy, to have some common API for various event types, so that more of the delivery code could be shared. In Qt 5.8 we added QQuickPointerEvent and associated types, as a way of prototyping what that could look like. They are QObjects; and since then, QQuickWindow has been delivering these wrapper events that carry the original events inside. Now finally in Qt 6 we have been able to complete the QEvent refactoring, so that QQuickWindow no longer needs the wrappers. Along with that, we were able to add a few features and fix a few bugs. Many of the remaining bugs that seemed intractable in Qt 5 should at least be possible to fix later on.</p>
<!--more--><h2>Say hello to QPointerEvent and QEventPoint</h2>
<p>The inheritance hierarchy now looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=1280&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png" alt="event-hierarchy-qt6" width="1280" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=640&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 640w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=1280&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 1280w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=1920&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 1920w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=2560&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 2560w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=3200&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 3200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=3840&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 3840w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"><br>QPointerEvent is the new abstract type for all events that come from pointing devices (mouse, touchscreen, tablet stylus). It has the common API to be able to handle all these in a device-agnostic way. Since QTouchEvent can carry multiple touchpoints in one event, we standardized this concept: every QPointerEvent represents potentially a cluster of QEventPoint instances (even though most events only carry one point), and therefore has appropriate API: points(), point(i) and pointCount(). <br>Every QInputEvent (including QPointerEvent) carries a pointer to the QInputDevice that it came from. This allows event-handling code to respond in device-specific ways, even when handling synthetic mouse events. </p>
<p>Every QEventPoint has velocity. The Kalman filter that Qt Quick was using in Qt 5 has been moved to QtGui, so that the average velocity from the last few movements is available wherever the event is delivered. This enables velocity-sensitive behavior (such as distinguishing a slow drag from a quick flick, or responding to a particular direction of movement) regardless which device it comes from. Instantaneous velocity is generally too volatile for such purposes, but if you need it you can calculate it as <code>(globalPosition() - globalLastPosition()) / (timestamp() - lastTimestamp())</code>. </p>
<p>QSinglePointEvent is another abstract type that standardizes the position accessors that used to be separately and inconsistently implemented in QMouseEvent, QTabletEvent, QHoverEvent, QWheelEvent and a few more. They are all floating-point now. position() replaces pos() and posF(), scenePosition() replaces windowPos(), and globalPosition() replaces screenPos(). The old accessors are still there for now, but deprecated: a Qt 5 application will not encounter an SC break just because of handling QMouseEvent, for example. QEventPoint replaces QTouchEvent::TouchPoint, but there is a "using" declaration for the sake of source compatibililty. </p>
<p>I have <a href="https://github.com/ec1oud/clazy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">forked clazy</a> and added a new qevent-accessors check, which might save you some trouble: it can automatically apply "fixits" to get rid of the deprecation warnings stemming from the event accessor renaming. (Yes we should upstream that change.)</p>
<h2>Device-agnostic event handling in C++</h2>
<p>In various places in Qt we can now respond to mouse, touch and tablet events (such as detecting a click or a drag), either by iterating the QEventPoints, or just responding to the first point. Here's a contrived example of how a QQuickItem subclass could do that: </p>
<pre>bool MyItem::event(QEvent *ev) override {<br>  if (ev-&gt;isPointerEvent()) {<br>    QPointerEvent *pev = static_cast&lt;QPointerEvent *&gt;(ev);<br>    for (QEventPoint &amp;point : pev-&gt;points()) {<br>      switch (point.state()) {<br>      case QEventPoint::State::Pressed:<br>        if (reactToPress(point.position()))<br>          pev-&gt;setExclusiveGrabber(point, this);<br>        break;<br>      case QEventPoint::State::Updated:<br>        ...<br>      }<br>    }<br>    return true;<br>  }<br>  return QQuickItem::event(ev);<br>}</pre>
<p>QQuickFlickable::childMouseEventFilter() works this way, for example. And that has an interesting result: </p>
<h2>Flickable handles touch now! </h2>
<p>There were many open bugs related to the fact that Qt 5's Flickable could only handle actual mouse events and synthetic mouse events. Qt only supports one mouse, one mouse position, one cursor (so far, but we're working on that...) and therefore you could not flick two Flickables with two fingers. If you touch some component inside the Flickable that is able to handle touch events, but then you drag your finger across the Flickable in the allowed direction, it uses childMouseEventFilter() to steal the grab from that component; but that involved switching from the actual touch event to a synthetic mouse event, and also remembering to deliver the following updates as synth-mouse events to Flickable. Various things went wrong. Well... those days are over, because Flickable::childMouseEventFilter() no longer cares which device the QPointerEvents come from. If you set pressDelay, it's able to withhold the actual touch press and then replay it to the items inside when the timer expires. Yes, you can now drag multiple Flickables with multiple fingers too.</p>

But it can be avoided. In general: try to use Event Handlers rather than MouseArea, because (as its name indicates) it's not really intended to support anything more than mouse interaction. </p>
<p>QTabletEvents (from your Wacom stylus, Samsung S-pen, Apple Pencil etc.) are also just pointer events that carry a few more properties, and can be handled by any device-agnostic code that handles mouse and touch events. But we will keep working on improving the experience with those. We didn't add any new virtual functions in QQuickItem for them, but they will get delivered to QQuickItem::event() soon. </p>
<p>Another thing we're still working on is making Flickable behave better with laptop touchpads. A fix is coming soon. </p>
<h2>Left to your own devices</h2>
<p>Platform plugins now have responsibility to discover and register input devices, in order to fulfill the promise that every QInputEvent tells you exactly where it came from. Some of this work is already done on some of the platforms. (On others it's proving to be problematic.) You can get a list of all registered devices from QInputDevice::devices(). The qtdiag utility also shows you this list. </p>
<p>QInputDevice is a QObject, and its parent() can be another device in case there is a natural hierarchy: for example, X11 has master and slave devices, and a tablet stylus "belongs to" a particular tablet device. In other cases, the parent is simply an object within the platform plugin that owns the device for memory management purposes. </p>
<p>On the platforms where the device discovery work is not done, QInputEvent::device() is never null, but may be a generic instance taken from QInputDevice::primaryKeyboard() or QPointingDevice::primaryMouse(). Touchscreen devices are unique though; we already did it that way in Qt 5. </p>
<p>QInputDevice::seatName() correponds to the Wayland notion of a "seat": a set of devices that one user is using. There is little multi-seat support so far, but it will be improved over time. If you configure a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Multi-pointer_X" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multi-pointer X server</a>, you can see different seat names on different devices, but those names are automatically generated from xinput IDs in the xcb plugin. On Wayland compositors such as <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/experimental/sway/sway-input.5.en.html#SEAT_CONFIGURATION" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sway</a>, it's possible to give the seats arbitrary names; and we plan that Qt will eventually work with that. </p>

December 5, 2020 | https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-11-25-asterius-th/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-11-25-asterius-th/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Template Haskell (TH) is a widely used yet controversial language extension. You have
probably used it in your own code; with a single line of splice code, you can
achieve tasks like deriving instances and embedding files easily. And you might
also have heard the reasons why people may dislike it: it slows down
compilation, breaks encapsulation, arbitrary IO at compile time is risky, etc.</p>
<p>But it is less well known that Template Haskell also makes cross compilation
with GHC harder. In this post, we’ll show why this is a challenge, some existing
solutions developed by the community, and in particular, how this problem is
addressed by <a href="https://github.com/tweag/Asterius">Asterius</a>.</p>
<h2>Just run some code at compile time, what can go wrong?</h2>
<p>Conceptually, Template Haskell is a principled way of generating Haskell AST at
compile time, like in the simplified example below:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code>

<span><span>import</span> Data.Char</span>
<span><span>import</span> Language.Haskell.TH.Syntax</span>
<span><span>import</span> System.Process</span>

<span>gitRev</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span>
<span>gitRev</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>$</span><span>(</span> <span>do</span>
       <span>rev</span> <span>&lt;-</span>
         <span>runIO</span> <span>$</span>
           <span>filter</span> <span>isHexDigit</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>readProcess</span> <span>"git"</span> <span>[</span><span>"rev-parse"</span><span>,</span> <span>"HEAD"</span><span>]</span> <span>""</span>
       <span>liftString</span> <span>rev</span>
   <span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Suppose we’d like to define a <code>gitRev</code> string that represents the current <code>git</code>
revision in the project repository. This can be done using an expression splice:
it is written using the <code>$(...)</code> syntax, and the content within <code>$()</code> is an
expression of type <code>Q Exp</code>, representing a compile-time computation that returns
an <code>Exp</code> value, which is, in this case, the current <code>git</code> revision as a string
literal.</p>
<p>Splice code lives in the <code>Q</code> monad, which manages the context for Template
Haskell and provides a rich set of interfaces. Inside <code>Q</code> we can query info
about datatypes or functions, allocate fresh identifiers, etc. Arbitrary <code>IO</code>
actions may also be run inside <code>Q</code>. Here, we run <code>git rev-parse HEAD</code> to obtain
the <code>git</code> revision and then return it. When GHC compiles this module, the splice
is replaced with a string literal, and compilation moves on.</p>
<p>So at first glance, Template Haskell is just about running user code at compile
time, what can go wrong? All is right for most developers, who compile to the
same platform they run GHC on, but there’s trouble ahead when you try to do
cross compilation…</p>
<h2>The what and why of cross compilation</h2>
<p>Suppose we’d like to write a Haskell app for an Android phone or a Raspberry
Pi. It’s possible to bootstrap a native GHC release on them and use it to
compile stuff, but given the limited hardware resources of these machines, it’s
wiser to run GHC on a proper x64 build server and emit code for these ARM
devices. When we do so, we’re performing <em>cross compilation</em>. Some terminology:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>host</em> platform is where we run GHC to compile stuff.</li>
<li>The <em>build</em> platform is where we compile GHC. For simplicity, we assume
build=host and only use the host term from now on.</li>
<li>The <em>target</em> platform is where we run the compiled Haskell app. When
host=target, the GHC is a <em>native</em> GHC, otherwise it’s a <em>cross</em> GHC.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a native GHC, Template Haskell isn’t a problem, since GHC can link and run its
emitted code just like native dynamic libraries. But this doesn’t work
out-of-the-box for a cross GHC.</p>
<p>Over the years, people have come up with different approaches to address the
cross compilation issue of Template Haskell, each coming with its own rough
edges; more details follow in later sections.</p>
<h2>Only run TH on the host platform</h2>
<p>If we can’t run emitted code, then how about we don’t run it at all and stay
with a cross GHC without TH support? We’ll preprocess the cross GHC input code,
strip usages of the Template Haskell extension, and replace all TH splices with
the expanded code. And the way to expand the splices would be… using a native
GHC to compile it!</p>
<p>There’s a GHC flag <code>-ddump-splices</code> which dumps the expanded splices code.
Unfortunately, the dump output has extra text decorations and isn’t proper Haskell
source code, so it takes more work to use the dumps. Here’s a list of known
implementations of the splice dump approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://source.git-annex.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=blob;f=Build/EvilSplicer.hs;h=e07034c5b05f47c316a1e68e6a85d54335c8e253;hb=aaa841e60a55524c3efb5e9783b8e6074d2413cc"><code>EvilSplicer</code></a> uses a <code>parsec</code>-based parser to process the dumps
for later consumption of cross GHC. It was used in the
<a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com/"><code>git-annex</code></a> project until late 2018.</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/zeroth"><code>ZeroTH</code></a> is a tool which does something similar, and includes a CLI
and <code>Cabal</code>-related helper functions.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-platform"><code>reflex-platform</code></a> uses a patched native GHC which dumps the
expanded splices as proper Haskell source code, and feeds into <a href="https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs">GHCJS</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, making native/cross GHC work together is not trivial:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike <code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code> which can emit code for other platforms by simply
adding relevant CLI flags, a GHC installation can only emit code for a single
target platform configured at its build time. So two different GHC
installations must be managed in isolated places.</li>
<li>Native/cross GHC must have the same version and process the same build plan to
minimize the chance of emitting wrong code. Say package <code>foo</code> includes a TH
splice that uses package <code>bar</code>, if native/cross GHC sees different versions
(or even same version but different build plan) of <code>bar</code>, the splice behavior
could potentially differ, expanding into wrong code that may be silently
consumed by cross GHC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the complexity of the required hacks and GHC/Cabal’s lack of cross
compilation support, it’s common to use an external build system (e.g.
<a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a>) to encapsulate this mechanism.</p>
<p>Other than saving dumps of expanded splices, there is another solution to only
run TH splice code on the host platform: the same GHC always compile everything
to both host/target code in one invocation! When running TH, we can just load
host code just like native GHC. This requires quite some customization of GHC
behavior and is only possible for 3rd-party compilers based on GHC API. In
fact, GHCJS used this approach in its earliest days.</p>
<h3>Pros and cons of running TH on the host platform</h3>
<p>Running TH on the host platform works for pure splices, which can only do
things like reifying info and generating ASTs. It should also work pretty well
for side-effecting splices which reads files, spawns processes or fires
missiles, since the splice behavior should be just the same as when we use a
native GHC to compile stuff.</p>
<p>But is this the end of story? Not yet. Here’s one immediate problem: the
native/cross GHC may not consume the same Haskell sources despite our best
efforts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Haskell modules may use the <code>CPP</code> extension with target-specific macros, so
when you compile for different targets, you see different top-level
definitions.</li>
<li>Cabal files may also check implementation/platform/etc, and end up with
different flags or even different modules to be consumed by GHC.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problems above will likely trigger compile-time errors. And there’s an even
stealthier problem that may lead to generating incorrect code instead of a
crash: the architecture difference of host/target, e.g. word size or endianness.
For instance, a TH splice may make use of <code>sizeOf (undefined :: Int)</code>, which is
4 on 32-bit target platforms, and if the host platform is 64-bit, then the TH
splice will see 8, which sneaks into the emitted code without a single warning.</p>
<h2>Run TH code on the target platform</h2>
<p>As explained in earlier sections, vanilla GHC can only link and run host code.
Would it be possible to teach GHC to link and run target code? The answer is
yes. The key to supporting running non-native code is RPC (Remote Procedure
Calls). GHC needs to call into target code to obtain the splice expansion
result; the target code needs to call GHC to do reification. These calls are
achieved via exchanging serialized messages between GHC and the loaded splices.
Since there is a fixed set of operations allowed in the <code>Q</code> monad (as methods of
the <code>Quasi</code> class), the operations and the results can be encoded as a
serializable <code>Message</code> datatype.</p>
<p>This RPC approach to run TH code is standardized in the <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/commentary/compiler/external-interpreter">external
interpreter</a> feature. When running TH, GHC starts an
external process calls <code>iserv</code>, pipes messages to <code>iserv</code> and tells it to load
archives, objects, etc and link code. After a splice starts running in <code>iserv</code>,
<code>iserv</code> may send queries back to GHC and get results. Finally, the splice
expansion result is sent back to GHC.</p>
<p>The external interpreter opens up the possibility of using various emulators
(e.g. <code>wine</code> for windows, <code>node</code> for js/wasm or even <code>qemu</code> for exotic
platforms) to run target code for TH. GHC itself doesn’t need to care about how
the code is actually linked and run in <code>iserv</code>, and TH should work as long as
our target-specific <code>iserv</code> can properly process the messages.</p>
<p>This approach was pioneered by GHCJS, and later made it into upstream GHC by
7.10. Other than GHCJS, known users include:</p>
<ul>
<li>GHC itself, even in native GHC! But why bother? Well, suppose we’re compiling
a profiled library with TH usage. Since profiled code follows different
runtime conventions and links with profiled runtime, in the early days, a
profiled GHC executable was needed. Now, we can simply use a profiled <code>iserv</code>
executable, and avoid the extra profiling overhead in GHC.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix">haskell.nix</a>, which includes support for cross-compiling to
Windows via <code>wine</code> emulation of TH code.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@zw3rk">Mobile Haskell</a>, which are ARM-targetting GHC distributions.
They use Android/iOS emulators to set up the splice runtime environment. GHC
talks to an <code>iserv-proxy</code> process via pipes, and <code>iserv-proxy</code> merely relays
the messages to the real <code>iserv</code> program in the emulator via a socket.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/typelead/eta">Eta</a> Haskell-to-JVM compiler.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tweag/Asterius">Asterius</a>, which uses <code>node</code> for running the WebAssembly &amp;
JavaScript code.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pros and cons of running TH on the target platform</h3>
<p>Compared to running TH on the host platform, there are a few benefits to
running it on the target platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>No host/target incoherence issues, as explained in earlier sections.</li>
<li>Less hacky and more standardized. Although upstream GHC won’t likely contain
<code>iserv</code> implementations for all interesting target platforms out there,
developers can just roll their own if needed.</li>
<li>Simpler, since there isn’t a bunch of hacks to be packaged via nix anymore,
and it works with vanilla <code>cabal</code>/<code>stack</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be tempting to announce TH for cross compilation is now a solved
problem! Turns out it’s not. Recall how TH enables running …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>In this guide I am going to show you how to setup <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD" target="_blank">CI/CD</a> with GitHub Actions for Rails. I assume you are running Linux and have Rails 6 installed together with PostgreSQL and Git. If you need help, I wrote a guide on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://codingwizardry.com/2020/11/10/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-on-ubuntu-20-04/" target="_blank">how to install Rails with PostgreSQL on Ubuntu 20.04</a>. In this tutorial we will create a basic Rails application. We will upload the application to GitHub, integrate GitHub Actions, and setup a CI/CD workflow that deploys to Heroku. Let’s begin!</p>



<h2>Setting Up PostgreSQL</h2>



<p>Create a PostgreSQL user for the Rails app we’ll create in the next step. To do this, switch into the <code>postgres</code> user and fire up <code>psql</code>:</p>



<pre><code>$ sudo -u postgres -i
$ psql</code></pre>



<p>Then create a new user (or “role”, as PostgreSQL calls it):</p>



<pre><code>$ create role social_network with createdb login password 'password1';</code></pre>



<p>To go back you type <code>\q </code>to exit psql and <code>exit</code> to return to your main terminal.</p>



<h2>Creating a New Rails App</h2>



<p>Navigate to a directory on your computer where you want to store the project (I like to use <code>~/dev</code>) and execute the following commands:</p>



<pre><code>$ rails new social_network -d postgresql
$ cd social_network</code></pre>



<p>Open up the <code>config/database.yml</code> file in a text editor and under <code>default</code> find the line that says <code>pool: &lt;%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %&gt;</code> and add the following lines: </p>



<pre><code>host: localhost
username: social_network
password: &lt;%= ENV['SOCIAL_NETWORK_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %&gt;</code></pre>



<p>We are going to need an environment variable to store the database password. The password should match the password used in the previous step. Execute the following commands:</p>



<pre><code>$ echo 'export SOCIAL_NETWORK_DATABASE_PASSWORD="password1"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc</code></pre>



<p>Finally, we’ll create our database and launch our application.</p>



<pre><code>$ rails db:create
$ rails server</code></pre>



<p>You can now visit <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://localhost:3000/" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a> and if everything has gone right you will be greeted by the following website:</p>

<h2>Add Project to GitHub</h2>



<p>Next up, let’s create a new repository on GitHub. You can create a new repository <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/new" target="_blank">here</a> once you’re logged into GitHub.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="724" height="716" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-e1605980210642.png" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-e1605980210642.png 724w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-e1605980210642-300x297.png 300w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-e1605980210642-585x579.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px"></figure>



<p>Then we want to link the GitHub repository to our local project. In the <code>social_network</code> folder execute the following command:</p>



<pre><code>$ git remote add origin git@github.com:your_username/social-network.git</code></pre>



<p>Or if you prefer to use HTTPS instead of SSH, run the following command:</p>



<pre><code>$ git remote add origin https://github.com/your_username/social-network.git</code></pre>



<p>Verify that we’ve set the remote origin correctly:</p>



<pre><code>$ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:your_username/social-network.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:your_username/social-network.git (push)</code></pre>



<p>Because we’ve let GitHub create a README.md and .gitignore file for us, let’s remove the the ones generated by Rails, and pull the new files (including a LICENCE file) from GitHub into our local project folder:</p>



<pre><code>$ rm .gitignore README.md
$ git pull origin main
From github.com:your_username/social-network
 * branch            main       -&gt; FETCH_HEAD</code></pre>



<p>Now to push all our local files onto GitHub, execute the following commands. Note here that we have to rename our master branch to main, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-alternative-term-to-avoid-slavery-references/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GitHub no longer uses the name master</a> in order to rid itself from references to slavery.</p>



<pre><code>$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git branch -m master main
$ git push --set-upstream origin main</code></pre>



<p>If everything went well, we’ve successfully uploaded our newly created Rails application to GitHub.</p>



<h2>Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions</h2>



<p>To set up GitHub Actions for our project we’ll need a workflow file. A workflow is an automated procedure that you can add to a repository. Workflows are made up of one or more jobs and can be scheduled or triggered by an event. The workflow can be used to build, test, package, release, or deploy a project on GitHub. You can read more about GitHub Actions <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. In this tutorial we’re going to use a workflow to test the project and, if all tests pass, deploy the project to <a href="https://heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heroku</a>.</p>



<p>Let’s start by creating a functional workflow file. This file will be able to automatically run the, currently non-existent, tests. In your project folder create a new directory <code>.github/workflows/</code>. Within the newly created workflows directory create a new workflow file <code>social-network.yml</code>:</p>



<pre><code>name: Social Network
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres
        ports: ['5432:5432']
        env:
          POSTGRES_USER: social_network
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
        options: &gt;-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: '14.x'
      - name: Set up Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: 2.7
          bundler-cache: true
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          bundle install --jobs 4 --retry 3
          yarn
      - name: Set up database
        run: bundle exec rails db:prepare
        env:
           SOCIAL_NETWORK_DATABASE_PASSWORD: postgres
      - name: Run tests
        run: bundle exec rails test
        env:
           RAILS_ENV: test
           SOCIAL_NETWORK_DATABASE_PASSWORD: postgres       </code></pre>



<p>To understand the workflow file I recommend you take a moment to read the “Understanding the workflow file” section in the GitHub Actions documentation <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions#understanding-the-workflow-file" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Now, commit and push the file to GitHub:</p>



<pre><code>$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Add automated tests workflow"
$ git push</code></pre>



<p>Head over to GitHub and select the <strong>Actions</strong> tab in the social-network repository and click on “Add automated tests workflow”, you will see the following output:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1015" height="654" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3-e1606833342684.png" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3-e1606833342684.png 1015w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3-e1606833342684-300x193.png 300w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3-e1606833342684-768x495.png 768w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3-e1606833342684-585x377.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1015px) 100vw, 1015px"></figure>



<p>We’ve successfully set up continuous integration! In the next section we will focus on automatic deployment to Heroku.</p>



<h2>Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions</h2>



<p>Create a new Heroku account if you haven’t already got on <a href="https://signup.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Then, create a new app within Heroku <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Choose an app name and select your region, I like to prefix the app name with my last name:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="655" height="327" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1.png 655w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-300x150.png 300w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-585x292.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px"></figure>



<p>In order to deploy to Heroku we will need to setup a GitHub Secret with the Heroku API key. The API key can be found <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Create a new GitHub secret:</p>



<ol><li>On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.</li><li>Under the repository name, click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>In the left sidebar, click <strong>Secrets</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>New repository secret</strong>.</li><li>Type <code>HEROKU_API_KEY</code> in the <strong>Name</strong> input box.</li><li>Paste the Heroku API key in the <strong>Value</strong> input box.</li></ol>



<p>We can now use this secret in the workflow file. Update the workflow file to deploy to Heroku once all tests pass:</p>

         heroku_email: 'Your email'</code></pre>



<p>In order to execute commands on Heroku once the project is deployed, we need a <code>Procfile</code>. We will need to execute commands that set up the database and start the application. Go ahead and create the file in the project root directory with the following contents:</p>



<pre><code>release: bundle exec rails db:prepare
web: bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb</code></pre>



<p>Commit the changes:</p>



<pre><code>$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Add automated deployment to workflow"</code></pre>



<p>We are almost ready to push to GitHub. But first, add a root route so that the project knows what to display whenever a users surfs to the website. Add a function named <code>index</code> to <code>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</code>:</p>



<pre><code>class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
  def index
    render html: 'Hello, world!'
  end
end</code></pre>



<p>Then, add a root route to <code>config/routes.rb</code>:</p>



<pre><code>Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root 'application#index'
end</code></pre>



<p>Commit the changes once more and push to GitHub:</p>



<pre><code>$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Add root route"
$ git push</code></pre>



<p>Head over to GitHub Actions and confirm that all tests pass:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Standing in line with other high-end brands, <em>“Less is better”</em> has always been the one principle that we can all observe in Apple’s branding and design. From their physical store layouts to their website and products including hardware and software, Apple has always emanated a sense of luxury in their aesthetic. And that’s what makes them stand out.</p>
<!--more--><p>What standards has Apple set for the world of design? Let’s take a close look at how they do it.</p>
<h2><strong>How Apple Does Web Design</strong></h2>
<p>Do you remember the first time you went on Apple’s website to check out their new iPhone? You were probably really quickly convinced by the clean typography, smooth animation flows, and high definition product images that immersed you by filling your screen… that you wanted one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple’s web design doesn’t just function, it wows.<img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=1383&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png" alt="Apple iPad product images and descriptions clean white space and font" width="1383" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=692&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 692w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=1383&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 1383w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=2075&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 2075w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=2766&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 2766w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=3458&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 3458w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=4149&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 4149w" sizes="(max-width: 1383px) 100vw, 1383px">(Image Source: Apple)</p>
<p>If we look at how Apple’s website has transformed over the years, we can see that minimalistic web design is one of its most consistent catches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their website focuses on clutterless single content areas that highlight one piece of content at a time with plenty of white space and wide margins. Not only is this design aesthetically pleasing, it is easy on the eyes and makes content easy to take in.</p>
<p>To make reading even lighter, Apple also uses simple headlines that show you the main idea of the paragraph without requiring you to read the paragraph.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=1488&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png" alt="Apple homepage iPhone 12 Pro product image" width="1488" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=744&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 744w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=1488&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 1488w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=2232&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 2232w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=2976&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 2976w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=3720&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 3720w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=4464&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 4464w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px">(Image Source: Apple)</p>
<p>On their homepage, it’s difficult to ignore the huge product image that appears as soon as you enter, filling your entire screen from edge to edge, immersing you in it. The reason behind this design choice is to prevent decision fatigue and give visitors room to breathe. Instead of pushing their products onto you all at once, they let you focus on one single product, one headline, and one catchy subheadline.</p>
<p>Unlike most other websites that use multiple, smaller product photos, Apple uses techniques that obey the principles of visual hierarchy. They use large images, high contrast and bold typefaces for emphasis, and maximize space around it to draw even more attention to the subject. That is why when you glance at the image above, ‘iPhone 12 Pro’ takes center stage before anything else.</p>
<h2><strong>How Apple Does Product Design</strong></h2>
<p><span>It’s no unpopular opinion that Apple products look AND feel luxurious, whether it’s the iPhone, Mac, iPad or Apple Watch. One of the most groundbreaking moments for Apple was when they launched the original Macbook Air in 2008. Their iconic </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ywa_EynjC8"><span>Envelope Ad</span></a><span> went viral because at the time, the Macbook Air was the thinnest laptop ever in the market.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>When we look at their unrivaled history of success, we can’t help but wonder: What’s been keeping Apple products ahead of the rest all these years?</span></p>

<p><span>Yes, Apple definitely has a strong focus on user experience, premium quality, practical design, and even tasking users’ feedback into consideration. But ask anyone what they think stands out about Apple products, and they’ll mention one thing </span><span>—</span> <em><span>simplicity</span></em><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The book </span><em><span>Steve Jobs Biography</span></em><span> written by Walter Isaacson highlights Apple’s emphasis on simplicity:</span></p>
<p><span><em>Jobs’ belief in the power of simplicity as a design precept reached its pinnacle with the three consumer device triumphs he produced beginning in 2001: the iPod, iPhone and iPad. He immersed himself daily in the design of the original iPod and its interface.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>His main demand was <strong>“Simplify!”</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span><em>He would go over each screen and apply a rigid test: If he wanted a song or a function, he should be able to get there in three clicks. And the click should be intuitive. If he couldn’t figure out how to navigate to something, or if it took more than three clicks, he would be brutal.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>“There would be times when we’d wrack our brains on a user interface problem, and think we’d considered every option, and he would go, ‘Did you think of this?’” said Tony Fadell, the team leader.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>“He’d redefine the problem or approach, and our little problem would go away.”</em></span></p>
<p><span>This is what makes Apple’s design unique. With Jobs’ hard focus on clean, simple, and sleek, iOS had started a big design wave </span><span>that, to this day, has Android operating systems scrambling to ride it.</span></p>
<p><span>When Apple launched the iPad 2 in Silicon Valley in 2011, Jobs said:</span></p>
<p><span><em>“It is in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough - it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing.”&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>Today, it’s clear that Apple designers are continuing his legacy in keeping Apple at the intersection of technology and liberal arts. This is the reason why Apple’s design is great. Their products don't just look good, they’re designed in a way that thinks about the people they’re designed for.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong><span>Next Step for You</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>User experience makes Apple the winner that it is today. At Snappymob, we believe in the same thing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We design products that function with feelings and connect with humans. If you’re in search of a product design and development agency, we are here to help.&nbsp;</span></p>

                                    <p>PWAs are (hopefully) here to stay.</p><p>As I mentioned in my <a href="https://blog.s1h.org/wedding-pwa/">previous post</a>,</p><p>the problem with native apps is that they are supposed to be distributed via a dedicated app store.</p><p>To be able to distribute apps via these stores requires you to sign up for a developer account,</p><p>which requires a one time or regular payment.</p><p>(I do know about open-source app stores like <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a> for Android,</p><p>but I do assume that the largest portion of smartphone users does not.)</p><p>That's exactly where PWA's come into play!</p><h2 id="ok-sounds-cool-but-what-exactly-is-a-pwa">Ok, sounds cool, but what exactly <strong>IS</strong> a PWA?</h2><p>The most important thing about PWAs is that it's possible to enhance any existing web application with progressive features.</p><p>PWA features integrate seamlessly into existing applications, when added carefully they will be available in supporting browsers, but also not cause any differences or errors on browsers which do not (yet) support them.</p><p>In my opinion, the three core building blocks which make up a PWA are the following:</p><ol><li>Responsive, engaging Design</li><li>Modern JavaScript APIs</li><li>Service Workers</li><li>HTTPS</li></ol><p>The thing I want to talk about in this post is regarding the design of PWAs, but more posts will follow.</p><p>(Except for HTTPS. Here you only have to know that full-featured PWAs require HTTPS. You'll see why in the post on service workers. If you do not yet have a valid TLS certificate, I can only recommend <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/">Let's Encrypt - Free SSL/TLS Certificates</a>. As an alternative, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> are also served via HTTPS and allow for custom domains.)</p><h2 id="responsive-design">Responsive Design</h2><p>Over the course of years certain UI / UX patterns established in smartphone apps.</p><p>The two most notable styles are certainly the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/themes/">iOS interface guidelines</a> and Google's <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html">Material Design</a>.</p><p>These two style guides contain detailed information on how to design user interfaces for the respective platform,</p><p>as well as guidelines on how to handle user interaction.</p><p>Taking these guidelines into account gives new users an easier onboarding to your app,</p><p>since the overall look and feel already seems "familiar".</p><p>These guidelines are also of interest for progressive web apps.</p><p>Since a PWA could be used as a light-weight alternative to the full web page (<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/">Twitter lite</a> for example),</p><p>or even serve as a full replacement to native apps,</p><p>users of your PWA should still feel at home,</p><p>no matter whether they are using a native app or visiting the web app.</p><h3 id="mobile-first">Mobile First</h3><p>The old-school approach when designing a webpage was to make it look good on desktop browsers and later on make it look ok on mobile browsers.</p><p>The mobile first approach takes the other way round by designing webpages with mobile devices in mind.</p><p>Design for smartphones but also apply techniques to make the webpage look good when accessed via desktop browser.</p><p>To make this possible one could rely on a CSS framework like Twitter's <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> or <a href="https://getmdl.io/">Material Design Lite</a>,</p><p>but it certainly does no harm to read up on CSS Media Queries <a href="https://blog.s1h.org/p/70dac731-261c-4e22-bbc0-efd51aa8a53c/">1</a>, <a href="https://blog.s1h.org/p/70dac731-261c-4e22-bbc0-efd51aa8a53c/">2</a>.</p><p>With mobile first UIs in place, another major point which distinguishes web apps from native apps is the fact, that web apps are still running in a browser.</p><p>One of the cool things about PWAs is that they can be "installed" to a device (well, currently it's an Android device, to be precise) like a native app.</p><p>The requirement for this is a so-called "<strong>app manifest</strong>".</p><h2 id="web-app-manifest">Web App Manifest</h2><p>The web app manifest contains metadata about a web application.</p><p>It's actually a simple JSON file, but it's also common to name the file</p><pre><code>manifest.webmanifest
</code></pre><p>The manifest file allows configuring things like application name, icons, display style, color schemes and much more.</p><p>The following listing shows the content of wddng's manifest:</p><pre><code>{
  "name": "wddng",

[…] Moreover, not every shift of the viewer will reveal something significant. It can be just more of the same, or nothing worth reflecting on.

It's by far <a href="https://hjerpbakk.com/tag/csharp/">my favorite programming language</a>. And who wouldn't agree? I mean with a piffy, roll of the tounge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">Wikipedia description</a> like this, what is not to love?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Yeah, yeah", I hear you say dear reader. "I know C# is great to use if you want to write better Java apps, even so, this is the Bekk Functional advent calendar. What are you rambling about?"</p>
<p>I know you love your pure, scalable functions in <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_programming#Purity">Haskell</a> and your fancy web pages written in <a href="https://www.elm.christmas/2020">Elm</a>, but did you spot the magic word in the description above? It said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... <strong>functional</strong> ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes! As the late Sean Connery <a href="https://youtu.be/hKJZ9pzDMCk">said so excitedly</a>:</p>

<p>C# is not only useful on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core?view=aspnetcore-5.0">backend</a>, while writing <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/">iOS and Android apps</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-5.0">replacing JS in the browser</a> or as a <a href="https://github.com/filipw/dotnet-script">scripting language</a>, it also becomes more and more functional-friendly with every new language version!</p>
<p>However, what does it mean to be a <em>functional-friendly</em> programming language?</p>
<h2>Functional advantages</h2>
<p>Enrico Buonanno argues in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-write-better-code/dp/1617293954/">Functional Programming in C#: How to write better C# code</a> that we should care about functional programming because it gives us the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power:</strong> We can get more done with less code. Functional programming raises the level of abstraction, allowing us to write high-level code while freeing us from low-level technicalities that add complexity but no value.</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> A program written in the imperative style may work well in a single-threaded implementation but due to the mutable state that is in its nature, cause all sorts of bugs when concurrency comes in. Code in the functional style might offer better guarantees in concurrent scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> We spend more time maintaining and consuming existing code than writing new code, so it’s important that our code be clear and intention-revealing. As we learn to think functionally, achieving this clarity will become more natural.</li>
</ul>
<p>C# supports a lot of <a href="https://functionalprogrammingcsharp.com/functional-features-of-c-sharp">functional building blocks</a>, such as <em>function delegates</em>, <em>higher order functions</em>, <em>expressions instead of statements</em>, <em>method chaining</em>, <em>extension methods</em>, <em>yield</em>, <em>LINQ</em>, <em>tuples</em> and <em>local functions</em>. Despite all that, the core functional tenet of <em>immutability of data</em> has always been a C# pain point. Until now.</p>
<h2>Immutability in C#</h2>
<p>C# second greatest error<sup><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></sup> was to one-up Java and introduce the concept of properties as a first class language feature with the poorest defaults of all time: the default property syntax made it all too easy to create classes with mutable properties. The deed is as simple as:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Person</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> Age <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="https://hjerpbakk.com/img/christmas/the-wolf.png" alt="Listen to the wolf"></p>
<p>Alas, premature aging can take its toll and we should've listened to the dog, hound, wolf or whatever, and make the <code>age</code> property immutable. It came with a cost however, amounting to a lot more work and boilerplate code. I mean, I got bored by just writing out this small example from the past:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Person</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> age<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span><span>uint</span></span> age<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.</span>age <span>=</span> age<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> Age <span>{</span> <span>return</span> age<span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties#expression-body-definitions">C# 6</a> made the pit of success a bit deeper by introducing read-only properties using only a <code>get</code> accessor:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Person</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span><span>uint</span></span> age<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        Age <span>=</span> age<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> Age <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/struct#readonly-struct">C# 7.2</a> made declaring our intent more explicit by allowing a <code>struct</code> to be marked as <code>readonly</code>:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Person</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span><span>uint</span></span> age<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        Age <span>=</span> age<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> Age <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is all well and good, yet consider when our class or struct has multiple readonly properties and we need to construct a new copy with an updated value in one or more of them. My head hurts just by thinking about it. The boilerplate has tested my Christmas spirit, why must we endure this error prone, manual waste? A better way must exist!</p>
<h2>Records in C# 9</h2>
<p>And finally this year, at the end of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu3k2PJumfI">worst year ever</a>, it does! Microsoft bestowed <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9">.Net 5 and C# 9</a> upon us, giving us my most requested feature: <em>language support for immutable data types</em>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9#record-types">Record types</a>!</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>record</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span><span>uint</span></span> Age<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>A <code>record</code> is immutable in that none of the properties can be modified once it's been created. When we define a record type, the compiler provides several useful methods for us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Methods for value-based equality comparisons</li>
<li>Override for <code>GetHashCode()</code></li>
<li>Copy and Clone members</li>
<li><code>PrintMembers</code> and <code>ToString()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Seems like we're finally winning the war against boilerplate, and if we need to create a copy with an updated value, we can now easily use the <code>with</code> keyword:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span><span>var</span></span> me <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span>37</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>Person</span> meAYearOlder <span>=</span> <span>me</span> with <span>{</span> Age <span>=</span> <span>38</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With such quality functional features in C# like <em>immutable records</em>, not even time's inevitable flowing towards my 40th birthday and usage of 24(!) year old memes can break this aging developer's Christmas spirit!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I spent a large part of 2019 working with the distributed and decentralized web, especially IPFS, also known as the “Inter-Planetary File System”. I’ve written a few articles on the topic, on how you can host a web app on IPFS, one of which even ended up on the front page of HackerNews.</p><p>For about a year, I hosted my blog and other apps through an IPFS cluster. I wrote a utility for making pinning files easier on Pinata, a third-party cloud service for IPFS. I made some small contributions to the IPFS core projects. I built some projects with it, including one that I never released–nor fully completed–that used both IPFS and Ethereum. And I even gave a talk about hosting static web apps on IPFS at Node+JS Interactive last December in Montreal.</p><p>That all changed in the Spring of 2020. I called myself out of the distributed web.</p><p>My blog and other apps I built aren’t hosted on IPFS anymore. I don’t participate in those online communities anymore. I’ve stopped writing about the distributed and researching about it. I’ve shelved all my projects that were using those technologies.</p><p>I also updated my blog posts about IPFS adding a note that my blog isn’t hosted that way anymore. More than a few people asked me why, and I always gave the same answer: a mix of technical issues and mostly personal reasons. So, I think it’s time I explain the personal reasons.</p><p>First, I need to explain why I got involved with IPFS in the first place.</p><p>When I first read about IPFS, my mind immediately saw it as an exciting new platform I could build my apps for. The premise of a fully-decentralized platform included unlimited scalability, ultra-high availability and resiliency, no single points of failure, and resistance against attacks like DDoS.</p><p>Coming from a background in which I am always thinking about SLAs, number of nines of uptime, disaster recovery, etc, IPFS sounded like a dream platform that would magically solve all my concerns. And, aside from some performance issues at times, it did. Plus, the small engineer inside me was really excited about being able to play with a new, shiny toy, that had lots of hype around it!</p><p>What happened next for me was a reckoning with the reality of what many people behind the IPFS core project and the community around it saw: the dream of a radically open, unfiltered, and by-design un-censorable platform.</p><p>I have recently opened up about my experience, over a decade ago, with building an app with good intentions but that was then misused (<a href="https://withblue.ink/2020/09/24/that-time-i-accidentally-built-a-spying-app.html"><em>That time I accidentally built a spying app</em></a>). I learned early on in my life and (pre-)professional career about the importance of ethics in software development, and I am now a proponent of the idea that just because something <em>can</em> be built, it doesn’t mean it <em>should</em> be built.</p><p>And that brings me back to why, after spending some time in the world of the decentralized web, I have called myself out, and why I think that should things like IPFS actually become mainstream, they might cause more harm than good in the world.</p><p><strong>I have seen, and I am seeing every day, the dangers of completely unrestricted speech, and I don’t want to be the one enabling that.</strong></p><p>I know that last sentence is a strong ideological statement; some might call it a <em>political</em> statement, but for me it’s more than just political, which is often used to describe extemporary beliefs.</p><p>Many of you reading this will not agree with me, and that’s fine. I’m not going to try and change your beliefs with this blog post. Rather, I’m looking to explain why, while I respect that others might have differing opinions, I stopped doing anything that would actively advance a technology whose ethics I question. To put it in other terms: your freedom of speech isn’t my obligation to enable you and give you a platform.</p><p>In short, I think that while the Internet has helped the world in countless of ways, it has also brought out the worst in people.</p><p>I do believe we need some filters on the Internet. It’s not just about stopping criminal activities, terrorism and child pornography: while I am obviously unsupportive of all them, I also think they’re not the biggest dangers coming from the Internet (yet they’re a very convenient pretext for politicians).</p><p>Instead, I think that regular people’s writings on the Internet is hurting the world on a bigger scale. And the collective sentiment is often manipulated by some “agitators” that are exploiting anonymous online speech for their own agendas: that includes online militias–for example sponsored by foreign governments–whose goal is to destabilize a society.</p><p>In the last few years, completely unregulated online speech has given rise to fake news and conspiracy theories that have actually killed people. It’s offered a megaphone to those promoting dangerous ideas like white supremacy, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, homophobia and other anti-LGBTQ positions, and sometimes outright Nazism. It has tilted many democracies towards right-wing populism and fascism.</p><p>All these extreme ideas have divided societies and increased social tensions. And they’re responsible for a number of acts of terrorism which caused the death of too many people.</p><p>Given our experiences so far, there’s no sign that indicates that a fully decentralized and unrestrained web would be anything but a dangerous wild west.</p><p>In fact, despite being tightly centralized and controlled, social media companies are facing significant challenges regulating what people write on their platforms, and in fact they are usually at the center of every scandal of these years. Decentralization and less control won’t be the solution to this issue, but rather the opposite.</p><p>If you believe that I’m overthinking this, and that it’s not going to be bad <em>this time</em>, I urge you to think twice.</p><p>First, there’s no indication that a new Web would be better than the previous one just on virtue of being decentralized. The same actors that are using today’s Internet to wreak havoc around the world would not disappear in the new Internet, and actually, they could be even more unrestrained.</p><p>Second, while almost everyone in the communities supporting a distributed web are good people, with good intentions, seeing some names in there is concerning to me. Regarding IPFS, advocates (at least for a while) included people like Nick Lim of BitMitigate and VanwaNet, companies responsible for rescuing, among others, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2017/seattles-bitmitigate-now-protecting-pro-nazi-site-daily-stormer-web-attacks/">pro-nazi website</a> The Daily Stormer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/breaking-the-law-how-8chan-or-8kun-got-briefly-back-online/">and the platform</a> 8chan, a cesspool full of Nazi propaganda, child pornography, and other hate speech. Gatherings on 8chan have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8chan#2019_shootings">blamed</a> for at least three mass shootings in 2019 alone, including the one in the <a href="https://time.com/5648479/8chan-ban-new-zealand/">mosque in Christchurch</a>, all of them motivated by racial hatred.</p><p>The first real examples of the distributed web aren’t particularly encouraging either. Among some of the most popular apps (“popular” in relative terms, of course) for the distributed web is DTube, a sort of YouTube that is built on top of IPFS. As you can expect, the website is full of questionable content, including conspiracy theories, cryptocurrency scams, weapons, RT&nbsp;International’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/26/russia-disinformation-rt-nuanced-online-ofcom-fine">Russian propaganda</a>… and of course, porn.</p><p>In essence, if it’s true that <em>a good beginning makes a good ending</em>… with such a mixed beginning, the outlook isn’t too rosy.</p><p>I understand that my opinion is somehow a minority one, and people will continue to build IPFS and other technologies part of the distributed web. There’s also a chance they might become successful and potentially get mainstream adoption–although at this stage the barrier to entry is too high for the average user.</p><p>However, I feel that it’s my responsibility to not be helping to advance this technology and the beliefs of at least some advocates in the world of the distributed web hold. If the advancement occurs, it won’t be because of my help.</p><hr><p><em>PS: The idea that freedom of speech is an absolute right that should have (almost) no limitations is not a universal one. While that right is granted to people living in all democratic countries, outside of North America it’s accepted that such right comes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/world/europe/el-paso-shooting-freedom-of-speech.html">with limitations</a>, and usually that has roots in the history of those places.</em></p><p><em>For example, in Italy where I grew up, the same constitution that grants freedom of expression (speech, press, etc) also criminalizes “apology of fascism”, or propagating the ideas of fascism; it also sets other limits on speech that is hateful or discriminatory. Other European countries have similar laws, such as the outlawing of Nazi rhetoric and symbology in Germany.</em></p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section><p>It is well known that prime numbers are important for cryptography, although it has not always been true. The advent of primes came with several groundbreaking papers almost 50 years ago. Pioneers in introducing asymmetric cryptography, Whit Diffie, Martin Hellman, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, used results from number theory to build key agreement, encryption, and signatures. Prime numbers hold a very special position in number theory, and this carried over to cryptography.</p>
<h2>From Primes to Crypto</h2>
<p>Cryptographic protocols are typically working <em>modulo</em> some prime <em>p</em>. This can be likened to turning the number line into a coil, such that 0, <em>p</em>, 2<em>p</em>, etc. all join at the same place. From then on, whenever we add or multiply the number such that we go beyond <em>p</em>, we can simply remove as many multiples of <em>p</em> as necessary until we come between 0 and <em>p</em> again.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that we used a composite number instead, for example 12. Then 0 and 12 are "the same" in this situation, but that also means that 3 multiplied by 4 is ... 0! One of the intuitions when working with normal numbers is that if <em>ab</em> = 0, then either <em>a</em> or <em>b</em> would have to be 0. Hence, when using composite numbers, there is simply stuff that no longer works the way we’re used to. Fortunately, this is not the case when using the primes — for instance 7 — as our so-called modulus.</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/curves.png"></p>
<p>Let’s make a rule, and let’s call it <em>m</em>. We take the coil we just made from the number line, and since we can always reduce numbers to below <em>p</em>, we label our points on this circle from 0 to <em>p</em>-1. Given two points <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> on the circle, we decided that the output of the rule <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) should be the point which is represented by the product <em>ab</em>, possibly after reducing modulo <em>p</em>. It may look like a very natural rule, but it is nonetheless a rule we just agreed on. If you play around with this rule a bit, you will notice some properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <em>a</em> = 1, then <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) = <em>b</em> (and the other way around).</li>
<li>For any <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> not equal to 0, <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) is never zero. So, if we removed 0 from the circle entirely, no harm would happen — the rule would still be well-defined.</li>
<li>For any nonzero <em>a</em>, there is always some <em>b</em> such that <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) = 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>These nice properties — together with a property called associativity — are the properties we need to be able to do cryptographic computations.</p>
<p>Now focus on a particular number on the circle, and let’s call it <em>g</em>. If we take <em>m</em>(<em>g</em>, <em>g</em>), or — to return to the more usual notation — <em>g²</em>, we will reach a new point on the circle. We can continue this process and compute <em>g</em>³, <em>g</em>⁴, etc. At some point, we will reach 1. All the points we have visited in this process are members of the set of numbers <em>generated</em> by <em>g</em>, and if the number of points on the coil is a large prime, then we have a very good candidate for doing cryptography, for example Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Let <em>h</em> be some number in this set generated by <em>g</em>. That means that <em>h</em> = <em>g</em>ᵉ for some exponent <em>e</em>. If it is easy to find this <em>e</em> from <em>g</em> and <em>h</em>, we would have trouble. Fortunately, it turns out that if we use <em>large enough</em> primes, then this <em>e</em> appears to be very difficult to find.</p>
<h2>From Coils to Curves</h2>
<p>Coiling up the number line is not the only way of finding suitable primitives for cryptography. Let’s make a new rule. Instead of using a circle like we did in the previous section, we consider the following equation:</p>
<p><em>y</em>² = <em>x</em>³ + <em>ax</em> + <em>b</em>, where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are fixed constants.</p>
<p>If we graph this in our usual coordinate system, it may look like this curve:</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/curves2.png"></p>
<p>We will now make a rule on how to combine two distinct points <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> on this curve. The agreed upon notation is to call this rule addition, but we will have to define what we mean by that. Programming languages often include this mental concept as operation overloading. Draw the straight line between <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em>. It will intersect at a third point, say, <em>R</em>. This could have been a nice candidate for <em>P</em> + <em>Q</em>, but since we are making the rules, let’s make this a bit more interesting. Draw a vertical line through <em>R</em>. It will intersect the curve on the opposite side of the <em>x</em>-axis, and we define this point as <em>P</em> + <em>Q</em>. Just as before, this is a rule we’re deciding here and now. However, this also turns out to be a very useful rule, with the same properties as before:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of having the point 1 on the circle, we imagine a point infinitely far up. (Remember what you see when looking at railway tracks: parallel lines actually meet beyond the horizon, at infinity.) So, now the line intersecting <em>R</em> and <em>P</em> + <em>Q</em> is indeed also intersecting a third point: the point at infinity. This can be made precise, but requires maths from algebraic geometry, which is far beyond the scope of this blog post. This point at infinity has all the same properties as 1 had above.</li>
<li>For any point <em>S</em> on the curve, there is always a point <em>T</em> such that we get a line intersecting <em>S</em>, <em>T</em> and the point at infinity. This means that for any point <em>S</em>, we can find a point we can call -<em>S</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can test this rule interactively in a simple <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/ukhajwzs">GeoGebra demonstration</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/ec_group_law.gif"></p>
<p>We just assumed that <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> were distinct. If <em>P</em> = <em>Q</em>, then we simply use the tangent to the curve at point <em>P</em> instead, and proceed as before.</p>
<p>In particular, take a point <em>G</em>, and compute 2<em>G</em> = <em>G</em> + <em>G</em>, 3<em>G</em>, 4<em>G</em>, etc. Eventually, we reach the point at infinity, and then back to <em>G</em>. We have now spent about 1000 words of this blog post getting here, just to do the same as we did above, and what was the point? Above, we said that computing exponents are secure if the primes were large enough. It turns out that "large enough" is currently about 3072 bits, or a number with approximately 925 digits. That is somewhat strenuous even for a computer, but the elliptic curve version only requires us to work on numbers of size 256 bits, or 77 digits, which is far more efficient.</p>
<h2>Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key-Exchange</h2>
<p>The Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol is widely used today, and its instantiation using elliptic curves is ranked as the best choice in modern cryptographic protocols like TLS and SSH. The protocol is fairly simple. The public information is an elliptic curve <em>E</em> and a generator <em>G</em> for the points on this curve. One party, Alice, samples a random integer <em>a</em> and computes a point <em>A</em> = <em>a</em> <em>G</em>. Another party, Bob, samples a random integer <em>b</em> and computes <em>B</em> = <em>b</em> <em>G</em>. Then they exchange the values <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, and compute the shared key <em>K</em> = <em>b</em> <em>A</em> = <em>a</em> <em>B</em> = <em>a</em> <em>b</em> <em>G</em>. As long as both <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> stay secret, even when an attacker knows <em>G</em>, <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, then the key is secure.</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/dh.png"></p>
<p><em>Reference: <a href="https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/go_x3dh">https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/go_x3dh</a>. Used with permission.</em></p>
<p>To achieve long-term security, to protect previous messages in the case where someone’s secret keys are leaked after the fact, Alice and Bob can do an ephemeral key-exchange every time they communicate. If <em>a</em> and <em>A</em> is Alice’s long term key pair where <em>A</em> is public to everyone, and similar for Bob, they can run the following protocol to agree upon a one-time session-key. Alice samples a random integer <em>c</em> and computes <em>C</em> = <em>c</em> <em>G</em>, and Bob samples a random integer <em>d</em> and computes <em>D</em> = <em>d</em> <em>G</em>. Then they exchange <em>C</em> and <em>D</em>, and compute the shared key as (<em>a</em> <em>b</em> + <em>c</em> <em>d</em> )<em>G</em>.</p>
<p>The interested reader can check out this <a href="https://play.golang.org/p/qJBI0_2lsGP">simple example written in Go</a>. Are you able to extend the basic protocol to the ephemeral key-exchange on behalf of Alice and Bob?</p>
<p>We finally point out that this protocol is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, and we need to also send signatures computed on the messages to ensure that the communication is authentic. Are you able to attack the protocol as described above, when signatures are not used? If you found these problems interesting, we encourage you to check out similar challenges at <a href="https://cryptohack.org/challenges/ecc/">cryptohack.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Common Curves</h2>
<p>Not all elliptic curves are suitable for cryptography. There could also be power in choosing a curve and the distinguished base point(s). Hence, implementations tend to choose among a small number of well-known curves. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/186/4/final">maintains a list</a> of recommended curves; P-256 is perhaps the most popular among these.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among others, there is also the <a href="https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/">SafeCurves</a> collection proposed by Dan Bernstein and Tanja Lange. In particular, their Curve25519 has proven to be a popular choice.</p>
<p>Elliptic curve libraries will typically have tailored support for certain curves.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<p><a name="20201204_Modern_TPMS_Sensors_Lets_try_a_DoS_attack"><b>Modern TPMS Sensors: Let's try a DoS attack</b></a></p><p>
TPMS (Tire-pressure monitoring system) sensors have been researched extensively
many years ago, they periodically transmit the tire pressure, temperature
and a unique ID which can be misused for tracking a vehicle. But there is
another aspect: modern TMPS sensors also have a receiver which is typically
used to trigger the data transmission when a new TPMS sensor is presented to
the vehicle ("learning procedure").
</p>

<p>
Here in Europe TPMS sensors usually transmit on the 433 MHz ISM band. The
receiver operates on 125 kHz, very similar to LF RFID. A simple way to make
use of the receiver is just to look for the presence of the 125 kHz carrier
and then trigger data transmission. Current sensors are usually more evolved
and use a modulated carrier which contains command packets and only if the
correct command is received data transmission is triggered.
</p>

<p>
If you already have a receiver you can do of course more than just trigger
data transmission: For example there might be support for different
commands, some sensors even allow firmware updates this way.
</p>

<p>
One such command which is typically supported is switching the sensor into
"Shipping" mode. Why would you need that? When the sensor is operating
normally it waits for motion (there is an acceleration/shock sensor inside)
and only starts periodic data transmission when the wheel is rotating. This
is used to safe battery life. When the TPMS sensor is not yet mounted in the
tire it should not react on motion, that’s why there is this "Shipping" mode.
In this mode the sensor only wakes up every few seconds and looks if there
is a 125 kHz signal, if yes it checks for a valid command, for example the
command to trigger data transmission which usually also leaves "Shipping"
mode and switches the sensor into normal operation.
</p>

<p>
This "Shipping" mode can be misused: If you can switch a TPMS sensor of a
vehicle’s wheel into "Shipping" mode the sensor will no longer transmit data
and the vehicle's tire pressure control light will go on after a while.
Just to make it clear: This warning light is annoying to the driver, it
does not affect safety of the car because the deactivated TMPS sensor has
not affected the actual tire pressure.
</p>

<p>
I have looked at a few TPMS sensors for different cars if this really works,
I choose sensors for BMW and Ford cars. Please note that most certainly
other car manufactures are affected too, mainly because there are only a
few manufactures of TPMS sensors which deliver their sensors to various
car manufactures. My choice for BMW and Ford came from the fact that I
found lots of cheap, used sensor for those cars.
</p>

<p>
Also I only looked at "OEM" sensors for BMW and Ford, which means that those
sensors are mounted by the car manufacturer. There are also so called
"Universal" sensors which are typically mounted by tire dealers, there
are some notes about them at the end of this text.
</p>

<p>
It is quite easy to build a tool for transmitting data on 125 kHz: There
is this cheap EL-50448 TMPS sensor activation tool which only transmits a
carrier without modulation. However the hardware can easily be modified
to modulate the carrier: Most of the time OOK (On-Off Keying) is used
for communication, which means that the carrier is just turned on and off.
The EL-50448 uses a power driver with an unused "enable" pin to generate
the carrier, you can use this "enable" pin to modulate the carrier. The
data rate is slow, a frequently used rate is 3900 baud.  Most of the time
Manchester encoding of the data bits is used, which means that the carrier
changes twice as much (7800 changes per second). This is nothing special
and can be done with probably any microcontroller you prefer to use. The
hardware costs for such a setup are below EUR 20, the transmission range
is about 20 centimeters.
</p>

<p>
How can you find the command to switch to Shipping" mode? Brute force by
trying all possible commands is only an option if the command is short.
The reason is that the sensor only looks for the LF 125 kHz signal every
few seconds. If the command is not longer than two bytes brute force is
possible (it takes a few days), for longer commands it is impractical.
Please note that you also have to find a way to detect if the command you
send causes a reaction of the TPMS sensor, e.g. by monitoring the power
consumption of the sensor or receiving the 433 MHz data signal (which of
course only works if the command you send causes a data transmission).
</p>

<p>
Another option is looking at those TPMS tools which tire dealers and
car repair workshops use to check TPMS sensors. Some of those tools
might support switching a TPMS sensor into "Shipping" mode.
</p>

<p>
Those are the results I found (I won't go into the details to avoid misuse):
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>BMW:</b>

  A certain sensor used in several car models from TPMS Sensor manufacturer
  "A" can be switched into "Shipping" mode. The deactivated TPMS sensor can
  be activated again with a different command. Also if the sensor detects a
  fast pressure change (e.g. by inflating the tire) the sensor leaves
  "Shipping" mode. The command length is four bytes so brute force is no option. 

</li>

<li><b>Ford:</b>

  A certain sensor used in several car models from TPMS Sensor manufacturer
  "A" (the same manufacture as above for the BMW sensor) can be switched
  into "Shipping" mode, it is the same command as used by the BMW sensor
  from above. The deactivated TPMS sensor can be activated again with a
  different command.
  
  A certain sensor used in several car models from TPMS Sensor manufacturer
  "B" can be switched into "Shipping" mode. The deactivated TPMS sensor can
  be activated again with a different command. The command in this case is
  only two bytes and I tried all combinations which resulted in several more
  "interesting" commands, a few examples:


    <ul>
<li>
      It is possible to completely turn off the TPMS sensor. In this case it
      will no longer react on anything, you have to break open the sensor
      case and apply a hardware reset or disconnect the battery to reactivate
      it again.
</li>

<li>
      It is possible to switch the sensor into continuous "carrier transmit"
      mode on 433 MHz. In this mode the sensor will continuously transmit
      the 433 MHz carrier until the battery is empty or you apply a hardware
      reset (see above), it will not react on anything else. There are two
      other similar commands which transmit on the upper and lower shifted
      frequency (the sensor uses FSK modulation, Frequency Shift Keying, when
      transmitting data).
</li>
</ul>      

  Those examples show that it is basically possible to destroy this specific
  sensor by transmitting the appropriate command. Also if the sensor is in
  "carrier transmit" mode it probably disturbs the remote control car
  key fob which usually uses the same frequency as the TPMS sensor.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You have to be close to the sensor to send those LF 125 kHz signals but it
only takes a few seconds to send the signal. Using a larger antenna (which is
basically a coil) for the transmitter, e.g. large enough to fit in a suitcase,
might extend the transmission range to more than a meter. 
</p>

<p>
How can those problems be avoided? This is actually quite easy, the command
to switch into "Shipping" mode should not be allowed if the measured tire
pressure is above a certain limit, which means that the sensor is mounted in
the tire of a vehicle. This also applies to those other commands of the sensor
from manufacturer "B" which are probably some kind of factory test or developer
commands. Please note that during my tests the commands I described were
possible even when the measured tire pressure was in the range of a typical
vehicle wheel.
</p>

<p>
I contacted the car manufactures (BMW and Ford) before I published this
article, this is the experience I made:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <b>BMW:</b>
  The contact information for reporting security issues can be found on
  the BMW website. I had a phone call with the responsible person within
  a few days after reporting the issue. BMW already knew the problem, they
  found it during an internal review. Their latest TPMS sensors have fixed
  the issue by blocking certain commands if the tire pressure is above a
  certain limit.
</li>

<li>
  <b>Ford:</b>
  I wasn't able to find a security contact on the website of Ford Germany
  so I contacted the person responsible for "Public Relation". He promised
  to look for someone who takes care of the issue I reported, after several
  days I got a reply that it is possible to disturb the TPMS system due to
  the nature of radio transmission and that this is a known problem. I wasn't
  able to communicate directly with the responsible person and I then replied
  that the reported issue is not about disturbance but a "Denial of Service"
  and that it is even possible to destroy a certain TPMS sensor used in Ford
  cars. I didn't receive any further information about the security issue, I
  notified them again after several weeks that I am now going to publish
  the issue which was acknowledged.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some notes about those "Universal" sensors tire dealers normally use: Those
sensors are "Universal" because they can be programmed for different car
models. The main benefit for the tire dealer is that only a few different
kind of "Universal" sensors have to be on stock, it’s not necessary to have
lots of different "OEM" TPMS sensors for every possible car model lying
around. The programming of those …</p></div></td></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="contentdiv">

<p>I spent a few hours spread over the last couple of weeks to learn every single one of VSCode’s keyboard shortcuts, specifically the 149 shortcuts from the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf">official keyboard shortcuts reference</a>. These are also present in <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collections/vscode/">KeyCombiner’s searchable table of VSCode shortcuts</a>.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I started this challenge to write a blog post about it afterward and as a way to promote <a href="https://keycombiner.com/">KeyCombiner</a> via content marketing. The blog post I had in mind would be similar to my previous one, <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/how-i-learned-50-new-keyboard-shortcuts-in-42-minutes/">documenting my process of learning 50 new web application shortcuts in 42 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>But, as it usually happens only in romantic comedies, my intentions changed over time. This article turned out much different. It is not about the learning process but about how this challenge changed some of the developing habits I had for many years. Workflows that I grew used to during many projects, different IDEs, and even varying programming languages suddenly evolved.</p>

<p>As software engineers, we like to think that we are continually learning and improving our skills. This is certainly true when it comes to the technologies we are using. However, our development habits, such as which features of our IDEs we use, are much more rigid. I believe most of our core workflows are formed early on and very hard to change.
I don’t have data to back this up, but when I look at myself, my co-workers, and other developers I know, this certainly seems true. If you think about it, it is not surprising, the same thing happens in other areas of life. For this very reason, you will find that developers who have studied or worked together will often use similar shortcuts, similar IDE features, and have similar limitations in their workflows.</p>
<p>The usual way to combat this is reading books, blog posts, attending conferences, well, everything that is used in our industry to extend our knowledge. However, with fundamental developing habits, I have found that this works poorly. You might read about a neat feature of your IDE, or see someone demo their workflow, but when you are eventually sitting in front of your screen and writing code, it is easy to fall back to what we already know, what is already set up, and proven to work.</p>
<p>After this experiment, I am convinced that keyboard shortcuts are the main factor in how we form our developing habits, and they can also stop us from evolving our habits.
Even before this challenge, I felt that I was good with shortcuts. I knew quite a few refactoring shortcuts, knew how to pause and stop program executing during debugging, was decent at jumping around between files, searching through my project, and all the other usual stuff. When I saw a co-worker using a shortcut that I didn’t know, I was quick to incorporate it into my workflow, too. After all, I was enough into shortcuts that I built a whole side-project around learning them.
<strong>The thing is, all new shortcuts that I learned were the ones that would augment my existing habits.</strong></p>
<p>This is a hen and egg problem; if you don’t know the shortcuts, you will not start to change your habits and use new IDE features because without shortcuts, they are too tedious to use or not at all usable. But if you don’t form new habits, you will not learn the shortcuts.</p>
<p><strong>Without intending it, I think I found a way to break out of this cycle:
Learning all IDE shortcuts very well <em>before</em> getting back to work. By learning <em>all</em> shortcuts, you are not limited to what somebody shows you and might not be compatible with your situation. You can naturally include what makes sense, in addition to your existing skills.</strong></p>
<p>The next section shows how this worked for me.</p>

<p>I started the learning process as it is usually done with KeyCombiner: By importing some shortcuts from the <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collections/vscode/">public collection of VSCode shortcuts</a> into a personal collection. Intuitively, I started with the ones I already knew and some additional that seemed most useful to me. Back then I was still trying to show that I could learn all shortcuts very quickly with KeyCombiner. I didn’t expect that shortcuts that had nothing to do with my existing workflows will be the real deal.</p>
<p>Some of the first combinations that I picked and that I did not know previously were <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd>/<kbd>r</kbd>/<kbd>c</kbd> for toggling find options (match whole word, regex, case sensitivity) because I was already using those features. This went on for a few days. I did a couple practice runs every day and added new shortcuts whenever KeyCombiner was saying that I mastered all of the previous ones.</p>
<p>Eventually, I knew all shortcuts that seemed useful for how I was using VSCode back then. So I had to start adding shortcuts that had nothing to do with my existing habits. This brought up an interesting misconception. Often keyboard shortcuts are seen as a way to do things faster, compared to using the mouse. While that is true, I think there is an even more aspect to shortcut usage in IDEs: Many features are not used at all, if you don’t know the shortcut!</p>
<p>As I was learning new VSCode shortcuts every day, I started to use features that I previously didn’t even know of. One of the first things that suddenly made a lot of sense was <em>Select all Occurences of Find Match</em> with <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> as default binding, especially when combined with regex search. I was so excited about it, that I even <a href="https://twitter.com/ThomasKainrad/status/1305608337799761920">tweeted a Gif</a> showing how I use it to modify the CSV files that are the source for KeyCombiner’s public collection tables.</p>
<p>The process worked both ways: Sometimes, while I was practicing a shortcut on KeyCombiner, it seemed apparent that this was useful and that I should include it into my workflow. Sometimes it hit me while coding that I had just learned a shortcut that can make the current task more efficient.</p>
<p>In the following, I describe the most significant changes in my daily development habits. The list is far from complete though; there are many more small things that I picked up and frequently use now.</p>
<p><strong>Editor and Panel Management</strong><br>
Since knowing all the shortcuts to switch focus between panels and move editors around, I am using VSCode’s powerful layouting capabilities much more. I have 3-5 editor panels open at pretty much all times, seeing many related pieces of code at once. Working this way by using the mouse is very impractical.
I switch between editor panels with keyboard shortcuts and move editors from one group to the other.</p>
<p>There is one negative side-effect, though: I am starting to get annoyed when I use other IDEs (PyCharm, Eclipse), because they lack far behind VSCode when it comes to using multiple editors.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-cursor Editing</strong><br>
If you don’t know the shortcut to add additional cursors, I doubt you will ever use this incredibly powerful feature of VSCode. It is a typical feature that only blends into your habits once you know the shortcuts.
The basic commands are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Down</kbd>/<kbd>Up</kbd> for adding cursors above/below. However, I found the commands to <em>Insert cursor at end of each line selected</em> (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>), and the above-mentioned <em>Select all Occurences of Find Match</em> (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>) even more powerful. These commands are why I frequently paste text snippets into VSCode, apply a few operations, and then copy-paste it back into whatever application I was using.</p>
<p><strong>Opening views by shortcut</strong><br>
I sometimes tried to do this before, but it never stuck. Now I finally switch to all views (Explorer, Debug, Search, Problems, etc.) with dedicated keyboard shortcuts. These shortcuts translate very nicely to other IDEs. After learning the VSCode default bindings, which are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>&lt;char&gt;</kbd>, I set the same bindings also for Eclipse and PyCharm. Especially <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>e</kbd> for switching to the explorer view and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd> for switching to the debug view are among my most used shortcuts now.</p>
<p><strong>Making Selections</strong><br>
I hate to admit it, but I did not use shortcuts to expand and shrink AST selections before. AST stands for <em>abstract syntax tree</em>, which means that the IDE will take the current language’s syntax into account for modifying the selection. Finally, I picked up <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>left</kbd>/<kbd>right</kbd> to shrink and expand selections. Not all IDEs handle this in the same way, which can be a bit annoying, but it works well for the most frequent tasks, such as expanding the selection to enclose the current string, method, class, or HTML tag.</p>
<p><strong>Folding</strong><br>
I have started to use folding much more. For years, I have rarely used this feature that all IDEs support to a great extent. Now, I do it frequently. Folding is one of these things that are just not feasible with the mouse. Of course, if you need to fold code, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-problem-with-code-folding/">chances are that you need to structure your code better</a>. Many organizations even apply automatic code linters that will complain when methods or classes are too long. However, I have never seen someone recommend splitting up blog posts into multiple files. The same goes for other non-code file types, such as JSON. All we have there is folding.</p>
<p>I am not saying these are the things you should start to learn now, far from it. These are the things I personally integrated deep into my workflows after doing this challenge, without choosing them deliberately, but naturally. Who knows what you will pick up.</p>
<p>Of course, some of the shortcuts I learned still seem a bit, let’s say nonessential, but a little useless knowledge never killed nobody.</p>

<p>In addition to finally breaking out of old habits and experience a real evolution of my IDE usage, there were some additional, less significant, but still delightful second-order effects.</p>
<p>As a shortcut enthusiast, I often had the problem that I needed to decide which binding to use for a particular operation and application pair. KeyCombiner’s public shortcut search helps to find out which binding is the convention for a particular operation, but it can still be tricky. For example, take the frequently used <em>Step Over</em> operation used for debugging. <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/public/search/?description=step+over&amp;keys=&amp;mac_keys=&amp;submit=Search">KeyCombiner shows that VSCode, Eclipse, and JetBrains IDEs all use a different default binding</a>(<kbd>F6</kbd>,<kbd>F8</kbd>,<kbd>F10</kbd>). Learning every single VSCode shortcut has freed me from this mental load of deciding what the best …</p></div></div>

        <section>
            <div><p>The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/?resellerType=home">Raspberry Pi Zero</a> and original Raspberry Pi both have a 32-bit ARM architecture which many projects have dropped support for. So when I saw that <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/4530">containerd recently merged a fix</a> for building containerd on armv6, started to think what I could do with it.</p>
<p>Earlier that month, a user of the <a href="http://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd project</a> which runs very well on VPSes, RPi 3 and RPi4 asked me whether it could work on the Zero and I told him it was not practical or worth his time. After all, an RPi4 with 2GB of RAM, 4 Cores and much faster I/O is only 25GBP/EUR/USD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd is OpenFaaS</a>, but for a single node, and designed for those who don't want to pay for and manage an entire Kubernetes cluster, GitOps, service-mesh, and IngressController just to deploy a few simple functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My past experiences told me that it would be a challenge to get the zero working. It has such a paltry amount of memory available and its I/O is really slow. Still, sometimes it's fun to do things that we shouldn't. Had I been <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">"nerd sniped"</a>?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/homepage-9df4b/static/1dfa03d09c1f3e446e8d936dfb92267f/8924f/6b0defdbbf40792b64159ab8169d97162c380b2c_raspberry-pi-zero-1-1755x1080.jpg" width="60%">
&gt; The RPi Zero originally released in 2015.
</p><p>In this post I'll show you what you need to do to deploy functions through the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli">OpenFaaS CLI</a> and be able to invoke them, including multi-arch builds. At the end of the post I'll explain what the limitations are and whether we should leave the Raspberry Pi Zero with those fond memories we have of it when it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">released in 2015</a>, 5 years ago.</p>
<h2 id="walkthrough">Walk-through</h2>
<h3 id="prereqs">Pre-reqs</h3>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi Zero</li>
<li>Ethernet adapter and USB &lt;&gt; USB A micro shim</li>
<li>16-32GB class 10 SD card</li>
<li>MicroUSB power adapter</li>
</ul>
<p>Flash the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS Lite to your SD card, and then create an <code>ssh</code> file in the <code>/boot/</code> folder.</p>
<p>Power up the Raspberry Pi and ssh to it with <code>ssh pi@raspberrypi.local</code>.</p>
<h3 id="installgo">Install go</h3>
<p>You can install Go from a package manager, but the version is likely to be rather old. Fortunately the Go team still ship a binary for armv6:</p>
<pre><code>export ARCH="armv6l"
echo "Downloading Go"

curl -SLsf https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-$ARCH.tar.gz --output /tmp/go.tgz
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go/
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/go/
sudo tar -xvf /tmp/go.tgz -C /usr/local/go/ --strip-components=1

export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin/
</code></pre>
<p>You now have Go installed, run <code>go version</code> to see it working.</p>
<h3 id="buildcontainerd">Build containerd</h3>
<p>faasd uses containerd rather than Docker, but there are no official binaries for any of the ARM CPUs, so we have to build them from source.</p>
<p>For armv7 and ARM64, you can use my repo <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-arm">alexellis/containerd-arm</a>. It's my hope to see ARM support upstreamed, but having spoken on several occasions to the containerd team, it seems very unlikely that we will see this happen.</p>
<p>On my first attempt of building I got the following error:</p>
<pre><code>+ bin/containerd
# github.com/containerd/containerd/cmd/containerd
/usr/local/go/pkg/tool/linux_arm/link: running gcc failed: fork/exec /usr/bin/gcc: cannot allocate memory
make: *** [Makefile:188: bin/containerd] Error 2
</code></pre>
<p>The RPi Zero and the largest RPi 1 only has 512MB of RAM and I slowly watched the RAM being eaten up with <code>watch -n "free -h"</code>.. I should have remembered this.</p>
<p>Fortunately I had the battle scars and knew what I had to do:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1M &amp;&amp;\
  sudo mkswap /swapfile &amp;&amp; \
  sudo swapon /swapfile
</code></pre>
<p>This creates 1GB of swap, on the SD card.. which already has terrible I/O, but it may just work.</p>
<p>The other trick you may have seen me talk about is adding <code>gpu_mem=16</code> to <code>/boot/config.txt</code>. It seems pointless changing the split on an 8GB RPi4, but for our RPi Zero, we need every MB we can get.</p>
<p>Second time lucky?</p>
<p>No. It failed again due to some missing libraries. I reminded myself to read <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/BUILDING.md#build-containerd">BUILDING.md</a> from the containerd repo. After adding libseccomp and a few other packages, it started to move along again.</p>
<pre><code>make
+ bin/ctr
+ bin/containerd
+ bin/containerd-stress
+ bin/containerd-shim
+ bin/containerd-shim-runc-v1
+ bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2
+ binaries
</code></pre>
<p>I don't know if it was 10 minutes or over an hour, but it was slow progress.</p>
<p>I then ran <code>sudo make install</code> and copied the systemd unit file into place with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp containerd.service /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service
sudo systemctl enable containerd
</code></pre>
<p>I didn't want to start containerd at this time, to save on memory for the next task.</p>
<h3 id="buildfaasd">Build faasd</h3>
<p>The faasd Makefile needed a patch because it was set to cross-compile to armv7, but we needed armv6.</p>
<pre><code>.PHONY: dist
dist:
	CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=6 go build -mod=vendor -ldflags $(LDFLAGS) -a -installsuffix cgo -o bin/faasd-armhf
</code></pre>
<p>This took so long to build on the zero that I gave up and built it on my Intel NUC. Fortunately Go is very good as cross-compiling, especially when linking into C/C++ libraries is disabled with <code>CGO_ENABLED=0</code>.</p>
<p>I then ran <code>scp</code> to copy the binary to the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp faasd-armhf /usr/local/bin/faasd
cd go/src/github.com/openfaas/faasd
</code></pre>
<p>The final step was to install faasd which creates two systemd unit files:</p>
<ul>
<li>faasd - for the OpenFaaS core services</li>
<li>faasd-provider - for the provider that supports CRUD and Invoke operations</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo faasd install
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/faasd-install.jpg" alt="faasd-install"></p>
<h3 id="unexpectedissues">Unexpected issues</h3>
<p>I tried to log in with <code>faas-cli login</code>, but it didn't work. I saw a number of errors in the logs <code>sudo systemctl journalctl -u faasd</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Dec 03 23:18:49 zero-dns default:basic-auth-plugin[13218]: standard_init_linux.go:207: exec user process caused "exec format error"
Dec 03 23:18:50 zero-dns containerd[12169]: time="2020-12-03T23:18:50.338589900Z" level=info msg="starting signal loop" namespace=default path=/run/containerd/io.containerd.runtime.v2.task/default/gateway pid=13324
Dec 03 23:18:52 zero-dns default:gateway[13335]: standard_init_linux.go:207: exec user process caused "exec format error"
</code></pre>
<p>It turned out that out of nats, prometheus, and the openfaas gateway, the openfaas basic-auth plugin only nats was available for armv6. It seems that projects really have moved on and left armv6 behind.</p>
<h3 id="thenihadanidea">Then I had an idea</h3>
<p>What if we didn't run the whole OpenFaaS stack at all, but just the <code>faasd-provider</code>? It would allow this tiny device to support all the CRUD operations on functions, and invocations, but nothing more.</p>
<p>The provider seemed to be running well, and responding to <code>faas-cli</code> commands:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/provider.png" alt="provider"></p>
<p>We'd lose the queue and async invocations, lose the UI, lose the metrics, but we could still deploy functions and invoke them.</p>
<p>It was already very late by this point so I decided to sleep on it.</p>
<h3 id="inthemorning">In the morning</h3>
<p>I powered up the RPi zero and tried deploying a container directly to the faasd endpoint, and it worked.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/deploy.jpg" alt="deploy"></p>
<p>Now, I had to make a few changes. Rather than building with the OpenFaaS watchdog in the container, I just used a Dockerfile and a plain Go HTTP server.</p>
<p>Here's what I ended up with:</p>
<p>Dockerfile</p>
<pre><code>FROM --platform=${BUILDPLATFORM:-linux/amd64} golang:1.13-alpine3.11 as build

)

	s := &amp;http.Server{

<p>I ran this on my PC with the following:</p>
<pre><code>export OPENFAAS_URL=http://192.168.0.81:8081
faas-cli publish --platform linux/arm/v6

faas-cli deploy
</code></pre>
<p>Using the PC means we can cross-compile the Go HTTP server and push a multi-arch image to the container registry. The new <code>faas-cli publish</code> command comes in handy for this and can accept a list of architectures.</p>
<p>The <code>deploy</code> command talks to the remote machine over REST and tells it to deploy a function. The server-side handler <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/pkg/provider/handlers/deploy.go">deploy.go</a> pulls the image into containerd and starts executing it as a container.</p>
<h3 id="onemorething">One more thing</h3>
<p>When I say that it worked. I should clarify that I'd forgotten to deploy CNI - the networking layer required for faasd and containerd.</p>
<p>I saw this error by running the following:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -u faasd
</code></pre>
<p>Not that long ago, <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/docs/DEV.md">I'd documented all the steps required for a manual installation</a>, but somehow forgot this was needed.</p>
<pre><code>export ARCH=arm
export CNI_VERSION=v0.8.5

sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin
curl -sSL https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/${CNI_VERSION}/cni-plugins-linux-${ARCH}-${CNI_VERSION}.tgz | sudo tar -xz -C /opt/cni/bin

# Make a config folder for CNI definitions
sudo mkdir -p /etc/cni/net.d

# Make an initial loopback configuration
sudo sh -c 'cat &gt;/etc/cni/net.d/99-loopback.conf &lt;&lt;-EOF
{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
    "type": "loopback"
}
EOF'
</code></pre>
<p>Just changing "ARCH" to "arm" was enough to make it work. So the CNI project are still <a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/blob/master/.travis.yml">building the plugins against armv6</a> for the time being.</p>

<p>Then it was a case of simply running <code>faas-cli deploy</code> again, and finally, it actually worked.</p>

December 4, 2020 | https://react.christmas/2020/5 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://react.christmas/2020/5">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In this article, we will look at one of webpack's exciting new features, Module Federation. This feature will allow dynamic code reloading from another project at runtime. Using module federation will enable sharing code from other projects with only a little tweaking in your webpack config. It can make a website consisting of multiple frontend applications appear as one seamless SPA. Neat, huh?</p>
</section><article><section><blockquote>
<p><a href="https://webpack.js.org/concepts/">webpack</a> is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In webpack 5, a new exciting feature was released. <strong>Module Federation</strong>, a webpack plugin enabling dynamic code loading from multiple webpack builds at runtime. It supports dependency sharing, i.e.:</p>
<p><em>Application A, importing code from application B, will attempt to use its own dependencies before downloading payloads from B. Nevertheless, A will download the dependencies from B if they are missing from A.</em></p>
<p>This way of sharing code between webpack applications opens up a sea of possibilities. For instance, you may use react components from other projects while receiving updates, both during build and runtime. Moreover, if your website consists of many applications, you can have a dedicated app to load and route between all projects. Another use case is to incorporate a design system at runtime. Since you are fetching the components from a different origin at runtime, you can get the latest version from your design system without rebuilding and deploying.</p>

<p>I am more of a learning by doing kind of gal, so let us have a look at an example to see how it is done. We will create a Christmas calendar using module federation. For illustrative purposes, we will be using two separate npm projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>calendar-container</code>: Contains the calendar component.</li>
<li><code>calendar-card</code>: Contains the calendar card component.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will use module federation to import components from <code>calendar-card</code>into the <code>calendar-container</code> during runtime.</p>
<p>The wonderful thing about module federation is that we can easily outsource the development of various card components to fellow programmers, and reap the fruits of their efforts later on.</p>
<p>The complete example can be found <a href="https://github.com/hegehaav/christmas-calendar">here</a>!</p>
<p><img src="https://react.christmas/assets/ex_white.svg" alt="Figure of example architecture"></p>
<h3>App 1: The Container</h3>
<p>Let's start by creating our first application, <code>calendar-container</code>. <code>calendar-container</code> will be a simple react application containing a title and a container that, later on, will render the calendar cards. The application will run on <code>localhost:3001</code>.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>

<span>import</span> React <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>App</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>	
	<span>return</span> <span>(</span>
		<span>&lt;</span>main<span>&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>Christmas Calendar<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>
			<span>&lt;</span>p<span>&gt;</span> Here we will put content <span>from</span> calendar<span>-</span>card <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>p<span>&gt;</span>		 
		<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>main<span>&gt;</span>
	<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> App<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>App 2: Calendar Window</h3>
<p>Next, we will create the <code>CalendarCard</code>-component in an application we call <code>calendar-card</code>. Initially, you will only see the day of the month the window is hiding. If you click the card, it will tell you how many days there are until Christmas. This application will run on <code>localhost:3002</code>.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>

<span>import</span>  React<span>,</span> <span>{</span> useState <span>}</span> <span>from</span>  <span>'react'</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span>  <span>CalendarCard</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span><span>{</span> dayOfDecember <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>const</span> <span>[</span>isClicked<span>,</span> setIsClicked<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
	<span>const</span>  daysUntilChristmas <span>=</span> <span>24</span> <span>-</span> dayOfDecember<span>;</span>
	
	<span>return</span> <span>(</span>
		<span>&lt;</span>div  onClick<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>  <span>setIsClicked</span><span>(</span><span>!</span>isClicked<span>)</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>	
			<span>{</span>isClicked <span>?</span> <span>(</span>
				<span>&lt;</span>p<span>&gt;</span><span>{</span>daysUntilChristmas<span>}</span> days until Christmas 🎅<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>p<span>&gt;</span>
			<span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>(</span>
				<span>&lt;</span>p<span>&gt;</span><span>{</span>dayOfDecember<span>}</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>p<span>&gt;</span>
			<span>)</span><span>}</span>
		<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>div<span>&gt;</span>
	<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>export</span>  <span>default</span>  CalendarCard<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>Module federation</h3>
<p>Now that we have created the calendar container and the calendar card in separate applications, we are ready to set up the module federation to share code between the applications. This is done in each app's webpack.config.js utilizing webpack's ModuleFederation-plugin.</p>
<p>We need to expose the <code>CalendarCard</code>-component that we want to import into the <code>calendar-container</code>-application. This is done in <code>calendar-card</code>'s <code>webpack.config.js</code>. We need to add the ModuleFederationPlugin to the list of plugins. In the config, we need to give the app a filename, letting the module federation know to emit a remote entry. Then we must expose the component we want to use, in our case, the <code>CalendarCard</code>-component. Finally, we will add <code>react</code> and <code>react-dom</code> to the list of shared dependencies. That way, <code>calendar-container</code> will use its own <code>react</code> and <code>react-dom</code> dependencies if available. If one of the dependencies is not available, module federation will provide a fallback dependency from <code>calendar-card</code> anyway.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>

<span>const</span>  HtmlWebpackPlugin  <span>=</span>  <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'html-webpack-plugin'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span>  ModuleFederationPlugin  <span>=</span>  <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
	
	plugins<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
		<span>new</span>  <span>HtmlWebpackPlugin</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> template<span>:</span> <span>"./public/index.html"</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
		<span>new</span>  <span>ModuleFederationPlugin</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
			name<span>:</span> <span>"calendar_card"</span><span>,</span>
			filename<span>:</span> <span>"remoteEntry.js"</span><span>,</span>
			exposes<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
				<span>"./CalendarCard"</span><span>:</span> <span>"./src/CalendarCard"</span> 
			<span>}</span><span>,</span>
			shared<span>:</span> <span>[</span> <span>"react"</span><span>,</span> <span>"react-dom"</span> <span>]</span>
		<span>}</span><span>)</span>
	<span>]</span>	
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that the <code>CalendarCard</code> is exposed, we need to tell <code>calendar-container</code> where to find it. This is done in <code>calendar-container</code>'s <code>webpack.config.js</code>. The set up is similar to <code>calendar-card</code>, but we let webpack know that it is expecting a remote module called <code>calendar_card</code>. This is done in the <code>remotes</code>-field. Here, we also specify the location of the remote entry, which is  <code>http://localhos:3002/remoteEntry.js</code>.  As no other project is importing code from <code>calendar-container</code> - yet - there is no need to expose anything in this application. We need to list the shared dependencies in <code>calendar-container</code>  as well, to let <code>calendar-card</code> know it will not need to provide them as fallback dependencies.</p>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>Putting it all together</h3>
<p>We need an async way to load the application, this can be done by moving all the code from <code>index.js</code> into a new file <code>bootstrap.js</code>. We do this in both applications:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>

<span>import</span> React <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> ReactDOM <span>from</span> <span>'react-dom'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> App <span>from</span> <span>'./App'</span><span>;</span> 

ReactDOM<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>&lt;</span>App <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> document<span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'calendar-container'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then we dynamically import the content in <code>index.js</code>:</p>

<p>Now we are ready to import the CalendarCard-component from <code>calendar-card</code>:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>

<span>import</span> React <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span>

<p>And voilà! We have a Christmas calendar that imports code from a separate application at runtime!</p>
<p>In this article, we took a quick look at webpack 5's Module Federation feature, enabling runtime code sharing between applications. This is an exciting new feature that can assist in building micro-frontends and cross-platform code sharing.</p>
<p>We made a simple Christmas calendar showcasing some Module Federation based features. There are still other features to explore. The next step could be to share code in both directions, or perhaps create several applications and add routing between them in a container app.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text" v-pre=""><p>Here are few differences between using <code>let</code> and <code>var</code>:</p>
<h3>1. Redeclaration:</h3>
<p>In strict mode, <code>var</code> will let you re-declare the same variable in the same scope while <code>let</code> throws a <code>SyntaxError</code>.</p>
<pre><code>'use strict';
var foo = "foo1";
var foo = "foo2"; // No problem, 'foo' is replaced.

let bar = "bar1";
let bar = "bar2"; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'bar' has already been declared
</code></pre>
<h3>2. Creating global object property:</h3>
<p><code>let</code>, in contrast to <code>var</code>, doesn't make a property on the global object:</p>
<pre><code>var foo = "Foo";  // globally scoped
let bar = "Bar"; // globally scoped

console.log(window.foo); // Foo
console.log(window.bar); // undefined
</code></pre>
<h3>3. Scoping rules:</h3>
<p>The most important difference is the scoping rules. Variables declared by <code>var</code> keyword are scoped to the immediate function body while <code>let</code> variables are scoped to the immediate enclosing block meant by <code>{ }</code>.</p>
<pre><code>function run() {
  var foo = "Foo";
  let bar = "Bar";

  console.log(foo, bar); // Foo Bar

  {
    let baz = "Bazz";
    console.log(baz); // Bazz
  }

  console.log(baz); // ReferenceError
}

run();
</code></pre>
<p>The motivation behind why let keyword was introduced with the language was function scope is confusing and was one of the main sources of bugs in JavaScript.</p>
<pre><code>var funcs = [];
// let's create 3 functions
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
  // and store them in funcs
  funcs[i] = function() {
    // each should log its value.
    console.log("Value: " + i);
  };
}
for (var j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {
  // and now let's run each one to see
  funcs[j]();
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>Value: 3</code> was output to console each time <code>funcs[j]();</code> was used since anonymous functions were bound to the same variable.</p>
<p>Developers needed to make immediately invoked functions to catch correct value from the loops yet that was also hairy.</p>
<h3>4. Hoisting:</h3>
<p>While variables declared with <code>var</code> keyword are hoisted (initialized with undefined before the code is run) which implies they are accessible in their enclosing scope even before they are declared:</p>
<pre><code>function run() {
  console.log(foo); // undefined
  var foo = "Foo";
  console.log(foo); // Foo
}

run();
</code></pre>
<p><code>let</code> variables are not initialized until their definition is evaluated. Accessing them before the initialization brings about a <code>ReferenceError</code>. Variable said to be in "temporal dead zone" from the beginning of the block until the initialization is handled.</p>
<pre><code>function checkHoisting() {
  console.log(foo); // ReferenceError
  let foo = "Foo";
  console.log(foo); // Foo
}

checkHoisting();
</code></pre>

<h3 id="preword">Preword</h3>

<p>I often reference the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">manpages</a> when giving a development
presentation or talk, but I’ve only recently come to realize how few people are both <em>comfortable</em>
with the <code>man</code> interface and adept at discovering information through it.</p>

<p>This post is my attempt to share some of the tricks and techniques I’ve picked up over years of
reading manpages.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-recap">A Quick Recap</h2>

<p>The manpages (short for “manual pages”) are the oldest and longest-running documentation collection
on *nix, stemming back to the
<a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/1stEdman.html">first edition of the Unix Programmer’s Manual</a>
in 1971.</p>

<p>On a modern system, the <code>man</code> command is the most common way to access the manpages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># access the first manpage named "time", which happens to be time(1)</span>
man <span>time</span>

<span># access a specific section's "time", in this case the C time function</span>
man 2 <span>time</span>

<span># attempt to access a nonexistent "time" in section 5</span>
man 5 <span>time</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because the manpages were originally published on paper, they were (and continue to be) typeset with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troff"><code>troff</code></a> on most systems. Today, the <code>man</code> command (and other
manpage readers) invoke <code>troff</code> internally and pipe the output to the user’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_pager">pager</a> (like <code>more</code> or <code>less</code>).</p>

<p>In fact, a very simple manpage reader (which only works with section 1) can be implemented with
just three commands pipelined together:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function </span>myman <span>{</span>
    <span># `-t` and `-e`: run `tbl` and `eqn` on the input, for tables and equations</span>
    <span># `-mandoc`: use a set of troff macros specifically for manpages</span>
    <span># `-Tutf8`: output UTF-8 text rather than PostScript</span>
    <span>gunzip</span> &lt; /usr/share/man/man1/<span>"</span><span>${</span><span>1</span><span>}</span><span>.1.gz"</span> | groff <span>-t</span> <span>-e</span> <span>-mandoc</span> <span>-Tutf8</span> | less
<span>}</span>

myman gcc
myman <span>ls</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Apart from their simplicity and adherence to the UNIX philosophy, <code>man</code> and the manpages serve a
number of important roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They provide a categorization: section 1 is for system commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for library
functions, and so forth. This categorization is followed both by the system itself (which populates
several of the sections) and by programs installed by the user or package manager.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They provide offline documentation: <code>man</code> doesn’t require an internet connection, and can provide
much of the documentation that an internet search would yield.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They offer <em>canonical</em> information: searching for a command or function online might tell you
whether it exists, but won’t tell you the flags, arguments, or behavior specific to your system.
For example, <code>man ls</code> will tell you whether your system’s <code>ls</code> is BSD or GNU (and the differences
therebetween). The manpages (on Linux) will also tell you which feature macros you’ll need to define
in a C program in order to use a function (or a variant of a function).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, let’s move on to some techniques.</p>

<h2 id="colorized-manpages">Colorized manpages</h2>

<p>One of the simplest things you can do to enhance the readability of manpages within <code>man</code> is to
colorize the pager’s output:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/gcc_man.png" alt="A colorized version of `man gcc`"></p>

<p>In <code>less</code>, this is accomplished by setting the <code>LESS_TERMCAP_*</code> environment variables to your
preferred ANSI color codes. Here are the variables you can set:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>LESS_TERMCAP_mb <span># blinking mode (not common in manpages)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_md <span># double-bright mode (used for boldface)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_me <span># exit/reset all modes</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_so <span># enter standout mode (used by the less statusbar and search results)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_se <span># exit standout mode</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_us <span># enter underline mode (used for underlined text)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_ue <span># exit underline mode</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You may be able to set others corresponding to the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/termutils/manual/termcap-1.3/html_chapter/termcap_5.html">termcap capability names</a>,
but the variables above should cover all of your manpage needs.</p>

<p>By way of example, here is the <code>bash</code> function I use to colorize my manpages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>man<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>env</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_mb</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;31m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_md</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;31m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_me</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_se</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_so</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;44;33m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_ue</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_us</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;32m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    man <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>@</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that you don’t need to use escape sequences as above — <code>tput</code> will work just fine.</p>

<h2 id="other-sections">Other sections</h2>

<p>I mentioned some of the big sections above: 1 for system commands, 2 for system calls, and so on.</p>

<p>90% of <code>man</code> lookups will be in those three, but there are a few lesser-known sections that can also
be useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>man 4</code> - Special files and devices</p>

    <p>On Linux, section 4 is used to document special files, usually representing some aspect of
  the machine or its peripherals. For example, <code>man 4 mem</code> will tell you how to use the
  <code>/dev/mem</code>, <code>/dev/kmem</code>, and <code>/dev/port</code> files to read from and write to the system’s main
  memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>man 5</code> - Configuration files and formats</p>

    <p>You probably know the <code>/etc/shadow</code> file, but do you know how its format is specified?
  <code>man 5 shadow</code> will tell you that. Similarly, <code>man 5 deb</code> describes the <code>.deb</code> package format,
  and <code>man 5 ppm</code> lists the spec for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format">PPM images</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>man Np</code> - POSIX pages</p>

    <p>These pages come in handy for contrasting POSIX behavior with the system’s behavior.</p>

    <p>Some examples:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>  <span># compare the system ls (on Linux, GNU) to the POSIX ls behavior</span>
  man 1 <span>ls
  </span>man 1p <span>ls</span>

  <span># compare the read syscall to the POSIX read function</span>
  <span># note the categorization: POSIX read is a function, not a syscall!</span>
  man 2 <span>read
  </span>man 3p <span>read</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="searching-and-navigating">Searching and navigating</h2>

<p>Like colorization, searching is more of a general <code>less</code> feature than one specific to <code>man</code>. That
being said, <code>less</code>’s searching and navigating features can make browsing the manpages a much faster
and more pleasant experience.</p>

<p>Searches in <code>less</code> can be forwards or backwards, using the <code>/</code> and <code>?</code> commands respectively. The
search syntax is mostly POSIX ERE, but with some additions (<code>man less</code> has the details!).</p>

<p>For example, to find the first instance of “x86” in <code>man gcc</code> (watch the bottom of the screen for
the search prompt):</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/Wc0OiKVTrTDiP4tG9bPRWtDwM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_Wc0OiKVTrTDiP4tG9bPRWtDwM.png">
</a></p>

<p>Observe that instances of the search term are highlighted with the standout colors from before.</p>

<p>Once a search term is entered, its results can be navigated via the <code>n</code> and <code>N</code> commands, which
move forwards and backwards in the results list respectively. For example, going through all
of the results for “Windows”:</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/n3S3wteHmbdPrtmyTSkCSVMiX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_n3S3wteHmbdPrtmyTSkCSVMiX.png">
</a></p>

<p>When the last result has been jumped to, the statusbar changes to “Pattern not found”. Once that
happens, as in the video above, previous results can be returned to by hitting <code>N</code>.</p>

<p>Even this can be simplified: the <code>&amp;</code> command can be used to display only lines that match the given
pattern. For example, retrieving every line that contains either “ARM” or “ABI”:</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/Wh8QZ4eideLNmCMBmAkYExgEm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_Wh8QZ4eideLNmCMBmAkYExgEm.png">
</a></p>

<p>The effect is more dramatic when searching for the definition of a flag (in this case <code>-D</code>):</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/17Kcnb8PBNIz8JdogOFKVeDQn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_17Kcnb8PBNIz8JdogOFKVeDQn.png">
</a></p>

<p>These commands are just the tip of the iceberg — <code>less</code> supports searching multiple files at
once, jumping around scopes (opening and closing parentheses, braces, brackets), and marking the
current location for later return. Each of these is documented on the help screen, which you can
get to in any <code>less</code> session via the <code>h</code> command:</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/8i6kyFTbFttVTgDNbgnzyJvGB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_8i6kyFTbFttVTgDNbgnzyJvGB.png">
</a></p>

<h2 id="wrapup">Wrapup</h2>

<p>Before picking up these tricks (especially searching), the manpages were an item of last resort
for me: I would search the internet or ask a friend, with mixed results. I had no real idea how to
use <code>less</code>, and would just clumsily page around until I found what I was looking for. More often
than not, I would give up entirely.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the manpages (and the <code>man</code> interface) are not perfect — there’s no
hyperlinking or real cross-referencing, and the entire corpus is written in a 45+ year old
typesetting language designed for <em>physical</em> output, not display in a virtual terminal.</p>

<p>That being said, they’re a <em>fantastic</em> initial resource for pretty much anything concerning your
system — they remain up-to-date (unlike blogs and articles), they’re accurate and concise, and
they’re <em>very</em> UNIX-y (text files and pipelines!).</p>

                    <p>My previous development laptop was an <a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/CA/content/series/acerchromebookr11">Acer R11</a> chromebook. I always ran it in <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/developer_mode.md">developer mode</a> with all the Linux packages I needed installed via <a href="https://github.com/skycocker/chromebrew">chromebrew</a>. This setup worked great except for GUI programs, as (at the time), the built-in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)">Wayland</a> server on the chromebook was not exposed to the user in a meaningful way. I relied on an internal tool from Google called <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform2/+/HEAD/vm_tools/sommelier/">sommelier</a> to translate X11 calls to the internal Wayland server. None of this was ideal, but with a lot of scripts and aliases, I made it work.</p>

<p>Recently, I decided to remove the locked-down ChromeOS all together, and set the laptop up with <a href="https://galliumos.org/">GalliumOS</a> so it can be used as a lightweight code-review machine with access to some useful tools like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> and <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a>. This whole process is actually fairly easy, and a good way to breathe new life in to an old chromebook. This guide will be R11-specific, but the process doesn’t vary too wildly between models.</p>

<h2 id="developer-mode">Developer mode</h2>

<p>A standard feature on chromebooks is “developer mode”. This is a hidden boot mode that is designed to give <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os">ChromiumOS</a> contributors and Google developers access to debug tools when testing new OS builds. Along with debug tools, this mode also exposes a Linux terminal with root access to the user via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>-&gt;</kbd>. On an extremely locked down system like a chromebook, this terminal access exposes a lot of new capability. For this use case, we will only use it to modify the system bootloader.</p>

<p>To enable developer mode, simply press <kbd>Esc</kbd> + <kbd>Refresh</kbd> + <kbd>Power</kbd>, and let the chromebook reboot. Once the recovery screen pops up, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>, and the device is now in developer mode.</p>

<h2 id="write-protection">Write protection</h2>

<p>This step will void your device’s warranty. Chromebooks are able to handle anything you throw at them. Even if you were to delete important system files to the point the device can no longer boot, hopping in to recovery mode can reset the device to a working state. This works via ChromeOS’s write protect mechanism. All important files are protected by hardware-enforced write protection. Since the process of loading a new operating system onto the device involves overwriting important system files (like the BIOS), we must physically disable write protection.</p>

<p>Luckily, on the Acer R11, this process is very simple. Firstly, unscrew the laptop’s bottom plate to expose the motherboard (some screws are hidden under rubber feet). With the backplate off, you will find a screw that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://retrylife.ca/assets/images/arcer_r11_screw.jpg" alt="R11 write protect screw"></p>

<p>The screw is hard to miss, it is beside the WIFI card, an has an arrow pointing to it. Simply remove it, and put the laptop back together. You now have a fully unlocked device.</p>

<h2 id="flashing-a-custom-bootloader">Flashing a custom bootloader</h2>

<p><a href="https://mrchromebox.tech/">Mr Chromebox</a>, a well known person in the world of Chromebook modification, provides and maintains a very easy to use shell script that handles bootloader modifications automatically. To use this tool, open up the ChromeOS terminal (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>-&gt;</kbd>), log in with the username <code>chronos</code> (you must already be logged in to your personal Google account. This will not work from the login screen), and run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>crossystem <span>dev_boot_usb</span><span>=</span>1 <span>dev_boot_legacy</span><span>=</span>1
<span>cd</span><span>;</span> curl <span>-LO</span> mrchromebox.tech/firmware-util.sh
<span>sudo install</span> <span>-Dt</span> /usr/local/bin <span>-m</span> 755 firmware-util.sh
<span>sudo </span>firmware-util.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will open up the <code>firmware-util</code> settings screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://retrylife.ca/assets/images/fwutil_cros_wp-on.png" alt="firmware-util screen"></p>

<p>You will want to select the <code>RW_LEGACY</code> option to load the <code>RW_LEGACY</code> / SEABIOS payload. The <code>UEFI</code> option is technically the better choice, but it will completely remove the device’s ability to run ChromeOS again in the future.</p>

<h3 id="setting-fuses">Setting fuses</h3>

<p>The <code>RW_LEGACY</code> payload only works if the laptop always has power. Once the device completely runs out of power, the boot settings are wiped from the device (not something we want). The solution is to modify the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/vboot/+/master/_vboot_reference/firmware/include/gbb_header.h">system <code>gbb</code> fuses</a>. This sounds complicated (and it is), but Mr Chromebox comes to the rescue again with the <code>GBB Flags</code> option in his script. <em>After</em> the <code>RW_LEGACY</code> payload has been configured, run his script again, and select <code>GBB Flags</code>.</p>

<h2 id="installing-galliumos">Installing GalliumOS</h2>

<p>On another computer, <a href="https://galliumos.org/download">download GalliumOS</a> (make sure to select the <code>Braswell</code> option), and <a href="https://wiki.galliumos.org/Installing/Creating_Bootable_USB">create a bootable USB</a>. Plug this USB into the Chromebook, reboot, and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> as the warning screen pops up. This will begin the GalliumOS setup process (which is identical to that of Ubuntu).</p>

<h3 id="enabling-verbose-boot">Enabling verbose boot</h3>

<p>It is nice to know what is happening when the device is booting. To disable the boot animation and replace it with the boot log, edit <code>/etc/default/grub</code>, and replace both the <code>quiet</code> and <code>splash</code> arguments with <code>noplymouth</code> in the <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</code> options. Next, run the following, then reboot:</p>

<p>An interesting way for getting an intuitive sense for why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_probability" title="Poker hand probabilities">certain hands</a> are rare in poker, I've laid out all the cards in a standard deck in a grid:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/blank_1024x1024.png?v=1607133617" alt="Array of Playing Cards" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024">
</p>


<p>When I first learned to play poker, it took a while before I could get an intuitive understanding of the relationships between the various poker hands. Calculating their likelihood definitely helped get a handle on how many ways for a specific hand to actually occur there were.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I think laying the hands out in a grid like this would have given me an intuitive understanding of the game much more quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Poker Hands shown geometrically</h2>
<p>So the lowest poker hand, high card, is the most common happening 50% of the time, but will rarely be the winning hand:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/High_Card_1024x1024.png?v=1607134813" alt="High Card" width="1023" height="1023"></p>

<p>The next highest hand is a single pair which has a geometric interpretation of one column with two dots in it:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Pair_1024x1024.png?v=1607134853" alt="Pair" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>Two pair has a similar flair to it, except this one has 2 vertical lines:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Two_Pair_1024x1024.png?v=1607134962" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>Three of a kind is similar in spirit, but is much rarer than the two preceding hands happening once every 50 hands:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/three_of_a_kind_1024x1024.png?v=1607135086" alt="3 of a kind" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>For a straight, we need 5 cards that are in order without any gaps and can look kind of like a nice scatter plot:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/straight_1024x1024.png?v=1607135179" alt="Straight" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>A flush requires all 5 cards in the hand to be in a single horizontal row, but there can gaps between them:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/flush_84512f1f-428d-4ed7-b703-9372fc3575d6_1024x1024.png?v=1607135233" alt="Flush" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>A full house requires that all points be split into two lines of 3 and 2 points each:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/full_house_1024x1024.png?v=1607135454" alt="Full House" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>Four of a Kind requires a vertical line that spans the entire grid with an extra point tucked away somewhere:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/4_of_a_kind_1024x1024.png?v=1607135655" alt="4 of a kind" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<p>A straight flush is one of the tidiest hands as it requires all cards to be colinear on the same row and be immediately adjacent to each other:</p>

<p>The best hand that you can get is a subset of all the straight flushes that you can get. It's just a straight flush all the way against the right side of the grid with the 5 highest cards:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking at poker this way made me realize that there are some interesting hands that we could add to the game.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Rectangle</h2>
<p>This hand is formed when you have 4 points that are <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Collinear.html" title="Mathematical Definition of colinearity">colinear</a> in both orthogonal axes (form a rectangle):&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Rectangle_1024x1024.png?v=1607136065" alt="Rectangle Hand" width="1024x1024" height="1024x1024"></p>

<h2>Flower</h2>
<p>This one seems like it would be complicated to spot in the wild, but in reality it's a lot like a full house. You need a Three of a Kind and the other two cards need to be the same suit as one of your 3oK cards, and just before and after it. So, maybe it is a little complicated to spot, but it certainly is an interesting idea.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Want More?</h2>
<p>If you found this interesting, you'll probably love the 3D reconstruction we did of <a href="https://evermontbills.com/pages/walter-white-did-not-have-80m" title="Walter White's Cash Pile Counting">Walter White's cash pile</a> in order to count it.&nbsp;</p>

    <br>
    
    <br>
    
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>Overview</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>In <a href="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/gRPC-1.html" target="_blank"><span>Part 1</span></a> of
        this series, we provided a high-level overview of <span>gRPC</span>, installed the necessary software, setup the
        environment, and finally demonstrated the <span>Unary</span> RPC communication in both Go and Java.</p>
      <p>In this part, we will continue the journey to the next RPC communication pattern - <span>Server Streaming</span>.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Server Streaming RPC</p>
    <p>The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of <span>Server Streaming</span> communication
        pattern:</p>
    <div id="img-outer-div"> <p><img src="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/images/grpc-06.png" alt="Server Streaming Architecture"></p><p>Figure-6</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>In the Server Streaming RPC mode, the client sends a request to the server and the server responds with sequence (or stream)
        of messages back to the client.</p>
    <p>For the Server Streaming RPC demonstration, we will implement a fictitious Currency Rate service, where the client sends the
        'from' currency and the 'to' currency as the request and the server responds with a stream of 'rates' from different 'agents'.</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>We will first demonstrate the Currency Rate service using the Go programming language.</p>
      <p>In the <span>$GOPATH</span> directory, create the project directory hierarchy by executing the following
        commands:</p>
    </div>
    <div id="cmd-div">
      <p>$ cd $GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc</p>
      <p>$ mkdir -p serverstream serverstream/currencypb serverstream/server serverstream/client</p>
    </div>
    <p>The following are the contents of the file <span>currency.proto</span> located in the directory <span>
        $GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc/serverstream/currencypb</span> as shown below:</p>
    <fieldset id="sc-fieldset">
      <legend>currency.proto</legend>
      <pre>/*

syntax = "proto3";

package serverstream;

option go_package = "polarsparc.com/grpc/serverstream/currencypb";

option java_multiple_files = true;
option java_package = "com.polarsparc.gss";

message CurrencyRateRequest {
  string from = 1;
  string to = 2;
}

message CurrencyRateResponse {
  string agent = 1;
  string from = 2;
  string to = 3;
  double rate = 4;
}

service CurrencyService {
  rpc getCurrencyRate(CurrencyRateRequest) returns (stream CurrencyRateResponse) {};
}</pre>
    </fieldset>
    <p>The request message is defined as <span>CurrencyRateRequest</span> and the response message is defined as
        <span>CurrencyRateResponse</span>. The service interface is defined as <span>CurrencyService</span>
        with an RPC method <span>getCurrencyRate</span> that takes in a <span>CurrencyRateRequest</span>
        as an input and returns a sequence (or <span>stream</span>) of <span>CurrencyRateResponse</span>
        objects.</p>
    <p>To compile the <span>currency.proto</span> file, execute the following commands:</p>
    <div id="cmd-div">
      <p>$ cd $GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc/serverstream</p>
      <p>$ protoc currencypb/currency.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:$GOPATH/src</p>
    </div>
    <p>On success, this will generate the Go code file called <span>currency.pb.go</span> located in the directory
        <span>$GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc/serverstream/currencypb</span>.</p>
    <p>From the file <span>currency.pb.go</span>, we see the <span>CurrencyServiceServer</span> interface,
        as shown below, that the server needs to implements:</p>
    <fieldset id="sc-fieldset">
      <legend>currency.pb.go</legend>
      <pre>.
.
.
type CurrencyServiceServer interface {
	GetCurrencyRate(*CurrencyRateRequest, CurrencyService_GetCurrencyRateServer) error
}
.
.
.</pre>
    </fieldset>
    <p>The following are the contents of the file <span>currency_provider.go</span> that simulates an in-memory
        store for initializing and returning currency rates from fictitious agents and is located in the directory <span>
        $GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc/serverstream/server</span> as shown below:</p>

<p><strong>Presentation: </strong><strong>Esperanto Accelerates Machine Learning With 1000+ Low-Power RISC-V Cores on a Single Chip</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Esperanto Technologies has developed a ground-breaking accelerator chip for large-scale machine learning applications employing over 1000 RISC-V cores.</li>
<li>In this talk, Esperanto provides an overview of the company’s new ET-SoC-1 chip, which features two kinds of general-purpose 64-bit RISC-V cores. The ET-Maxion, previewed at the RISC-V Summit in 2018, is a superscalar out-of-order core delivering high performance for modern operating systems and applications. The complementary ET-Minion core designed by Esperanto is a leaner, energy efficient, in-order multithreaded core with a vector/tensor accelerator unit at the heart of the massively parallel compute array.</li>
<li>The chip’s performance and efficiency is derived from a combination of factors, including the simplicity of the RISC-V instruction set, wide vector/tensor units on every ET-Minion core, a uniquely optimized memory hierarchy, state of the art process technology, and custom pipeline architecture and low-voltage circuits which enables more energy-efficient operation. The result is that Esperanto will deliver better performance per watt than legacy CPU and GPU solutions, as well as competing fixed-function designs without compromising generally purpose flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Esperanto Technologies</strong></p>

Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash"></a><figcaption>(Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Slack’s life as an underdog darling of Silicon Valley ended on November 2, 2016. That’s when the upstart communication startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">published an open letter to Microsoft in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">New York Times</a></em>, offering the tech giant an insincere “welcome” to the world of workplace chat software. The occasion was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13405200/microsoft-teams-slack-competitor-launch">Microsoft’s launch of Teams</a>, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.</p><p>In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding: “we’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats">took Teams from zero to 115 million users</a>. </p><p>That disparity helps to explain why <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html">Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce</a>. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/salesforce-acquires-slack-salesforces-reasoning-salesforces-opportunity/">offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack</a>.)</p><p>But it also feels like the end of an era — one where workers gained new power to bring their own tools to the office, and decide for themselves how they wanted to get work done. Slack first succeeded with small teams who wanted to accelerate their work, and was often dragged into organizations by early adopters. But today, waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices.</p><p>The rise of smart phones in the early 2010s brought with it a new surge of workplace productivity tools that made mincemeat of everything that had come before them. Box and Dropbox brought easy file storage and sharing. Evernote introduced the idea of ubiquitous, cloud-synchronized note-taking. Sunrise created a more social calendar, while Mailbox and Acompli reimagined email for the mobile phone.</p><p>Slack tiptoed into the conversation in the middle of the decade, and almost immediately became the fastest-growing enterprise software tool of all time. In 2015, just 18 months after it launched, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8836087/slack-1-million-daily-users">Slack reported having more than 1 million daily users</a> —&nbsp;a figure then unheard-of in enterprise software.</p><p>It had a great backstory —&nbsp;a last-ditch pivot from a failed video game called Glitch —&nbsp;and, in Stewart Butterfield, one of the tech world’s most charming founders. It also had a bold pitch: it was going to “kill email” —&nbsp;or, at the very least, reduce your reliance on it. And it would do so by integrating hundreds of other services into real-time work chat, creating a kind of all-knowing command console for your organization.</p><p>The company embodied the belief, so common in Silicon Valley, that the best product would win in the end. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” the company wrote in its open letter to Microsoft. “How far you go in helping companies truly transform to take advantage of this shift in working is even more important than the individual software features you are duplicating.”</p><p>And yet if there’s a lesson of the past four years, it’s that thoughtfulness and craftsmanship only got the company about 10 percent as far as Microsoft did by copy-pasting Slack’s basic design. In its open letter, Slack famously told Microsoft: “You’ve got to do this with love.” In 2020, looking at Slack’s size, the idea seems laughable. What’s love got to do with it?</p><p>The thing is, I <em>hate</em> that this was the outcome for Slack. I love good productivity tools, and was rooting for Slack to someday become as good as the company hyped it up to be. (And perhaps it still will: like most giants Salesforce has a mixed track record when it comes to the success of its acquisitions, but some seem to be thriving. When I asked about this on Twitter, people had <a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1333891286185644032?s=21">a lot of good things to say about post-acquisition Heroku</a>.)</p><p>But Slack’s struggle to succeed as an independent company sadly mirrors that of many one-time innovators in enterprise productivity. Mailbox died and Acompli sold to Microsoft, where it became the mobile Outlook app. Evernote is a pale shadow of its former self. Of that early cohort, only Box and Dropbox became — and still remain —&nbsp;public companies.</p><p>Why is this the case? To get some insight, I called up Aaron Levie, Box’s affable CEO. In Levie’s telling —&nbsp;and he also wrote <a href="https://blog.box.com/salesforce-slack-and-future-work">a blog post about the Slack sale</a> — it all comes down to sales. The idea that workers would someday choose all their own tools was always a fantasy, he told me, in part because most workers don’t event want to think about their tools. In such a world, the winning app will almost always be one with a giant, er, salesforce behind it. </p><p>Microsoft had one. Slack didn’t. Enter Salesforce.</p><p>“The reality with the enterprise is that you can have the best product, but that’s not good enough,” Levie told me. “You need distribution. And what Salesforce has — they have the procurement officers, they have the finance people. They have all of the apparatus you need to interact with to sell software, and they have it for the top 100,000 corporations around the world.”</p><p>Levie is bullish on the acquisition, because it puts Slack and Salesforce on more even ground. </p><p>“The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage that Microsoft has had,” he said. “All of a sudden, they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity, because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.”</p><p>Assuming Levie is right — and I wouldn’t bet against him — that means the medium-term future of work is increasingly a choice between three giants: Microsoft, Salesforce, and (in a distant third) Google. And with that, the golden age of worker choice in productivity tools seems to be coming to an end.</p><p>That’s not to say that the incumbents won’t always face new challengers. But I wonder whether the low ceiling that Slack turned out to have has implications for some of the other fast-growing productivity companies of the current moment. Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable, or Notion, or Coda? Don’t get me wrong — I’m confident their investors will all get their money back, and then some. But do they have a real future outside the arms of a monolith?</p><p>If not, then the productivity market will become as consolidated as any number of other spaces on the internet, from app stores to search engines to social networks. And as our government antitrust regulators begin to awaken after a long period of hibernation, I wonder if they’ll have anything to say about it.</p><h3>The Ratio</h3><p><em>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies</em></p><p>⬆️ <strong>Trending up</strong>: <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">Google</a></strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">’s new paid deals with publishers mean that access to some paywalled content will now be available to readers for free</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you spend a lot of time on Hacker News, it’s easy to get taken by the allure of building a web app without a framework. There are a bunch of potential advantages (no bloat! bespoke to your project!) and being able to say you built something with minimal dependencies gets you Engineer Points.</p>
<p>That is, if you can pull it off.</p>
<p>I started a new side project recently. It’s a web-based graphics editor, so it needs to be a single page app. My time spent profiling <a href="https://songrender.com/">SongRender</a> for performance issues has made me a little wary of React for building interfaces that update at 60 frames per second, so I decided to avoid it. I’d go (mostly) vanilla and see how far that took me.</p>
<p>I installed <a href="https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/">lit-html</a> and got to work. “Components” were simply functions that returned lit-html template results. A big singleton at the top of the tree held onto all the application state, stored as a global variable within that module.</p>
<p>The first hurdle came when a component needed local state. I could have lifted it to the singleton, but that would have broken the component’s encapsulation. I noticed that lit-html directives can keep state, so I decided to use them to build a tiny component library — ignoring a warning from the lit-html developers that this wasn’t a supported use case.</p>
<p>My home-brewed library worked great… until I needed to run some code when a component appeared on the screen. I started digging through lit-html documentation and issues looking for a way to detect a directive’s lifecycle, but it became clear to me that going down that path would be painful.</p>
<p>At that point, I recalled <a href="https://tomdale.net/2015/11/javascript-frameworks-and-mobile-performance/">this quote by Tom Dale</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have heard from many developers who have told me that they accepted the argument that vanilla JavaScript or microlibraries would let them write leaner, meaner, faster apps. After a year or two, however, what they found themselves with was a slower, bigger, less documented and unmaintained in-house framework with no community. As apps grow, you tend to need the abstractions that a framework offers. Either you or the community write the code.</p>

<p>Fair enough. Let’s avoid that trap. What about a small framework? I’d heard a lot of good things about Svelte, and although I was slightly worried about the size of the Svelte community I figured it would be fine.</p>
<p>My migration attempt quickly ground to a halt when I wanted a parent component to apply some styles to a child component. In React, I’d pass a class name in from the parent as a <code>className</code> prop. In Svelte, that’s considered a workaround, and the actual feature is the subject of an <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0000-style-properties.md">RFC</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Maybe this is an example of <a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/160.html">dangling by a trivial feature</a>. But it’s so basic a capability that I’m surprised Svelte is on version three without an officially blessed way to do it. I ran into this limitation when I created my <strong>second component</strong>. Way before I got to try out any of the cool reactivity that earns Svelte all that buzz.</p>
<p>So I changed my mind and went with React. After an hour or so, I’d finished moving everything over — and my anxiety had vanished. I stopped worrying about having most efficient component system, and picked up work on the thing I wanted to build in the first place.</p>
<p>No, React isn’t perfect. It’s optimized for apps that make network requests and then display lists of things (i.e. most apps) which isn’t really what I’m doing here<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The performance is fine now, although I expect I’ll have to optimize as my project gets more complex.</p>
<p>But React lets me stop thinking about the framework. React gets out of my way. React is <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">boring</a>. React is actively developed. React has a giant ecosystem and a giant community. React is battle-tested on some of the most visited websites in the world.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are technically better ways to build a highly interactive interface on the web, but life is too short for me to spend hours trying to figure them out. There are things I want to create, and the only way I can actually create them is to stop spending so much time on tooling.</p>
<p>For now, I’m choosing React.</p>

<p>The solution they seem to have landed on — letting the child expose CSS custom properties as props — is actually pretty cool, though I don’t like that Svelte will silently wrap your component with an extra <code>div</code>. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

Games generally have a short-lived sales cycle so I am not expecting a huge increase in sales after this.</p>
<p>I’m writing this up to help other indie developers calibrate their expectations. You often read about the success stories because people love to read that it’s possible to make it big with a hit game, but few people bother to write up mediocre outcomes, which is the outcome of <em>most</em> game development efforts. This is called “selection bias”.</p>
<p>You can find a list of all the marketing and promotion I did below, to give you an idea of what kind of an effect you can expect from a single person doing all coding and all promotion by themselves.</p>

<p>Let’s cut to the chase.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>30</code> copies of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cx.mccormick.asterogue" rel="nofollow noopener">Asterogue for Android</a> were sold netting <code>$89 USD</code>.</li>
<li><code>18</code> copies of <a href="https://chr15m.itch.io/asterogue">Asterogue for Windows</a> were sold netting <code>$132 USD</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Total sales = <code>$221 USD</code></p>
<p>The game got a couple of five star ratings on each platform. Interestingly, the average payment for the Windows version was around $6 which is double the suggested $3 (people were able to choose any amount higher than $3).</p>
<p>The main cost making the game was my own time. If I had been charging one of my freelance clients to make this game it would have cost around <code>$5k - $10k</code> over 1.5 months of part time development at my normal hourly rate. Incidentally if you’re interested in having a game like this made, <a href="mailto:chris@mccormick.cx" rel="nofollow noopener">hit me up</a>. :)</p>

<p>It’s interesting to look at the visits to the game’s pages on each platform, and the click-through-rate of people who visited the page and then went on the buy the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Windows page on Itch saw <code>1,937</code> views with a click-through purchase rate of just under 1%.</li>
<li>The Google Play store doesn’t give raw numbers but it says the conversion rate is about 1% too.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s an implication here that if I could drive more traffic to these pages I could expect 1 out of every 100 visitors to buy the game.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of all the marketing and promotion I did while building the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/mccrmx/status/1306223700199448577" rel="nofollow noopener">Kept a Twitter thread up to date with the latest changes</a> (about 1250 followers).</li>
<li><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=70875.0" rel="nofollow noopener">Posted devlogs to the TIGSource forum</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/search/?q=saturday%20sharing&amp;source=recent&amp;restrict_sr=1" rel="nofollow noopener">Participated in Saturday Sharing on /r/roguelikedev</a>.</li>
<li>I sent a couple of updates to my own email newsletter subscribers (there are 90 subscribers).</li>
<li>Some <a href="https://dev.to/chr15m" rel="nofollow noopener">dev.to posts</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of everywhere I launched the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/jkt4ue/asterogue_released_today_sci_fi_pixel_graphics/" rel="nofollow noopener">Launched on /r/roguelikes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mccormick.cx/news/entries/it-s-asterogue-launch-day" rel="nofollow noopener">On my own blog</a>.</li>
<li>Emailed the <a href="https://infinitelives.github.io/" rel="nofollow noopener">infinitelives mailing list</a>.</li>
<li>Emailed my own email newsletter subscribers.</li>
<li>Created a listing on <a href="http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Asterogue" rel="nofollow noopener">RogueBasin</a> and in the news section too.</li>
<li>Kenney.nl discord in #promotion</li>
<li>Roguelikes discord in #advertise-releases</li>
<li>On the local game dev discord in my city.</li>
<li>On the local web dev front-enders Slack chat in my city (the game is built with front-end web technology).</li>
</ul>
<p>After release I also wrote some blog posts here on the game’s Itch devlog and linked a couple of these to Hacker News. The post <a href="https://chr15m.itch.io/asterogue/devlog/190653/my-game-wont-sell-and-thats-ok">My game won’t sell and that’s ok</a> got 7k hits.</p>

<p>There are three main strategies I can think of to improve sales for this game and future games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kaizen. Improving the game. Fixing issues people have flagged and making quality of life improvements from player feedback.</li>
<li>Keep making more games. Compound on the interest and marketing garnered by this game. This is the strategy of <a rel="nofollow noopener">Sokpop games</a> and when I did an analysis of their collective I realized they probably didn’t make a profit until game number 8.</li>
<li>Use a 3rd party company for promotion instead of doing it myself.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am going to allocate time in my schedule to improve Asterogue. I got some great feedback and I want to polish those rough edges and fix all the issues people have flagged.</p>
<p>I will almost certainly make more graphically rich roguelike games in the future, because it was so much fun to do so. Thank you very much to everybody who bought the game, I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>I think the key is to do this without great expectations, just try to make the best games possible, and have fun doing it.</p>
<p>If you want to hear about games and other stuff I make you can follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/mccrmx" rel="nofollow noopener">on Twitter @mccrmx</a> or <a href="https://mccormick.cx/" rel="nofollow noopener">subscribe to my newsletter at mccormick.cx</a>. Thanks for reading!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In the fall of 2007, my parents gave me an unforgettable gift for my sixteenth birthday: a first-generation iPhone.</p><p>I still clearly remember watching the keynote in which Steve Jobs announced the first Apple-branded phone a few months earlier. As a teenager attending high school in my hometown of Vicenza, Italy, I tuned into the livestream just before dinner, carefully listening to every word he said. That evening, Jobs started announcing a “widescreen iPod with touch controls”, a “revolutionary mobile phone” and a “breakthrough Internet communications device”–theatrically pausing before confessing that he was actually talking about one single device: the iPhone. Thousands of miles away from me, you could hear attendees exploding cheerfully through the live feed. Jobs went on demoing this amazing invention that, a decade later, would end up changing much more than the mobile phones market: it directly or indirectly impacted our society through mobile web, app stores, changing work-life balance, and social media.</p><p>October came, and so did the day I finally got my iPhone. I was really excited as I was the first one in my social circle with one. Every other teenager (and adult!) that saw my phone reacted in awe and with lots of curiosity. More than a few were also secretly envious, something I secretly did not mind. To add to the novelty, at the time the iPhone was only available for sale in the US.</p><p>To get an iPhone for me, my father had to ask a friend traveling to New York on a business trip to bring one back on the plane with her. That was not the end of it, however, as all phones were locked to the AT&amp;T network. In order for me to be able to use my iPhone in Italy, I had to unlock it.</p><p>That process required learning a variety of tools and techniques developed by hackers in the community, then documented in various blogs and forums. The first step was to <em>jailbreak</em> the phone, which gave you full access to the system and allowed you to run third-party apps. Then you’d have add one of those “hacking” apps to your phone, which patched the bootloader to remove the lock the US carrier had put on it. Despite sounding like a mouthful, the iPhone hacking community had worked hard on the User Experience (UX), making this entire process relatively easy for most people with basic tech skills.</p><hr><p>I really loved my shiny, new iPhone, and I was so excited about it that I was willing to accept many of its original limitations. It only supported slow 2G networks, didn’t have copy/paste, couldn’t transfer files via Bluetooth to my friends, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">famously</a> didn’t support Adobe Flash, which was ubiquitous on the web at the time.</p><p>However, there was one thing I really couldn’t stand: the Messages application could only store 1,000 texts (SMS).</p><p>That was 2007 — before the days of WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, etc. Instant messaging was something people did on their PCs only, with things like Windows Live Messenger (née MSN Messenger) or AIM.</p><p>For a high schooler like me, text messaging was the main way I kept in touch with my friends daily (<em>what was I supposed to do, call them?</em>). With my carrier giving me a whopping 100 free texts per day (seriously, we had to pay for them), between sent and received texts it would take less than a week to reach the storage limit of 1,000.</p><p>That’s when it all started.</p><p>Because my iPhone was already “hacked” (jailbroken), as a requirement for unlocking it and use it in Italy, I had full system access already. That allowed me to c extract any document I wanted, including my phone’s text message database.</p><p>It wasn’t even a month since I got my iPhone that I had already built a small “app” running on my laptop to archive my text messages forever. I would manually extract the SMS database from my iPhone, copy it to my laptop, then use a set of scripts written in PHP (the only programming language I knew at the time) to store the messages in a local database, and finally display them using a web-based interface.</p><p>This thing I put together worked just fine for me, but I immediately realized the “business potential” of what I had just created. Just like myself, I assumed many others had the same annoyance. I could have used what I learned to help them too, and maybe make some pocket change in the process. As a matter of fact, I did consider myself an enterprising teenager.</p><p>The idea had potential, and the “app” I built for myself already provided solid foundations, so I just needed to do a bit more work to turn it into a commercially-viable project.</p><p>The biggest challenge was making the solution more accessible to others, including those who were not particularly tech-savvy. That’s when I started learning about app development for iPhone.</p><p>Famously, Apple did not want the iPhone to support third-party apps at the beginning, saying developers should build web apps instead. That policy didn’t last long, and with the iPhone OS 2 update, launched in mid-2008, the official App Store came to life: the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>However, the hacking community had already found a way to sideload apps and had even developed an “app store” called Cydia where you could find games, apps, and even mods to enhance the capabilities of the operating system itself. Cydia came preinstalled on every <em>jailbroken</em> iPhone, which meant potentially hundreds of thousands of people had access to it.</p><p>Everyone could build apps that would be published on Cydia, as long as you knew how to–something that was not remotely as easy to do as it is with today’s tools. As an enterprising teenager with quite a bit of free time on my hand during those winter afternoons and evenings, I took on that challenge.</p><hr><p>The first version of YouArchive.It came out in January 2008.</p><p>Today, you would describe YouArchive.It as a cloud service to store iPhone text messages. You could store all your messages in there, then read and search them using a web-based application.</p><p>There’s still a video left on YouTube showing the application in action (this was the third, and last, version):</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ps5ohEhO3S4" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>With YouArchive.It came an iPhone application too. Published on the Cydia app store, it allowed importing messages into the “cloud service” directly from the phone.</p><p>YouArchive.It was free to use with a limit of 80,000 text messages. Because personal communications can be sensitive, all messages were stored encrypted. With a one-time payment of just €5 (about $6), you could become a VIP, remove any limit and enjoy unlimited storage.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*vTxYRljXFl3IBXGRsXOVag.png" alt="A screenshot of iTextUploader running on a first-generation iPhone"></p><figcaption>A screenshot of iTextUploader running on a first-generation iPhone</figcaption><p>For the next year and a half, YouArchive.It continued to grow organically. A few blogs and websites dedicated to iPhone “hacking” and to the underground app stores wrote about the app. Even a small radio program in the US featured it</p><p>I continued developing the app as a side project while in high school. I was also providing tech support and maintaining the infrastructure.</p><p>Listening to users' feedback, I would periodically add new features. YouArchive.It started displaying emojis as soon as the iPhone supported that (outside of Japan, it required downloading an app to enable them). Users asked for and got the ability to restore texts in another iPhone, before iCloud was available. I also implemented other privacy features such as requiring a password to open the mobile app.</p><blockquote><h3 id="what-i-didnt-realize-at-the-time-however-is-that-i-had-unknowingly-and-unwillingly-built-a-spying-tool-and-a-really-convenient-and-efficient-one">What I didn’t realize at the time, however, is that I had, unknowingly and unwillingly, built a spying tool, and a really convenient and efficient one.</h3></blockquote><p>Enough users were paying the fee to become VIP that I could cover the costs of running the service–this was before everyone was using Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, so I was renting a co-located physical server which wasn’t cheap–and keep some pocket cash. Not much, but enough to pay for some hobbies and outings with friends.</p><p>Most importantly, building YouArchive.It gave me a lot of satisfaction and the opportunity to learn a lot of things about software development, business, dealing with customers and listening to their feedback.</p><hr><p>When I finally shut the service down, in June 2010, YouArchive.It had about 32,000 registered users who stored over 76 million messages.</p><p>The first, and stated, reason for the deprecation was a technical one: YouArchive.It’s iPhone app required using private APIs, which meant it could not be published on the App Store (and it still couldn’t to this day), limiting it to <em>jailbroken</em> phones only.</p><p>The second reason however was the most important to me, even though I have not revealed it until now.</p><p>About a year before the app closed, in April 2009 I implemented a new feature that was requested by many users: the ability to upload texts automatically, in background, without user intervention. For paying “VIP” users only, the mobile app could automatically send all new text messages to YouArchive.It, as often as every 15 minutes.</p><p>Automatic upload was an incredible convenience for many users that wanted to hoard their texts like me, to keep them forever, search within them, print or export them, or just liked having a backup.</p><p>What I didn’t realize at the time, however, is that I had, unknowingly and unwillingly, built a spying tool, and a really convenient and efficient one.</p><p>Thanks to background uploads, people could install the YouArchive.It app on another person’s iPhone, set it up, maybe even hide it (something possible on a <em>jailbroken</em> iPhone), and then watch as the text messages come in, almost real-time. Jealous partners, stalkers and the likes could install this tool on an unknowing victim’s phone with relative ease.</p><p>I can’t remember how I discovered that — it might have been a support request from a user or a post in a bulletin board. I also can’t know how many people were using YouArchive.It for their own archiving rather than to spy on others. Realizing what my users were doing, however, made me feel really uncomfortable and I did not want any part of that anymore.</p><p>As a senior in high school, barely eighteen years-old, I realized for the first time how technology can have a …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><strong>Tirana – Bloodshed Avoided At Queens Birthday Party</strong> is a story that came about thus. Sitting out and enduring the lockdown , I spent a lot of time trawling through YouTube videos especially trooping the colour and the celebrations of the Queen’s birthday. I love our history and traditions and make no apologies for saying so.</span></p><p>Every year, on the occasion of the Queen’s official birthday, all British embassies and Posts throughout the world organise their own Queen’s birthday celebration.</p><p>So, this took me back to a time and place when the apparently straightforward task of arranging an event of this magnitude can often be fraught with uncertainty and a whiff of danger, especially abroad.</p><p>It was the first week in June 1998 in Tirana, where the focus then was on the upcoming <strong>Queens</strong> <strong>Birthday Party,</strong> (QBP) which I had been told I was to organise.</p><p>Although I took the embassy lead with the organisation and logistics, all QBP’s are very much a team effort.</p><p>Given the importance of this event, all staff in the embassy, from drivers right up to the Ambassador, have a role to play in putting together this, our showcase social occasion of the year.</p><p>My chief role as lead was to coordinate all the various strands, make sure everyone knew exactly what they were expected to do, liaise with the venue for catering and entertainment and of course assist with the compilation of the all important guest list.</p><p>Planning progressed well. Perhaps a little too well. When the great day arrived we were all in position, well prepared and briefed as to what our role would be during the two hour long event. The Tirana International hotel had pulled out all the stops and really done a splendid job. Flower baskets abounded, the food was laid out on silver platters buffet style along the terrace, spotlessly white- jacketed waiters were primed and ready to mingle and dispense drinks.</p><p>For background, I had even hired a small classical musical quartet as well as a solo lady harpist.</p><figure id="attachment_112" data-shortcode="caption" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-112"></figure><p>For an event such as this, protocol dictated that as well as other foreign diplomats and notables, we invite the heads of the two main political parties, who were the President of Albania from the current governing party and his chief political rival from the opposition party, who just so happened to be the former President of Albania.</p><p>There was bad history between both men, they despised each other and there had been outbreaks of serious violence and bloodshed between their supporters in the recent past.</p><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/sas-rescue-trapped-diplomats-in-albania/">SAS Rescue 3 Trapped British Diplomats in Albania</a></p><p>Therefore, given this mutual loathing, we didnâ€™t expect either to turn up. For us, the best-case scenario would have been both sending lower level minions for appearances sake or, better still, nobody from either party showing up.</p><p>Therefore, based on this presumption, I catered for one hundred official guests. No RSVP was received from either current or former President, therefore it was assumed that they would not be coming. Even last minute phone calls to their respective offices evoked non-committal answers</p><p>Well, I was wrong.</p><p>First to turn up was the incumbent President of Albania with a whole host of bodyguards, drivers and associated hangers-on. The Ambassador, thinking that the President was not coming was initially caught on the hop, but thinking fast on his feet announced that he was honoured and thrilled that the President had decided to accept our invitation.</p><p>I was then tasked with ushering him and his party to a shady spot on one side of the harpist who began to look extremely nervous at being so near to the President but more so I think because of his bodyguards, all black leather jackets and bulges under their armpits.</p><p>Not long after, more official guests arrived. But what was this?</p><p>I could not believe it. The Presidentâ€™s chief political rival had also decided to accept our invitation. So in he came, with even more bodyguards, drivers and associated hangers on. Why had he come? He must have known that the President would be coming. Was this an excuse for some form of confrontation?</p><p>The by now clearly rattled Ambassador greeted the former President announcing again how honoured and thrilled he was that he had decided to accept our invitation. At this stage of the proceedings I was trying to merge into the background fearing the worst, but (bugger) the Ambassador spotted me and motioned for me to take charge of the party and find them a suitable spot. Well, the only free space large enough was on the other side of where the lady harpist was playing and so I directed the former President and his entourage there.</p><p>The poor harpist.</p><p>I had no idea what Albanian piece she was playing but with two warring factions on either side of her the pace of her playing definitely increased in tempo and volume. Also, a<span>t that stage, I really did not think that a harp would be a sturdy enough barrier if the two factions decided to have a go at each other.</span></p><p>However, my main concern at this stage was not about confrontation, it was the catering arrangements. I had only catered for one hundred and now with the recent, unexpected arrivals it looked to be about one hundred and fifty. Horror of horrors, it now appeared as if we might run out of food and drink at an early stage, a cardinal sin of the first magnitude at a QBP.</p><p>If so, I was in trouble. If this was not bad enough, we had two factions who would at the drop of a hat be at each others throats, a twitchy harpist who was literally going into overdrive with the speed of her playing and an Ambassador who seemed to be hyperventilating under an awning in the corner with a very shaky largeÂ&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; G &amp; T.</p><p>Things were definitely taking a turn for the worse. I could see my career ending before it started. I was the one put in charge, I had arranged all of this. If things went wrong it was down to me.</p><p>The uneasy atmosphere persisted as it came time for the speeches (very short thankfully), which, both the Ambassador and the President managed to deliver without incident or interruption. On conclusion of the speeches, the two national anthems were played followed soon after with the orderly departure of the President and his party.</p><p>A few minutes later, having been advised that the Presidentâ€™s convoy of cars had left the hotel and sped off into the distance, the former President and his entourage also left. Both parties fortunately (for me) had not touched any of the food instead limiting themselves to soft drinks or iced water.</p><p>My relief was palpable. It had turned out eventually to be a good QBP given the uncomfortable circumstances and unexpected guests. At least the Ambassador who had by now recovered his composure, was content with the proceedings which was the main thing. This was a good, steep learning curve for me as I was destined to organise a number of QBPs in the future in various locations and under some pretty extreme constraints.</p><p>So, valuable lesson learned, never take anything for granted.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>In this guide I am going to show you how to setup <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD" target="_blank">CI/CD</a> with GitHub Actions for Rails. I assume you are running Linux and have Rails 6 installed together with PostgreSQL and Git. If you need help, I wrote a guide on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://codingwizardry.com/2020/11/10/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-on-ubuntu-20-04/" target="_blank">how to install Rails with PostgreSQL on Ubuntu 20.04</a>. In this tutorial we will create a basic Rails application. We will upload the application to GitHub, integrate GitHub Actions, and setup a CI/CD workflow that deploys to Heroku. Let’s begin!</p>



<h2>Setting Up PostgreSQL</h2>



<p>Create a PostgreSQL user for the Rails app we’ll create in the next step. To do this, switch into the <code>postgres</code> user and fire up <code>psql</code>:</p>



<pre><code>$ sudo -u postgres -i
$ psql</code></pre>



<p>Then create a new user (or “role”, as PostgreSQL calls it):</p>



<pre><code>$ create role social_network with createdb login password 'password1';</code></pre>



<p>To go back you type <code>\q </code>to exit psql and <code>exit</code> to return to your main terminal.</p>



<h2>Creating a New Rails App</h2>



<p>Navigate to a directory on your computer where you want to store the project (I like to use <code>~/dev</code>) and execute the following commands:</p>



<pre><code>$ rails new social_network -d postgresql
$ cd social_network</code></pre>



<p>Open up the <code>config/database.yml</code> file in a text editor and under <code>default</code> find the line that says <code>pool: &lt;%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %&gt;</code> and add the following lines: </p>



<pre><code>host: localhost
username: social_network
password: &lt;%= ENV['SOCIAL_NETWORK_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %&gt;</code></pre>



<p>We are going to need an environment variable to store the database password. The password should match the password used in the previous step. Execute the following commands:</p>



<pre><code>$ echo 'export SOCIAL_NETWORK_DATABASE_PASSWORD="password1"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc</code></pre>



<p>Finally, we’ll create our database and launch our application.</p>



<pre><code>$ rails db:create
$ rails server</code></pre>



<p>You can now visit <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://localhost:3000/" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a> and if everything has gone right you will be greeted by the following website:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="679" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1-1024x679.png" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1-1024x679.png 1024w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1-300x199.png 300w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1-768x509.png 768w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1-1170x776.png 1170w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1-780x516.png 780w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1-585x388.png 585w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1-263x175.png 263w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2>Add Project to GitHub</h2>



<p>Next up, let’s create a new repository on GitHub. You can create a new repository <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/new" target="_blank">here</a> once you’re logged into GitHub.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="724" height="716" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-e1605980210642.png" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-e1605980210642.png 724w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-e1605980210642-300x297.png 300w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-e1605980210642-585x579.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px"></figure>



<p>Then we want to link the GitHub repository to our local project. In the <code>social_network</code> folder execute the following command:</p>



<pre><code>$ git remote add origin git@github.com:your_username/social-network.git</code></pre>



<p>Or if you prefer to use HTTPS instead of SSH, run the following command:</p>



<pre><code>$ git remote add origin https://github.com/your_username/social-network.git</code></pre>



<p>Verify that we’ve set the remote origin correctly:</p>



<pre><code>$ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:your_username/social-network.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:your_username/social-network.git (push)</code></pre>



<p>Because we’ve let GitHub create a README.md and .gitignore file for us, let’s remove the the ones generated by Rails, and pull the new files (including a LICENCE file) from GitHub into our local project folder:</p>



<pre><code>$ rm .gitignore README.md
$ git pull origin main
From github.com:your_username/social-network
 * branch            main       -&gt; FETCH_HEAD</code></pre>



<p>Now to push all our local files onto GitHub, execute the following commands. Note here that we have to rename our master branch to main, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-alternative-term-to-avoid-slavery-references/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GitHub no longer uses the name master</a> in order to rid itself from references to slavery.</p>



<pre><code>$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git branch -m master main
$ git push --set-upstream origin main</code></pre>



<p>If everything went well, we’ve successfully uploaded our newly created Rails application to GitHub.</p>



<h2>Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions</h2>



<p>To set up GitHub Actions for our project we’ll need a workflow file. A workflow is an automated procedure that you can add to a repository. Workflows are made up of one or more jobs and can be scheduled or triggered by an event. The workflow can be used to build, test, package, release, or deploy a project on GitHub. You can read more about GitHub Actions <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. In this tutorial we’re going to use a workflow to test the project and, if all tests pass, deploy the project to <a href="https://heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heroku</a>.</p>



<p>Let’s start by creating a functional workflow file. This file will be able to automatically run the, currently non-existent, tests. In your project folder create a new directory <code>.github/workflows/</code>. Within the newly created workflows directory create a new workflow file <code>social-network.yml</code>:</p>



<pre><code>name: Social Network
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres
        ports: ['5432:5432']
        env:
          POSTGRES_USER: social_network
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
        options: &gt;-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: '14.x'
      - name: Set up Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: 2.7
          bundler-cache: true
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          bundle install --jobs 4 --retry 3
          yarn
      - name: Set up database
        run: bundle exec rails db:prepare
        env:
           SOCIAL_NETWORK_DATABASE_PASSWORD: postgres
      - name: Run tests
        run: bundle exec rails test
        env:
           RAILS_ENV: test
           SOCIAL_NETWORK_DATABASE_PASSWORD: postgres       </code></pre>



<p>To understand the workflow file I recommend you take a moment to read the “Understanding the workflow file” section in the GitHub Actions documentation <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions#understanding-the-workflow-file" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Now, commit and push the file to GitHub:</p>



<pre><code>$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Add automated tests workflow"
$ git push</code></pre>



<p>Head over to GitHub and select the <strong>Actions</strong> tab in the social-network repository and click on “Add automated tests workflow”, you will see the following output:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1015" height="654" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3-e1606833342684.png" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3-e1606833342684.png 1015w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3-e1606833342684-300x193.png 300w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3-e1606833342684-768x495.png 768w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3-e1606833342684-585x377.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1015px) 100vw, 1015px"></figure>



<p>We’ve successfully set up continuous integration! In the next section we will focus on automatic deployment to Heroku.</p>



<h2>Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions</h2>



<p>Create a new Heroku account if you haven’t already got on <a href="https://signup.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Then, create a new app within Heroku <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Choose an app name and select your region, I like to prefix the app name with my last name:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="655" height="327" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1.png 655w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-300x150.png 300w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-585x292.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px"></figure>



<p>In order to deploy to Heroku we will need to setup a GitHub Secret with the Heroku API key. The API key can be found <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Create a new GitHub secret:</p>



<ol><li>On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.</li><li>Under the repository name, click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>In the left sidebar, click <strong>Secrets</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>New repository secret</strong>.</li><li>Type <code>HEROKU_API_KEY</code> in the <strong>Name</strong> input box.</li><li>Paste the Heroku API key in the <strong>Value</strong> input box.</li></ol>



<p>We can now use this secret in the workflow file. Update the workflow file to deploy to Heroku once all tests pass:</p>



<pre id="block-a8c659b2-f50c-4043-8a74-f7fc3eb6a65f"><code>name: Social Network
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres
        ports: ['5432:5432']
        env:
          POSTGRES_USER: social_network
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
        options: &gt;-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: '14.x'
      - name: Set up Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: 2.7
          bundler-cache: true
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          bundle install --jobs 4 --retry 3
          yarn
      - name: Set up database
        run: bundle exec rails db:prepare
        env:
           SOCIAL_NETWORK_DATABASE_PASSWORD: postgres
      - name: Run tests
        run: bundle exec rails test
        env:
           RAILS_ENV: test
           SOCIAL_NETWORK_DATABASE_PASSWORD: postgres
  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
     - uses: actions/checkout@v2
     - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.6.8
       with:
         heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}
         heroku_app_name: 'Your Heroku app name'
         heroku_email: 'Your email'</code></pre>



<p>In order to execute commands on Heroku once the project is deployed, we need a <code>Procfile</code>. We will need to execute commands that set up the database and start the application. Go ahead and create the file in the project root directory with the following contents:</p>



<pre><code>release: bundle exec rails db:prepare
web: bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb</code></pre>



<p>Commit the changes:</p>



<pre><code>$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Add automated deployment to workflow"</code></pre>



<p>We are almost ready to push to GitHub. But first, add a root route so that the project knows what to display whenever a users surfs to the website. Add a function named <code>index</code> to <code>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</code>:</p>



<pre><code>class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
  def index
    render html: 'Hello, world!'
  end
end</code></pre>



<p>Then, add a root route to <code>config/routes.rb</code>:</p>



<pre><code>Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root 'application#index'
end</code></pre>



<p>Commit the changes once more and push to GitHub:</p>



<pre><code>$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Add root route"
$ git push</code></pre>



<p>Head over to GitHub Actions and confirm that all tests pass:</p>

<p>And that’s it! The project is now successfully deployed to Heroku.</p>
