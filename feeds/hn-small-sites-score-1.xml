</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609697572806_14361"><div><p>The desire to get more sales off-Amazon doesn’t just come from the risk that they suspend our company from their platform. It’s also about the cost of selling there relative to other channels. If we sell $100 worth of product on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/viahart">our Amazon store</a>, on average, we get $48.25 back. At <a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?query=viahart&amp;redirect=false">our Walmart.com store</a>, we get $54.50 and on <a href="https://www.ebay.com/str/viahart">eBay store</a>, we get $57.50 back. On <a href="https://viahart.com/">our website (which could use a bath!)</a>, by virtue of not having a commission and by having much lower per unit shipping costs driven by larger orders (the more you ship, the cheaper it is to ship per unit), we get $83.10 back!</p><p>What’s driving those cost differences between the big marketplaces Amazon, eBay, and Walmart? It’s not shipping. It costs us roughly the same to ship out of our warehouse as it does for us to use Amazon’s FBA. eBay’s has slightly lower commissions, but the main reasons for the cost differences between these marketplaces are:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Refunds - It could be Amazon’s customer service or perhaps the customers themselves, but Amazon grants more refunds (2.6% of revenue) than either Walmart (1.9%) or famously seller friendly eBay (1%)</p></li><li><p>Storage - It costs a lot of money to store your products in Amazon’s fulfillment centers. We spent 2.4% of our Amazon revenue on storage. Amazon’s service was very spotty this year, but being able to reach 99.99% of America within 1-2 days is pretty awesome and this is a big driver of why Amazon owns 93.4% of our sales.</p></li><li><p>Advertising - Depending on what website A/B testing they’re doing, as many as 6 out of the top 7 results in an Amazon search can be advertising.  Even when a customer searches for your brand, if you want to be seen before your competition, you need to pay Amazon. We paid them 3.55% of our Amazon revenue in 2020. As less competitive marketplaces, we did not see the need to pay for advertising on eBay or Walmart. </p></li></ol></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609697572806_20928"><div>

At that level of margin, moving your sales from Amazon to eBay would result in a 38% improvement in profits, which is huge. Shifting those sales from Amazon to one’s own website would represent a more than 3x increase in profits! Of course, if this were easy, we would have done it already. Unfortunately, getting traffic to one’s website is oftentimes a costly affair and it could be expected that a good portion of those profits would go to Facebook or Google.</p><p>Logistics and Covid-19 or Why It’s Better to Be Lucky Than Good</p><p>When the lockdowns first hit in the United States, it caused a massive shift in spending from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce. When government assistance arrived, it turbocharged online consumer spending even further. So for almost everyone in the e-commerce industry, 2020 was the best year they’ve ever had.</p><p>That said, it was a logistics nightmare, all year. And as a result, the rewards of this e-commerce boom were not spread evenly across all channels throughout the year.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609697572806_31343"><div>

From 11/27/2020 through 12/31/2020 sales were up only 20% over 2019’s same period. From 12/15/2020 through the end of the year, our sales in 2020 were lower than they were in 2019.

One way to establish social proof is to have a lot of reviews for your item. Again, it’s not just the quality of the reviews, but the quantity that is important to customers trying to make a decision. Our older items had a lot of reviews, given that they had been sold since 2014. However, Amazon implemented a change. They’ve lowered the bar to reviewing, by offering the new rating feature.</p></div><div data-aspect-ratio="32.077625570776256" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609697572806_52634"><div>

This past weekend, on January 9th, we celebrated 10 years since <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/337c3f2d569a42ebd5fcab6fef18c5e012f9be5b">the first commit to the Elixir repository</a>. While I personally don’t consider <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> to be 10 years old yet - the language that became what Elixir is today <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/6052352b6281752b905b30eb5b08fac0f51f68cd">surfaced only 14 months later</a> - a decade is a mark to celebrate!</p>
<p>
The goal of this post is to focus on the current state of some projects in the ecosystem and then briefly highlight a few of the exciting efforts coming over the next months.</p>
<h2>
Recap: The language goals</h2>
<p>
When I started working on Elixir, I personally had the ambition of using it for building scalable and robust web applications. However, I didn’t want Elixir to be tied to the web. My goal was to design an <em>extensible</em> language with a diverse ecosystem. Elixir aims to be a general purpose language and allows developers to extend it to new domains.</p>
<p>
Given Elixir is built on top of Erlang and Erlang is used for networking and distributed systems, Elixir would naturally be a good fit in those domains too, as long as I didn’t screw things up. The Erlang VM is essential to everything we do in Elixir, which is why <em>compatibility</em> has become a language goal too.</p>
<p>
I also wanted the language to be <em>productive</em>, especially by focusing on the tooling. Learning a functional programming language is a new endeavor for most developers. Consequently their first experiences getting started with the language, setting up a new project, searching for documentation, and debugging should go as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>
Extensibility, compatibility, and productivity are the goals we built the language upon.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Elixir in production</h2>
<p>
Last year we started <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/cases.html">a series of articles on companies using Elixir in production on the official website</a>. As of today, we have 7 production cases listed with more coming this year! Overall it is very exciting to see many different companies using a variety of business models and industries running Elixir in production.</p>
<p>
Companies like <a href="https://www.brex.com/">Brex</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/06/23/growing-with-elixir-at-brex/">case</a>), <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">case</a>), <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a>, <a href="https://www.podium.com/">Podium</a>, and <a href="https://salesloft.com/">SalesLoft</a> have reached <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)">“unicorn status”</a> and rely heavily on Elixir. Startups like <a href="https://www.joinblvd.com/">Boulevard</a> (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/elixirtalk/episode-166-feat-sean-stavropoulos">podcast</a>), <a href="https://community.com/">Community</a>, <a href="https://duffel.com/">Duffel</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/12/10/integrating-travel-with-elixir-at-duffel/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.ockam.io/">Ockam</a>, <a href="https://www.mux.com/">Mux</a>, <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, <a href="https://remote.com/">Remote</a>, and <a href="https://www.v7labs.com/">V7</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2021/01/13/orchestrating-computer-vision-with-elixir/">case</a>) also use Elixir and have received funding in the last year or two. Elixir is also used within known brands and enterprises such as <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/">Bleacher Report</a>, <a href="https://www.change.org/">Change.org</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">case</a>), <a href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/09/24/paas-with-elixir-at-Heroku/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a>, <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/">PepsiCo</a>, and <a href="https://www.therealreal.com/">TheRealReal</a>.</p>
<p>
There is also a special category of startups that run Elixir alonside an open source model, such as <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a>, <a href="https://app.supabase.io/">Supabase</a>, <a href="https://logflare.app/">Logflare</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/11-logflare-is-a-log-management-and-event-analytics-platform">podcast</a>), and <a href="https://hex.pm/">Hex.pm</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/19-hexpm-is-elixirs-official-package-manager">podcast</a>) itself. Still on the open source front, you will find projects like <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> and <a href="https://changelog.com/">Changelog</a>. There also many small scale and hobby projects that use Elixir for a productive and joyful development experience.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Diverse ecosystem</h2>
<p>
Today, Elixir has a diverse ecosystem that works on a wide range of domains and industries. Let’s take a look at some examples.</p>
<h3>
Web</h3>
<p>
Most developers are familiar with using Elixir for web development thanks to <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/">the Phoenix web framework</a>. Phoenix gained traction in the ecosystem because it was the first to fully leverage the language and the platform for building real-time applications besides the usual MVC (Model-View-Controller) offering.</p>
<p>
It all started with Phoenix Channels, as a bi-directional communication between clients and servers, and Phoenix PubSub, which uses Erlang’s distributed compatibilities to broadcast messages across nodes. As far as I know, Phoenix was the first major web framework to provide a multi-node web real-time solution completely out-of-the-box. Regardless if you are using one node or ten nodes, everything just works, with minimal configuration and dependencies.</p>
<p>
Phoenix has matured a lot since its first stable release. Phoenix v1.2 included <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Phoenix Presence</a>, that allows developers to track which users, IoT devices, etc are connected to your cluster right now. No databases or external dependencies required! This is one of the problems that look deceptively simple at first, but once you outline all scalability, performance, and fault-tolerance requirements, it <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/11/17/real-time-collaboration-with-elixir-at-slab/">becomes quite complex</a>. Luckily, Phoenix is running on a platform that excels at these problems, and I am not aware of any other framework that provides such a lean and elegant solution as part of its default stack.</p>

Most recently, <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix LiveView</a> was released and brought new ways to build rich, real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML, inspiring developers to attempt similar solutions for other languages and frameworks. You can read the <a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/12/12/phoenix-liveview-interactive-real-time-apps-no-need-to-write-javascript">original announcement</a> or <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5">learn how to build a real-time Twitter clone in 15 minutes</a>. As part of the <em>Live</em> family, we have also announced <a href="https://twitter.com/josevalim/status/1250846714665357315">Phoenix LiveDashboard</a>, making monitoring and instrumentation a first-class citizen for Phoenix applications.</p>
<h3>
Embedded and IoT</h3>
<p>
While I always expected Elixir to shine for building web applications, I was taken by surprise when I heard about the <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves platform</a> for creating high-end embedded applications. However, once I learned their premise, it all made sense: writing embedded systems <em>is</em> complicated. Reasoning about failures is hard. So what if we could leverage the decades of lessons learnt by Erlang/OTP to design embedded applications? What if a fault on the Wi-Fi driver could be fixed by having a supervisor simply restart it? After all, the first major use of Erlang/OTP was in an embedded system, the Ericsson AXD301 ATM switch.</p>
<p>
Nerves brings the Elixir ecosystem and the battle-tested Erlang VM to edge computing, providing a rich developer experience using proven technology. Nerves started as a one step process for turning an Elixir project into a complete software image for common hardware devices. Today, Nerves is being used in production in industrial automation, machine learning, consumer electronics and more, with <a href="https://farm.bot/">Farmbot</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/08/20/embedded-elixir-at-farmbot/">case</a>) and <a href="https://www.rosepoint.com/">Rose Point Navigation</a> being two of the most notable examples.</p>
<p>
The Nerves team also created <a href="https://www.nerves-hub.org/">NervesHub</a>, a fully open-source device management system. Combining all these technologies makes Elixir a comprehensive language for building end-to-end IoT platforms.</p>
<h3>
Data ingestion and pipelines</h3>
<p>
Shortly after Elixir v1.0 was released, the Elixir Core Team and I started looking into abstractions for tackling data ingestions and data pipelines in Elixir. We ran through a couple designs until we eventually <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2016/07/14/announcing-genstage/">landed on GenStage</a>: a behaviour for exchanging data with back-pressure between Elixir processes and external systems. For an introduction, make sure to check out <a href="https://youtu.be/srtMWzyqdp8?t=242">my keynote introducing both GenStage and Flow</a>.</p>
<p>
Today, almost 5 years later, GenStage has been used by many industries and has become one of the factors driving Elixir adoption. For example, you can read how both <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">Discord</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">Change.org</a> have built systems on Elixir and GenStage that handle spikes and run at massive scale.</p>
<p>
However, GenStage was just the beginning. In 2019, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOExnT1PYjs">we announced Broadway</a>, which is a higher-level abstraction on top of GenStage that makes building data ingestion pipelines a breeze. We originally released with Amazon SQS support. Nowadays, RabbitMQ, Google Cloud PubSub, Apache Kafka, and other sources (known as producers in Broadway terms) are also available.</p>
<h3>
Audio/Video streaming</h3>
<p>
Since the Erlang VM was designed for scalable network processing, one can expect to also be an excellent platform for audio and video streaming. However, if you also wanted to process and transform those streams on the fly, the situation becomes much more complicated as you likely have to integrate with native code.</p>
<p>
Luckily, the tables have turned when Erlang/OTP 20 was released a couple years ago with the so-called Dirty NIFs. The Erlang VM always had the ability to invoke native code, but this native code could not run for long, as to not interfere with the preemptive features of the Erlang runtime. Dirty NIFs allow developers to tag native code either as IO or CPU bound, which runs on specific threads. Between ports (I/O based), NIFs, Dirty NIFs, and remote nodes, developers now have many options to interface with native code with different performance and reliability guarantees. That’s exactly the foundation the <a href="http://www.membraneframework.org/">Membrane Framework</a> builds on top of.</p>
<p>
Membrane was extracted from RadioKit, a startup aiming at disrupting the radio broadcasting industry. Originally it focused on processing and mixing audio. Later, <a href="https://www.swmansion.com/">Software Mansion</a> acquired the framework and provided stable funding and a solid team to help it grow into a full-scale framework. Currently, it allows developers to process, transmit, broadcast, and transform audio and videos streams on the fly. Whether you are building a Twitch clone, a VOD application or a video conferencing system, Membrane provides a growing set of high-level abstractions and pre-made modules so you don’t have to dive into idiosyncrasies of particular codecs, protocols, and formats. </p>
<h2>
Looking ahead: what is coming in 2021</h2>
<p>
The year of 2021 looks very exciting for the Erlang Ecosystem and the Elixir community. In this section, we are going to mention some of the things we expect to see in 2021.</p>
<h3>
Erlang/OTP 24 with JIT</h3>
<p>
In September 2020, <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/2745">Lukas Larsson and the Erlang/OTP team</a> announced a JIT compiler for the Erlang VM called BeamAsm. How faster the JIT will be in practice depends on your application but the results posted in the announcement are promising. To quote Lukas:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
If we run the JSON benchmarks found in the <a href="https://github.com/devinus/poison/tree/master/bench">Poison</a> or <a href="https://github.com/michalmuskala/jason/tree/master/bench">Jason</a>, BeamAsm achieves anything from 30% to 130% increase (average at about 70%) in the number of iterations per second for all Erlang/Elixir implementations. For some benchmarks, BeamAsm is even faster than the pure C implementation <a href="https://github.com/davisp/jiffy">jiffy</a>.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
More complex applications tend to see a more moderate performance increase, for instance, RabbitMQ is able to handle 30% to 50% more messages per second depending on the scenario.  </p>

<p>The first publication of the first VideoLAN NuGet package dates back to April 1st, 2018 (no joke!). We have been steadily adding new packages since then to cover all platforms supported by both LibVLC and .NET.</p>

<p>Today, we actively publish and maintain <strong>15 NuGet packages</strong>, 6 of which  actually containing native platform-specific code. The remaining 9 packages are managed C# DLLs composed of the main binding (<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibVLCSharp/">LibVLCSharp</a>) and various GUI toolkit integrations for getting users up and running quickly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Xamarin.Android</li>

<p>LibVLCSharp counts about <strong>19 contributors</strong>, with most people doing one-off contributions and mainly 2 active maintainers (<a href="https://github.com/jeremyVignelles">Jérémy</a> and myself). I’d like to thank each of them for their valuable OSS contributions!</p>



<p>Many exciting things! More game engine integrations, ongoing LibVLC 4 support, interop performance improvements and plenty of new integrations, samples and features are yet to be implemented.</p>

<p>We have a diverse and (mostly) well-defined <a href="https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp/-/issues">backlog</a> of both features to implement and bugs to fix, with a varying degree of difficulty, and always welcome new contributors. We are available on the <a href="https://discord.gg/3h3K3JF">LibVLC community Discord server</a> (320+ members).</p>

<p>I recently mass refactored our production codebase at work. And I did so without the fear of breaking things. It was a full-stack refactor, and I did changes to our apps, test code and DevOps code. After finishing the mass refactor, I did zero manual testing. So, how did I do this? With the help of automated testing like this, of course:</p>

I will talk more about the product that I worked on more in a moment. I will also explain the tools and technologies that helped me in the process of mass refactoring.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-i-do">What Did I Do?</h2>
<p>I have refactored our large production codebase over the span of four months. I did this refactor module by module and product by product. I have probably touched our entire tech stack during this (hence the importance of being a full-stack engineer!). I made changes to our clients (mobile and desktop) in their UI and core code. I adapted our tests code to the changes that I’ve done to the product. I have also changed our DevOps code extensively, to accommodate the changes I’ve done to the product and test code. Following animation is from my method chaining article, which was partly inspired by the changes that I did to our test framework. If you want to check out the full article, it is in the resources section above.</p>

<video width="790" height="300" controls=""><source src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/media/method_chaining.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>Changes were mostly technical (i.e. swap one JSON library with another, adapt the code to new UI libs, use method chaining in test code etc.) so correctness of the changes from product management perspective was not entirely relevant. However, verifying that functionality remained the same, and everything continued to work in production as-is was #1 priority. Further code level changes that I’ve done is not the point of this article so I won’t dig deeper. I did most of my refactors using IntelliJ IDEA, which supports all the programming languages we use and has enormous refactoring capabilities. We also have a ton of static code analyzers, linters, and code reformatters built into our continuous-integration process, which was also very helpful in detecting defects at code level early on. Finally, our code peer-review process using pull-requests has the most important code quality assurance factor.</p>

<p>After I was done with the refactors, I made zero manual testing on our products. Neither did I have any fear of breaking things during this mass refactor. And oh boy, did break things! So why was I not fearful of breaking things? Because I knew that I could identify and fix what I broke during the refactoring process. I will talk more about our quality assurance tech in a moment.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-our-product">What is Our Product?</h2>
<p>Our product is a large enterprise VPN software. It has been under development by a large team for the last 5+ years, so it has a considerably complex codebase. It has key hardware integrations, so reliability is quite important. When you integrate software and hardware features, you get a large surface area for bugs. Testing the hardware integrations is incredibly daunting since you need to get the hardware in test to the right state to test things correctly every time. In addition, we have clients for all major desktop and mobile OSes, and a vast DevOps infrastructure to automate the assembly of these clients. I want to leave a bit of mystery here, as I will write a separate article on what I do in my day-to-day work.</p>

<h2 id="why-was-i-so-confident">Why Was I So Confident?</h2>
<p>As a senior engineer, it is my duty to initiate and take on riskier projects. When done right, a large refactor and a refresh of the codebase can make working with the products a joy again. While initiating this mass refactor project, I was fully confident that I would not end up destroying our products, as I knew that a considerable number of automated end-to-end tests that I implemented over long years got my back. Also, I have recently created a mobile device farm, extending our end-to-end testing coverage to mobile devices. As you can see in the following photo, I have Android devices on the left and iOS devices on the right, and a MacBook as the host. All the connected devices are controller by the host machine:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/device_farm.jpg" alt="My Device Farm Implementation"></p>

<p>Mass end-to-end testing like this, also known as acceptance testing, makes mass refactoring a less worrisome task. However, you still have to trigger tests every time you complete a part of your refactor and make sure to fix any broken tests or features. Depending on the test suite size and availability of automation hardware, this might take days. Of course, to verify the full correctness of my refactors, I had the run the entire test suite, and not just the end-to-end tests. Our unit and integration test coverage is also solid and they run on our CI servers as a part of our build process. Especially having integration tests that verify our software design decisions were invaluable, including our API endpoints and other 3rd party software integrations. Especially when dealing with our software’s modules written in scripting languages (JavaScript, Python, etc.), our unit tests came in quite handy. I depend on those unit tests to verify that I broke none of the expected input/output types, as the compiler cannot do it for me in a dynamic programming languages</p>

<p>Before going into device farms, let me briefly mention automated testing.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-automated-testing">What is Automated Testing?</h2>
<p>In summary, automated testing has three main parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Unit testing. Unit testing tests the smallest sections of your code, which is mostly going to be your functions. You can even have multiple tests per function based on the behavior of your functions. And there are some great frameworks for it like NUnit, JUnit, Mocha, etc. which will help you organize your tests better.</li>
  <li>Integration testing. As the name suggests, integration testing tests the integration of your software components. For instance, one integration test can test the integration of multiple functions, classes, or even modules. You can use the same unit testing frameworks that I mentioned above for integration testing too.</li>
  <li>End-to-end (acceptance) testing. This is the endgame. End-to-end testing is where you test your product just like an end-user would do. You simulate real user interactions with your product using end-to-end testing frameworks like Selenium, Appium, etc. More on this in the next section.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have a complete video on software quality assurance where I describe how software companies test their products, starting with unit tests and going all the way to end-to-end (acceptance) testing level. If you want to see it, link to it is in the resources section above.</p>

<h2 id="device-farms-and-test-labs">Device Farms and Test Labs</h2>
<p>Now comes the fun part. This is where you get to play with your products on real devices. Of course, you don’t want to play with the devices indefinitely; you want to automate that process. For my device farm implementation for our products, I used Appium, which uses Selenium’s WebDriver protocol for all clients. Appium can control both web apps and native apps. It can even control hybrid web UI + native core apps (i.e. Electron apps). A single Appium server instance running in a host machine can control all the connected devices, and the apps and browsers installed on those devices:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/appium_architecture_diagram.png" alt="Appium Architecture Diagram"></p>

<p>In my implementation, I connected all our mobile devices to a single host machine via a USB hub, and the host machine is controller by Appium:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/device_farm_usb_hub.jpg" alt="Device Farm With USB Hub"></p>

<p>Now let’s watch my device farm implementation in live-action in our office:</p>

<video width="790" height="300" controls=""><source src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/media/device_farm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>As you can see, I have both Android and iOS devices connected to a single MacBook. Everything except for one power-hungry tablet is going through the USB hub. It is a little messy, but it has been working great. When someone triggers an automated test run, one of the devices is selected at random for the given platform. Then the entire test suit runs on that device, and the test results are collected. There is quite a bit of room for improvement, but this, along with our similar setup for desktop clients, enabled me to make extensive changes to our sensitive production codebase with confidence.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that automated testing on real devices is substantially better than manual testing in the long run. You will save a ton of time via automation like this, and you can keep expending your testing coverage for your optimum quality assurance needs. You really don’t need to take the route that I took and implement all these yourself. You can utilize ready-to-use device farms provided by Google Firebase Test Lab, Amazon Device Farm, etc.:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/firebase_test_lab.png" alt="Firebase Test Lab"></p>

<p>However, if you choose to implement your own device farm, remember that a lot of the publicly available device farms were born from internal implementations as I did. So you can always provide parts of your infrastructure as a service if you ever decide to go IaaS/SaaS route.</p>

<p>As a bonus in my implementation, people can RDP into the main test machine and control the phones remotely for manual testing when needed. Also, there are …</p></section></div></div>

<li><strong>Optimized OLTP</strong>—storage is optimized for high I/O transaction database workloads. Each database instance can support up to 30,000 IOPS.</li>
<li><strong>General purpose</strong>—cost effective hardware offering 3 IOPS per stored GB.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong>&nbsp;improves on the performance of standard MySQL by 5x, and improves on standard PostgreSQL by 2x, with the same hardware configuration. Aurora is a new database engine built to make the most of available compute capacity, memory, and network bandwidth.</p>
<h3>Storage</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon RDS</strong> can provision storage up to 6TB, on-demand without downtime.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong> automatically increases storage from a minimum of 10 GB to a maximum of 64 TB, in increments of 10 GB, based on current usage—you do not need to pre-configure storage. Storage scaling does not affect database performance.</p>
<p>However, for MySQL, Aurora only supports the InnoDB storage engine. Tables are automatically converted if they use another storage engine.</p>
<h3>Replication</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon RDS </strong>allows up to five live database copies, known as read replicas. RDS failover is done manually, so some data loss may occur.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong> also provides read replicas, which share the same data volume as the original database instance. Up to 15 read replicas are supported. Failover is done fully automatically with no data loss. It also supports creating a highly available database cluster with synchronous replication across multiple availability zones.</p>
<h3>Backup</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon RDS</strong> performs a daily snapshot of your database, and saves transaction logs to allow point-in-time recovery. The snapshot occurs during a backup window you can specify. While the snapshot is being taken, storage I/O may be interrupted while data is copied, affecting database performance. Backups are saved to S3 with very high durability.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Aurora</strong> backups are continuous, incremental backups that do not affect database performance. Also, there is no need to take frequent snapshots to enable point in time recovery.</p>
<h2 id="sub_3">Amazon RDS or Aurora? Factors to Consider Before Choosing</h2>
<p>We covered a feature by feature comparison of the two database services. Here are some other important considerations before you select the service that is right for you.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong></p>
<p>Especially for production databases, <a href="https://cloudian.com/guides/backup-cloud-storage/data-backup-in-depth/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">data backup </a>is a critical consideration. Aurora offers higher availability and better resilience than RDS, due to its unique storage model, and ability to perform continuous backups and restore with a very low recovery point objective (RPO).</p>
<p><strong>Database engine support</strong></p>
<p>Aurora only supports MySQL and PostgreSQL. If you need to run other database engines, such as SQL Server, you will need to opt for RDS.</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong></p>
<p>Aurora is generally more expensive than RDS for the same workloads. RDS is priced based on type and size of instance and EBS volume. Aurora pricing is mainly based on instance size and storage is billed according to actual usage. Keep in mind read replicas represent an extra cost in both platforms.</p>
<h2 id="sub_4">AWS Aurora and RDS with Thundra</h2>
<p>Thundra provides deep insights into the microservice applications. Todays’ distributed applications are developed and served on the cloud, and modern tools like Thundra enable developers to trace their apps and debug the code easily. Thundra instruments in a plug and play fashion and automatically traces the requests made to Aurora and RDS databases. You can understand what the query is and the duration of the query made to the database. Thundra provides data privacy by enabling the users to mask their sensitive data inside the calls. <a href="https://blog.thundra.io/which-database-should-i-choose-for-my-serverless-applications" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Check this blog post</a> where we discuss which database to choose for cloud applications.</p></span>

<h2>Reverse Engineering The Great Escape</h2>

<p><dfn>The Great Escape</dfn> is a classic 1986 prison break game for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">48K ZX Spectrum</a>.

<hr>

<p>Email is a powerful tool that is an inextricable part of everyone’s lives.
Despite countless valiant efforts to kill it and replace it with something
better, email continues to live on in more or less the same form it has had
since the 1990s. Technology that endures this long deserves a fair amount of
attention and praise.</p>

<p>There are two main reasons why email continues to be useful today. It is simple
to use, and it is not owned or controlled by a single company. Every attempted
replacement has failed at excelling in either one or both of those qualities.
Simple tools can often be extended in ways that the original authors never could
have imagined in the beginning. And because users are in control of the core
functionality, new use cases can be explored completely independently.</p>

<p>Computer users have a tendency to over-generalize when solving problems. In
other words, when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. In
this post, we are going to be looking at a lot of nails that can probably be
hammered down with email. At a fundamental level, email clients are tools
designed for storing and retrieving sequences of messages which can contain
arbitrary data. Looking at it this way, it is not difficult to imagine a variety
of use cases that can be accomplished with minimal amounts of scripting.</p>

<p>I do seriously think that email is a solid tool for a lot of these purposes, and
in fact use it as such for a few of these purposes every day. However, the main
purpose of this post is exploration, not general advice.</p>

<h2 id="to-do-list-one-that-you-actually-check">To-Do List (One That You Actually Check)</h2>

<p><img src="http://zanneth.com/assets/post-assets/email/todo-list.png" alt="To-Do List"></p>

<p>The first use case is pretty obvious, and it is one that likely a large number of
people already employ on a daily basis.</p>

<p>By far the single most important productivity discovery that I made in my life
is <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/01/04/email-dmz">Inbox Zero</a>. Inbox Zero is
the simple idea that your email inbox should contain only a list of messages
that require some sort of action. Once the action associated with those messages
is completed, the message is archived or moved to a different folder. I have
been using Inbox Zero for years now and I rarely forget to do anything
important after integrating it into my life.</p>

<p>Need to remember to pack for your flight next week? You probably already got a
confirmation about your reservation in your email. Leave it in your inbox until
you are finished preparing for your trip, and archive it when you are done.</p>

<p>How about one-off reminders that are not associated with messages already in
your inbox? Just send an email to yourself with the action item in the subject
line. Use the body of the message to write down any notes you want, and reply to
the message to keep a record of additional notes if you need them.</p>

<p>What about periodic reminders that repeat on some interval, like reminding
yourself to pay a bill on time every month? Write a simple script that sends you
an email about it and schedule it to run once a month. At the end of each month,
you will have a new to-do item in your inbox with an actionable task in the
subject line.</p>

<p>The great part about using email as a to-do list is that you are already
checking it with some degree of regularity. Smartphone apps or web-based to-do
lists quickly lose their value the moment users lose interest or switch to using
something else. They also frequently become buggy or overburdened with features
that don’t add any value. This will never be a problem with email because you
can always use your favorite client as long as it continues to work with the
standard protocols. Syncing across multiple devices is a given, since your email
is already doing this.</p>

<h2 id="news-reader">News Reader</h2>

<p><img src="http://zanneth.com/assets/post-assets/email/rss2email.png" alt="RSS"></p>

<p>RSS is a really elegant and simple way to subscribe to a feed of updates from
your favorite websites. Since the early 2000s, RSS has been integrated into a
lot of different services all across the net, and serves as the foundation for a
variety of different web-based content platforms such as podcasts.</p>

<p>In order to actually use RSS, you need a client that is capable of aggregating
entries from multiple different feeds and displaying them in some manner.
Managing a list of entries, tracking read or unread state, and displaying HTML
content is exactly what every email client is already good at doing.</p>

<p>I like using <a href="https://github.com/rss2email/rss2email">rss2email</a> for this.
rss2email delivers stories from my feeds into a special mailbox on my email
server that I check approximately every morning. Since the end result is just
IMAP messages stored on my email server, I can read them using my favorite
email client on whatever device I happen to be using that day.</p>



<p><img src="http://zanneth.com/assets/post-assets/email/update-blog.png" alt="Updating a Blog"></p>

<p>Setting up a frictionless workflow for updating your personal website can be
rather difficult, especially if you want to be able to do it while on-the-go and
away from your usual workstation.</p>

<p>If you are maintaining a blog on a personal website or for a business, the focus
should primarily be on the content itself and not on writing markup, updating a
source control repository, or publishing static content to a file server or
database. At the end of the day, you want to be able to write your content in a
message and send it to your server to publish.</p>

<p>Writing rich-text or plain-text content, saving drafts, and publishing that
content to a server is the perfect job for an email client. Your email client
can even allow including inline images sent as attachments, or links that point
to other websites. Once you are done writing your post, send it to a special
email address that activates a script on the other end to convert your email
message into a blog post. <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x135.html">PGP</a>
can be used by both the client and the server to ensure that it is actually you
who is authoring the blog post and not someone else. Forget about OAuth or
anything more complicated than that.</p>

<p>Social media feeds can be updated in a similar manner. All of your server-side
functionality can be multiplexed using different email addresses for each
service. For example, you can use <code>blog@mydomain.com</code> to send updates to your
blog, and <code>mastodon@mydomain.com</code> to publish toots on your
<a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> account. Writing the code for this is a
breeze, since your favorite programming language already has libraries for
dealing with SMTP and IMAP.</p>

<h2 id="a-user-interface-to-a-search-engine-or-database">A User Interface to a Search Engine or Database</h2>

<p>It’s pretty simple to build an API for a web service these days. However,
choosing the right library or designing the right API can sometimes be an
unnecessary burden when working on a personal project that only has one or two
users.</p>

<p>Email can be used as an interface between a user and a web service when the
input and output are simple enough.</p>

<p>For example, imagine that you have a file server with a large amount of photos
stored on it and you want to be able to search those photos and retrieve them at
random. The server could use machine learning libraries such as Tensorflow to
categorize the photos and attach metadata on them.</p>

<p>Instead of building a custom web-based user interface for this, you could use
email instead. The user sends an email with the search term in the subject line,
such as “pizza”, to a special email address that corresponds to the file server
containing the photos. Just like in the previous example, PGP or S-MIME can be
used as an authentication mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can
access the photos being requested. Once the server has collected a search
result, it replies to the query email with matching photos attached as MIME
parts. The email server keeps a record of previous queries, along with their
returned results as replies, in an easily displayable and searchable format.</p>

<h2 id="the-only-limit-is-your-imagination">The Only Limit is Your Imagination</h2>

<p>Connecting email accounts to small shell scripts is a simple but powerful
concept that can unlock a wide variety of different applications. You can build
these apps with the comforting knowledge that they are all based on federated
and robust protocols used by hundreds of different email clients which have
stood the test of time.</p>

<p>Using the rich text editing features of your email client, combined with a
hierarchical organization system based on folders, allows you to do a lot of
tasks that have previously been accomplished using buggy and monolithic tools.
Privacy and security issues that plague web-based tools can be effectively
avoided when using email, because you are in control of both the client and
the server. You also get syncing to multiple devices for free, since IMAP was
designed to facilitate managing email from multiple clients at once since the
beginning.</p>

<p>I’m always interested in learning about new uses of email. If you know about
some of these yourself, send me an email about them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">






<p> In an announcement that has stunned the computer industry, Ken
Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan admitted that the Unix
operating system and C programming language created by them is an
elaborate prank kept alive for over 20 years. Speaking at the recent
UnixWorld Software Development Forum, Thompson revealed the following:</p>

<p> "In 1969, AT&amp;T had just terminated their work with the
GE/Honeywell/AT&amp;T Multics project. Brian and I had started work with an
early release of Pascal from Professor Niklaus Wirth's ETH Labs in
Switzerland and we were impressed with its elegant simplicity and power.
Dennis had just finished reading 'Bored of the Rings', a National Lampoon
parody of the Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. As a lark, we decided
to do parodies of the Multics environment and Pascal. Dennis and I were
responsible for the operating environment. We looked at Multics and
designed the new OS to be as complex and cryptic as possible to maximize
casual users' frustration levels, calling it Unix as a parody of Multics,
as well as other more risque! allusions. We sold the terse command
language to novitiates by telling them that it saved them typing.  </p>

<p> Then Dennis and Brian worked on a warped version of Pascal, called
'A'.  'A' looked a lot like Pascal, but elevated the notion of the direct
memory address (which Wirth had banished) to the central concept of the
"pointer" as an innocuous sounding name for a truly malevolent construct.
Brian must be credited with the idea of having absolutely no standard I/O
specification: this ensured that at least 50% of the typical commercial
program would have to be re-coded when changing hardware platforms.  </p>

<p> Brian was also responsible for pitching this lack of I/O as a feature: 
it allowed us to describe the language as "truly portable". When we found
others were actually creating real programs with A, we removed compulsory
type-checking on function arguments. Later, we added a notion we called
"casting": this allowed the programmer to treat an integer as though it
were a 50kb user-defined structure. When we found that some programmers
were simply not using pointers, we eliminated the ability to pass
structures to functions, enforcing their use in even the simplest
applications. We sold this, and many other features, as enhancements to
the efficiency of the language. In this way, our prank evolved into B,
BCPL, and finally C.  </p>

<p> We stopped when we got a clean compile on the following syntax: 
<code>for(;P("\n"),R-;P("|"))for(e=C;e-;P("_"+(*u++/8)%2))P("|
"+(*u/4)%2);  </code>

</p><p> At one time, we joked about selling this to the Soviets to set their
computer science progress back 20 or more years.  </p>

<p> Unfortunately, AT&amp;T and other US corporations actually began using
Unix and C. We decided we'd better keep mum, assuming it was just a
passing phase. In fact, it's taken US companies over 20 years to develop
enough expertise to generate useful applications using this 1960's
technological parody. We are impressed with the tenacity of the general
Unix and C programmer. In fact, Brian, Dennis and I have never ourselves
attempted to write a commercial application in this environment.  </p>

<p> We feel really guilty about the chaos, confusion and truly awesome
programming projects that have resulted from our silly prank so long ago." 
</p>

<p> Dennis Ritchie said: "What really tore it (just when ADA was catching
on), was that Bjarne Stroustrup caught onto our joke. He extended it to
further parody Smalltalk. Like us, he was caught by surprise when nobody
laughed. So he added multiple inheritance, virtual base classes, and later
...templates. All to no avail. So we now have compilers that can compile
100,000 lines per second, but need to process header files for 25 minutes
before they get to the meat of "Hello, World".  </p>

<p> Major Unix and C vendors and customers, including AT&amp;T, Microsoft,
Hewlett-Packard, GTE, NCR, and DEC have refused comment at this time. 
</p>

<p> Borland International, a leading vendor of object-oriented tools,
including the popular Turbo Pascal and Borland C++, stated they had
suspected for Windows was originally written in C++. Philippe Kahn said:
"After two and a half years programming, and massive programmer burn-outs,
we re-coded the whole thing in Turbo Pascal in three months. I think it's
fair to say that Turbo Pascal saved our bacon". Another Borland spokesman
said that they would continue to enhance their Pascal products and halt
further efforts to develop C/C++.  </p>

<p> Professor Wirth of the ETH Institute and father of the Pascal, Modula
2, and Oberon structured languages, cryptically said "P.T. Barnum was
right." He had no further comments.  </p>

January 13, 2021 | https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2021/01/08/the-neural-network-of-the-stockfish-chess-engine/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2021/01/08/the-neural-network-of-the-stockfish-chess-engine/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>Last time, we <a href="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2020/12/13/shallow-trees-with-heavy-leaves/">briefly mentioned</a> the high-level differences between Stockfish and Leela Chess.</p>
<p>To recap, Stockfish evaluates about 100 million positions per second using rudimentary heuristics, whereas Leela Chess evaluates 40 000 positions per second using a deep neural network trained from millions of games of self-play. They also use different tree search approaches: Stockfish uses a variant of alpha-beta pruning, whereas Leela Chess uses Monte Carlo tree search.</p>
<p>An important recent change to Stockfish was to introduce a neural network to evaluate the positions in the search tree, instead of just relying on hardcoded heuristics. It’s still much simpler than Leela Chess’s neural network, and only slows down Stockfish to exploring 50 million positions per second.</p>
<p>The real cleverness of Stockfish’s neural network is that it’s an <strong>efficiently-updatable neural network (NNUE)</strong>. Specifically, it’s a simple feedforward network with:</p>
<ul>
<li>a large (10.5M parameters!) input layer, illustrated below, that can utilise two different levels of sparsity for computational efficiency;</li>
<li>three much smaller layers (with 17.5k parameters in total) which are evaluated densely using vector instructions;</li>
<li>a single scalar output to give a numerical score for the position, indicating how favourable it is for the player about to move.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything is done using integer arithmetic, with 16-bit weights in the first layer and 8-bit weights in the remaining layers.</p>
<h3>The input layer</h3>
<p>Let’s begin by studying the first — and most interesting — layer. Here’s an illustration I made using Wolfram Mathematica:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial.png" alt="" width="640" height="760" srcset="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial.png 640w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial-253x300.png 253w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p>The inputs to the layer are two sparse binary arrays, each consisting of 41024 elements. It may seem highly redundant to encode a chess position using 82048 binary features, but this is similar to <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/06/wide-deep-learning-better-together-with.html">an approach</a> (called ‘feature crosses’) used in recommender systems.</p>
<p>What are the two sparse binary arrays, and why do they have 41024 features? My preferred way of interpreting these two arrays are as the ‘worldviews’ of the white king and the black king. In particular, the differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coordinate systems:</strong> because black and white pawns move in opposite directions, the two players need to ‘see the board from opposite angles’. This already happens in regular (human) chess because the two players are seated opposite each other at the chessboard, so one player’s ‘top’ is the other player’s ‘bottom’. If you imagine each player numbering the squares from top to bottom, left to right, then any physical square would be called <em>n</em> by one player and 63 − <em>n</em> by the other player.</li>
<li><strong>Piece types:</strong> instead of viewing the pieces as black or white, a player sees it as either ‘mine’ or ‘theirs’. The 10 non-king piece types are thus {my pawn, their pawn, my knight, their knight, my bishop, their bishop, my rook, their rook, my queen, their queen}.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for these ‘player-relative coordinate systems’ is that it means that Stockfish can use the same neural network irrespective of whether it’s playing as white or black. The network uses <em>both</em> your king’s worldview and your enemy king’s worldview for evaluating a position, because they’re both highly relevant (you want to protect your own king and capture your enemy’s king).</p>
<p>So, why does each worldview have 41024 features? It can be seen as an outer product (or tensor product) of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a 64-element feature encoding the position of the king whose worldview this is, in their own coordinate system. This is ‘one-hot encoding’, where exactly one of the 64 entries is ‘1’ and the other 63 entries are ‘0’.</li>
<li>a 641-element feature encoding, for each of the 64 × 10 ordered pairs (square, piece-type), whether or not that square is occupied by that piece. The 641st element is unused, and is (according to the <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish_NNUE">Chess Programming Wiki</a>) apparently a result of the network being ported from Shogi to chess.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the two 64-by-641 outer product matrices* is then flattened (the matrix is ‘reshaped’ into a vector with the same entries) to yield the corresponding 41024-element ‘sparse worldview’. In the input layer, each of the two 41024-element sparse worldviews are then affinely transformed to form a 256-element ‘dense worldview’.</p>
<p><strong>*Important note:</strong> the 41024-element sparse binary arrays are never explicitly materialised, either as a 64-by-641 matrix or as a 41024-element vector. The Stockfish NNUE effectively ‘fuses’ the construction of these sparse vectors with the subsequent affine transformation (described below), updating the 256-element dense worldviews directly when the configuration of pieces on the chessboard is modified.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two levels of sparsity</strong> which are utilised when computing this affine transformation from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B41024%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{R}^{41024}" title="\mathbb{R}^{41024}"> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B256%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{R}^{256}" title="\mathbb{R}^{256}">, allowing the network to be efficiently evaluated many times in a tree search:</p>
<ul>
<li>the 41024-element implicit vectors are themselves sparse: the number of nonzero elements is equal to the number of non-king pieces on the board.</li>
<li>moving a piece typically changes very few of the entries of the vector: if it’s a regular non-king move, only 2 entries change; if it’s a non-king move with capture, then 3 entries change.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s this second aspect which warrants the name ‘efficiently updatable’: when a move is made (or unmade, since we’re doing a tree search), we only need to add/subtract a few 256-element matrix columns from the resulting ‘dense worldview’ to update it.</p>
<p>Unless a king is moved, this (2 or 3 vector additions/subtractions) beats summing all of the matrix columns corresponding to nonzero entries (up to 30 vector additions), which in turn unconditionally beats doing a regular dense matrix-vector multiplication (41024 vector additions). That is to say, the second-level sparsity is about 10 times more efficient than the first-level sparsity, which is in turn about 1000 times more efficient than naively doing a dense matrix-vector multiplication.</p>
<p>The two dense worldviews are concatenated according to which player is about to move, producing a 512-element vector, which is elementwise clamped to [0, 127]. This elementwise clamping is the nonlinear activation function of the input layer, and (as we’ll describe) the hidden layers use a similar activation function. We can think of this as a ‘clipped ReLU’, which is <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/src/nnue/layers/clipped_relu.h">exactly what the Stockfish source code calls it</a>.</p>
<h3>The remaining layers</h3>
<p>The two hidden layers each use 8-bit weights and 32-bit biases. The activation function first divides the resulting 32-bit integer by 64 before again clamping to [0, 127], ready to be fed into the next layer. The output layer also uses 8-bit weights and 32-bit biases, but with no nonlinear activation function.</p>
<p>The first hidden layer takes 512 inputs (the clamped concatenated worldviews) and produces 32 outputs. The second hidden layer takes those 32 values as inputs, and again produces 32 outputs. The output layer takes those 32 values as inputs, and produces a single scalar output.</p>
<p>Since these subsequent layers are applied to dense vectors, they can’t use the same ‘efficiently updatable’ approach as the input layer; that’s why they’re necessarily substantially smaller. They can, however, use hardware vectorisation instructions (SSE/AVX) to apply the linear transformation and activation function.</p>
<p>This scalar output is then <a href="http://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=75506&amp;start=9">further postprocessed</a> using other Stockfish heuristics, including taking into account the 50-move rule which isn’t otherwise incorporated into the evaluation function.</p>
<p>Observe that the neural network doesn’t actually have complete information, such as whether a pawn has just moved two squares (relevant to <em>en passant</em>), whether a king is able to castle, and various other information pertaining to the rather complicated rules for determining a draw. This is okay: the network is only being used as a cheap approximate evaluation for a position; when deciding what move to make, Stockfish performs a very deep tree search and only uses this approximate evaluation in the leaves.</p>
<p>Equivalently, you can think of this as being a massive refinement of the approach of ‘look a few moves ahead and see whether either player gains a material or positional advantage’, using a neural network as a much more sophisticated position-aware alternative of crudely ‘counting material’.</p>
<p>This is a neural network, so the weight matrices and bias vectors of the layers were learned by training the network on millions of positions and using backpropagation and a gradient-based optimiser. Of course, for supervised learning, you need a ‘ground truth’ for the network to attempt to learn, which seems somewhat circular: how do you even gather training data? The answer is that you use the classical version of Stockfish to evaluate positions <strong>using the deep tree search</strong>, and use that as your training data.</p>
<p>In theory, you could then train another copy of the NNUE using the NNUE-enhanced Stockfish as the evaluation function, and then iterate this process. Leela Chess does the same thing: its current network is trained on positions evaluated by using deep lookahead with the previous network as the leaf evaluation function. Note that the construction of the training data is orders of magnitude more expensive than training the network with this data, as you’re doing thousands of evaluations of the previous network (owing to the deep tree search) to construct each item of training data for the new network.</p>
<h3>Further reading</h3>
<p>The network is <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish_NNUE">described and illustrated</a> on the Chess Programming Wiki, which also has tonnes of references to forum discussions and other references. The first description of an NNUE was a Japanese paper by Yu Nasu (who suggested it for the board game Shogi instead of chess); the paper has <a href="https://github.com/asdfjkl/nnue">since been translated</a> into English and German. There’s also the Stockfish source code, which is very well organised (there’s <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/tree/master/src/nnue">a directory</a> for the NNUE) and clearly written.</p>

<p>This is a video of The Action Lab’s James Orgill painting the entire interior of a room he made out of insulation board with the world’s blackest commercially available paint, Musou black, which absorbs 99.4% of light. He then turns on an overhead light bulb to see what it looks like inside. It looks…weird. My eyes did not like that. Of course my eyes don’t like much besides being closed and napping if we’re being perfectly honest. Although occasionally they do request I push on them really hard with the fleshy parts of my palms below the thumbs until I get a headache and see all sorts of painful colors and patterns, but that’s rare. </p>
<p>Keep going for the video, the reveal and experimenting begins at 3:30.</p>

        <p id="6595f0c7-f94b-4772-8c12-22b107c82c47">End-user databases are all the buzz these days — Notion, Airtable, Coda, Roam, etc. These products have made it possible for people to model information in a way that feels more natural and intuitive to the way we experience it in our daily lives.</p>
        <p id="69014b56-b04f-4baf-be70-2c0ba0ad30e9">I love building products like Notion, but building these kinds of products is hard. For two reasons:</p>
        <ol id="3c07bc59-4c8a-4b48-bdb0-1bf930336c2e" start="1">
          <li>Most people don't have the technical literacy about databases and information architecture to actually automate and organize their lives with these tools.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol id="d5625fcf-2e32-45ce-acc4-d73e1d38d037" start="2">
          <li>The databases we have today aren't well-suited for dynamic user-generated filters and sorts.</li>
        </ol>
        <p id="aa0edb68-c072-4214-acf9-8e6e243900dd">This second challenge is more technical and I will hide all of these programmer-related details behind a toggle so you don't have to read them if you'd like.</p>
        <ul id="33a92bec-cc3c-4881-9fda-d91198d3ffee">
          <li>
            <details>
              <summary>🤖 Technical Details</summary>
              <p id="64d9a82d-8237-4a9f-b83f-eb9eae786157">Underneath any end-user database is <em>another</em> database and so much complexity arises from the challenge of building a database inside a database. Solutions to this problem vary widely and make some sort of trade-off between scalability (performance) and complexity.</p>
              <p id="9dd2cc1a-1eb6-4af8-9c22-d486c3e9dc99">Some applications load the entire end-user database in-memory. This creates long initial load times, but really performant interactions once the application loads. There are obvious scalability issues with this approach, but it is fairly simple to implement.</p>
              <p id="e10696df-1d8a-47ff-9365-701d9ff58d00">Other applications resort to O(n) scans on the server to fetch data and filter/sort records in memory with a few caching and indexing optimizations when convenient. The problem here is that users can create their own columns and filters dynamically. If your cloud application is backed by a SQL database, for example, it’s worrisome to allow users to edit the database schema and create an unbounded number of tables and indexes. Thus, you must resort to filtering records in-memory.</p>
              <p id="30d92414-92a1-4469-99ba-643219826c94">If you're dedicated to O(log n) queries, you'll need to build indexes yourself (unless there's some amazing database I am unaware of). On every write, you can compute what indexes need to be updated and you write to a NoSQL database to incrementally update a cached query result. This can lead to a good solution, but it comes at the cost of consistency. Now that you're building your own indexes outside of the database, writes are no longer transactional and you lose the guarantee of being able to read your own write.</p>
              <p id="c04b352e-bd9a-44ad-ba88-17ac5cc502ff">Another solution is to have a separate database for every user and allow users to edit the schema of their own isolated database. This allows writes to be transactional, but creates other kinds of collision problems (i.e. dealing with merge conflict) when you want users to be able to collaborate. With separate databases for each user, you're also doing a lot more computing labor, especially if the same records are shared amongst many people.</p>
              <p id="7c45a3a9-7051-4386-a53f-d246c9ba7310">Long story short, existing databases are not great for building end-user databases.</p>
              
            </details>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p id="f41a9378-fc1b-4ea2-a13a-cb918178cff3">I plan to address this first reason by giving you a mental model of what databases are and a first-principles understanding of how they work.</p>
        <p id="1d0ea7ea-6760-43cc-a728-4b3a1d7efe3b">I'll introduce databases as an abstract concept and then we'll work through a real-world example to explore how databases leverage sorting and filters to lookup information quickly.</p>
        <p id="088e64ab-1cbd-49c2-85e5-ac16a93efcfa">By the end, I hope to show you how these information architecture concepts are immensely powerful and totally approachable for non-technical people. </p>
        <p id="69cf1cd2-0e55-4a55-8d70-a407a8cba1e3">Lastly, I want to convince you that software based on these concepts will be far superior to anything we use today for end-user database applications. If these concepts are interesting to you, <a target="_blank" href="mailto:ccorcos@gmail.com">please reach out</a>! I love sharing ideas. 😁</p>

        <p id="437c4e5d-072f-4e2c-a690-f23c26fa06f4">Databases don't have to be so complicated. If you strip away all the fancy semantics, you end up with something simple and familiar.</p>

Databases are no different, they're also containers of sorted information.</p>

        <p id="2238e190-e73f-43c3-96d3-44daa545e966">Alphabetical, numerical, compound, lexicographical Encodings.</p>
        <p id="e4db1ca2-03e3-4767-883b-83b12f484fd6">The simplest way to sort something is alphabetically (a.k.a <em>lexicographically</em>) and this is how words are sorted in the dictionary. But we often find ourselves sorting by more than one property. For example, a contact list is often sorted by last name, <em>then</em> first name. This is called a <strong>compound sort</strong>. </p>
        
        <p id="3f686c5c-6eed-4ad6-8eb3-73168fa60be6">For example, notice that "Thomas Robins" should come before "Charlie Robinson" when sorting this way and that a compound sort is fundamentally different from simply joining the words together and then sorting.</p><pre id="82947e67-674e-4edd-8b12-6d7a800dee7a"><code>// Compound Sort: Last, First

        <p id="c545d059-b2b0-4678-8fd4-40aa6d7bdafd">We do this kind of compound sorting all over the place. Dates, in particular, are compound sorted by year, <em>then</em> month, <em>then</em> day.</p><pre id="cc0fb85d-ab5f-4e44-8947-0a504713b758"><code>January 10, 2019

        <p id="ef7175d9-a258-4f95-afe7-0ce9b274df54">Notice that this kind of sorting isn't exactly alphabetical. The months in a year are definitely not sorted alphabetically — each month has an underlying order within a year. Even days of the month aren't alphabetically sorted — they're numerically sorted.</p>
        
        <p id="9d475882-2657-4dc0-a0d4-7e8456c1a201">Numerical sorting is different from alphabetical sorting because alphabetical sorting compares letter-by-letter. For example, if we sorted numbers alphabetically, then 10 would come before 2 because the first digit "1" is before "2".</p><pre id="e4876df9-d390-4c6e-b0a8-c3201a7e43fa"><code>// Alphabetical Sort

// Numerical sort

        <p id="934e9af4-eb81-43ab-8dd1-9d973c87eb93">A simple way to represent numbers in a way that can be sorted alphabetically is to put zeros at the beginning of the number. This works well for small numbers with a known maximum size such as the months in a year. </p><pre id="245e5864-d979-4b11-944c-eb6a46ade312"><code>// Zero-padded numbers representing months in a year.

        <p id="becf436f-03a3-4bad-a0f7-519f75156d75">And in fact, we can represent dates in a way that can be sorted alphabetically using <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 date format</a>. </p><pre id="6c4b1b11-3f63-4789-b0d5-4e0145fc9750"><code>2019-01-10

        <p id="82017443-040f-4acf-9810-23cd870f9c5e">Representing dates this way is convenient because it doesn't require domain knowledge to understand how to sort them. There are an infinite number of things that can be sorted arbitrarily: a deck of cards, the status of a project, your rock collection—they are all just different types of things.</p>
        <p id="7ddb731a-5ae6-4745-8134-9dc166ec26f4">In general, lexicographical encodings are important because they allow databases to store arbitrary information in the correct order without needing additional knowledge about the type of information that is being sorted.</p>
        
        <ul id="9983c3de-f661-4eb5-82a0-54f7af61c590">

              <p id="5339e8c2-5d28-41fe-8f64-fca7f3df92c3">You've probably experienced frustration with this when looking at files in your filesystem. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order">Natural sort</a> solves this problem elegantly by representing both alphabetical and numerical sort at the same time.</p>
              <p id="22c8cbba-c26b-4fb1-8f46-f50abce95449">Representing numbers as lexicographically sortable is another interesting challenge, particularly very large and very small numbers. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ealmansi/elen/blob/master/resources/elen.pdf">Elen</a> is an interesting approach for encoding floating precision numbers.</p>
              <p id="31067abe-ad6c-4491-b84a-825c02101577">Tuples can be represented as compound sortable by separating each item with null-byte (and escaping null-bytes inside each item).</p>
              <p id="5003f170-c3f9-4e52-a674-1018970c3f16"><a target="_blank" href="https://observablehq.com/@dgreensp/implementing-fractional-indexing">Fractional sorting</a> is a very related and interesting topic as well.</p>

        <p id="e0f0bb9b-fa2a-4b90-9201-a13005754346">You can think of databases much in the same way you think of system filing cabinets. To explore this analogy further, let's imagine that you are in charge of administering a police department where you keep track of a variety of information about every police officer in your region — name, badge number, address, and precinct, among other details.</p>
        
        <p id="60068181-62be-45e4-979e-b7a04b4d0ed9">As the administrator of this information, you're responsible for making sure that everything is up to date and easily accessible.</p>
        
        <p id="244c9ed1-6e90-4a3b-a370-59fa67d0cd5f">To keep things simple, you start by keeping all officer information in a filing cabinet sorted by badge number. This makes it easy to retrieve information about any officer based on their badge number, for example when an officer gets promoted or moves to a new address.</p>
        
        <figure id="7b5ff822-3bb7-4db6-b9a1-3872565c69bb"><img src="https://ccorcos.github.io/filing-cabinets/assets/Filing_cabinets_8.png">

        <h2 id="c78d6501-da7f-4633-b2e4-4a429cfd0008">Read/Write Trade-off</h2>
        <p id="e6dfff08-0cd8-4af5-96b2-448a8a05302c">How we copy information into other cabinets.</p>
        <p id="47066dd1-5373-4fac-8a18-0a29a5703390">One day, the police chief asks you for the address of every officer in the 60th precinct.</p>
        <p id="46c18841-1de6-4cd9-a084-cb39b033b939">With all of this information in a single filing cabinet sorted by badge number, this is a painful request because you have to scan through every file and check if each officer is in the 60th precinct.</p>
        <p id="9fb77909-54eb-4ecb-9059-10642f19e8f1">Maybe this is just a one-time request so you can labor over it and be done with it, but the police chief says that every month he wants to mail a bonus check to every officer in the precinct with the most arrests. If you're going to have to do this every month, maybe it's worthwhile to make this job a bit faster.</p>
        
        <p id="da5b845b-2a98-48f0-a688-857dd844a990">To solve this problem, you create another filing cabinet where you sort all officers by precinct. To keep things simple, you photocopy all of the information in the <em>Badge #</em> cabinet over to the <em>Precinct</em> cabinet. Now when the chief asks you to get the address of every officer in a precinct, you can use this new filing cabinet to quickly retrieve …</p></div></div>

January 12, 2021 | https://www.onefinance.com/welcome-simple-users-were-answering-faqs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.onefinance.com/welcome-simple-users-were-answering-faqs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>^ One is not affiliated with Simple in any way.</p><p>With the recent Simple closing news, many users were left scrambling to look for a new home. You aren’t stranded or alone; we’re here to welcome you all to One! There have been many questions and requests coming into One, so we gathered all the ones Simple users have asked the most.</p><h3>How does a Simple account compare to a One Pocket?</h3><p>At One, Pockets hold your money. When you create your One account your money will be stored in Pockets, similar to how they were organized at Simple.</p><p>When you first get started, you’ll have a few default Pockets. A Pocket for spending: Spend Pocket, another for savings: Save Pocket and you’ll have a special Pocket to automatically save: Auto-Save Pocket. <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/features/#autosave">The Auto-Save Pocket</a> will need to be toggled “on” but it’s there, ready to be used.</p><p>Easily create free and unlimited Pockets around your life and your people. There’s no limit to how many Pockets you can create in your <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/features/">One account</a>. Each pocket has its own account and routing number, so you can transfer funds directly in and out of Pockets from external sources (example: to pay bills).&nbsp; You can also share individual Pockets with other One users. You’ll also have the flexibility to choose which Pocket is debited when you use your One card by assigning your card to it in the One app. Adjust what Pocket your card points to at any time!</p><p>P.S. We’re actively working on new upgrades to One that will include enhanced features similar to Simple’s Safe-to-Spend and Expenses and Goals.</p><h3>Does One connect to Mint?</h3><p>At the moment, One is not available with Mint but is available on any budgeting tool that utilizes the Plaid exchange network.</p><h3>When will Mint add One?</h3><p>Mint prioritizes what financial institutions to add based on user demand. If you’d like to see One work with Mint, please follow below for a step-by-step guide on how to request it directly with the Mint team.</p><p>Mint users can request One to be added by:</p><ol><li>Logging into your Mint account through their desktop website. The app does not support requesting a new bank.</li><li>Click “+ Add Accounts” button on the top navigation bar.</li><li>Type in a few random letters (typing “One Finance” here will result in hundreds of incorrect results).</li><li>Click “Request support for your bank” button.</li><li>Type “One Finance” in the Bank name field.</li><li>Copy and paste our website URL into the bank web address field: <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/">https://www.onefinance.com</a></li><li>That’s it!</li></ol><p>We appreciate your support and hope to move up in the line fast if enough requests for One come through!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="http://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets.png" alt="" width="5136" height="1401" srcset="https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets.png 5136w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-300x82.png 300w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-1024x279.png 1024w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-1536x419.png 1536w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-2048x559.png 2048w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog_Pockets-1600x436.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 5136px) 100vw, 5136px"></p><h3>Does One offer joint accounts?</h3><p>One offers something even better, Pocket sharing! You can create and share as many Pockets as you’d like with any One user(s). This feature helps you get hyper-organized with your finances especially with the ability to slice and dice your finances so you can control who and what Pocket you share. For example: partners can each have their own separate One account but share one or more Pockets with each other for shared expenses like rent, groceries, car payments etc. They’ll both be able to access only the funds within the Shared Pockets while their main One account funds stay separate. Ditch the constant requests for bill splitting and continually ping ponging money back and forth through another app.</p><h3>Can I move money between Pockets? How long does it take? Is there a limit to the amount of transfers?</h3><p>Yes! It’s easy to move money between Pockets under the “Move Money” tab in the One App. It’s instant, and there’s no limit to the amount of transfers that can be done between your Pockets.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="http://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1.png" alt="" width="4608" height="2836" srcset="https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1.png 4608w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-300x185.png 300w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-1024x630.png 1024w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-1536x945.png 1536w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-2048x1260.png 2048w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_Chart-1-1600x985.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 4608px) 100vw, 4608px"></p><h3>What does APY and APR mean? <b>Why does One have higher rates than other brands?</b></h3><p>The Annual Percentage Yield, or “APY”, is a percentage rate reflecting the total amount of interest paid to you on your account. Our APYs are based on the interest rates we offer and how often interest compounds (interest on the amounts you contribute plus any interest you have already earned).</p><p>The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the amount you pay each year to borrow money, including fees, expressed as a percentage.</p><p>One is able to offer higher rates because as a digital banking service we don’t have the traditional overhead that brick and mortar banks have. Instead of keeping the cost savings, we put it back into our product offerings, such as the 3.00% APY* One users enjoy in their Auto-Save Pocket, and the 1.00% APY* we provide on existing savings balances (up to $25k for our paycheck direct deposit customers). We’re able to maintain these industry-leading rates to our customers for two primary reasons. First, we focus on generating revenue through interchange (essentially card spending activity, which is driven by the expense that businesses pay to accept credit and debit cards) and fairly priced credit and lending, instead of fees like traditional banks. Second, our savings products are designed to help build, and rebuild, financial wellness, a big component of which is emergency savings and a cushion for unexpected expenses. For customers with very large existing savings balances looking for a place to park their money just to earn returns, we may not be the best option, and that is okay. We are focused on helping to improve and maintain financially healthy habits for our customers, while offering the most compelling and best priced spending, saving and credit options in the market.</p><h3>Can a One account receive a wire transfer?</h3><p>Yes! All One accounts can accept wire transfers but are not able to send wire transfers. One accounts can also receive international wire transfers. Please <a href="https://help.onefinance.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">contact</a> our team for additional information needed to accept an international transfer.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="http://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group.png" alt="" width="5136" height="2387" srcset="https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group.png 5136w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-300x139.png 300w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-1024x476.png 1024w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-1536x714.png 1536w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-2048x952.png 2048w, https://2o6253jh7du27jpe919btkc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-1600x744.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 5136px) 100vw, 5136px"></p><h2>Your feedback is our fuel | One updates coming soon</h2><p><span>There’s been a lot of great feedback from Simple users and we’re actively listening, combing through every post and working to update One. Our team is reprioritizing to make sure we fill in the biggest gaps first so our new friends from Simple can feel less anxiety and regain their financial peace of mind. Here’s a quick list of top requested updates (in no particular order) and how we’re approaching them:</span></p><h3>Recurring Transfers</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> High<br><strong>Status:</strong> Currently working on<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Shortly</p><p>You’ll recognize this feature as “funding schedule.” It’s automating the funding of expenses and goals. We completely agree this is a feature One needs STAT. Manually allocating funds whenever new money lands in your One account is not fun.</p><p>Right now, you can allocate up to 10% of your <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/direct-deposit/">paycheck direct deposit</a> (up to $1,000/month) to automatically deposit into your Auto-Save Pocket. You’ll earn 3.00% APY* in the Auto-Save Pocket.</p><p>Our team imagines that an early version of the recurring transfers feature will allow a user to set similar rules for what money ends up in which created Pocket. Example: $100 to Grocery Pocket on the 3rd of every month.</p><h3>Virtual Cards For Every Pocket</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> Medium<br><strong>Status:</strong> In queue<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Launch first pass in Q1</p><p>This feature will help One users who have a very tight management around their recurring expenses. You’ll be able to set up dedicated Pockets, each with a unique virtual card number to pay these recurring bills. Example: a dedicated card to pay for your “Streaming TV” Pocket bill only. We’re also planning to support these cards later in Apple Wallet and Google Wallet to make spending even easier.</p><h3>Configurable Overdraft</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> Medium<br><strong>Status:</strong> Currently working on<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Launching Q1</p><p>Currently, the only Pocket that has overdraft protection is the default Spend Pocket. This Pocket comes with a built-in <a href="https://www.onefinance.com/features/#creditLine">Credit Line</a> in case your account dips below zip. We’re currently working on allowing any created Pocket to be auto-filled by available funds in the Spend Pocket when funds aren’t available to fill the transaction in the other Pocket. This update will take a lot of guesswork out of bill payments, including payments that have different amounts each month.</p><h3>MFA/2FA</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> Medium<br><strong>Status:</strong> Currently working on<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Shortly</p><p>We recognize that multi-factor authentication is an important security feature and are actively working to get this up and running.</p><h3>Remote Check Deposit</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> High<br><strong>Status:</strong> Currently working on<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Launch in February</p><p>Grandparents send checks, the landlord still wants a check, work pays you with a check…love them or hate them checks are still a part of daily banking. The ability to deposit checks with your mobile device is in the works.</p><h3>Mail A Check</h3><p><strong>Request Level:</strong> Medium<br><strong>Status:</strong> In queue<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Coming soon!</p><p>We will soon support the ability to “cut a check” all within the One app. Users will be able to fill in the details and we’ll handle the printing and mailing of the physical check, free of charge! This feature will be in lieu of traditional paper checkbooks. Let’s be honest, those thick books just collect dust in a drawer and only have 1 or 2 taken out anyway.</p><p>We’re excited to bring these features to life, and know they’ll be a huge step towards getting you back to the kind of stress-free workflows you worked so hard to fine-tune over the years with Simple. Thank you so much for all your feedback! We can’t stress this part enough…keep it coming! With your help, we can continue to constantly improve One.</p> </div></div>]]>

<p>Tim: Fair enough. So, I want to start at the beginning. What is Stoicism?</p>
<p>Marcus: Stoicism is a philosophy of life. It is a way of looking at the world. It is about seeing clearly what is in front of us and feeling what is in our hearts. It is about doing what is right, no matter what the cost. It is about living according to nature and treating others with kindness and respect.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. So, what is the goal of Stoicism?</p>
<p>Marcus: The goal of Stoicism is to live a good life, a life in accordance with nature.</p>
<p>Tim: What does that mean?</p>
<p>Marcus: It means doing what we ought to do, not doing what we want to do. It means acting rationally, not emotionally.</p>
<p>Tim: Ok, so how do we do that?</p>
<p>Marcus: By paying attention to what is in our power and not worrying about the rest.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a great answer, but what does it mean?</p>
<p>Marcus: It means we have control over our actions, our judgments, and our feelings. It means we can choose how we respond to events outside of our control. It means we can choose what to think.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. So, how do you apply Stoicism to life?</p>
<p>Marcus: By facing the world with a smile and acting with justice, kindness, and honesty.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that too. So, can you give me an example?</p>
<p>Marcus: Sure. When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own—not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: These are obstructions.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a great passage. So, how do we deal with adversity?</p>
<p>Marcus: By recognizing that it is nothing more than what it is: a thing that can be endured.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s hard.</p>
<p>Marcus: It is, but it is also liberating.</p>
<p>Tim: How do you mean?</p>
<p>Marcus: The things that cause us suffering are those that are out of our control. Death, illness, poverty, dishonor, slander, and all such things. If you accept that they are fated to happen, they will lose their power over you.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a powerful idea. So, how do we deal with pain?</p>
<p>Marcus: The first step is recognizing that pain is an opinion, not a fact. The second is accepting that it can’t be changed. The third is being thankful that it isn’t worse.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a great way of putting it. So, what’s the best way to deal with other people?</p>
<p>Marcus: Be kind. Everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.</p>
<p>Tim: What about those who are unkind?</p>
<p>Marcus: They are like children, who are unkind not by choice but because they don’t know better.</p>
<p>Tim: How do we deal with external events that we can’t control?</p>
<p>Marcus: We accept that we have no control over them.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. I have a question. I’ve heard it said that Stoicism is a cold and emotionless philosophy.</p>
<p>Marcus: That’s not true. Stoics feel all the emotions—they just don’t allow those emotions to determine their behavior.</p>
<p>Tim: So, you’re saying that Stoics don’t repress their emotions?</p>
<p>Marcus: No. The Stoic does not indulge her emotions, but she feels them fully and completely.</p>
<p>Tim: What about death?</p>
<p>Marcus: Death is nothing to us. When we exist, death is not yet present. And when death is present, then we no longer exist. It doesn’t concern us at all.</p>
<p>Tim: That’s a great answer. So, can you sum up Stoicism for me?</p>
<p>Marcus: Sure. I can tell you that it is the art of living. It is about seeing clearly, doing good, and facing adversity. It is about accepting what cannot be changed and freeing yourself from the things that cause you suffering. It is about being strong and kind. It is about seeing the world as it is, not as you want it to be.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: I like that. For a small change of topic, there are a few questions I like to ask. As you may know I’m a huge fan of books and read dozens of them every year. What is the book (or books) you’ve given most as a gift, and why? Or what are one to three books that have greatly influenced your life?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I’m a big fan of biographies, especially those of the great philosophers and statesmen. I like to read about how others have dealt with adversity and challenges. I also love history books, especially those of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. What about books you’ve read recently that you would recommend?</p>
<p>Marcus: I’ve been reading The Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday. It’s about how to turn obstacles into advantages.</p>
<p>Tim: That sounds good. I’ll check it out. What about books that have greatly influenced your life?</p>
<p>Marcus: The Enchiridion by Epictetus.</p>
<p>Tim: I guess you like Roman philosophers. What about favorite quotes?</p>
<p>Marcus: I have many favorites.</p>
<p>Tim: Give me some.</p>
<p>Marcus: “It is difficult to fight against one’s natural impulses.”</p>
<p>“Accept life as it comes.”</p>
<p>“The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.”</p>
<p>“How much time he saves who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks.”</p>
<p>Tim: I like those. What about favorite movies or TV shows?</p>
<p>Marcus: I’m a big fan of many of the HBO series, such as Rome, The Sopranos, and Game of Thrones.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: What purchase of $100 or less has most positively impacted your life in the last six months (or in recent memory)? My readers love specifics like brand and model, where you found it, etc.</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I’m a big fan of the Moleskine notebooks. I just ordered the new “junior” version.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: How has a failure, or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Do you have a “favorite failure” of yours?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I failed at many things early in my life. I failed as a student, as an athlete, and as a politician. I failed as a husband and a father. But each failure taught me something about myself and the world. I learned from these failures and became a better man for it.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it — metaphorically speaking, getting a message out to millions or billions — what would it say and why? It could be a few words or a paragraph.</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: “You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”</p>
<p><strong>Tim: What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you’ve ever made? (Could be an investment of money, time, energy, etc.)</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: Travel. I’ve visited many countries and have learned much from others.</p>
<p><strong>Tim:What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I love to swim. I’ve done it every day for years.</p>
<p>Tim: What is the best advice you’ve ever received?</p>
<p>Marcus: I have no talent for drinking. I must therefore leave it alone.</p>
<p>Tim: I like that. So, what’s a personal habit that contributes to your success?</p>
<p>Marcus: I write in a journal every single day</p>
<p><strong>Tim: In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I’ve adopted a no-complaining policy. I used to complain all the time about everything. This doesn’t mean I don’t have complaints—it means I keep them to myself.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: What advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to enter the “real world”?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: Educate yourself. Read as much as you can. Surround yourself with people who are better than you. Don’t waste time on jealousy or resentment. Don’t let your emotions control you. Find a cause that is bigger than yourself and devote yourself to it.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: What are bad recommendations you hear in your profession or area of expertise?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: “Your gut doesn’t matter.” You must learn to trust your gut and use it to navigate the world.</p>
<p>“It’s too late for this.”</p>
<p>“You’re too old for that.”</p>
<p>“You’ll never be able to do that.”</p>
<p><strong>Tim: In the last five years, what have you become better at saying no to (distractions, invitations, etc.)? What new realizations and/or approaches helped? Any other tips?</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I’ve learned that it’s better to give a small amount of time to many people than a lot of time to a few people.</p>
<p><strong>Tim: When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, or have lost your focus temporarily, what do you do? (If helpful: What questions do you ask yourself?)</strong></p>
<p>Marcus: I take a break and do some exercise. Then, I get back to work.</p>
<p>Tim: If you were to start again, what would you do differently?</p>
<p>Marcus: I would have studied philosophy much earlier in life. It has changed everything for me.</p>
<p>Tim: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be? (There’s no right answer. I’m just curious.)</p>
<p>Marcus: I would like to be able to read other people’s minds. I’m pretty good at understanding what others are thinking, but I’d like to be able to read their thoughts directly.</p>
<p>Tim: One last question: What does success mean to you?</p>
<p>Marcus: Finding a purpose larger than yourself and devoting your life to it.</p>
<p>Tim: Thank you, Marcus, I really enjoyed this.</p>
<p>Marcus: It was a pleasure.</p>
<p>If you liked this conversation, I think you’ll like my book, Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers. In the book I deconstruct world-class performers’ routines and habits you can apply to your</p>

<p>Hello 👋&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know you like to use WhatsApp, I use WhatsApp as well. One of the most important things in WhatsApp that differentiates itself from other messaging apps like Viber, Messenger and Telegram is WhatsApp’s privacy.</p>
<p>WhatsApp chats are end-to-end encrypted. Which means once you hit the send button on your phone, WhatsApp scrambles the message so no one in the middle can read it, not even WhatsApp themselves can read what you send. Therefore called end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p>You get this feature as soon as you install and start using WhatsApp, while you need to enable end-to-end encryption on other chat apps that you use (Telegram, Messenger etc). So you are at risk of the app creator, your government reading your messages.</p>

<p><strong>However, starting&nbsp;from February 8th, WhatsApp is changing is policies, to loosen some of it’s privacy features because Facebook (the company that owns WhatsApp) plans to make money out of WhatsApp.<p>This including sharing your data with advertisers, companies, and businesses that might chat on WhatsApp.</p></strong></p>
<p>You might have already got this message asking you to agree to these new terms, and if you agree with it, you are agreeing to share your data with other companies.</p>

<p>Even though we are not sure whether WhatsApp or businesses can read your messages or not after the&nbsp;February 8th&nbsp;because the message is very vague, this update coming&nbsp;on February 8th&nbsp;means that&nbsp;<strong>WhatsApp is not safe anymore, and should not to be used for private communications.</strong></p>
<h2>Why use Signal?</h2>
<p>Signal is a chat app, just like WhatsApp. But unlike WhatsApp Signal is a non profit organization, which meansSignal does not have to sell your messages and information to advertisers like WhatsApp is planning to do in order to make money.<br>Signal also enables end-to-end encryption by default, so your chats are safe just like WhatsApp.<br>People like Elon Musk and others have asked everyone to switch to Signal once WhatsApp announced their new privacy policy about selling your data.</p>

<h2>What you miss by using signal instead of WhatsApp?</h2>
<p><strong>Basically nothing.&nbsp;</strong>Signal has everything that you love in WhatsApp.</p>
<ul><li>Groups ✅</li><li>Voice calls ✅&nbsp;</li><li>Video calls ✅</li><li>Stickers ✅</li><li>Statuses 🅾️</li></ul>
<p>You won’t miss anything by using Signal instead of WhatsApp.</p>
<p><strong>So I suggest everyone to download and try Signal, hopefully you will be able to replace WhatsApp if you care about your privacy, and may be try switching your friends over to Signal</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Download Signal</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://signal.org/download/">https://signal.org/download/</a></li><li><strong>Signal for iOS</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms</a></li><li><strong>Signal for Android devices</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/lk/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669">https://apps.apple.com/lk/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669</a></li></ul>

<p>Interestingly, public materials about the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/drawbridge/">Drawbridge</a> variant used on SQL Server are few and far between.</p>



<p>So <a href="https://threedots.ovh/slides/Drawbridge.pdf">here</a> is a slide deck about me working with Drawbridge from several years back. I’ve updated parts of it later on, keeping up partially with more recent SQLPAL versions.</p>



<p>Since I made that slide deck, lots of things happened… which will maybe be a subject for a story or two some day.</p>

    <figcaption>Unfolded Studio - The Platform for Geospatial Analytics</figcaption>
  </figure><p>Today we are delighted to officially unveil <a href="https://studio.unfolded.ai/">Unfolded Studio</a>,
our take on what the next generation geospatial analytics and visualization platform should look like.</p><p>We, the Unfolded founding team, originally met at Uber around 2015 as we started building out what has now become a suite of
leading open source geospatial technologies, including kepler.gl, deck.gl and H3. </p><p>By 2019, theis this technology stack had become quite mature,
and we realized that an extraordinary geospatial platform
could be built on top of it, so we came together to found Unfolded,
a new geospatial company with a mission to build the next generation of geospatial analytics.</p><p>Our mission is to enable effortless geospatial and temporal data analytics at
massive, planetary scales, and to share insights through geospatial visualizations
that inspire with their beauty and fluidity.</p><h2>Why Geospatial Platforms?</h2><p>Geospatial datasets are unique among data sets, in that they can be presented
in the context of maps and the physical world, rather than just as abstract graphs.
This makes it possible for viewers to quickly comprehend and draw valuable insights
from datasets that are orders of magnitude larger than would normally be possible.</p><p>Unfortunately visualizing data on maps is complicated. Ingesting, processing
and interacting with geospatial datasets is computationally and
technically demanding, especially when datasets become large,
and users typically need to solve numerous problems before insights can be reached. </p><p>For a geospatial platform like Unfolded Studio,
each of these problems represents an opportunity to help our users.</p><h2>Enter Unfolded Studio</h2><p>Our view is that any geospatial analytics platform worth considering today
must offer its users a range of critical core features:</p><ul><li>Effortless map creation</li><li>Strong exploratory visualization</li><li>Powerful geospatial analytics to help users uncover insights</li><li>Seamless cloud storage for geospatial data</li><li>Single-click map publishing </li><li>Easy ingestion of key geospatial data formats</li><li>Automation for getting data into and out of the tool</li><li>Ways to build custom applications on top of maps</li></ul><p>Note that Unfolded Studio is designed to handle not only these core geospatial data management tasks,
but more importantly is architected to address what we consider to be the hard problems in geospatial analytics.
We will share our thoughts and roadmaps around this in a follow-up blog post.</p><h3>Powerful Visualization Layers</h3><figure>

				<p><em>Alternative title: Young NB Yells At The Cloud</em></p>
<p><strong>Note that this absolutely isn’t vetted for technical accuracy.</strong>
<strong>It’s probably also not a very coherent post altogether.</strong>
<strong>I just needed to get this off my chest.</strong></p>
<p>Ever since late 2019, I’ve been using a Google Pixel 2 as my day-to-day
cellphone. While I’ve known that it didn’t respect my privacy, per the Google
tradition of being creepy and generally terrifying, I wasn’t <em>entirely</em> aware of
this phenomenon until Google told me when I registered my rooted Nook Tablet
with their services in 2014. The fact that this has been recorded six years
later was enough to set me off on a path to de-Googlify my Google phone.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.knightsofthelambdacalcul.us/img/2020-01-28-1.png"> 
</figure>

<p>The first option I found was <a href="https://github.com/dan-v/rattlesnakeos-stack">RattlesnakeOS</a>, which is basically just AOSP built
on EC2. While it seemed like a competent option, and it likely is, I didn’t want
to set up an AWS account and pay $5/mo to build it, as I’m already paying $10/mo
on my current servers (including the one hosting this website). In addition,
there’s <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a>, which is the continuation of the ill-fated CopperheadOS
(which effectively died Because Capitalism^TM after CopperheadOS was
commercialized, effectively killing the project altogether). I opted for the
latter as I wouldn’t have to set up my own build infrastructure on AWS, and the
fact that GrapheneOS decidedly had more features directly geared towards a
“hardened” Android experience, regardless of de-Googlification.</p>
<p>This of course, would be wonderful… if not for a critical roadblock.</p>
<h2 id="trying-to-unlock-the-bootloader">Trying to unlock the bootloader</h2>
<p>Here’s how it went down:
“Hey, are you able to unlock the boot-loader?”</p>
<pre><code data-lang="nil"> Λ ~ fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability
(bootloader) get_unlock_ability: 1
OKAY [  0.000s]
</code></pre><p>(read: “yeah, sure”)</p>
<p>“Okay, <em>can</em> you unlock the boot-loader?”</p>
<pre><code data-lang="nil"> λ ~ fastboot flashing unlock
FAILED (remote: 'Flashing Unlock is not allowed')
fastboot: error: Command failed
</code></pre><p>(read: “No, because I’m not able to.")</p>
<p>…so I’m left with Schrödinger’s bootloader (and not the cat from Digital Devil
Saga). Wonderful! Furthermore, I’m not the only one with this issue; not only do
some carriers lock down your ability to OEM unlock, but Google Play Services’
anti-theft protection makes it impossible to do so without an internet
connection, <em>and</em> some refurbished Pixel devices (mine being case-in-point) just
<a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-2/help/unlock-bootloader-refurbished-pixel-2-t4017557">don’t cooperate</a>, regardless as to whether or not it <em>should</em> work.</p>
<p>My experience with Google support on this topic basically boiled down to “why
are you even trying to unlock the bootloader, you idiot”, so that’s out of the
question. I’d imagine they’re probably not super happy about me stealing profits
from them by trying to escape their ecosystem.</p>
<p>On a happier note, I came across this person on Freenode’s channel #grapheneos,
which eased the tension due to them not breaking character:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="nil">       hazel1 │ hi yes okay so.
       hazel1 │ i'm on a pixel 2 non-xl, `fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability` returns 1, but `fastboot flashing unlock` says "Flashing Unlock is not allowed"
       hazel1 │ no idea where to go from here.
TheJollyRoger │ Avast! Did ye enable OEM unlocking in the OS under developer options?
       hazel1 │ i did, yes, that's what `fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability = 1` meant
       hazel1 │ also i appreciate your dedication to character.
       hazel1 │ i'm on linux, if that's important, and i'm running these commands as root.
TheJollyRoger │ Shiver me timbers, I be stuck too. Maybe someone else on this here tub will know.
</code></pre><h2 id="why-this-is-stupid">Why this is stupid</h2>
<p>This is where I turn this tech rant into a political rant, as I have no
self-control.</p>
<p>Per the majority of things that happen in the modern tech industry, this is, of
course, a byproduct of capitalism. The fact that carriers or refurbishers <em>can</em>
lock you out of customizing your own device is in it of itself terrifying, on
the merit that it’s an effective paywall to gain control of the hardware you own
— or rather, should own. While I’m a firm believer in security, and a firm
believer that the majority of people have devices that work well enough for them
(given that they’re not privacy conscious…), I’m also under the impression
that <em>people should have control over the things they own</em>. Capitalism, in the
name of profit, contradicts that scheme.</p>
<p>The fact that your carrier owns your phone, or your phone manufacturer owns your
phone, or Google owns your phone, etc, applies in bounds here. While the
saying is generally “if it’s free, you’re the product”, the fact that you’re
<strong>still</strong> the product when buying an expensive device speaks volumes about the
technological ecosystems we tend to depend on in 2020. I should be able to
unlock the bootloader without a second thought, but the fact that some
refurbisher owns the rights to do that with the device I should own, and not me,
worries me deeply.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t have to worry about whether some random thing I say is going to be
used against me in some creepy fashion three weeks later in an ad that shows up
on a torrent site when I’m trying to scrape the web for some obscure piece of
software that nobody uses or some movie that nobody watched.</p>
<p>I’m well aware that this point has been regurgitated. I’m well aware this post
doesn’t actually make much sense. But regardless, I’m scared that Google has
this much control, and I’m scared that I’m unable to remove it.</p>
<h2 id="follow-up--2020-01-29--and-a-potential-explanation">Follow-up (2020-01-29) and a potential explanation</h2>
<p>So apparently this is by design, which pretty much confirms my theory. Great.
Per a user on the <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/14920605?hl=en">Pixel Phone Help “official support forum”:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update: I was able to get a reply from the higher levels in Google and they
simply informed the man handling my case, to his astonishment, that the
refurbishment process is intentionally locking the bootloader and that is the
way they designed it to operate. No options were given to me to remedy the
issue and I was asked if there was anything else I wanted to discuss before
they ended the call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>This is ridiculous if true.</strong> Not only does it compound on my existing complaint
of bootloader unlocks being behind a paywall, which is already ridiculous, but
it means that even <strong>if</strong> you go through a paywall, any device defect could lead
to a permanently locked bootloader (such as my case). Even more ridiculous is
that Google’s factory Pixel images require a bootloader unlock to flash, meaning
that this locks users out of potential support options.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the theory of a refurbished device just being an unlocked
carrier edition phone is true (despite my CID being all zeroes), this is just
<em>negligence</em>.</p>
<p>Even if 99.3\% of users should <em>never</em> have to touch this option, the fact that
Google not only sends refurbished phones, but RMAs of unlockable phones with
this defect is astounding. It attests to the fact that what you own is not truly
yours even moreso than this just being a coincidence — it’s an explicit
hostile action towards the privacy-focused by Google. The former glory of Nexus
devices of being “the modder’s phone” has been changed drastically upon a vision
of a more popular “Google phone”; again, driven by capitalism.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>From the invention of the steam engine, to incandescent light, to radio, computation, and the internet, a familiar story unfolds:</p><p>In a small pocket of the world, a group of people produce immense innovation, changing the world as we know it.</p><p>Different times, different places, same story. If anything, “changing the world as we know it” is an understatement. It might be fairer to say that the <em>majority</em> of the wealth and security that we enjoy today, comes from these little pockets. </p><p>Without the steam engine, or electricity, or computers, our world would be different in kind. Many more people would be burdened by toil, many an idea would be impossible, and many a person would be dead from disease. It boggles the mind to think that these innovations took place in areas no larger than a few neighborhood blocks.</p><p>The latest place, of course, was Silicon Valley. From Intel, to Apple, to Microsoft, to Netscape, to Amazon, to Google, technology invented here continues to ripple around the world. </p><p>But, we’re facing some dangerous headwinds.</p><p>The ingredients that made Silicon Valley prosperous are beginning to disappear. For the young and ambitious hacker, it’s unaffordable to live there, and the cultural atmosphere has become stifling.</p><p>Yet our need for innovation has never been greater. From centralization to addiction, Big Tech itself has produced second order-consequences. We need solutions that protect the future of our society. And this pales in comparison to the largest problem at hand: we still have billions of people below the poverty line. There is no way for everyone to enjoy the standard of living that western people enjoy, without massive changes in technology.  </p><p>This is both daunting, and thrilling. We have big problems ahead, but humanity has managed to solve them time and time again. What are we going to do now?</p><p>One way, is to proliferate the ideas that made these areas of innovation so special. Can we reverse the trend in Silicon Valley? Even better, what if we had one thousand more Silicon Valleys of 2003, or Pittsburgs of the 1880s, or the Londons and Paris’ of the 1700s? </p><p>Throughout my life I’ve lived in about 5 cities across 3 continents, with at least 4 starkly different societal structures. Most recently I spent 6 years in Silicon Valley, where I was lucky enough to experience some of what made this place so special. </p><p>When I reflect, there are certainly ingredients I’ve noticed that made Silicon Valley stand apart from any other place I’ve lived in. I want to share them with you.</p><p>The most important ingredient I noticed was risk appetite, and a love for risk takers. </p><p>It’s surprising this isn’t a standard thing. Don’t we all respect Elon Musk? Sort of. We respect the successes, but our revealed preferences show something different. </p><p>Here’s how you can tell:  Pick a city, and ask the average student what they want to do after they graduate.</p><p>Most will say they want a prestigious job at a big company. In some even more unfortunate places, it’s that they want a prestigious and cushy job…in politics. </p><p>This doesn’t bode well for their risk appetite. But can you blame them? Imagine if the same undergraduate student has a love interest. What would the grandma say if they found out that the suitor wants to “make a rocket that flies to the moon?”. How would this suitor compare to the “deputy director of X bank”?</p><p>This attitude is shared across continents and cultures, revealing a generally conservative cultural attitude towards risk.</p><p>Now, it does vary. Being different is bad but not terrible in Germany, while it’s unbearable in Japan. Yet, by and large most places are on the “still bad” side of the spectrum.</p><p>Why does it happen this way? There may be good cultural reasons. For most of our history there was little variation in productivity. Being different didn’t get you much, outside of potential exile. </p><p>But things have changed. Technology brings extreme variation in productivity. Innovation necessarily lies in doing what hasn’t been done before. And there’s a reason why many good things <em>haven’t</em> been done before: either they look dumb, foolish, or impossible.</p><p>To exploit those opportunities, you need talented people “foolish” enough to try to build on these opportunities, and capitalists “foolish” enough to invest money in them. </p><p>Conservative risk outlooks make this impossible. It’s frustrating to see. Outside of the stigma, there isn’t much downside for the talented undergraduate student — they don’t have kids to support. And likewise for the capitalist — the amount to invest is insignificant. Just when life is the <em>least</em> risky for both, stigma prevents their action.</p><p>This is not the case in Silicon Valley. Starting a startup, even failing, only makes you a better engineer and a better candidate for greater things here. And there’s no shortage of angel investors who are ready to make a bet and write it off completely, if they believe in the slightest chance of upside. </p><p>Why? Because ambition is lauded here. </p><p>When you say you want to get to the moon, people take you seriously. An environment like that nourishes the adventurer in a person’s soul. </p><p>So, what do we do? How do we bring this kind of risk loving attitude to different cultures? </p><p>I think it’s going to be hard, but it’s not impossible. Ideas tend to spread non-linearly. </p><p>What kind of content is available in your society? Are there gripping case studies that you can share? Can you build up small pockets of like-minded people? How can you make an ambitious outlook virtuous and laudable?</p><p>Whichever city can solve for these questions, has a gold-mine on their hands. </p><p>Risk appetite, however, has a necessary side effect. </p><p>Innovation requires thinking up unintuitive ideas. You have to question the status quo. A common question you need ask is: why does X <em>really</em> have to be this way? </p><p>Well, ask this questions enough times, and you’ll discover an idea that’s unpopular in whatever zeitgeist you live in. What do you do if you have an idea like that? </p><p>In some places, the penalty is so severe, that it’s dangerous to even think of an idea like this, let alone say it. </p><p>And this becomes tragic, because when you silence dissenting ideas, you stop innovation too. There is no way to follow innovative reasoning without some dissenting ideas popping up.</p><p>When you realize this, it’s no surprise that most pockets of innovation tended to stem from western cultures. Freedom of speech, common law courts, and liberty from oppression gives a person the necessary space to think.</p><p>One kicker is, that space is unbelievably attractive to a thinker: to let your mind roam is thrilling. This means that spaces like this build on themselves: people want to move there.</p><p>So, you need civil freedoms. But you can’t stop there. You need freedom to think, but you also need freedom to <em>build</em>. </p><p>This requires an open regulatory environment. If regulation is too restrictive, it selects for the kind of company that can make it through legal hurdles: large, bureaucratic, and lawyered up. Small, innovative startups that are likely to fail will die at birth.</p><p>How do you know if your city has an enough regulatory environment? Here’s how you can tell. </p><p>Just answer these questions: How quickly can you incorporate a business? Can you hire and fire someone easily? Can you accept payments easily? What kind of permits do you need to work on crypto, autonomous driving, or drones? </p><p>If you answered in the negative, this is a bottleneck for forming a pocket of innovation in your city. Each question you answer in the positive improves your city’s chances by a magnitude. If you answer entirely in the positive, you have a city that looks incredibly attractive to great thinkers and great doers.</p><p>The most critical remaining ingredient is talent. Technology is the medium of innovation, and it requires deep expertise. So how do you get these experts? Let’s put ourselves in the mind of these experts. </p><p>One immediate upside they’ll see already, is that your city has an environment where they can think freely, and it’s possible for them to try ambitious ideas without stigma.  That’s already an unbelievably attractive proposition. </p><p>But this itself isn’t enough for talent to flourish. Talent looks for other talent. Great thinkers want to be around other great thinkers. From Princeton to Bell Labs to Palo Alto, innovators clump together. So, you need to manufacture such a clump. How could you do it? </p><p>Traditionally, the solution is to nurture a great technical university. Build a place where the smartest people can gather and work on ambitious ideas. If you have that, you have a prime ingredient. </p><p>Is there anything special you need to do with this university, outside of just making admission selective? I think so. The place has to be livable enough for the professors, and fun enough for the students to stick around after.</p><p>One heuristic to know you have a city that’s livable enough, is to answer this question: Do you have any areas where folks don’t need to use cars? If you have a walkable pocket in your city, you have a place where thinkers will thrive.</p><p>Aside from investing in a good technical University, and a walkable area, what else can you do?</p><p>The most exciting development, is to turn your city into a kind of startup itself. Choose a group of technical thinkers that other hackers look up too. These are now your customers. The goal is to get them to move to your city. If you can do that, others will follow. </p><p>How do you get them to move? Well, these folks are not used to friendly governments, and are accessible on twitter. Reach out, offer to help, do the schlep work, and a movement can start. Mayor Suarez kicked this offw and has shown what’s possible. If I was a Mayor of any other city, I’d be studying this thoroughly.</p><p>If you can get a clump to form, now you have tinder. All you need to do is to add spark.</p><p>That spark is capital. I put this last, because if you have all of the above, capital will flock to you. In todays world, money is starving for assets. Many an angel investor dreams of …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div>

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I have seen a significant uptick of people posting or joining the forums and using belligerent language, making unilateral demands and insulting the process that is open source software. “The fact you haven’t done x is stupid”. “How can you write a piece of software that doesn’t do y?”. “It’s 2021 and you still can’t make a program do z, how pathetic”. Not exact words, but accurate sentiments.</p>
<p>Please don’t do this. Please be nice.</p>
<p>The Signal team, as with any open-source team, are not infinite resources to pour down the drain. Every hour they spend on their job working for Signal, every hour they spend after work helping out, every hour a volunteer puts into forum support and bug investigation, is an hour consumed. To receive insults and vitriol in return is corrosive. It is unfair and it is not in the spirit of giving, of making something and offering it for free.</p>
<p>You’re receiving this for free, this great software which is made by people who <em>literally care</em> about your privacy. They don’t know you, and they sure don’t know what you talk about on Signal, and yet they put in a lot of effort for this. Not to make wads of cash. Not to sell you to advertisers for your social life to be analysed and abused.</p>
<p>The developer for the Mastodon software Fedilab recently <a href="https://framagit.org/tom79/fedilab/-/issues/498" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">revealed he has been burnt out</a> and I’ve read elsewhere it was because people were screaming hate at him for a principle he upheld - which was that his software would not censor people screaming hate at each other. I’m sure you can appreciate the painful irony here. (Please note that his stepping down seems to be for real, the specific reasons I’ve gave are speculation). I, for one, chose his software specifically because it did not censor, because whilst I believe a service can censor if it chooses, software must remain neutral. (If you wish to discuss this, perhaps let’s do that on another thread).</p>
<p>Don’t be that person. Don’t jump on issues making demands. Don’t pile on forum threads that make some users’ opinions very clear as it is, and throw your bellicose howling in there too. Don’t insult the developers or their priorities, their choices. They are real people who have a finite capacity for work and for abuse. Add a thumbs up to an issue, add a heart to a forum request. Post only if you can materially add to the discussion, else use a reaction. Post in the spirit and the letter of the <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/guidelines">community guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Please be nice.</p>

          <p>We as old community members should also be reminded to be nice even when other people are not nice.<br>
I can talk of myself (and think many other here feel the same) that sometimes when a wave of people hits and behave bad I am angry and I should be nicer to other people.</p>
<p>So to us, even when we have people misbehave and maybe even spaming or other stuff we should still try to be serious and nice to each other :)</p>

        <p>Taking a risk of offending people is not a means to push your opinion. There is no law against it, but there are community guidelines against it.<br>
Pushing the buttons of other people, you full well know that sooner or later you will push a button that triggers something. That’s why we don’t push each others buttons in the first place. you can always make your point without being rude.</p>

<p>This is not cool, and you have kind of missed the point entirely.</p>
<p>As the post says, the people behind the non-profit app are spending time out of their days to help everyone get the best out of the app. Of late, with the influx of users requesting (and demanding!) features akin to WhatsApp and the other monstrosities, it’s likely to take its toll.</p>
<p>I appreciate what you are saying, to a degree. I also don’t think your post should be ‘hidden’ as it’s been reported by the Cancel-Culture-Community. I firmly believe that if you say something, you own that! As you will expect, people are entitled to reply to that to support or rebut. That’s called a conversation. So you shouldn’t be denied that. That said, the Community Guidelines are what they are. And if we disagree, we can chose not to participate.</p>
<p>In summary, the bottom line is being aware of the unkindness towards those trying to help. Berating developers for not having something featured isn’t likely to inspire ‘will’. Neither is your post. But then you have every right to say what you have said and others have the right to reply to it accordingly. In my opinion, anyway.</p>

          <p>Firstly. Thank you to Signal Devs. I think you’re all doing an amazing job and I will be signing up to donate, even if it is a small amount.</p>
<p>One thing I want to say to the Signal Dev Team. I bet that 99% of your user base appreciate all the hard work you are doing and want to support you in any way they can, myself included, even if just morally. Please don’t let that 1% of intolerant users discourage you from all the great input you have.</p>
<p>I am a great supporter of free speech even if something is “offensive” but posters must also realize the difference between <strong>“saying something offensive”</strong> and <strong>"hate speech"</strong></p>

<p>You might have the right to say what you want, but free speech isn’t about interrupting a conversation about football yelling about zebras. Free speech is about tolerance, about a productive and focused conversation –that’s why there’re guidelines, and why guidelines are there to be tolerated.</p>

<p>I was one of the flaggers. I am fine with someone disagreeing with me and refuting or rebutting what I’ve said. I even tolerate them doing so rudely if their points are salient. (A few hours later I usually come back and +1 their post with begrudging flouncing) If their first post on a forum is flaming someone without addressing a single one of their points in a coherent or sensible way, misrepresenting the letter and spirit of the conversation and acting generally in bad-faith, then I will flag that as it’s not a conversation, it’s just pointless screaming. If they also break the rules then they’re definitely getting a flag.</p>
<p>Flagging/reporting a post is not cancel culture at all. Flagging a rude, abusive or entirely unconstructive post is doing your bit as a member of the community to weed out bad behaviour and bad actors. I urge everyone to flag anyone posting in bad faith, or breaking the rules. Flag it all and let the pages written by people who detract from the conversation burn.</p>

<article>
    <p>Everyone knows good code is easy to maintain, but that also means anyone can maintain it. That’s no bueno for the individual developer who wants a little job security. Writing overly complex code that nobody else can maintain let alone read, will ensure your company holds onto you, and will give you more bargaining power come raise time.</p>
<p>We’re going to work with a simplified example for the rest of this article. Imagine your boss has asked you to write a program that will count from 1 to 9 and print out the number, along with if it is even. A valid output would be as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">1 is even: False
2 is even: True
3 is even: False
4 is even: True
5 is even: False
6 is even: True
7 is even: False
8 is even: True
9 is even: False
</code></pre></div><p>Your boss might’ve said this would be part of the test suite for the NPM package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-even">is-even</a> but you stopped listening about halfway through to figure out how many story points this would be on the next sprint.</p>
<p>Oh well, sounds easy enough right? Any developer worth their salt knows a simple for loop could solve this problem.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (int i = 1; i &lt; 10; i++) {
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {i % 2 == 0}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>But as correct as this solution might be, it doesn’t guarantee us job security which is after all the most important principle of good code.</p>
<p>Time to add a little complexity to ensure no one else will dare touch the code, or try to understand it.</p>

<p>Just so we’re all on the same page, a for loop is comprised of a statement, and a body.</p>
<p>The statement is the portion which sits atop the loop and is within parenthesis. It’s divided into three parts. Each of which is separated by a semi-colon.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for(initializer; condition; iterator) {}
</code></pre></div><ol>
<li>initializer: The initializer is the first part, and usually instantiates a variable. Say <code>int i = 0;</code></li>
<li>condition: The condition is the middle portion and is checked each pass of the loop to ensure it’s true. When the condition tests false, the loop is exited.</li>
<li>iterator: The last portion is the iterator, this is typically used to increment the loop variable ex: <code>i++</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>All 3 parts of the statement are optional, and an empty for loop <code>for (; ;) { }</code> will act like an infinite while loop <code>while(1) { }</code>.</p>
<p>The body is the portion of the loop below the statement. Usually surrounded by curly braces, unless it’s one line (as they’re optional then). I should also mention that the body is optional too.</p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and start writing our <em>ahem</em> abomination.</p>

<p>First off we’ve got some domain logic operating inside the for loop body. The ternary that detects if the number is even: <code>i % 2 == 0</code>. Let’s go ahead and squeeze it into the for statement because after all that’s where it belongs.</p>
<p>We’re going to need an extra variable to hold a <code>isEven</code> flag. But, there’s a bit of a problem. C# only allows for defining multiple variables of the same type in one line. So while the following is perfectly valid:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for(int a = 0, b = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {}
</code></pre></div><p>This is not:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for(int a = 0, bool isEven = false; i &lt; 10; i++) {}
</code></pre></div><p>But that’s okay because we’ll slap it in a value tuple and deconstruct it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for(var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i &lt; 10; i++) {}
</code></pre></div><p>Now that’s beautiful.</p>
<p>With the bool instantiated we just need to recalculate it each time in the iterator. Thankfully C# is cool with assigning multiple variables of different types on the same line.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i &lt; 10; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { }
</code></pre></div><p>And now our for loop body has been devoided of any logic. It’s clean and concise.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i &lt; 10; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>I’d argue <code>i &lt; 10</code> is too readable. Since the condition just needs to be a boolean we can substitute it with anything we please provided it evaluates to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Which basically makes it a no-brainer to swap it out with a switch expression.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 10 =&gt; false, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>The switch expression will still run our loop from 1 to 9 as intended. Each iteration of the loop it’ll see which case it matches i against. The underscore (or discard) is equivalent to the default case of a switch statement. Therefore while i is not 10 it’ll return true which means keep running the loop, and once it hits 10 the switch will return false saying it’s time to stop.</p>
<p>But we can take this a step further and add erroneous cases. As long as the switch never hits said cases it doesn’t mess with the logic.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 10 =&gt; false, 14 =&gt; true, 69 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; true,_ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>And on top of that they don’t even have to be in order. Also note that erroneous cases can return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. This is extra important to add another layer of confusion.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 =&gt; false, 69 =&gt; true, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; true, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>For the finishing touch let’s kick it up a notch. A switch case has to be a literal or constant, which removes the usages of methods, and the such but still leaves math on the table.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; true, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; true, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>I recommend leaving the math a fifth grade level. We want to give the reader a flash back to their day in grade school learning their multiplication tables.</p>
<p>Oh and did I mention we can add some math and more to the return values? After all they just need to be booleans.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; 8 / 2 == 4, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; 7 * 6 == 92, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0) { 
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>We’re not done yet. Our solution is optimal, but everyone knows that a 1 line solution is <strong>always</strong> better. Right now you’re either begging for mercy or thinking there’s no way it’s possible. Even if we removed the brackets it’s still 2 lines.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; 8 / 2 == 4, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; 7 * 6 == 92, _ =&gt; true }; i++, isEven = i % 2 == 0)
  Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
</code></pre></div><p>But if there’s a will there’s a way.</p>
<p>Our next magic trick is going to involve a little inspiration from JavaScript. Have you ever heard of a self invoking function? It’s basically a function declaration that immediately executes itself.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">(function () {
  console.log("foo");
})();
// prints "foo" to the console
</code></pre></div><p>And while we may be in the .NET world, who’s to say we can’t borrow a little inspiration?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">new Action(() =&gt; Console.WriteLine("foo"))();
// prints "foo" to the console
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s take our new found knowledge and replace the iterator of our loop. Because after all when all you’ve got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; 8 / 2 == 4, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; 7 * 6 == 92, _ =&gt; true }; (i, isEven) = new Func&lt;int, (int, bool)&gt;((i) =&gt; (i + 1, !(i % 2 == 0)))(i)) {
    Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}");
}
</code></pre></div><p>This is the little bit we added.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">new Func&lt;int, (int, bool)&gt;((i) =&gt; (i + 1, !(i % 2 == 0)))(i)
</code></pre></div><p>A Func&lt;&gt; is the same thing as an Action except it can have parameters, and a return value. In our instance, the function takes an int parameter, and returns a value tuple containing an int, and bool. Make sure you name your function parameters the same as the variable being passed in.</p>
<p>The real reason why we added in the self invoking function isn’t to make it more confusing. No. We just needed a new location to place our <code>Console.WriteLine()</code> call.</p>
<p>That my friends is how we can achieve our glorious one liner solution.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">for (var (i, isEven) = (1, false); i switch { 14 * 4 =&gt; false, 69 * 250 / 84 =&gt; 8 / 2 == 4, 10 =&gt; false, 420 =&gt; 7 * 6 == 92, _ =&gt; true }; (i, isEven) = new Func&lt;int, (int, bool)&gt;((i) =&gt; { Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}"); return (i + 1, !(i % 2 == 0)); })(i));

</code></pre></div><p>Here’s the self invoking function for those who somehow have trouble reading our work of art.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">new Func&lt;int, (int, bool)&gt;((i) =&gt; { Console.WriteLine($"{i} is even: {isEven}"); return (i + 1, !(i % 2 == 0); }(i)
</code></pre></div>
<p>We could take things further, but before doing some I’d recommend assessing the rankings of your co-workers. If you work alongside a lot of junior devs, it’s probably sufficient, but if you work with more senior developers we could always break out a few more tricks. I’ll leave this as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>With everything coded up, and testing good, it’s time to commit your masterpiece and send off some requests for code reviews. Come to think of it it’s probably about time to head on home as this likely took most the day. Go home and enjoy some brews. Because tomorrow when your boss calls you into his office it’s gonna be for that promotion you’ve been wanting.</p>
<p>PS: If anyone is hiring an entry level code obfuscator please let me know.</p>

<p>Thank you Chris Cattano for pointing out I had a logic error in the code bits after switching to the self invoking function. The program was incorrectly reporting which numbers were odd. Turns out even I fell prey to the complexity.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>The Mac has always been very different from its close relative, iOS, especially when it comes to what a user is or is not allowed to run on their system. Even with the introduction of Apple Silicon, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10686/?t=1161">has made it very clear</a> that the Mac is still the Mac, and is still <em>hackable</em>, even when running on the new architecture.</p><p>What this means for us developers is that, when targeting the Mac platform, we have choices: we can distribute our apps independently, outside the Mac App Store, through the Mac App Store exclusively, or through both at the same time.</p><p>This article is my brain dump on the subject. It is meant to be a guide on the things that you’ll need to know about when distributing a Mac app outside the App Store, rather than a how-to tutorial. My hope is that having everything listed here will help demystify the process for beginners, and the descriptions of my own process will be useful as starting points.</p><h2>App Store x Direct: pros and cons</h2><p>All of these choices come with their pros and cons, and depending on which type of Mac app you’re making, you might not be able to have it in the Mac App Store to begin with. An example of that is my app <a href="https://v2.airbuddy.app/">AirBuddy</a> which, in order to provide deep integration with Apple’s wireless devices, needs to run a system agent and use some private APIs, which would never be allowed in the App Store. The same goes for many other types of apps which simply wouldn’t work with the restrictions of the Mac’s sandbox.</p><p>For those who do have that choice, I’ve compiled a list of what I believe to be the pros and cons between shipping through the Mac App Store or shipping directly.</p><h3>Mac App Store pros</h3><ul><li>Apple handles the distribution, billing and licensing for you</li><li>The app is easier to find and install for most users</li><li>Potential to get featured by Apple and reach more customers</li><li>Can use features such as Sign in With Apple which are not available for apps distributed outside the Mac App Store</li></ul><h3>Mac App Store cons</h3><ul><li>Have to pay a 15% or 30% cut of all sales to Apple, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/">depending on how much you make in a year across all apps</a></li><li>Every single update, no matter how minor, has to go through App Review and has the potential of being rejected for arbitrary and random reasons</li><li>Can’t unlock the full potential of macOS because of the strict sandboxing requirements</li><li>Can’t do paid upgrades</li></ul><h3>Direct distribution pros</h3><ul><li>Ship updates whenever you want, no need to wait for them to be reviewed and no fear of random rejections</li><li>Unlock the full potential of macOS with system extensions, daemons, no sandboxing, private API, and more</li><li>Keep a higher percentage of your sales</li><li>Do paid upgrades or other business models which are not allowed in the App Store</li><li>Live without the constant fear that your app will suddenly become a problem for Apple and be threatened with removal from the App Store</li></ul><h3>Direct distribution cons</h3><ul><li>Have to handle licensing, distribution, and updates (it’s not that hard, you’ll see)</li><li>Not as easy to do consumable or non-consumable in-app purchases (no StoreKit)</li><li>Can’t use some Apple services such as Sign in With Apple (others such as CloudKit still work just fine)</li></ul><h2>A note on Catalyst and SwiftUI</h2><p>With the introduction of Catalyst, we’re now seeing many new Mac apps being released, since it’s a lot easier to take an existing iPad app and turn it into a Mac app. Apps ported to macOS through Catalyst are not required to be released in the App Store, even if their counterpart on iOS is.</p><p>Additionally, there is currently no TestFlight for macOS (one of my wishes for 2021), so if you’d like to distribute beta builds of a Catalyst app, you’ll have to do that outside the Mac App Store, and it is not that different from distributing a production app.</p><p>A lot of what I’m presenting here will also apply for Catalyst apps — they’re Mac apps, after all — but some might require additional hacking in order to work around the fact that Apple doesn’t want you to use the entirety of AppKit directly from within a Catalyst app. With a bit of work though, you can make a Catalyst app very Mac-capable, including <a href="https://www.highcaffeinecontent.com/blog/20190607-Beyond-the-Checkbox-with-Catalyst-and-AppKit">support for AppleScript</a> and other features.</p><p>For SwiftUI apps targeting the Mac, there should be no major differences with the distribution process, since you can use all features of the macOS API in a SwiftUI app without requiring a lot of hacking like it does for Catalyst apps.</p><h2>Distribution</h2><p>Distribution of an app involves two parts: actually uploading, storing and serving the app binary and its updates somewhere, and also producing the right package that will work for your users.</p><h3>Hosting</h3><p>The first major step with getting your Mac app in the hands of users without the App Store is to figure out how to distribute its binary. No App Store means that you’ll have to host your app’s binaries and updates somewhere on the internet and provide a link for your users to download it.</p><p>There are several ways you can go about this. For an open-source app, you can use Github releases and even host your app’s update feed in the Github repo. That’s how I distribute the <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/WWDC/releases">WWDC app for macOS</a>.</p><p>For my commercial apps, I’ve been using <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze B2</a> for storage of both the app binaries, delta updates and update feed, and proxying all requests through <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> so that I can have a custom domain for the downloads/updates and also add filtering, caching and logic on the server if needed.</p><p>B2 is an extremely affordable provider (I rarely pay over US$1 in a month). Most Mac apps are not that large in size, so even if your app is downloaded a lot, it’s unlikely that you’ll end up having to pay a lot of money for storage/bandwidth. Another popular option is using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> buckets, but their control panel gives me nightmares so I prefer to use B2 which is a lot simpler (and less expensive).</p><p>I haven’t automated the publishing step for my app releases as of yet, so to upload a new release I just use <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> as a client for my B2 buckets. Speaking of that, before we even get to upload a release to whatever provider we’ve chosen, there’s a very important step: getting the right file to put out there.</p><h3>Notarization and packaging</h3><p>When exporting an archived app from within Xcode, we get two main options for distribution: App Store Connect and Developer ID. To distribute apps without the App Store, you’re going to be using Developer ID.</p><p>The same developer account you use for distributing apps to the Mac App Store can be used to sign your apps for Developer ID distribution. The certificate itself is different, but Xcode will auto-generate and install one for you during the process of exporting the archive if you haven’t done so yet.</p><p>Since macOS Catalina, all apps distributed directly to users must be notarized by Apple, otherwise they won’t launch by default. This process uploads your app to Apple, which will then run automated malware checks and “staple” your binary with a special signature that will allow it to run. This is not App Review, it’s an automated check to prevent malware from being distributed through this method, and it is also a way for Apple to flag a single binary for malware, instead of a developer’s entire account, should it become compromised at some point.</p><p>Whether or not you notarize the binary directly from within the Xcode organizer will depend on which packaging method you’ll be using to distribute your app. We can’t just upload a <code>.app</code> directory to a server and let users download that, we have to turn it into a flat file. The simple way to do that is to just zip the app and distribute it as a zip file, but I’ve found through experience that distributing the app as a DMG file reduces support requests by quite a bit.</p><p>You’ve probably seen DMGs before when downloading Mac apps. They’re disk images that are mounted by macOS when double-clicked in Finder, and they can also provide some artwork instructing the user to drag the app into their Applications folder. This makes it easy for a user to figure out what to do, and it also reduces the chances that a given user will be running your app from their Downloads folder or some other random place like that.</p><p>If you’re going to be distributing your app as a DMG, you should just export it using the Developer ID option in Xcode, without notarization, then notarize the DMG itself. There’s no option in Xcode to export a DMG, so you’ll have to use a third-party tool. The one I like to use is <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/create-dmg">create-dmg</a>. I’ve also created and open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/dmgdist">dmgdist</a>, a tool that automates the process of creating, uploading and stapling the DMG so that you can get the image ready to be distributed by running a single command.</p><p>To distribute the app as a zip file, the process is simpler: pick the upload option from Xcode after selecting “Developer ID” and it’ll produce a notarized version of your app, which you can then zip up and distribute directly.</p><h2>App updates</h2><p>Another aspect of the App Store is that it also handles app updates. Whenever we upload a new version to App Store Connect and it gets approved, users receive the update in the App Store. For apps distributed directly, we need to replicate that somehow.</p><p>The best way to do that — and the most common — is to use <a href="https://sparkle-project.org/">Sparkle</a>. It’s been around for many many years and is pretty much the official way to distribute updates for Mac apps distributed outside the Mac App Store.</p><p>Sparkle is currently living a double life of sorts. You can either use the “legacy” version of Sparkle or use a more modern “v2” branch which includes many improvements such as the ability to update sandboxed apps. I still use the “legacy” version because it’s the one that I’m familiar with and I find that integrating the more modern version is still a bit more complicated. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.</p><p>The process of generating an app update usually goes as follows: ensure that with every update you increase the app’s version (of course), produce the package as described before (Sparkle can handle zips, DMGs and installer packages), then use the <code>generate_appcast</code> tool to update the feed. After doing that, upload the deltas, the package for the new version, and the updated AppCast …</p></div></article></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Over one year ago, I decided to quit my data science job and pursue my <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/">bootstrapped data science side-project</a> full time. It was a hard decision to make, but once I quit and was freed from the corporate nine to five, my life turned to complete bliss.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>That bliss lasted about two weeks before it reverted back to the mean. Honeymoons exist in all facets of life, and bootstrapping a business does not make you impervious to Mondays. Rather every day just became a Thursday. But more on that later...</p><p>I wanted to reflect on this past year plus of bootstrapping and add in some frameworks for why anyone reading this on the fence of quitting their job for their side-hustle should do so. Quitting was one of the hardest decisions that I had to make, but the best one I went through with. It's also a decision that many people should not do. </p><p>But for the small percentage of the people out there, bootstrapping a startup can be an awesome thing. You resign yourself to make trades. </p><p>You trade a steady stream of work and meetings for flexibility in your own time and hours. You trade your current monthly salary now for no income but with future options of money. And you trade office externalities and politics for taking full control of how your career might turn out. </p><p>And ultimately if those trades and values are worth it, then quitting your job can make sense in a very real way. </p><h2 id="how-it-got-started">How it got started</h2><p>On November 1st 2019, I officially quit my job as a data scientist at Nextdoor after working there for exactly a year. I had started a side project called Interview Query with my co-founder, Shane, six months prior. </p><p>Interview Query started out as an email newsletter that each day sent a user a data science interview question, and then the solution the next day if the user upgraded to premium. Over the past year we’ve built the product into a fully-fledged data science course, questions database, and became the de-facto data science interview prep resource.<br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-18.png" alt="Interview Query SQL" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-18.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-18.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-18.png 1364w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An example of a SQL interview question we would send out. If you paid for premium, we would send a detailed explanation + solution the next day.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The first time someone purchased a subscription in June of 2019, my co-founder Shane was convinced it was a stolen credit card. It took five more customers before he truly believed that we were not just a test platform for fraudsters. And we watched in fascination as our newsletter grew from $60/mo in revenue to $3,000/mo in revenue. <br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-19.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-19.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-19.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-19.png 1258w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>And while $3K/mo was a lot of money, it still wasn’t enough to constitute quitting our jobs. Shane was working part-time on it while also working a software engineering job. And I was also a pretty senior data scientist making <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-data-science-salaries">$160K/year</a>. So an apples to apples comparison of going from to $14K/month to $1.5K/month didn’t really seem worth it. </p><p>But direct income &nbsp;isn’t the only comparison you have to make. </p><h2 id="opportunity-cost">Opportunity Cost</h2><p>The hardest jump to make is almost always on money. Money has always had significance to me. I was born and raised as a Chinese American which meant money was and still is an intrinsic part of my identity. The comedian <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_KpLrHCAx0">Ronnie Chieng does a funny bit</a> on what money means to Chinese people.</p><blockquote>“Do you know what the direct translation of <em>Happy New Year</em> in Mandarin is? Hope - you - get - rich. <strong>That's not Happy New Year!</strong>"</blockquote><p>To my Chinese parents, they could have added an addendum of - <em>Hope you get rich while working a stable job with low risk.</em> For with all monetary pursuits, the equation that works best within typical Chinese American families is:</p><p><em>Current income * very stable job * years of working = <strong>Best Possible Outcome Ever</strong></em></p><p>It’s a pretty linear expectation of wealth that requires a normal day to day grind and the advantages of compound interest. But the equation never really took into account tweaking the risk factor. What happens when your current income drops and risk tolerance increases? </p><p>This was the pivotal question that made it difficult for me to quit. But a month before I ended up leaving, I met up with my old startup boss at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/monster-snaps-up-tinder-for-jobs-app-jobr/">company where we exited into an acquisition</a>. I told him about the dilemma I was in, and he illustrated a newer way of looking at it. </p><blockquote>If you have a product that’s making $3K/month and you can grow that into $5K/month in a few months by working full time on it, you have to realize that the <strong>actual added value of growing your business</strong> is turning it from $36K/year in revenue to $60K/year in revenue.<br></blockquote><p>This realization helped me understand the <strong>value investment of full-time work. </strong>Money and finances can be traded for time and investment in a business in ways that you can't when you work a job. Work your ass off for a year at any FAANG type of tech company and your boss will reward you with a 15% raise. Work hard on your business and double your monthly revenue after a year, <strong>well your business also just doubled in value. </strong></p><p>So the opportunity cost of trading a job that made me $160K/year didn’t seem that bad anymore if I could at least <strong>forecast a rate of growth that would be worth my time and investment</strong> as if I was working another full time job. </p><p>And at least on my own business, I’d enjoy the work. </p><h2 id="flexibility-and-values">Flexibility and Values</h2><p>Everything gets destroyed when you bulldoze a building. The walls, the appliances, even parts of the foundation. And while throwing a wrecking ball into the corporate 9-5 felt gratifying, picking up the pieces to rebuild <strong>exactly how I would work</strong> took just as much careful planning and thought. </p><p>Balancing structure and life is important when bootstrapping. A lifestyle business allows you flexibility in how you would like to run your business. Before I quit my job, I talked to a career coach (ironically employed by the company) who encouraged me to figure out my values - and try to see if quitting allowed me to prioritize them accordingly.</p><p>Eventually I realized it did when I wanted to re-prioritize my activity list from:</p><ol><li><em>Data science job</em></li><li><em>Surfing</em></li><li><em>Side-Hustle (Interview Query)</em></li><li><em>Friends and Relationships</em></li><li><em>Random data projects</em></li></ol><p>to</p><ol><li><em>Surfing</em></li><li><em>Interview Query</em></li><li><em>Friends and Relationships</em></li><li><em>Random data projects</em></li><li><em>Things I don’t want to do but have to do to make money</em></li></ol><p>This clear order of change in my lifestyle made me realize that valuing flexibility was extremely important. It was also something I couldn't attain in my day job.</p><p>For example, when an amazing swell approaches Ocean Beach now, I reschedule meetings, log off, and go surfing. Shane and I both have trust that I'm going to finish the work that needs to get done. But if I were to receive a meeting at my old job that conflicted or I didn't want to attend - there was no way around it. </p><p>As controllers of our own fate, we make it a priority to cut down all the things we don’t want to do, and hire for those roles. If we need vacation time, then we take it.</p><p>But on that note of flexibility comes the other way - how flexible can we be while still working? And how much did we really want to work in general?</p><h2 id="financial-independence-of-sorts">Financial Independence of Sorts</h2><p>In February of 2020, Interview Query was churning out a consistent $9K/month in revenue. We tripled revenue by increasing our distribution and had transitioned from the email newsletter to building a very simple interface for viewing all of the interview questions and solutions. It was also enough to now cover my rent and general expenses.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-22.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-22.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-22.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/image-22.png 1600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/image-22.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/questions/bank-fraud-model">Our current interface - much improved from before</a></figcaption></figure><p>And better yet we still weren’t even working that much. I had taken a long vacation in New Zealand and Shane was still working part time. For a moment, it seemed like it was going to be a 4-hour work week kind of business that we could maintain without adding new product features. </p><p>But realistically, <strong>I had nothing else to work on</strong>. I still hadn’t gotten any of my other side-projects off the ground at the time. Surfing season was slowly ramping down. I looked around at what I was doing and realized that this project was the only one working and growing on its own. So why not invest to work on it?</p><p>One of my favorite ice breakers is asking people what they would do with their life if they received $10,000/month forever. Kind of like a basic<strong> </strong>(wealthy) income. Many people say travel (<em>which seems illogical given the extent of traveling for the rest of your life</em>), others say they’d make music, volunteer full time, work on making furniture, even working at a boba shop.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-20.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-20.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-20.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Our New Zealand van!</figcaption></figure><p>It’s a thought experiment on the idea of financial independence (FIRE). And at its core, the question is asking about what you would practically do for the rest of your life if money wasn’t an issue. The current existence of career advancement is fueled by a never-ending competition in monetary and title status. But if those were all stripped away, what would be left to complete life satisfaction?</p><p>I realized there was nothing else I wanted to do but build a startup anyway. Of course money will always matter and I inherently want to grow the business bigger and bigger. But what happens when it’s just a question of: <em>what do I do with my time when my expenses are accounted for and I want to be productive?</em></p><p>Many people in the FIRE community seem to be at loss when they finally achieve their financial freedom. They grind at a job for 15 years to finally quit and reach the same elation that I felt for maybe a few weeks or even months to suddenly fall back into a depression of sorts. Their life has no purpose after hitting their number. Which makes sense, because for 15 years <strong>all they knew about was the grind</strong> and <strong>all they thought about was hitting their number</strong>.</p><p>I personally love startups and businesses. Building and running companies requires the experience and skillset to get better at doing so. And so the question posed that helped me understand things was: </p><p><em>Would you rather be completely financially independent at age X and then quit your job to try a startup, or get good at building startups now and be a complete pro at age X instead?</em></p><h2 id="buy-futures-in-yourself">Buy Futures in Yourself</h2><p>The first few weeks after quitting my job I enjoyed the classic freedom and flexibility I had …</p></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img alt="nRF9160 Feather Test CLI" src="https://www.jaredwolff.com/testing-hardware-using-rust/images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-06_at_10.30.55_AM.png" data-src="images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-06_at_10.30.55_AM.png"></p><p>Rust has grown on me over the past year. I consumed <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/" target="_blank">The Book</a> while on a plane ride in February of last year <em>right</em> before Covid hit. It has basically been all downhill since. 😅</p><p>Since then, i’ve designed a (very alpha) <a href="https://github.com/jaredwolff/eagle-plm" target="_blank">CLI based MRP system</a>, e-commerce backend for <a href="https://www.jaredwolff.com/store/" target="_blank">my static website</a>, CLI based tester and firmware for my nRF9160 Feather test fixture. Yea, all in Rust.</p><p>In this article, i’ll be sharing details about how I developed the CLI and ATSAMD based tester for the <a href="https://www.jaredwolff.com/store/nrf9160-feather/" target="_blank">nRF9160 Feather</a>. By the end this should give you confidence that you can also develop your own firmware and software 100% in Rust!</p><p>Let’s get started.</p><h2 id="sprinkle-some-rust-in-your-firmware">Sprinkle some Rust in your firmware</h2><p><img alt="nRF9160 Feather tester hardware render" src="https://www.jaredwolff.com/testing-hardware-using-rust/images/feather-tester_v14.png" data-src="images/feather-tester_v14.png"></p><p>As mentioned earlier, I designed my tester hardware (pictured above) to use an ATSAMD microcontroller. I had a few reasons why I chose the ATSAMD21:</p><ol><li>It has a <strong>ton</strong> of pins. (ATSAMD21J18A-MFT has 52 to be exact!) This was going to be important in order to connect to and control everything about the DUT (Device under test) in the tester.</li><li>SAMD21 series is also ubiquitous and plentiful elsewhere. It also happens to have great support in the form of the <code>atsamd-hal</code> crate. (<a href="https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd" target="_blank">Link</a>)</li></ol><p>While there is some test firmware on the DUT itself, there’s a bunch of exciting stuff happening on the tester side. But before we do, let’s chat about the bootloader.</p><h3 id="first-thing-you-should-do">First thing you should do</h3><p>After lots of tinkering I realized that one of the first things you should do on any SAMD based project is get the UF2 bootloader loaded. Since loading it onto my test board <strong>I haven’t used my debug probe.</strong> (Rust makes this extremely easy since it eliminates 80% of the stupid mistakes i’d otherwise make in C)</p><p>Here’s a quick primer on how I got my board working:</p><ol><li><p>I cloned the UF2 repo:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/microsoft/uf2-samdx1
</code></pre></div></li><li><p>Created a folder called <code>circuitdojo_feather_tester</code> within the <code>boards</code> directory.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cd uf2-samdx1
mkdir boards/circuitdojo_feather_tester
</code></pre></div></li><li><p>I created <code>board.mk</code> and <code>board_config.h</code></p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cd boards/circuitdojo_feather_tester
touch board.mk
touch board_config.h
</code></pre></div></li><li><p>Using the already existing boards in the <code>boards</code> folder, updated the contents of <code>http://board.mk</code> and <code>board_config.h</code>. First <code>board.mk</code> to define what chip I was targeting:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">CHIP_FAMILY <span>=</span> samd21
CHIP_VARIANT <span>=</span> SAMD21J18A
</code></pre></div><p>Then <code>board_config.h</code> for all the configuration bits:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#ifndef BOARD_CONFIG_H
</span><span>#define BOARD_CONFIG_H
</span><span></span>
<span>#define VENDOR_NAME "Circuit Dojo"
</span><span>#define PRODUCT_NAME "Feather Tester"
</span><span>#define VOLUME_LABEL "BOOT"
</span><span>#define INDEX_URL "https:</span><span>//www.jaredwolff.com/"
</span><span></span><span>#define BOARD_ID "SAMD21G18A-Feather-v0"
</span><span></span>
<span>#define USB_VID 0x16c0
</span><span>#define USB_PID 0x27dd
</span><span></span>
<span>#define LED_PIN PIN_PA22
</span><span></span>
<span>#endi
</span></code></pre></div></li><li><p>Then using the instructions in the Readme, build the code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">make BOARD<span>=</span>circuitdojo_feather_tester
</code></pre></div><p>I used the toolchain that comes with NCS v1.4.1. I did have to make a change to the Makefile for everything to compile without borking. Turns out my toolchain was newer than expected. Fortunately adding <code>Wno-deprecated</code> inside the Makefile to the <code>WFLAGS</code> variable fixes this problem.</p></li><li><p>Once complete it will dump your binary/hex files to <code>build/&lt;your board name&gt;</code></p></li><li><p>Then I flashed the bootloader using <code>pyocd</code> like so:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">pyocd flash -t ATSAMD21J18A -f <span>4000000</span> bootloader-circuitdojo_feather_tester-v3.4.0-65-gdf89a1f-dirty.elf --format elf
</code></pre></div><p><code>pyocd</code> is just one of many ways to load firmware. The <a href="https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd" target="_blank"><code>atsamd-rs</code> repo</a> has a ton more options.</p></li></ol><p>Once programmed, hit the reset button twice in quick succession to enable bootloader mode. (I believe this is consistent across all other boards using the UF2 bootloader. Correct me if i’m wrong!) This will cause the bootloader to remain active so you can transfer new firmware.</p><p>On a scale from easy to painful, this was defintiely on the easy side of the spectrum. The folks at Microsoft and contributors like Adafruit made this process <em>really simple.</em></p><h3 id="hey-my-name-is-hal">Hey, my name is HAL</h3><p><img alt="Compiling Rust firmware" src="https://www.jaredwolff.com/testing-hardware-using-rust/images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-10_at_12.37.34_PM.png" data-src="images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-10_at_12.37.34_PM.png"></p><p>As of this writing, every different hardware platform has some type of independently created HAL (hardware abstraction layer). Atmel’s SAMD differs slightly from nRF and that differs from the STM32s of the world. The nice thing is as long as they conform to the higher level APIs, you can use something like the <a href="https://github.com/mvirkkunen/usb-device" target="_blank">USB crate</a> which supports ATSAMD and STM32.</p><p>The fastest way to get started with your own ATSAMD based board to create your own board definition. You can find a <strong>ton</strong> of example in the <code>boards</code> directory. Many off the shelf boards are already supported which makes for one less thing you need to do!</p><p>If you do find yourself with a custom board, you can copy one of the already existing boards that is closest to yours. For instance I used <code>feather_m0</code> as the base for my tester board. I tweaked <code>memory.x</code> and <code>src/lib.rs</code> to my liking.</p><p>There’s even a cool way to define pins so you can easily access them later. For for instance if you have a pin named <code>FLASH_EN</code> and it’s mapped to pin port B, pin 8 you can simply reference it later on using the <code>Pins</code> struct like <code>pins.flash_en</code>. (More below..)</p><p>The ATSAMD repo is going through some slow and steady improvements. There are even some nice additions to the <a href="https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd/pull/371" target="_blank">board support</a> area that i’m excited about and testing. While it’s mostly useable, it is rough in some areas (especially related to documentation).</p><p><em>Big shoutout to Bradley who has been spearheading these improvements. If I were to do any of this, i’d be surprised it would be working by then of it.</em> 😅</p><h3 id="dont-be-unsafe">Don’t be <code>unsafe</code></h3><p>When I first started developing the test firmware, I notice that I was using <code>unsafe</code> a lot. While in hardwareland using <code>unsafe</code> is not uncommon, from a readability and risk for increased errors perspective, it can get hairy.</p><p>There is a cool solution around this and that’s where <code>rtic</code> enters the picture. <code>rtic</code> is a new spin on how to write firmware in Rust. Instead of having the familiar <code>main</code> function, it works differently. Here’s the features from <a href="https://github.com/rtic-rs/cortex-m-rtic" target="_blank">the Github page</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Tasks</strong>&nbsp;as the unit of concurrency [^1]. Tasks can be&nbsp;<em>event triggered</em>&nbsp;(fired in response to asynchronous stimuli) or spawned by the application on demand.</li><li><strong>Message passing</strong>&nbsp;between tasks. Specifically, messages can be passed to software tasks at spawn time.</li><li><strong>A timer queue</strong>&nbsp;[^2]. Software tasks can be scheduled to run at some time in the future. This feature can be used to implement periodic tasks.</li><li>Support for prioritization of tasks and, thus,&nbsp;<strong>preemptive multitasking</strong>.</li><li><strong>Efficient and data race free memory sharing</strong>&nbsp;through fine grained&nbsp;<em>priority based</em>&nbsp;critical sections [^1].</li><li><strong>Deadlock free execution</strong>&nbsp;guaranteed at compile time. This is an stronger guarantee than what’s provided by&nbsp;<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html" target="_blank">the standard&nbsp;<code>Mutex</code>abstraction</a>.</li><li><strong>Minimal scheduling overhead</strong>. The task scheduler has minimal software footprint; the hardware does the bulk of the scheduling.</li><li><strong>Highly efficient memory usage</strong>: All the tasks share a single call stack and there’s no hard dependency on a dynamic memory allocator.</li><li><strong>All Cortex-M devices are fully supported</strong>.</li><li>This task model is amenable to known WCET (Worst Case Execution Time) analysis and scheduling analysis techniques. (Though we haven’t yet developed Rust friendly tooling for that.)</li></ul><p>While all these features and capabilities seem great, so what gives?</p><p>Well, for starters there’s no <code>main</code> function. 🙀</p><p>Here’s what a basic blinky app looks like using some of the new BSP (Board support packages) I mentioned earlier:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#![deny(unsafe_code)]</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The <code>init</code> function is where you would normally put anything you’d normally put in an Arduino <code>setup</code> function. We’re setting up pins and peripherals. If you want to use them later on though, you’ll need to create an entry in <code>Resources</code>. This is also where you store any type of static mutable data structures that you need elsewhere in your firmware.</p><p>The <code>idle</code> function is similar to the <code>loop</code> function in Arduino. It’s important though that if you want a loop, you have to implement it. Here’s the warning in the <a href="https://rtic.rs/0.5/book/en/by-example/app.html?highlight=loop#idle" target="_blank"><code>rtic</code> documentation</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Unlike init, idle will run with interrupts enabled and it’s not allowed to return so it must run forever.</p></blockquote><p>You don’t <strong>need</strong> to use an <code>idle</code> function though. If you don’t, your microcontroller will go to sleep. This is ideal for battery powered applications that need to sleep as much as possible.</p><p>In <code>rtic</code> every work function gets a <code>Context</code> variable. It allow you to access resources that are pertinent to that function’s purpose. Access is only granted though when you add a resource like below:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[idle(resources=[led_pass, delay]</span>)]
</code></pre></div><p>If <code>resources</code> was not set like above, I would not be able to use <code>led_pass</code> or <code>delay</code> within the function!</p><p>While this is a simple example, when you start using static resources like fixed size vectors you’ll be happy you chose to use <code>rtic</code>. The <a href="https://github.com/japaric/heapless" target="_blank"><code>heapless</code></a> crate has been extremely useful for setting size contrained elements that you’d normally be able to use with Rust’s <code>std</code> lib.</p><p>While <code>heapless</code> implements a few very handy types, the <code>Vec</code> and <code>spsc</code> imlementation have been <em>extremely</em> useful.

<p>Open Source Security, Inc is proud to announce its funding of a full-time and 
public development effort of a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> front-end for <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.
In this blog post, we'll detail the motivations for our involvement and the benefits the public will reap
as a result of this effort.</p>

<h2>A Security Need</h2>

<p>In July of last year, shortly after my virtual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Kza6fdkSU">presentation</a> at the Linux Security Summit 
North America entitled <a href="https://grsecurity.net/10_years_of_linux_security.pdf">"10 Years of Linux Security - A Report Card"</a>, we put out a 
<a href="https://twitter.com/spendergrsec/status/1283005179135221761">call</a> to other 
companies interested in funding a GCC front-end for Rust.

The motivation for this arose
from outreach from Nick Desaulniers of Google on <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKwvOdmuYc8rW_H4aQG4DsJzho=F+djd68fp7mzmBp3-wY--Uw@mail.gmail.com/T/">LKML</a> 
to discuss the possibility of Rust support in the Linux kernel at the upcoming Linux 
Plumbers Conference.  One obvious hurdle mentioned immediately was that the kernel is most 
commonly compiled with GCC, while Rust currently requires rustc/LLVM.  According to reports of
the resulting discussion, kernel 
developers were open to the idea of allowing the kernel to be built with GCC and the Rust 
portions with LLVM, as long as the two were ABI compatible.</p>

<p>Such discussions appeared to sidestep a more fundamental issue however: the security 
viability of a mixed assembly/C/Rust execution environment and how cohesive security 
functionality could be provided while mixing different compilers with different 
implementations/availability of said functionality.  The importance of this topic, though apparent 
on reflection, was formalized just recently in a paper by Michalis Papaevripides and Elias 
Athanasopoulos of the University of Cyprus entitled <a href="https://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~eliasathan/papers/tops20.pdf">"Exploiting Mixed 
Binaries"</a>.  In it, they detail how the overall security of an execution 
environment can be reduced by the introduction of code written in Rust or that of another 
language where the same binary-level security is not provided by the compiler.  An excerpt from page 3 of the paper makes the impact clear:</p>

<blockquote>
"We experimentally show that CFI can be bypassed using Rust/Go code for developing clearly 
more straight-forward exploits than current state-of-the-art CFI bypasses [57, 70]. Our 
exploits do not rely on respecting the statically computed Control-flow Graph (CFG) for 
bypassing the enforced CFI and are much simpler to implement. [ ... ]
Again, we stress here that in the absence of the safe part (Rust/Go code), the unsafe part 
cannot be trivially exploited."
</blockquote>

<p>
The same exact scenario above was one of the motivations for Microsoft to recently push for their
<a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/08/17/control-flow-guard-for-clang-llvm-and-rust/">Control Flow Guard (CFG) support</a>
in Clang and Rust (see the heading of "Rust linked with C/C++").
</p>

<p>As the source of the GCC plugin infrastructure in the Linux kernel and nearly all of the GCC plugins adapted
for inclusion in the upstream Linux kernel, we too immediately spotted the importance of this problem and set out
to ensure both those plugins as well as the security features built-in to GCC itself are able to instrument code
from all languages supported by the Linux kernel with compatible and consistent security properties.</p>

<h2>Funding Process</h2>

<p>So despite not expecting Rust code to land in the Linux kernel in the near future, we reached out to other 
companies as mentioned above to pull together funding for the GCC front-end effort.  None of the leads 
came to fruition, so we as a company decided to bootstrap the process, in the hopes that as progress in the work
is observed, others would join in.  Further, we wanted to offer funding under the same terms we would want as developers, 
across the entire spectrum: stability, salary, benefits, ownership, etc -- not token compensation or bounties 
that treat those working on free/open source software for the public as somehow <em>less</em> than 
developers of proprietary code.  To that end, we decided to fund the first year of a full-time
developer for the work ourselves.</p>

<p>If the failed experiment of the Core Infrastructure Initiative (<a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">CII</a>) taught us anything, it's that
one finds dedicated and competent developers for some work not among whoever happens to apply, but 
among those already involved in the work as a passion project.  This led us to reach out 
to <a href="https://thephilbert.io/">Philip Herron</a>, who we noticed was <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">already working</a> on a GCC front-end for Rust with involvement
of external contributors.  We were extremely pleased to hear Philip was interested in performing the work 
full-time.</p>

<p>News of our outreach eventually extended to the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/steering.html">GCC Steering 
Committee</a>, who contacted us to coordinate efforts.  They were very helpful in recommending to us <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/">Embecosm</a>, a UK-based company with deep experience and involvement in 
GCC/LLVM development, among many other areas.  Embecosm graciously offered to contribute to the effort by 
handling Philip's employment and, at no cost to us, providing project management services to help ensure the project's success.  
The location, expertise, and sharing of our vision of doing right by the developer couldn't have been a 
better match.</p>

<h2>Vendor-Neutral, Developed in the Open</h2>

<p>To make sure the project remains vendor-neutral and in the public interest, Open Source Security, Inc. will not own any of the copyright over the code developed through its funding.
All relevant GCC code for the project is GPLv3-licensed and copyright is assigned, as required for upstream GCC inclusion, to the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  The work is being performed in the open, with Philip providing public monthly status updates on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting</a>.  Reports are already available for the months of November and December.
</p>

<h2>Get Involved</h2>

<p>For more information about the "how" of this effort, Embecosm has prepared a 
blog at <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/">https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/</a> that we encourage 
all those interested to read.  To get involved in contributing technical work to the 
effort, Philip can be found on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/the_philbert">@the_philbert</a> or committing to the project's Github repository at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-w-id="9dfc6912-3fe0-bf1a-3d6f-bb95ffba0a17"><p>The <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod">SOLID principles</a> are Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles designed for writing Clean Code. According to Robert C. Martin’s “<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a>” book, in order to keep a good software development pace, it’s important for a team to write Clean Code. By implementing ugly code, you can surely come up with decent results quickly, but in the long run, your project will end up crashing into a wall.<br></p><p>It is known that a software dies when it’s no longer possible to understand it or add new features to it in a reasonable period of time. Keeping things clean is crucial to successfully convey any software project. This line of thought applies especially to machine learning projects that involve taking solutions from research or academic projects and implementing them into a production environment.<br></p><p>Research code is known to be dirty. Why? Because it’s often directed towards one goal only: making proofs of concept (POC) as quickly as possible. In this case, there’s not much incentive to keep one’s code clean. But if you plan on building a maintainable and scalable product, dirty code will not last long.</p><p>‍<br></p><p><strong>“SOLID”, you said? </strong><br></p><p>Here are the SOLID principles, in addition to the Tell Don't Ask (TDA) principle which is also relevant.<br></p><ul role="list"><li>S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).<br>	Every class has one responsibility only.</li><li>O: Open-Closed Principle (OCP). <br>	Classes are closed to modification and open to extension.</li><li>L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP). <br>	Subtypes should be properly interchangeable with the base type.</li><li>I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP). <br>	Separate interfaces across your objects rather than implementing only a big one.</li><li>D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). <br>	Depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations.</li><li>Also: Tell Don’t Ask (TDA). <br> Don’t manage an object from the outside, rather tell it what to do.<br></li></ul><p>Let’s dive deeper into these concepts.</p><p><strong>S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</strong><br></p><p>This principle states that every class has one responsibility only. For instance, if you’re tempted to name a class SomethingAndSomethingElse, it’s a sign that the class should probably be split into two.<br></p><p>Separating classes to give them one responsibility each will ease things when time comes to change code. Not only it will be easier to implement changes, but the different parts will be more reusable and malleable. It‘s an easy and safe way to code successive prototypes. It also makes the test protocol smoother by allowing to test one thing at a time. So when an error pops up, you can easily pinpoint the problem.<br></p><p>In addition, when several developers work together on the same project, respecting the SRP reduces the chances of two developers stepping on each other’s toes (modifying the same object at the same time). Imagine that the SomethingAndSomethingElse class has the responsibility of doing two different tasks (the task Something and the task SomethingElse) and that these tasks need to be refactored. If two developers take care of one task each, they will find themselves modifying the same object at the same time, which will probably cause a conflict in the code when the time comes to merge the two solutions in the project. On the other hand, if SomethingAndSomethingElse is split into two classes in respect of SRP, the two developers can work on two different objects thus avoiding the conflict. Handling conflict in code is generally time consuming and very prone to bugs. This phenomenon should be avoided as much as possible.<br></p><p>Let’s apply SRP to a machine learning context. Suppose we have a class named MyNormalizerAndMyModel. This design pattern is most likely to be too rigid, too specific and not malleable. Here’s what could (and should) be done. First, a class named MyModel would be made. If you think it’s part of the job of MyModel to normalize data, a method named ‘’normalize’’ would be implemented inside of it. If not, another class named MyNormalizer (which would inherit from the same superclass as MyModel) should be implemented. This class would implement the method ‘’normalize’’. Another class named MyPredictor could then be implemented which would ingest data and one or more models to make predictions. MyPredictor would therefore represent what is called a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33091376/python-what-is-exactly-sklearn-pipeline-pipeline">Pipeline</a>. It could encapsulate objects of type MyNormalizer, MyModel, etc. Other models could be implemented and used in the pipeline by simply swapping MyModel with another class representing another model. This way, it is easy to reuse some objects in different contexts without having to duplicate code or modify an existing model (also see Open-Closed Principle - OCP).<br></p><p>Using a framework like <a href="https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle">Neuraxle</a> (which is open source) greatly facilitates the construction of pipelines.<br></p><p>This principle also applies to data loading. It’s better to give the responsibility of loading data to a class apart from our machine learning algorithm. You would want to pass already loaded and crunched data to a pipeline made of model instances, so that the source of the data and the way to load it (there can be a lot) would not matter for the pipeline. This is also closely related to the Dependency Inversion Principle - DIP.<br></p><p>Another example of properly respecting the SRP in Machine Learning pipelines is to let each step of a pipeline define its own way to initialize itself, to save itself, and to delete itself. This is especially important when implementing deep learning for instance. In that case, some of the pipeline steps might use GPUs as others might use CPUs (<a href="https://www.neuraxle.org/stable/scikit-learn_problems_solutions.html#problem-initializing-the-pipeline-and-deallocating-resources">Such resource management is handled by Neuraxle’s pipelines</a>). It’s therefore important for each step to be able to manage itself. Managing the specifics of each step of a pipeline from outside the pipeline would break not only the SRP but also the Tell Don’t Ask (TDA) principle.<br></p><div><p>Now, suppose that you’re trying to find the best hyperparameters for the different models of a pipeline (this process is called <a href="https://www.neuraxio.com/en/blog/automated-machine-learning-automl/2020/02/22/your-data-scientisti-is-a-mom-(seriously).html">Automated Machine Learning - AutoML</a>). In such a case, it is crucial for each object inside a pipeline to be able to manage its own loading, saving, initialization and deletion in order to effectively allocate and deallocate resources. It would be a nightmare to manage that process outside the model or worst, outside the pipeline. A major default of scikit-learn is its inability to manage this process. It’s also important to respect the SRP and OCP when serializing and saving machine learning pipelines containing code that can’t be saved natively by the python interpreter (e.g.: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41567895/will-scikit-learn-utilize-gpu">here</a> is how Neuraxle solves the issue of using GPU resources, making use of proper abstractions that respects SRP and OCP).</p></div><p><strong>O: Open-Closed Principle (OCP)</strong><br></p><p>This principle states that a class should be closed to modification, and open to extension. Which means that if a new functionality has to be added to a project, you shouldn’t have to go back to existing classes to edit stuff that is already working.<br></p><p>The most obvious example of not respecting this principle is to include long if/else statement chains (switch cases) in a single piece of code. Having too many if/else encapsulated in such a blob is called “poor man’s polymorphism”. Polymorphism is the ability for an object to inherit from others and take other forms in order to provide different functionalities. Rather than coding a lengthy if/else block at a particular point in a pipeline, it’s advised to implement an abstract class that is open to modifications (to polymorphism, in this case). All the different cases supposedly handled by an if/else block can then be incarnated by as many different sub-classes as needed, all inheriting from the previously built abstract class. Such a sub-class can then override certain methods of its parent abstract super-class as you see fit. By doing that, there’s no need to modify the abstract super-class or any of its sub-classes when implementing new functionalities. You would just implement a new sub-class inheriting from the same super-class, and inject it where you see fit (see the section about the DIP for more information about injection).<br></p><p>Let’s illustrate that principle with the example of loading data as a step of a machine learning pipeline. It’s certainly not a good idea to simply implement a function called “load_data” which would have a huge if/else block to cover all the possible cases like fetching data from a local repository, an external repository, an SQL table, a CSV file, an S3 bucket, etc. It would be better to implement an abstract class called DataLoader (or DataRepository). It would then be possible to implement as many concrete subclasses as needed to mimic the different ways of loading data. When the time comes to add a data loading step in a pipeline, the right sub-class (inheriting from DataLoader) suiting the context could be picked, so the pipeline doesn’t go through a useless chain of if/else statements to decide how to load data.<br></p><p>Here is another example to take this concept a step further. In compliance with OCP, it is possible to implement an effective strategy for choosing the right hyperparameters in a machine learning pipeline. Imagine that at a certain stage of a pipeline, you have to choose between the preprocessing method A and the preprocessing method B. The most tempting strategy (without considering OCP) would undoubtedly be to implement a full pipeline using method A and to implement another full pipeline using method B. We would then switch from one pipeline to another directly in the main file using a for loop. At first glance, this sounds like a good idea and it is the approach that most programmers and/or researchers in data science would recommend. The problem is that as new methods and models are to be implemented and tested, the main file must be modified to include a bigger and bigger polymorphism. This approach will therefore most likely generate a poor man's polymorphism directly in the main file. The main file is actually the worst place to implement this kind of polymorphism because it is outside the source project and its code is not …</p></div></div>

			<p>This is a tale of the intersection between thermal physics, cosmology, and a tiny
amount of computer science to answer a seemingly innocuous question: “How strong does
a password need to be for it to be physically impossible to brute-force, ever?”</p>
<p><a href="#conclusiontldr">TLDR</a> at the bottom.</p>
<p><em>Note: this post contains equations. Since none of the equations were long or
complex, I decided to just write them out in code blocks instead of using images or
MathML the way Wikipedia does.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I realize that advice on password strength can get outdated. As supercomputers grow
more powerful, password strength recommendations need to be updated to resist
stronger brute-force attacks. Passwords that are strong today might be weak in the
future. <strong>How long should a password be in order for it to be physically impossible
to brute-force, ever?</strong></p>
<p>This question might not be especially practical, but it’s fun to analyze and offers
interesting perspective regarding sane upper-limits on password strength.</p>
<h2 id="asking-the-right-question">Asking the right question</h2>
<p>Instead of predicting what tomorrow’s computers may be able to do, let’s examine the
<em>biggest possible brute-force attack</em> that the laws of physics can allow.</p>
<p>A supercomputer is probably faster than your phone; however, given enough time, both
are capable of doing the same calculations. If time isn’t the bottleneck, energy
usage is. More efficient computers can flip more bits with a finite amount of energy.</p>
<p>In other words, energy efficiency and energy availability are the two fundamental
bottlenecks of computing. What happens when a computer with the highest theoretical
energy efficiency is limited only by the mass-energy of <em>the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe">observable
universe</a>?</em></p>
<p>Let’s call this absolute unit of an energy-efficient computer the MOAC (Mother of All
Computers). For all classical computers that are made of matter, do work to compute,
and are bound by the conservation of energy, the MOAC represents a finite yet
unreachable limit of computational power. And yes, it can play Solitaire with
<em>amazing</em> framerates.</p>
<p>How strong should your password be for it to be safe from a brute-force attack by the
MOAC?</p>
<h3 id="quantifying-password-strength">Quantifying password strength.</h3>
<p>A good measure of password strength is <strong>entropy bits.</strong> The entropy bits in a
password is a base-2 logarithm of the number of guesses required to brute-force
it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>A brute-force attack that executes 2<sup>n</sup> guesses is certain to crack a
password with <em>n</em> entropy bits, and has a one-in-two chance of cracking a password
with <em>n</em>+1 entropy bits.</p>
<p>For scale, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES-256</a>
encryption is currently the industry standard for strong symmetric encryption. As the
name suggests, its keys have 256 bits of entropy; if your password has more than 256
entropy bits, then the AES-256 encryption algorithm is the bottleneck.</p>
<p>To calculate the entropy of a password, I recommend using a tool such as
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/wheeler">zxcvbn</a>
or <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Define a function <code>P</code>. <code>P</code> determines the probability that MOAC will correctly guess
a password with <code>n</code> bits of entropy after using <code>e</code> energy:</p>
<pre><code>P(n, e)
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>P(n, e) ≥ 1</code>, the MOAC will certainly guess your password before running out of
energy. The lower <code>P(n, e)</code> is, the less likely it is for the MOAC to guess your
password.</p>
<h2 id="caveats-and-estimates">Caveats and estimates</h2>
<p>I don’t have a strong physics background.</p>
<p>When estimating, we’ll prefer higher estimates that increase the odds of it guessing
a password; after all, the point of this exercise is to establish an <em>upper</em> limit on
password strength. We’ll also simplify: for instance, the MOAC will not waste any
heat, and the only way it can guess a password is through brute-forcing. Focusing on
too many details would defeat the point of this thought experiment.</p>
<p>I won’t address any particular encryption algorithms; this is just a pure and simple
brute-force attack given precomputed password entropy. Furthermore, quantum computers
can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm">Grover’s algorithm</a> for
an exponential speed-up; to account for quantum computers using Grover’s algorithm,
calculate <code>P(n/2, e)</code> instead.</p>
<p>Obviously, I’m not taking into account future mathematical advances; my crystal ball
broke after I asked it if humanity would ever develop the technology to make anime
real.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s always a non-zero probability of a brute-force attack guessing a
password with a given entropy. Literal “immunity” is impossible. Lowering this
probability to statistical insignificance renders our password practically immune to
brute-force attacks.</p>
<h2 id="computation">Computation</h2>
<p>How much energy does MOAC use per guess during a brute-force attack? In the context
of this thought experiment, this number should be unrealistically low. I settled on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KT_(energy)"><code>kT</code></a>. <code>k</code> represents the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant">Boltzmann
Constant</a> (about
1.381×10<sup>-23</sup> J/K) and <code>T</code> represents the temperature of the system. Their
product corresponds to the amount of heat required to create a 1 nat increase in a
system’s entropy.</p>
<p>A more involved approach to picking a good value might utilize the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%E2%80%93Einstein_relation">Plank-Einstein
relation</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also probably a better idea to make this value an estimate for flipping a single
bit, and to estimate the average number of bit-flips it takes to make a single
password guess. If that bothers you, pick a number <code>b</code> you believe to be a good
estimate for a bit-flip-count and calculate <code>P(n-b, e)</code> instead of <code>P(n, e)</code>.</p>
<p>What’s the temperature of the system? Three pieces of information help us find out:</p>
<ol>
<li>The MOAC is located somewhere in the observable universe</li>
<li>The MOAC will be consuming the entire observable universe</li>
<li>The universe is mostly empty</li>
</ol>
<p>A good value for <code>T</code> would be the average temperature of the entire observable
universe. The universe is mostly empty; <code>T</code> is around the temperature of cosmic
background radiation in space. The lowest reasonable estimate for this temperature is
2.7 degrees Kelvin.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> A lower temperature means less energy usage, less energy
usage allows more computations, and more computations raises the upper limit on
password strength.</p>
<p>Every guess, the MOAC expends <code>kT</code> energy. Let <code>E</code> = the total amount of energy the
MOAC can use; let <code>B</code> = the maximum number of guesses the MOAC can execute before
running out of energy.</p>
<pre><code>B = E/(kT)

<p>Now, given the maximum number of passwords the MOAC can guess <code>B</code> and the bits of
entropy in our password <code>n</code>, we have an equation for the probability that the MOAC
will guess our password:</p>
<pre><code>P(n,B) = B/2ⁿ
</code></pre>
<p>Plug in our expression for <code>B</code>:</p>
<pre><code>P(n,E) = E/(2ⁿkT)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="calculating-the-mass-energy-of-the-observable-universe">Calculating the mass-energy of the observable universe</h3>
<p>The MOAC can use the entire mass-energy of the observable universe.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Simply stuff
the observable universe into the attached 100% efficient furnace, turn on the burner,
and generate power for the computer. You might need to ask a friend for help.</p>
<p>Just how much energy is that? The mass-energy equivalence formula is quite simple:</p>
<pre><code>E = mc²
</code></pre>
<p>We’re trying to find <code>E</code> and we know <code>c</code>, the speed of light, is 299,792,458 m/s.
That leaves <code>m</code>. What’s the mass of the observable universe?</p>
<h3 id="calculating-the-critical-density-of-the-observable-universe">Calculating the critical density of the observable universe</h3>
<p>Critical density is smallest average density of matter required to <em>almost</em> slow the
expansion of the universe to a stop. Any more dense, and expansion will stop; any
less, and expansion will never stop.</p>
<p>Let <code>D</code> = critical density of the observable universe and <code>V</code> = volume of the
observable universe. Mass is the product of density and volume:</p>
<pre><code>m = DV
</code></pre>
<p>We can derive the value of D by solving for it in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations">Friedman
equations</a>:</p>
<pre><code>D = 3Hₒ²/(8πG)
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>G</code> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant">Gravitational
Constant</a> and <code>Hₒ</code> is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law">Hubble Constant</a>. <code>Hₒd</code> is the rate of
expansion at proper distance <code>d</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s assume the observable universe is a sphere, expanding at the speed of light
ever since the Big Bang.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The volume <code>V</code> of our spherical universe when given its
radius <code>r</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>V = (4/3)πr³
</code></pre>
<p>To find the radius of the observable universe <code>r</code>, we can use the age of the universe
<code>t</code>:</p>
<pre><code>r = ct
</code></pre>
<p>Hubble’s Law estimates the age of the universe to be around <code>1/Hₒ</code></p>
<h3 id="solving-for-e">Solving for E</h3>
<p>Let’s plug in all the derived values into our original equation for the mass of the
observable universe <code>m</code>:</p>
<pre><code>m = DV
</code></pre>
<p>Remember when I opened the article by saying that none of the equations would be long
or complex?</p>
<p>I lied.</p>
<pre><code>m = (3Hₒ²/(8πG))(4/3)π(ct)³
m = c³/(2GHₒ)

E = mc²
E = c⁵/(2GHₒ)
</code></pre>
<p>Yay, we found an expression for the total energy the MOAC can consume!</p>
<h2 id="final-solution">Final Solution</h2>
<pre><code>P(n,E) = E/(2ⁿkT)
P(n, c⁵/(2GHₒ)) = c⁵/(2GHₒ*2ⁿkT)
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s copy and paste the values for those constants from Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha:</p>
<ul>
<li>c = 299,792,458 m/s</li>
<li>G ≈ 6.67408×10<sup>-11</sup> m³/kg/s²</li>
<li>Hₒ ≈ 2.2×10<sup>-18</sup> Hz (uncertain; look up the Hubble tension)</li>
<li>T ≈ 2.7 K</li>
<li>k ≈ 1.3806503×10<sup>-23</sup> J/K</li>
</ul>
<p>Plugging those in and simplifying:</p>
<p><strong>P(n) ≈ 2.21×10<sup>92</sup> / 2<sup>n</sup></strong></p>
<p>Here are some sample outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>P(256) ≈ 1.9×10<sup>15</sup> (password certainly cracked after burning 1.9
quadrillionth of the mass-energy of the observable universe).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P(306.76) ≈ 1 (password certainly cracked after burning the mass-energy of the
observable universe)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P(310) ≈ 0.11 (about one in ten)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P(326.6) ≈ 1.1×10<sup>-6</sup> (about one in a million)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If your threat model is a bit smaller, simulate putting a smaller object into the
MOAC’s furnace. For example, the Earth has a mass of 5.972×10²⁴ kg; this gives the
MOAC a one-in-ten-trillion chance of cracking a password with 256 entropy bits and a
100% chance of cracking a 213-bit password.</p>
<h2 id="sample-unbreakable-passwords">Sample unbreakable passwords</h2>
<p>According to KeePassXC’s password generator, each of the following passwords has an
entropy between 330 and 340 bits.</p>
<p>Using the extended-ASCII character set:</p>
<pre><code>¦=¦FVõ)Çb^ÄwÎ¡=,°m°B9®;&gt;3[°r:t®Ú"$3CG¨/Bq-y\;
</code></pre>
<p>Using the characters on a standard US QWERTY layout:</p>
<pre><code>%nUzL2XR&amp;Tz5hJfp2tiYBoBBX^vWo3`g6H#JSC#N6gWm#hVdD~ziD$YHW
</code></pre>
<p>Using only alphanumeric characters:</p>
<pre><code>tp8D69CGWE5t5a9si5XNsw32CKyCafh8qGrKWLwE6KJHpGyUtcJDWpgRz5mFNx
</code></pre>
<p>An excerpt from a religious text with a trailing space:</p>
<pre><code>I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, 
</code></pre>
<p>Don’t use actual excerpts from pre-existing works as your password.</p>
<h2 id="conclusiontldr">Conclusion/TLDR</h2>
<p>Question: How much entropy should a password have to ensure it will <em>never</em> be
vulnerable to a brute-force attack? Can an impossibly efficient computer–the
MOAC–crack your password?</p></section></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Ctrl + Alt + Delete the President.</strong> Last week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/07/us/capitol-building-trump">after a violent riot at the capital</a>, Twitter and Facebook <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/technology/trump-twitter-ban.html">erased the President of the United States from social media</a>. He was further banned from, or severely restricted from communicating by: <a href="https://www.axios.com/platforms-social-media-ban-restrict-trump-d9e44f3c-8366-4ba9-a8a1-7f3114f920f1.html">Reddit, Twitch, Shopify (??), Snapchat, TikTok, and Stripe.</a> Within 24 hours, amidst a chorus of “it’s just the free market, losers, if you don’t like it build your own app,” Google and Apple worked in concert to remove Parler, the “free speech” alternative social media app popular on the political right, from their app stores. Amazon followed the move with the equivalent of tech industry napalm, taking the extraordinary step of suspending Parler from using Amazon Web Services, effectively shutting the company down. The loosely-framed charge against both Trump and Parler was incitement of violence and insurrection. There were no trials. There was no evidence presented for any crime formally argued. This is law in the age of corporate oligarchy. It is purposefully ambiguous, it is uncompromising, and when you run afoul of the powers that be, there is no recourse. Not even for the “most powerful man in the world.” </p><p>This of course begs the question: who is actually in charge right now? </p><p>Today, the internet is a life-critical layer of our world. In some sense, what happens on the internet —&nbsp;from payments to communication —&nbsp;is all that matters, as without it few things of significance in the “real world” are possible. You would be forgiven for not remembering that Trump was impeached last year, as it meant practically nothing. But erasing him from the internet? If this sticks, and Trump can no longer communicate or raise funds at scale, a small handful of unelected tech executives just ended a president’s political career. In theory, they can legally do this to anyone, which means they are effectively the most powerful people alive. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-should-we-address-the-growing-power-shift-from-washington-to-silicon-valley/2018/11/19/1470eb9a-e9e4-11e8-bbdb-72fdbf9d4fed_story.html">Silicon Valley is our nation’s shadow capital, argues Katherine Boyle,</a> and welcome to the shadow state. It is not a democracy. </p><p>The immediate arguments both in favor and against Trump’s censorship were equally ridiculous. From the camp against, we were told the technology industry’s actions were comparable to Chinese-style censorship. This is not even close to true. The Chinese Communist Party executes political dissidents, and while our nation is not immune to such governance, and many Americans do perversely seem to want CCP-style censorship, such dystopia has not yet descended on our country. As Dan Primack correctly notes: &nbsp;</p><p>From the camp in favor of vanishing Trump — people who have warned us of some ambiguous corporate overreach for decades, which I suppose in hindsight only ever meant “money people bad” —&nbsp;we were told this is simply what a free market looks like. Free speech cannot be constitutionally guaranteed where private corporations are concerned, as it infringes on the owner of a company’s rights to free association and speech (again, an interesting point of concern from the “business is always wrong” corner of the commentariat). If you don’t want to be vanished, we’re told, build your own sprawling, multibillion-dollar, duopolistic communications platform. But legally speaking, this is in the first place not straightforward. </p><p>In <em>Pruneyard Shopping Center Vs. Robins</em>, <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/583/pruneyard-shopping-center-v-robins#:~:text=Robins%20(1980)&amp;text=In%20PruneYard%20Shopping%20Center%20v,afoul%20of%20the%20Fifth%20Amendment">the Supreme Court ruled California could protect political protesters from being evicted from private property.</a> This case built on a body of law that flourished throughout the 60s and 70s, and included such cases as <em>Marsh v. Alabama</em> (1946), <em>Lloyd Corporation Ltd. v. Tanner</em> (1972), and <em>Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza</em> (1968). We haven’t even touched the <em>Sherman Antitrust Act</em>, or the much-discussed <em>Section 230</em>, and this is already complicated. In any case, the notion one should simply build a competitor platform if he isn’t happy with his Twitter ban has never really been serious, as everyone who works in tech is well aware it isn’t possible to build such a platform absent ideological submission to the shadow state. This was plainly evidenced by Parler’s fate last week. </p><p>If a natural right can’t meaningfully be exercised, can it really be said to exist? David Sacks has been absolute fire on this question all week:</p><p>The American Bill of Rights was written at the time of the printing press, a machine that anyone could buy, the street corner, on which anyone could sell a paper, a system of public roads and walks for distribution, and thousands of small businesses that comprised the “market,” any one of which, absolutely, could refuse to sell a paper, but no one or two (or five in obvious collusion) were capable of censoring a single voice out of public existence. Today, the internet is the gateway through which almost our entire democracy is conducted. It is where we go to learn about the world, almost without exception. It is our contemporary printing press, our street corner, our public roads and walks, and our market, all combined and dominated by a small handful of giants from the same class, of roughly the same politics, and from mostly the same region. </p><p>Should this tiny, unelected group of people so-empowered be allowed to vanish any voice from public, for any reason? Is this truly in keeping with the spirit of the Constitution? Separate from the legal questions: is this the kind of country you want to live in? </p><p>We are in danger, here —&nbsp;clearly, come on,<em> you know that this is true</em> —&nbsp;of something very dark. </p><p><strong>Ok but insurrection though.</strong> I recently spoke with a tech executive who supported Trump’s ban from public existence. He asked what theoretical action I would think worthy of such incredible censorship from the industry. A coup? Insurrection? What about incitement of violence? Herein lies tech’s only reasonable defense of itself, and the most popular argument in favor of Trump’s purge from the internet: he was hurting people. Isn’t that enough to act? The problem is the evidence here is ambiguous, and the argument lends itself to valid accusations of hypocrisy, as all of these things have been perpetrated by other political leaders, both at home and abroad, and often in a manner not ambiguous at all. The position is also somewhat naively oblivious of a political leader’s role, which is —&nbsp;I hate to break it to you, folks —&nbsp;violence. This is not to say violence is okay. This is not to excuse any of Trump’s deeply unhelpful ambiguity. This is only to say the logical consequence of the technology industry’s extraordinary actions last week must necessarily be massive, global censorship. Let’s set aside for a moment the question of whether or not censorship of this kind would be healthy. Is it really what our shadow state is planning? Because if dramatically accelerated speech crackdowns aren’t on the menu, tech’s actions sum only to narrow, draconian, partisan censorship. </p><p>It should go without saying I’m against activist political violence, and think everyone who participated in last week’s riot at the capitol should be tried and, when convicted, jailed. But I’ve said it anyway, repeatedly, both specifically in the context of the capitol riot and consistently, in every other context we’ve seen such behavior, throughout most of our batshit crazy 2020. I have felt compelled to speak about this issue as often as I have because what took place in Washington last week was not an outlier event. </p><p>The capitol riot was the latest in a string of unacceptably violent outbursts for which media personalities, activists, and politicians have spent the last year apologizing, and in many cases, by the standards to which we are now holding Trump —&nbsp;“dog whistles,” contributions to a “culture of hate” or “violence” —&nbsp;actively encouraging. Some cases have been less ambiguous. “Non-violence is an important tool for protests,” wrote Slate magazine this summer amidst a kind of chaos we have not seen on American streets for over half a century, <a href="https://twitter.com/Slate/status/1268415955937513473?s=20">“but so is violence.”</a> People were killed at the capitol, and property, both public and private, was destroyed. A federal building was invaded. All of these things are insane, and wrong, and intolerable. They are also illegal. Again: <em>these people should be tried, and when convicted sent to prison</em>. But have we so soon forgotten <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/goodbye-summer-of-love-11607898398">our summer of love in the CHAZ</a>? Or do we simply believe the MAGA Viking more likely to succeed in “insurrection” than the unhinged Stalinist baristas in Seattle explicitly calling for revolution? </p><p>I’ve been told repeatedly this week, while raising questions about a scale of censorship we have literally never before seen, that at least one of the capitol rioters was planning an assassination. This is chilling. If proven true, it will unfortunately also not be unique. Have we already memory-holed the Republican Congressional baseball shooting, where Congressman Steve Scalise and three of his colleagues were nearly killed by an unhinged Bernie Sanders stan? And how do we think this would-be assassin was radicalized? Carrier pigeon? No, the internet appears to be catalyzing significant political radicalization. The problem is deep, and broad. It is also by the way something <a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/tether-part-i">I write about not infrequently.</a> I’m glad the industry is finally concerned with the phenomenon, but is Jack Dorsey really prepared to own the issue? Because I’m sorry, but the problem isn’t Trump’s Twitter account, no matter how easy that would make this —&nbsp;in a sense, the problem appears to be Twitter. I’m pretty sure it’s driving us insane. </p><p>Gather round, friends. Have I told you yet about the time (this Christmas Eve) when a wildly-popular Marxist podcaster expressed a desire to see me dead in direct response to a piece I wrote about his fiancé’s boss, my San Francisco district supervisor? What about the time, immediately after, when his followers asked for my address, presumably to kill me? Do yourself a favor and keyword search the word “guillotine,” or the hammer and sickle emoji (which, while we’re on the topic, why the fuck does that exist?). Here’s …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-3d5c50e8=""><p data-v-3d5c50e8="">This article introduces an approach to structure FastAPI applications with multiple services in mind. The proposed structure decomposes the individual services into packages and modules, following principles of abstraction and separation of concerns. The code discussed below can also be studied in its entirety in a dedicated companion GitHub repository.</p>

<h2 id="fastapi--building-high-performing-python-apis" data-v-3d5c50e8="">FastAPI – Building High-performing Python APIs</h2>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8=""><a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">FastAPI</a> is a fast, highly intuitive and well-documented API framework based on <a href="https://www.starlette.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Starlette</a>. Despite being relatively new, it's gaining <a href="https://star-history.t9t.io/#tiangolo/fastapi" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">strong adoption</a> by the developer community – it is even already being adopted in production by corporates like <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-dispatch-da4b8a2a8072" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/26" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">Following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">UNIX philosophy</a> of <em data-v-3d5c50e8="">"doing one thing, and doing it well"</em>, separating parts of the application according to their task improves code readability and maintainability; ultimately reducing complexity. The main benefits of structuring applications in this way:</p>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8=""><strong data-v-3d5c50e8="">Separation of concerns</strong> – Decomposing the application into modules performing a single job. This allows accepting requests (top down: controller → service → data access) and returning responses (bottom up: data access → service → controller) with a clear separation of what particular functionality should be implemented in which particular module, reducing cognitive load for development.</p>
<div data-v-220acfa8="" data-v-3d5c50e8=""><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6c6e6d1a9a2252c24c72049f74382abee765095c/9408a/_nuxt/img/request-response.df4b985.jpg" width="100%" height="" alt="Request-Response Flow across Application Layers" data-v-220acfa8=""></p><p data-v-220acfa8="">Request-Response Flow across Application Layers</p></div>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8=""><strong data-v-3d5c50e8="">Abstraction</strong> — Components of the application are designed in a reusable way. For instance, <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">ServiceResult</code> is implemented as a generic outcome of a service operation (which may be successful and return a response, or unsuccessful and raise an exception) able to be used by all services of the app, keeping code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">DRY</a>.</p>
<div data-v-220acfa8="" data-v-3d5c50e8=""><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/fc6bd09df8db15e783bd11117eba8003350f04cc/465f4/_nuxt/img/directory-structure.0c63d71.jpg" width="100%" height="" alt="Directory Structure Overview" data-v-220acfa8=""></p><p data-v-220acfa8="">Directory Structure Overview</p></div>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">The granular nature of namespacing allow to distinguish parts of the application, e.g., routes versus business logic belonging to a particular service – grouping similar tasks together, while keeping distinct parts separated. Four principal packages are needed. For each service, one module is added to these four packages. For instance, a service called <em data-v-3d5c50e8="">"Foo"</em> requires the following modules (discussed in detail below):</p>
<div data-v-3d5c50e8=""><pre data-v-3d5c50e8=""><code data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./routers/  foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Router instance and routes</span></span>
<span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./services/ foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Business logic (including CRUD helpers)</span></span>
<span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./schemas/  foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Data "schemas" (e.g., Pydantic models)</span></span>
<span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">./models/   foo.py </span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># Database models (e.g., SQLAlchemy models)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">The four principal packages are complemented by two generic packages which contain application-specific (and not service-specific) functionality, such as configuration or utility functions.</p>
<h2 id="controller-layer--routes" data-v-3d5c50e8="">Controller Layer – Routes</h2>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">Within <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">main</code>, the application is instantiated and all routers are included. Additionally, middlewares and/or exception handlers are implemented. The example application discussed below is based on a service called <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">Foo</code>, which requires a number of routes. To handle custom exceptions occurring at the service layer, as instances of class <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">AppExceptionCase</code>, a respective exception handler is added to the application.</p>
<div data-v-3d5c50e8=""><pre data-v-3d5c50e8=""><code data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""><span data-v-3d5c50e8="">1</span><span data-v-3d5c50e8=""># ...</span></span>

<p>If you have done enough of that kind of programming, you’ll immediately see how Zig is tackling relevant problems, but if you don’t have such experience, then the front page could very easily look like a never-ending list of things you don’t have an opinion about.</p>

<p>When the Zig project started, its audience was almost exclusively people with a lot of relevant experience, since those would be the only ones able to evaluate the promise and limits of the newborn language.</p>
<p>Today we’re at a point where Zig is becoming increasingly compelling for people coming from all layers of the stack. People have written <a href="https://github.com/Hejsil/mecha" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">parser combinators</a>, <a href="https://github.com/prime31/zig-gamekit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">2d game rendering libraries</a>, <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/futureproof/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a live editor for GPU shaders</a>, and much more. </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong: all these projects have been developed by early adopters who wanted to try <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/buggy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a new and exciting</a> ecosystem. Zig is not yet stable, and won’t be for a while, but we’re getting there, and in the meantime Zig is already delivering big time on at least one promise: <strong>making it possible to learn more about programming without having to first buy into vast amounts of accidental complexity</strong>.</p>
<p>This redesign had two main goals and, as always, a few practical constraints. When it comes to constraints, it’s mostly my web design and project management skills, and the scope that can be addressed in no more than a couple of months, since we needed a new website <em>now</em> and not one year from now. Let’s now take a look at the goals.</p>
<h2 id="a-friendlier-first-impression"><a href="#a-friendlier-first-impression" aria-label="a friendlier first impression permalink"></a>A friendlier first impression</h2>
<p>The first goal addressed stems directly from the introduction of this blog post: we wanted to make the website more appealing to people that are looking at Zig as an opportunity to learn more about programming. For this reason, the lengthy breakdown has been moved to the Learn section and, in its place, we now have three short paragraphs that highlight some of Zig’s major features, followed by a code sample that gives you a first taste of the syntax. </p>
<p>Above the main introduction we still have the same slogan as before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining <strong>robust</strong>, <strong>optimal</strong>, and <strong>reusable</strong> software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrew did an outstanding job at formulating it and I believe it’s the one bit of the entire website that should probably never change.</p>
<p>Next to the slogan there’s a new cluster of buttons. This is where I wanted to come up with an interesting compromise: we follow the popular trend of putting a big call to action for new users, but we also use that block of space to create a single hotspot where regulars can get access to critical information. </p>

<p>My hope is for the big button to make new visitors become aware of that block and that, over time, checking there for docs and new releases just becomes muscle memory. That said, I know we’ll have to tweak the design once the auto-generated docs for the standard library become good enough for the front page.</p>
<p>Below everything I just described, we introduce the community and the Zig Software Foundation. The Zig project has grown to a point where governance matters and we want to show we’re doing everything the right way, up to the point of having formed a <a href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">nonprofit organization with a clear scope and mission statement</a>.</p>
<h2 id="internationalization"><a href="#internationalization" aria-label="internationalization permalink"></a>Internationalization</h2>
<p>The second goal of this redesign was to open the door to hosting multiple translations of the website. Having an i18n-enabled website is beneficial for multiple reasons: it helps with the first goal (i.e. help a wider range of programmers get started with Zig), it’s a good way of getting more use out of the informative materials we’ll progressively add to the website, and it’s also well aligned with the mission of the Zig Software Foundation. Lastly, I’m personally invested in the idea that we must ensure we don’t leave it to third parties to be the sole owners of all content available in a given language, as we’ve already seen bad actors exploit their position to implement a form of cultural arbitrage.</p>
<p>We’re well aware that keeping up with translations to multiple languages can quickly become an effort black hole. For this reason, I’ve tried to make sure the tooling would help in making the process as smooth as possible (more on that later), and I’ve also made sure to clarify in the design how translations are community-provided and thus best-effort.</p>

<p>At the moment of publication, the website can only offer <a href="https://ziglang.org/translations/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">an Italian translation</a> written by me. Italian was chosen out of necessity (i.e. it’s the only other language I speak), but it served the purpose of making me try out the ergonomics of producing a translation, and it can also act as documentation for others.</p>
<p>Finally, I should point out that there are some parts of the website we don’t plan to translate, like the News section, for example. This is another choice made out of necessity: we want to restrict translations to content with a long shelf life to reduce the amount of effort, but I don’t exclude that one day we might have enough resources to get rid of this compromise.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-details"><a href="#implementation-details" aria-label="implementation details permalink"></a>Implementation details</h2>
<p>The new website is statically generated by <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hugo</a>. I also considered <a href="https://www.getzola.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Zola</a>, but its i18n support is not complete yet. The website lists a number of Zig code snippets, with relative output. Andrew originally implemented a program to produce release notes and language reference. That program takes in code samples, applies syntax highlighting, runs the code, and reports the output as HTML (it even retains colors from the terminal). I took the original code and packaged it as a tool with a more general interface. I called it <a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/zig-doctest" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">zig-doctest</a> and it can be easily integrated with all kinds of static content generation tools.</p>
<p>Now a successful CI build of the <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ziglang/zig</a> repository triggers a build of the website, allowing us to catch outdated code examples much more easily. This addresses concerns raised in the past by people that would occasionally stumble upon a broken code sample.</p>
<p>Testing all code snippets is not instant as some tests include running the executable and capturing its output, so I made sure to integrate with Hugo’s caching system. I also noticed that Hugo processes tags sequentially within the same page, so I also <a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/hugo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">added to it</a> a warmup routine that makes sure to parallelize the testing when loading the development server the first time.</p>
<p>The result is a very enjoyable development experience that only depends on Zig and two additional executables (Hugo and doctest) to be able to develop the Zig website locally, resulting in an acceptable experience for potential contributors. </p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this post explains adequately the intent of this work and the practical limits of its execution. There’s still more work to do, but this seems a reasonable milestone for a first release, so I’m looking forward to working alongside the community to improve and add translations to the website.</p>
<p>For the next iteration I’ll work on improving accessibility, but first I have to focus on <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/zig_programming_language/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FOSDEM, since we have a Zig dev room</a> and I have a bunch of duties to attend to. </p>
<p>When I first discovered Zig, I saw it as a way for me to learn more about all the aspects of programming I missed when working with interpreted and/or garbage-collected languages. Turns out I got to learn that <a href="https://ziglang.org/news/announcing-zig-software-foundation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">and much more</a>, and I can’t tell you how excited I am about what’s to come. Despite everything, 2020 was a great year for Zig, and I fully expect 2021 to be even better.</p></div></div>]]>

Since the data volume was only about 1.75GB containing around 2 million chess games, I was skeptical of using Hadoop for the task, but I can understand his goal of learning and having fun with mrjob and EMR. Since the problem is basically just to look at the result lines of each file and aggregate the different results, it seems ideally suited to stream processing with shell commands. I tried this out, and for the same amount of data I was able to use my laptop to get the results in about 12 seconds (processing speed of about 270MB/sec), while the Hadoop processing took about 26 minutes (processing speed of about 1.14MB/sec).</p><p>After reporting that the time required to process the data with 7 c1.medium machine in the cluster took 26 minutes, Tom remarks</p><blockquote><p>This is probably better than it would take to run serially on my machine but probably not as good as if I did some kind of clever multi-threaded application locally.</p></blockquote><p>This is absolutely correct, although even serial processing may beat 26 minutes. Although Tom was doing the project for fun, often people use Hadoop and other so-called <em>Big Data (tm)</em> tools for real-world processing and analysis jobs that can be done faster with simpler tools and different techniques.</p><p>One especially under-used approach for data processing is using standard shell tools and commands. The benefits of this approach can be massive, since creating a data pipeline out of shell commands means that all the processing steps can be done in parallel. This is basically like having your own <a href="https://storm-project.net/">Storm</a> cluster on your local machine. Even the concepts of Spouts, Bolts, and Sinks transfer to shell pipes and the commands between them. You can pretty easily construct a stream processing pipeline with basic commands that will have extremely good performance compared to many modern <em>Big Data (tm)</em> tools.</p><p>An additional point is the batch versus streaming analysis approach. Tom mentions in the beginning of the piece that after loading 10000 games and doing the analysis locally, that he gets a bit short on memory. This is because all game data is loaded into RAM for the analysis. However, considering the problem for a bit, it can be easily solved with streaming analysis that requires basically no memory at all. The resulting stream processing pipeline we will create will be over 235 times faster than the Hadoop implementation and use virtually no memory.</p><h3 id="learn-about-the-data"><a href="#learn-about-the-data">Learn about the data</a></h3><p>The first step in the pipeline is to get the data out of the PGN files. Since I had no idea what kind of format this was, I checked it out on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation">Wikipedia</a>.</p><pre><code>[Event "F/S Return Match"]
[Site "Belgrade, Serbia Yugoslavia|JUG"]
[Date "1992.11.04"]
[Round "29"]
[White "Fischer, Robert J."]
[Black "Spassky, Boris V."]
[Result "1/2-1/2"]
(moves from the game follow...)
</code></pre><p>We are only interested in the results of the game, which only have 3 real outcomes. The 1-0 case means that white won, the 0-1 case means that black won, and the 1/2-1/2 case means the game was a draw. There is also a <em>-</em> case meaning the game is ongoing or cannot be scored, but we ignore that for our purposes.</p><h3 id="acquire-sample-data"><a href="#acquire-sample-data">Acquire sample data</a></h3><p>The first thing to do is get a lot of game data. This proved more difficult than I thought it would be, but after some looking around online I found a git repository on GitHub from <a href="https://github.com/rozim/ChessData">rozim</a> that had plenty of games. I used this to compile a set of 3.46GB of data, which is about twice what Tom used in his test. The next step is to get all that data into our pipeline.</p><h3 id="build-a-processing-pipeline"><a href="#build-a-processing-pipeline">Build a processing pipeline</a></h3><p><em>If you are following along and timing your processing, don’t forget to clear your OS page cache as otherwise you won’t get valid processing times.</em></p><p>Shell commands are great for data processing pipelines because you get parallelism for free. For proof, try a simple example in your terminal.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sleep <span>3</span> | <span>echo</span> <span>"Hello world."</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Intuitively it may seem that the above will sleep for 3 seconds and then print <code>Hello world</code> but in fact both steps are done at the same time. This basic fact is what can offer such great speedups for simple non-IO-bound processing systems capable of running on a single machine.</p><p>Before starting the analysis pipeline, it is good to get a reference for how fast it could be and for this we can simply dump the data to <code>/dev/null</code>.</p><p>In this case, it takes about 13 seconds to go through the 3.46GB, which is about 272MB/sec. This would be a kind of upper-bound on how quickly data could be processed on this system due to IO constraints.</p><p>Now we can start on the analysis pipeline, the first step of which is using <code>cat</code> to generate the stream of data.</p><p>Since only the result lines in the files are interesting, we can simply scan through all the data files, and pick out the lines containing ‘Results’ with <code>grep</code>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cat *.pgn | grep <span>"Result"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This will give us only the <code>Result</code> lines from the files. Now if we want, we can simply use the <code>sort</code> and <code>uniq</code> commands in order to get a list of all the unique items in the file along with their counts.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cat *.pgn | grep <span>"Result"</span> | sort | uniq -c
</code></pre></div><p>This is a very straightforward analysis pipeline, and gives us the results in about 70 seconds. While we can certainly do better, assuming linear scaling this would have taken the Hadoop cluster approximately 52 minutes to process.</p><p>In order to reduce the speed further, we can take out the <code>sort | uniq</code> steps from the pipeline, and replace them with AWK, which is a wonderful tool/language for event-based data processing.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cat *.pgn | grep <span>"Result"</span> | awk <span>'{ split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This will take each result record, split it on the hyphen, and take the character immediately to the left, which will be a 0 in the case of a win for black, a 1 in the case of a win for white, or a 2 in the case of a draw. Note that <code>$0</code> is a built-in variable that represents the entire record.</p><p>This reduces the running time to approximately 65 seconds, and since we’re processing twice as much data this is a speedup of around 47 times.</p><p>So even at this point we already have a speedup of around 47 with a naive local solution. Additionally, the memory usage is effectively zero since the only data stored is the actual counts, and incrementing 3 integers is almost free in memory space terms. However, looking at <code>htop</code> while this is running shows that <code>grep</code> is currently the bottleneck with full usage of a single CPU core.</p><h3 id="parallelize-the-bottlenecks"><a href="#parallelize-the-bottlenecks">Parallelize the bottlenecks</a></h3><p>This problem of unused cores can be fixed with the wonderful <code>xargs</code> command, which will allow us to parallelize the <code>grep</code>. Since <code>xargs</code> expects input in a certain way, it is safer and easier to use <code>find</code> with the <code>-print0</code> argument in order to make sure that each file name being passed to <code>xargs</code> is null-terminated. The corresponding <code>-0</code> tells <code>xargs</code> to expected null-terminated input. Additionally, the <code>-n</code> how many inputs to give each process and the <code>-P</code> indicates the number of processes to run in parallel. Also important to be aware of is that such a parallel pipeline doesn’t guarantee delivery order, but this isn’t a problem if you are used to dealing with distributed processing systems. The <code>-F</code> for <code>grep</code> indicates that we are only matching on fixed strings and not doing any fancy regex, and can offer a small speedup, which I did not notice in my testing.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P4 grep -F <span>"Result"</span> | gawk <span>'{ split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print NR, white, black, draw }'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This results in a run time of about 38 seconds, which is an additional 40% or so reduction in processing time from parallelizing the <code>grep</code> step in our pipeline. This gets us up to approximately 77 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.</p><p>Although we have improved the performance dramatically by parallelizing the <code>grep</code> step in our pipeline, we can actually remove this entirely by having <code>awk</code> filter the input records (lines in this case) and only operate on those containing the string “Result”.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P4 awk <span>'/Result/ { split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You may think that would be the correct solution, but this will output the results of <strong>each</strong> file individually, when we want to aggregate them all together. The resulting correct implementation is conceptually very similar to what the MapReduce implementation would be.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n4 -P4 awk <span>'/Result/ { split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++ } END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span> | awk <span>'{games += $1; white += $2; black += $3; draw += $4; } END { print games, white, black, draw }'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>By adding the second awk step at the end, we obtain the aggregated game information as desired.</p><p>This further improves the speed dramatically, achieving a running time of about 18 seconds, or about 174 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.</p><p>However, we can make it a bit faster still by using <a href="https://invisible-island.net/mawk/mawk.html">mawk</a>, which is often a drop-in replacement for <code>gawk</code> and can offer better performance.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n4 -P4 mawk <span>'/Result/ { split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++ } END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span> | mawk <span>'{games += $1; white += $2; black += $3; draw += $4; } END { print games, white, black, draw }'</span>

This past weekend, on January 9th, we celebrated 10 years since <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/337c3f2d569a42ebd5fcab6fef18c5e012f9be5b">the first commit to the Elixir repository</a>. While I personally don’t consider <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> to be 10 years old yet - the language that became what Elixir is today <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/6052352b6281752b905b30eb5b08fac0f51f68cd">surfaced only 14 months later</a> - a decade is a mark to celebrate!</p>
<p>
The goal of this post is to focus on the current state of some projects in the ecosystem and then briefly highlight a few of the exciting efforts coming over the next months.</p>
<h2>
Recap: The language goals</h2>
<p>
When I started working on Elixir, I personally had the ambition of using it for building scalable and robust web applications. However, I didn’t want Elixir to be tied to the web. My goal was to design an <em>extensible</em> language with a diverse ecosystem. Elixir aims to be a general purpose language and allows developers to extend it to new domains.</p>
<p>
Given Elixir is built on top of Erlang and Erlang is used for networking and distributed systems, Elixir would naturally be a good fit in those domains too, as long as I didn’t screw things up. The Erlang VM is essential to everything we do in Elixir, which is why <em>compatibility</em> has become a language goal too.</p>
<p>
I also wanted the language to be <em>productive</em>, especially by focusing on the tooling. Learning a functional programming language is a new endeavor for most developers. Consequently their first experiences getting started with the language, setting up a new project, searching for documentation, and debugging should go as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>
Extensibility, compatibility, and productivity are the goals we built the language upon.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Elixir in production</h2>
<p>
Last year we started <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/cases.html">a series of articles on companies using Elixir in production on the official website</a>. As of today, we have 7 production cases listed with more coming this year! Overall it is very exciting to see many different companies using a variety of business models and industries running Elixir in production.</p>
<p>
Companies like <a href="https://www.brex.com/">Brex</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/06/23/growing-with-elixir-at-brex/">case</a>), <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">case</a>), <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a>, <a href="https://www.podium.com/">Podium</a>, and <a href="https://salesloft.com/">SalesLoft</a> have reached <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)">“unicorn status”</a> and rely heavily on Elixir. Startups like <a href="https://www.joinblvd.com/">Boulevard</a> (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/elixirtalk/episode-166-feat-sean-stavropoulos">podcast</a>), <a href="https://community.com/">Community</a>, <a href="https://duffel.com/">Duffel</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/12/10/integrating-travel-with-elixir-at-duffel/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.ockam.io/">Ockam</a>, <a href="https://www.mux.com/">Mux</a>, <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, <a href="https://remote.com/">Remote</a>, and <a href="https://www.v7labs.com/">V7</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2021/01/13/orchestrating-computer-vision-with-elixir/">case</a>) also use Elixir and have received funding in the last year or two. Elixir is also used within known brands and enterprises such as <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/">Bleacher Report</a>, <a href="https://www.change.org/">Change.org</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">case</a>), <a href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/09/24/paas-with-elixir-at-Heroku/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a>, <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/">PepsiCo</a>, and <a href="https://www.therealreal.com/">TheRealReal</a>.</p>
<p>
There is also a special category of startups that run Elixir alonside an open source model, such as <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a>, <a href="https://app.supabase.io/">Supabase</a>, <a href="https://logflare.app/">Logflare</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/11-logflare-is-a-log-management-and-event-analytics-platform">podcast</a>), and <a href="https://hex.pm/">Hex.pm</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/19-hexpm-is-elixirs-official-package-manager">podcast</a>) itself. Still on the open source front, you will find projects like <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> and <a href="https://changelog.com/">Changelog</a>. There also many small scale and hobby projects that use Elixir for a productive and joyful development experience.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Diverse ecosystem</h2>
<p>
Today, Elixir has a diverse ecosystem that works on a wide range of domains and industries. Let’s take a look at some examples.</p>
<h3>
Web</h3>
<p>
Most developers are familiar with using Elixir for web development thanks to <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/">the Phoenix web framework</a>. Phoenix gained traction in the ecosystem because it was the first to fully leverage the language and the platform for building real-time applications besides the usual MVC (Model-View-Controller) offering.</p>
<p>
It all started with Phoenix Channels, as a bi-directional communication between clients and servers, and Phoenix PubSub, which uses Erlang’s distributed compatibilities to broadcast messages across nodes. As far as I know, Phoenix was the first major web framework to provide a multi-node web real-time solution completely out-of-the-box. Regardless if you are using one node or ten nodes, everything just works, with minimal configuration and dependencies.</p>
<p>
Phoenix has matured a lot since its first stable release. Phoenix v1.2 included <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Phoenix Presence</a>, that allows developers to track which users, IoT devices, etc are connected to your cluster right now. No databases or external dependencies required! This is one of the problems that look deceptively simple at first, but once you outline all scalability, performance, and fault-tolerance requirements, it <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/11/17/real-time-collaboration-with-elixir-at-slab/">becomes quite complex</a>. Luckily, Phoenix is running on a platform that excels at these problems, and I am not aware of any other framework that provides such a lean and elegant solution as part of its default stack.</p>
<p>
Most recently, <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix LiveView</a> was released and brought new ways to build rich, real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML, inspiring developers to attempt similar solutions for other languages and frameworks. You can read the <a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/12/12/phoenix-liveview-interactive-real-time-apps-no-need-to-write-javascript">original announcement</a> or <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5">learn how to build a real-time Twitter clone in 15 minutes</a>. As part of the <em>Live</em> family, we have also announced <a href="https://twitter.com/josevalim/status/1250846714665357315">Phoenix LiveDashboard</a>, making monitoring and instrumentation a first-class citizen for Phoenix applications.</p>
<h3>
Embedded and IoT</h3>
<p>
While I always expected Elixir to shine for building web applications, I was taken by surprise when I heard about the <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves platform</a> for creating high-end embedded applications. However, once I learned their premise, it all made sense: writing embedded systems <em>is</em> complicated. Reasoning about failures is hard. So what if we could leverage the decades of lessons learnt by Erlang/OTP to design embedded applications? What if a fault on the Wi-Fi driver could be fixed by having a supervisor simply restart it? After all, the first major use of Erlang/OTP was in an embedded system, the Ericsson AXD301 ATM switch.</p>
<p>
Nerves brings the Elixir ecosystem and the battle-tested Erlang VM to edge computing, providing a rich developer experience using proven technology. Nerves started as a one step process for turning an Elixir project into a complete software image for common hardware devices. Today, Nerves is being used in production in industrial automation, machine learning, consumer electronics and more, with <a href="https://farm.bot/">Farmbot</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/08/20/embedded-elixir-at-farmbot/">case</a>) and <a href="https://www.rosepoint.com/">Rose Point Navigation</a> being two of the most notable examples.</p>
<p>
The Nerves team also created <a href="https://www.nerves-hub.org/">NervesHub</a>, a fully open-source device management system. Combining all these technologies makes Elixir a comprehensive language for building end-to-end IoT platforms.</p>
<h3>
Data ingestion and pipelines</h3>
<p>
Shortly after Elixir v1.0 was released, the Elixir Core Team and I started looking into abstractions for tackling data ingestions and data pipelines in Elixir. We ran through a couple designs until we eventually <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2016/07/14/announcing-genstage/">landed on GenStage</a>: a behaviour for exchanging data with back-pressure between Elixir processes and external systems. For an introduction, make sure to check out <a href="https://youtu.be/srtMWzyqdp8?t=242">my keynote introducing both GenStage and Flow</a>.</p>
<p>
Today, almost 5 years later, GenStage has been used by many industries and has become one of the factors driving Elixir adoption. For example, you can read how both <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">Discord</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">Change.org</a> have built systems on Elixir and GenStage that handle spikes and run at massive scale.</p>
<p>
However, GenStage was just the beginning. In 2019, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOExnT1PYjs">we announced Broadway</a>, which is a higher-level abstraction on top of GenStage that makes building data ingestion pipelines a breeze. We originally released with Amazon SQS support. Nowadays, RabbitMQ, Google Cloud PubSub, Apache Kafka, and other sources (known as producers in Broadway terms) are also available.</p>
<h3>
Audio/Video streaming</h3>
<p>
Since the Erlang VM was designed for scalable network processing, one can expect to also be an excellent platform for audio and video streaming. However, if you also wanted to process and transform those streams on the fly, the situation becomes much more complicated as you likely have to integrate with native code.</p>
<p>
Luckily, the tables have turned when Erlang/OTP 20 was released a couple years ago with the so-called Dirty NIFs. The Erlang VM always had the ability to invoke native code, but this native code could not run for long, as to not interfere with the preemptive features of the Erlang runtime. Dirty NIFs allow developers to tag native code either as IO or CPU bound, which runs on specific threads. Between ports (I/O based), NIFs, Dirty NIFs, and remote nodes, developers now have many options to interface with native code with different performance and reliability guarantees. That’s exactly the foundation the <a href="http://www.membraneframework.org/">Membrane Framework</a> builds on top of.</p>
<p>
Membrane was extracted from RadioKit, a startup aiming at disrupting the radio broadcasting industry. Originally it focused on processing and mixing audio. Later, <a href="https://www.swmansion.com/">Software Mansion</a> acquired the framework and provided stable funding and a solid team to help it grow into a full-scale framework. Currently, it allows developers to process, transmit, broadcast, and transform audio and videos streams on the fly. Whether you are building a Twitch clone, a VOD application or a video conferencing system, Membrane provides a growing set of high-level abstractions and pre-made modules so you don’t have to dive into idiosyncrasies of particular codecs, protocols, and formats. </p>
<h2>
Looking ahead: what is coming in 2021</h2>
<p>
The year of 2021 looks very exciting for the Erlang Ecosystem and the Elixir community. In this section, we are going to mention some of the things we expect to see in 2021.</p>
<h3>
Erlang/OTP 24 with JIT</h3>
<p>
In September 2020, <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/2745">Lukas Larsson and the Erlang/OTP team</a> announced a JIT compiler for the Erlang VM called BeamAsm. How faster the JIT will be in practice depends on your application but the results posted in the announcement are promising. To quote Lukas:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
If we run the JSON benchmarks found in the <a href="https://github.com/devinus/poison/tree/master/bench">Poison</a> or <a href="https://github.com/michalmuskala/jason/tree/master/bench">Jason</a>, BeamAsm achieves anything from 30% to 130% increase (average at about 70%) in the number of iterations per second for all Erlang/Elixir implementations. For some benchmarks, BeamAsm is even faster than the pure C implementation <a href="https://github.com/davisp/jiffy">jiffy</a>.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
More complex applications tend to see a more moderate performance increase, for instance, RabbitMQ is able to handle 30% to 50% more messages per second depending on the scenario.  </p>

        <!-- <h1 class="post-title">My Rules for Writing Well</h1> -->

        <section>
            <p>I’ve learned the hard way that writing is… hard. But anyone can become a great writer by following a few rules.</p>

<p>This post is a collection of guidelines I’ve adopted while writing four technical books, publishing countless blogs, and enduring the wrath of frontpage Hacker News commentary. Many of these rules were imparted by the great mentors I’ve had over the years, such as <a href="https://twitter.com/bphogan">Brian Hogan</a> (Pragmatic Bookshelf editor) and <a href="https://twitter.com/jonmountjoy">Jon Mountjoy</a> (creator of Heroku’s DevCenter).</p>

<h4 id="be-concise">Be concise</h4>
<p>Make every word count.</p>

<h4 id="write-with-the-door-closed-rewrite-with-the-door-open">Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open</h4>
<p>Writing requires concentration, but editing requires feedback. When it’s time to write, close the door, turn off alerts, and remove distractions. When your first draft is complete, share it with people–friends, colleagues, reviewers–and listen to what they say.</p>

<h4 id="use-the-right-word">Use the right word</h4>
<p>Richard Feynman once told a story about a group of physicists explaining “acoustic reverberations” to a confused non-scientist. Feynman interjected, saying “it’s an echo”.</p>

<p>Precise word choice is important, but longer isn’t always better. Unusual vocabulary words and technical jargon distract readers from your point. In general:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t “utilize” something when you can “use” it.</li>
  <li>Don’t “procure” something when you can “buy” it</li>
  <li>Don’t “ascertain” something when you can “learn” it</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="show-it-dont-say-it">Show it, don’t say it</h4>
<p>Avoid the word “easy” in your writing. If something is easy it will go without saying. More importantly, if readers find something difficult, you may alienate them by calling it easy. Avoid “simple” or “straightforward”, too.</p>

<h4 id="cut-and-paste">Cut and paste</h4>
<p>When you write, you’re telling a story. When you rewrite, you’re removing all the parts that are not the story. Be ruthless as you edit. Cut and move sections like Victor Frankenstein piecing together his creature.</p>

<h4 id="bring-your-reader-with-you">Bring your reader with you</h4>
<p>Some pronouns will engage your readers, while others distance you from them.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t say “I find it important to”, when you mean “You should”</li>
  <li>Don’t say “It is widely believed”, when you mean “I think”</li>
  <li>Don’t say “I’ll show you how”, when you mean “We’ll see how”</li>
</ul>

<p>I use you/your in this post because I want <em>you</em> to adopt these rules. But if I were writing a tutorial and guiding you on a journey, I might use we/us/ours to indicate that I’m in it with you. It’s sometimes acceptable to switch between we/us/our and you/your in a single piece of writing, but in general you want to pick a voice and stick with those pronouns.</p>

<h4 id="throw-the-first-one-away">Throw the first one away</h4>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The Mythical Man Month</a>, Fred Brooks warns software developers that their first version of code will have bugs, run slowly, and lack features. You’ll likely need to rewrite it. The same caution applies when writing prose. Plan to throw your first draft away. You’re going to make mistakes; might as well make them quickly and get on to the second draft.</p>

<h4 id="write-write-write">Write, write, write</h4>
<p>Writing is a muscle. Practice your writing, share it with people, and learn from their feedback. Like going to the gym, it’s not easy. You’ll need to create a writing schedule and set goals. Will you publish one blog post a month? Will you write a post this year that gets one-thousand views? Aim high.</p>

<h4 id="know-your-craft">Know your craft</h4>
<p>Writing is a craft, which means there’s always more to learn. There are many more rules I could have included in this post, like “prefer the active voice”, “avoid noun stacks”, “use action verbs”, and “use puncuation effectively”. But then I’d be writing a fifth book. Instead, I encourage you to read some of the wonderful resources I’ve used over the years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dave Thomas’ <a href="https://pragdave.me/blog/2007/03/04/sywtwab-1-so-you-want-to-write-a-book.html">So You Want to Write a Book</a> series</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.wilbers.com/Keys.htm">Keys to Great Writing</a> by Stephen Wilbers</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Writing%3A_A_Memoir_of_the_Craft">On Writing</a> by Stephen King</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53343.On_Writing_Well">On Writing Well</a> by William Zinsser</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="break-the-rules">Break the rules</h4>
<p>Writing isn’t a science. There’s a time to break the rules, but do so cautiously.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Four years ago, when <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/28d4e100-2a6d-11e7-bc4b-5528796fe35c" data-trackable="link">Ant Group’s premier money market fund</a> was racing to a peak of more than $260bn worth of assets under management, many of China’s state-owned banks and their regulators started to get agitated. In a series of calls and meetings with Jack Ma, Ant’s founder, bank executives and regulatory officials demanded that its Yu’E Bao fund be <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7f9deba0-51e1-3c8e-9f1c-1d71a384028d" data-trackable="link">reined in</a>.</p>
<p>“Yu’E Bao was pulling a lot of money from the banks,” says one person familiar with the discussions. “The banks were worried about the impact on liquidity and wanted Ant to take measures to minimise the impact. The conversations were pretty tense.”</p>
<p>In the end, Mr Ma had to back down and Yu’E Bao imposed caps on how much people could deposit. Between March and December of 2018, its funds under management <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/35bbbef6-20a8-11e9-b126-46fc3ad87c65" data-trackable="link">fell by a third</a> to $168bn and stood at $183bn last September.</p>
<p>The showdown would prove to be a prelude to the much bigger confrontation that now pits the Chinese Communist party and President Xi Jinping <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d2f174d-aa73-44fc-8c90-45c2a554e97b" data-trackable="link">against not just Ant but also Alibaba</a>, the ecommerce group founded by Mr Ma. </p>
<p>The stand-off, which has sparked <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b3a94f55-5e44-417f-a869-a542d0527fe7" data-trackable="link">rampant speculation about Mr Ma’s whereabouts</a>, could become a defining moment for the future of private business in Mr Xi’s China.</p>
<p>On December 24, China’s market regulator announced it was launching an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bdcc073f-3b70-4411-92d7-ee36973a8b7a" data-trackable="link">antitrust probe into Alibaba</a> and sent investigators to its headquarters in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, Mr Ma’s hometown. The announcement came just two weeks after the party’s politburo said it would target monopoly businesses to prevent the “disorderly expansion of capital”.</p>

<p>The move on Alibaba also came two months after financial regulators dramatically cancelled Ant’s planned $37bn initial public offering, which would have been the world’s largest.</p>
<p>Taken together, the measures amount to an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/84d57797-4211-4658-ac54-ebdcb5146151" data-trackable="link">unprecedented squeeze on a business empire</a> whose ubiquitous services are central to the functioning of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c636a22e-dd3f-403e-a72d-c3ffb375459c" data-trackable="link">China’s pioneering online economy</a>. Ant says Alipay, its payment app, is regularly used by 700m people — half of China’s total population — and 80m merchants, processing payments worth Rmb118tn ($18.2tn) in the group’s last financial year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alibaba’s shares have fallen by almost 30 per cent since the regulatory showdown began in late October, putting a big dent in the net worth of Mr Ma, who has not been seen in public since then. Over the same period his fortune has declined from $62bn to $49bn, according to Bloomberg data. The Hurun China Rich List estimated that Mr Ma had been the country’s richest man as recently as October 20 but would now rank fourth, his top slot taken by a bottled water tycoon, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e09bd3a4-29e3-47ac-bad2-19d29b47d777" data-trackable="link">Zhong Shanshan</a>.</p>
<p>The results of the showdown will say a lot about the sort of economy that China is developing. If Ant and Alibaba are crippled by regulators — or its founder is personally targeted by investigators — it will go down as a landmark moment in the party’s fickle relationship with China’s private sector even though Mr Ma is, ironically, a party member himself.</p>
<p>Since Deng Xiaoping launched the “reform and opening” era 40 years ago, the party has become ever more dependent on private sector companies for economic growth, job creation and tax revenues. But the party’s fixation with control, especially since Mr Xi came to power almost a decade ago, also triggers periodic crackdowns on the sector and prominent entrepreneurs. </p>
<div>
<figure><picture><source media="screen and (max-width: 490px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2F447c1530-0fb2-11eb-8965-eb99f552cea7-mobile.png?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=490" data-id="https://api.ft.com/content/b85f190e-e69f-4767-b253-b9355fa0f700" data-original-image-width="301" data-original-image-height="401"><img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2F447c1530-0fb2-11eb-8965-eb99f552cea7-standard.png?dpr=1&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=700" data-id="https://api.ft.com/content/3a63d780-65bf-4baf-896f-210d3475c482" data-image-type="graphic" data-original-image-width="700" data-original-image-height="500" alt="Ant Group’s revenue breakdown"></picture></figure>
</div>
<p>Yet there is another potential outcome that would indicate a less fraught relationship between the party-state and business. The investigations into Ant and Alibaba could lead to the sort of settlements that are not dissimilar to those pursued in the US and EU against large finance and technology groups. That would leave Mr Ma’s two flagship companies humbled but still formidable and highly profitable national champions. Even then, a strong political message would have been sent.</p>
<p>“Chinese internet magnates can still enjoy thriving businesses and enormous fortunes if they are able to convince the top leadership of their loyalty,” says Chen Long at Plenum, a Beijing-based consultancy. “The top leadership wants to ensure that neither Ma nor anyone else ever crosses the red line of trying to exert personal influence over government policies again — at least not publicly. The government will support them on the condition that they serve the national interest first.” </p>
<h2>Fintech revolution</h2>
<p>Mr Ma has not appeared in public since October 24, when he gave a high-profile speech critical of the same state-owned banks he clashed with over Yu’E Bao’s rapid growth, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/843b3f60-292b-431f-a94c-93c78bc72bae" data-trackable="link">as well as regulators</a> who he said often sacrifice innovation on the altar of stability. According to people involved in the listing, the speech angered Mr Xi, who made the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/87883923-e321-4632-a1cb-dc2663a00456" data-trackable="link">final decision</a> to halt the Ant IPO. </p>



<p>“To innovate without taking risks is to strangle innovation,” Mr Ma said. “There is no such thing as riskless innovation in the world. Very often, an attempt to minimise risk to zero is the biggest risk itself.”</p>
<p>He was speaking at the same forum where Wang Qishan, Mr Xi’s powerful vice-president and former <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d82964ba-6d42-11e7-bfeb-33fe0c5b7eaa" data-trackable="link">anti-corruption tsar</a>, had earlier emphasised the paramount importance of financial system stability. “Efforts should be made to prevent and lower financial risks . . . security always ranks first,” Mr Wang said. “While new financial technologies have improved efficiency and brought convenience, financial risks have been heightened.”</p>
<p>In an unprecedented public rebuke of Ant two months later, on December 26 China’s central bank <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/96b0bc5f-c02c-41de-be90-fd4a3f56fd2f" data-trackable="link">criticised Ant for being too cavalier about financial risk</a> and taking advantage of regulatory loopholes. But as frustrated as regulators are with Ant, they cannot ignore the beneficial effects of the financial revolution it has led in China.</p>
<p>“Ant Group,” People’s Bank of China vice-governor Pan Gongsheng admitted in his otherwise critical comments, “has played an innovative role in developing financial technology and improving the efficiency and inclusiveness of financial services”. The central bank, he added in a nod to jittery entrepreneurs, was also “unshakeable” in its commitment to “protect property rights and promote entrepreneurship”.</p>

</div>
<p>Mr Ma has long enjoyed support from officials in a range of State Council ministries, as well as the lead financial regulators, who appreciate the contributions of Ant, Alibaba and their rivals, all of whom have transformed China’s economy and made its online services sector a global leader. When his status as a party member was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4b6e5f9a-f233-11e8-9623-d7f9881e729f" data-trackable="link">first confirmed</a> only two years ago, it was in the context of an award he was receiving from the party’s Central Committee for “making China a leading player in the international ecommerce industry, internet finance and cloud computing”.</p>
<p>Alibaba and Ant’s ecommerce and online payment services were even more critical at the height of China’s successful battle to contain coronavirus, providing <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ed316d4c-141c-487f-afb4-cd4c92e823fd" data-trackable="link">essential services</a> to the hundreds of millions of people caught in <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/82574e3d-1633-48ad-8afb-71ebb3fe3dee" data-trackable="link">draconian lockdowns</a>.</p>
<p>“There are different lines of thought within the regulators,” Mr Chen says. “Until Jack Ma’s speech the pro-growth people had the upper hand. But Xi thought the speech was too much and a second [risk-averse] group took the lead. If his speech hadn’t happened, everything would have been fine.” </p>
<p>Disappearing acts are unusual for Mr Ma, who also missed the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a91dfeae-da1e-4348-8212-bbfbe94d93bd" data-trackable="link">November finale</a> of his African reality TV show — <em>Africa’s Business Heroes</em>. He routinely gives <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/308e46a8-6189-11e3-916e-00144feabdc0" data-trackable="link">flamboyant musical performances</a> at Alibaba events and hobnobs with heads of state and government leaders.</p>



<p>As China’s most successful private entrepreneur, Mr Ma enjoys unique status in China — and overseas. His fluent English has made him a huge celebrity on the international conference circuit, with a star quality unmatched by any of his private or state-sector peers. </p>
<p>When Mr Xi hosted the G20 leaders summit in Hangzhou in 2016, some of his guests also visited Mr Ma — something that irked the Chinese president, according to one diplomat involved and other people familiar with the matter. Mr Ma’s VIP callers included Indonesian president Joko Widodo, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and the then Italian premier, Matteo Renzi. Foreign leaders were offered limited time slots and the Chinese foreign ministry was mostly cut out of the process.</p>
<p>Over the past week rumours about Mr Ma’s whereabouts have abounded on China’s carefully monitored social media channels, while domestic media outlets have received <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/62fe82c5-b058-4dd0-bb15-e9428593f078" data-trackable="link">strict instructions</a> from censors about the stories they can and cannot run on Ant and Alibaba’s regulatory troubles. </p>
<p>Many of Mr Ma’s friends and colleagues strongly dispute suggestions that he is personally in any sort of legal jeopardy, let alone on the run. “He is in China and not travelling because of Covid, not anything else. He’s lying low,” says one friend of Mr Ma.</p>

</div>
<p>Another friend who communicates with Mr Ma regularly adds: “Everyone is asking me if he’s in danger, but he’s doing fine. He responds [to messages and calls] quickly and seems like he’s in good spirits. Discussions with regulators are still very much in process so he just has to stay quiet until they are resolved.”</p>
<h2>Leadership missteps</h2>
<p>Friends add that while Mr Ma may now regret the consequences of his October 24 speech, he meant what he said and still believes passionately in what he sees as Ant’s mission to transform the provision of financial services in the world’s second-largest economy.</p>
<p>Yu’E Bao, which translates as “account balance treasure”, was started in 2013 and allowed anyone in China, from restaurant staff to the urban yuppies they serve, to deposit as little as Rmb1 ($0.15) in a money-market fund and earn more interest than they could in a Chinese savings deposit account. Just four years later it became the world’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/28d4e100-2a6d-11e7-bc4b-5528796fe35c" data-trackable="link">largest money market fund</a>, surpassing JPMorgan’s US government money market fund. </p>

<h3><strong>Discrete Mathematics part 1</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to declarative statements, sets, and operations with sets, laws, logic, quantifiers, functions, proofs, sequences, and summation. For this course, and it’s a second part which we’ve put in Year 2, we are going to use the same playlist of 60 YouTube videos, but we are going to split it, 34 videos for part 1 (1-34) and 26 videos for the part 2 (35-60).</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discrete Math playlist (videos: 1-34)</a></li>

<h3><strong>Calculus part 1</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to limits, intervals, differentiability, continuity, derivatives, antiderivatives, rules, trigonometric functions, inverse trigonometric functions, optimizations, and sums. It will be a huge help to you, once you dive into the later semesters of your studies and will help you understand most of the <a href="http://laconicml.com/mathematical-skills-data-scientist/">mathematics</a> behind Machine Learning, Deep Learning, etc. Here we will suggest you take look at this list of 86 videos. Yes, it looks long, but the videos are quite short and well explained.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII1ml6mys-RXoQ0O3GfwBPVM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calculus part 1 playlist</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>Introduction to Computer Science and Programming</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to computer science and programming from a theoretical view. It is very important for every beginner to have a visual representation in its mind about most of the concepts of computer science and programming. That way, it can understand their complexity and unlock its imagination and creativity and use the full power of computer science and programming while respecting their laws. Here we recommend you this video:</p>
<div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zOjov-2OZ0E" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>

<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Intro to Python Programming</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course is an introduction to Python programming. Easily one of the most popular programming languages in the world, <a href="http://laconicml.com/implement-bayesian-regression-python/">Python</a> is widely used by many people who work in some sort of IT-related field. It is easy to understand, use has tons of libraries and it has huge community support. It is used in Web Development (Django, Flask), Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow), etc. You are going to use Python a lot, so for this course, we are going to keep it simple by recommending only one video:</p>
<div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rfscVS0vtbw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>





<h2><strong>Semester 2</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Calculus part 2</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the second part of the Calculus. Here you are going to learn about integrals, series, tests, polar coordinates, polar graphs, etc. For this course, we are going to recommend you this playlist of 64 videos. It looks like a lot, but the videos are well explained and are quite short, so you feel like you’ve covered a lot of material.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII1OxI-BbNkEhuwPHcKxuPSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calculus part 2 playlist</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Discrete Mathematics part 2</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to matrices, graphs, searching algorithms, sorting algorithms, algorithms complexity, introduction to probability, combinatorics, variations, and permutations.</p>
<p>This is the second part of the Discrete Mathematics, and as we’ve mentioned in the first part, we are going to use the same playlist of 60 videos, but here we are going to watch starting from the 35th up to the 60th video.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discrete Math playlist (videos: 35-60)</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Introduction to C++ and Object-Oriented Programming</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce me to C++, starting from the basics, up to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP is one of the main programming paradigms, and probably the most used.</p>
<p>Most of the applications that you have on your mobile phone or access from the browser are programmed following this paradigm.</p>
<p>It is the pillar of every program you will write in the future, so you will want to give this course more time. For this course, we will recommend you a video playlist of 29 videos.</p>
<p>However, we recommend you to watch them up to the 13th because the rest of them are beyond OOP and if you are new to this, might be complex and difficult to understand.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvQ9S8YSV0iDsuEU8v11yP9M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C++ tutorial playlist (videos: 1-13)</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>Computer System Architecture</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this course, you are going to be introduced to set design, processor micro-architecture and pipelining, cache and virtual memory organizations, protection and sharing, I/O and interrupts, in-order and out-of-order superscalar architectures, VLIW machines, vector supercomputers, multithreaded architectures, symmetric multiprocessors, and parallel computers. For this course, we will recommend you the following playlist coming from <a href="http://laconicml.com/computer-science-engineer-mit-university/">MIT</a>. The list has 39 videos, that are quite long</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5PHm2jkkXmi5CxxI7b3JCL1TWybTDtKq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer Systems Architecture full playlist</a></li>

<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Introduction to Web Design (HTML + CSS)</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course is your introduction to what one stage of web development (the front-end) looks like. You are going to get familiar with HTML, which is the markup language that makes the elements we see on a webpage, and with CSS, which is a stylesheet that gives life to those elements. Here we recommend two videos, one for HTML and one for CSS.</p>
<ol>

January 12, 2021 | https://www.zebrium.com/blog/using-gpt-3-with-zebrium-for-plain-language-incident-root-cause-from-logs | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.zebrium.com/blog/using-gpt-3-with-zebrium-for-plain-language-incident-root-cause-from-logs">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>This project is a favorite of mine and so I wanted to share a glimpse of what we've been up to with <a href="https://openai.com/" rel="noopener">OpenAI's amazing GPT-3 language model</a>. Today I'll be sharing a couple of straightforward results with basic prompts only. There are more advanced avenues we're exploring for our use of GPT-3, such as fine-tuning (custom pre-training for specific datasets); you'll hear none of that today, but if you're interested in this topic, follow this blog for updates.</p>
<!--more-->

<h2>Our goal</h2>
<p>I believe the future of monitoring has to include autonomous root cause tools. Deployment frequency and complexity make the "new" issue the driver of Mean-Time-To-Resolve (MTTR) today. You may always know when something breaks, but you won't always know what. Problem is, root cause often hides in log files... but since the volume of logs has grown enormous and it's not always clear what to search for when a new issue arises, we saw a need for a smarter tool to help with root cause.</p>

<h2>Our approach in a nutshell</h2>
<p>If you structure logs really well (we do this with machine learning), including free-text logs, even when there are only one or two examples for a given event type, you can start talking confidently about a "rare" event. Severity lets you talk about a "bad" event. So, you can imagine one log stream expressing a "rare" event, and then another log stream expressing an event that is both "rare" and "bad". A simple point process model lets us talk naively about how likely it is that such a pair of events should show up as close together in time or closer, given patterns of "rare" and "rare"+"bad" events in those two streams. Watching the data for a while will let you estimate parameters for this model, and you can start picking out bouts of such event pairs. Zebrium takes such a bout, and generates an incident report from it. The results we are seeing…</p>

<h2>The plain language challenge</h2>
<p>Our approach works really well at generating root cause reports: if there's a root cause indicator in the logs, it will almost always make its way into a concise root cause report. Our approach has proven robust to different kinds of applications and logs; it requires no training or rules, pre-built or otherwise.</p>

<p>However, there's a big challenge remaining here. The last mile of delivering the benefits of autonomous Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is translating even the concise reports we generate into something the user can understand. The user who needs the quick RCA is not always the person who can understand the oblique root cause indicators in a technical log file. Who is to consume these reports, and what composes them?</p>

<p>This challenge is even more stark for an Managed Service Provider (MSP) or enterprise. At a small company, engineers may be responsible for front-line triage. At a large company or MSP, there will be a front-line, typically junior person who needs a quick RCA; they can't be expected to know all the different intricacies of application logs and what those logs mean. To bring value over the last mile to them, we need plain-language.</p>

<h2>Enter GPT-3</h2>
<p>Now that I've set the stage, let me show you a couple of examples that I think make it clear how transformational GPT-3 can be in the context of our problem. I think you'll agree with me that autonomous RCA seems a lot more real when it's translated into plain-language, and surely a lot more accessible by a lot of users.</p>

<p>GPT-3 is a state-of-the-art bidirectional autoregressive transformer model, with parameters in the hundreds of billions. It is produced, trained, and maintained by OpenAI, and it has really brought start-of-the art, deep NLP to developers’ fingertips.</p>

<p>The most basic procedure for using GPT-3 looks like this -</p>

<p>1) Construct a “prompt” for the model – this is a sort of open-ended document that leaves the model to “continue the story”, as it were; the continuation or response is called a “completion”. For the below two-line examples, I used the following simple prompt construction:</p>

<p>An expert examined the logs for the incident.</p>
<p>The first log message was: &lt;first_line_goes_here&gt;</p>
<p>The last log message was: &lt;second_line_goes_here&gt;</p>
<p>The expert described what had happened, in plain English:</p>

<p>2) Select model (I used davinci) and parameters - for the below examples, I used the following parameters to the davinci GPT-3 model:</p>

<p>{</p>
<p>"max_tokens": 128,</p>
<p>"temperature": 1,</p>
<p>"top_p": 0.05,</p>
<p>"presence_penalty": 0.3,</p>
<p>"frequency_penalty": 0.3,</p>
<p>"best_of": 10</p>
<p>}</p>

<p>3) Call the API; post-process completion for dangling or repeated phrases, to-taste. Serve warm.</p>

<h2>Example one: Database shutdown</h2>
<p>We shut down the Postgres database backing our Atlassian stack. Thousands of events, largely errors, ensued in the logs. Zebrium dutifully generates a root cause report, based on an ML-driven auto-detection. The report looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png" alt="postgres incident" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=520&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1559&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=2078&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=2598&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=3117&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>As you can see, Zebrium pulled about a dozen log events into the report; the first 9 are shown in the image. You’ll notice that the first event is colored green and the last event purple; these are the “FIRST” and the “WORST”, and we use these to characterize the incident in the incidents list. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png" alt="postgres incident summary" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=520&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1559&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=2078&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=2598&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=3117&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>OK, so Zebrium did a pretty good job here. It autonomously picked these two log events out of thousands to display to the user on the list page. Often, the “FIRST” event reflects root cause and the “WORST” reflects follow-on problems; you’ll note here that the first is not even an error, but it’s rare, and happens too close to other incident events, according to our model, to be a coincidence.</p>

<p>Now in this case, it’s pretty clear to someone who has looked at a log file before that the database was shut down by the administrator. You’ll also notice, though, above the log events, a field called “DESCRIPTION”: this was generated by GPT-3. It says:</p>

<p>“The database server was stopped by the administrator.”</p>

<h2>Why this summary is also amazing</h2>
<p>We passed in the “FIRST” and “WORST” events, as described above, to GPT-3. Notice that the first line says that the “PostgreSQL RDBMS” was “Stopped”. The second line says that there was a “PSQLException” indicating that a connection was “terminating due to administrator command”.</p>

<p>The word “administrator” appears on a different line than the word “PostgreSQL”, and nowhere in the log messages are the words “database” or “server” to be found at all.</p>

<p>The algorithm is doing the following:</p>

<p>1.) Inferring that the statements on the two lines are related</p>
<p>2.) Inferring that they are both speaking about a “database server”</p>
<p>3.) Putting the two statements together: “stopped by the administrator”</p>

<p>Essentially, this is the sort of summary someone would put into a ticketing system; here, it’s being done automatically, thanks to an appropriately selected pair of log messages coupled with a language model.</p>

<h2><span>Example two: Out of memory</span><span></span></h2>
<p>In this case, and using the same parameters as were used in the previous example, we take a root cause report for what turns out to be an out-of-memory issue to GPT-3 and see what sort of summary it gives us.</p>

<p>This particular report was generated in response to a signal from a monitoring tool that saw endpoint latencies spike too high. The system was configured with Zebrium to provide root cause observability across the stack. Here is the report Zebrium ML generated:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=oom_incident.png" alt="oom_incident" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=520&amp;name=oom_incident.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=oom_incident.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1559&amp;name=oom_incident.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=2078&amp;name=oom_incident.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=2598&amp;name=oom_incident.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=3117&amp;name=oom_incident.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>As you can see, Zebrium pulled about a dozen log events into the report; the first 9 are shown in the image. You’ll notice that the first event is colored green and the last event purple; these are the “FIRST” and the “WORST”, and we use these to characterize the incident in the incidents list. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=908&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png" alt="oom_incident_summary" width="908" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=454&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 454w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=908&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 908w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=1362&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 1362w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=1816&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 1816w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=2270&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 2270w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=2724&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 2724w" sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px"></p>

<p>In this case, it’s not so clear that the problem is due to an out-of-memory issue, unless the reader is familiar with Linux and the OOM killer facility. There are a lot of technical parameters in these events as well, obscuring what was really at the heart of the problem.</p>

<p>Taking a look above the log messages again, in the “DESCRIPTION” field, let’s see what GPT-3 gave us:</p>

<p>“The memcached process was killed by the OOM killer</p>
<p>because it was consuming too much memory. The OOM killer</p>
<p>is a Linux kernel feature that allows the system to kill</p>
<p>a process when <strong><u>the system is running out of memory</u></strong>.”</p>

<h2>Why this summary is also amazing</h2>
<p>What this summary tells us explicitly in plain-language is that the system was running out of memory. This is in fact the root cause of the original incident, tallying up a successful root cause summary.</p>

<p>For an L1 or L2, the Zebrium root cause summary may not be enough. That person won’t necessarily know that OOM means out-of-memory, or that the “FIRST” message isn’t talking about an application issue entirely within memcached.</p>

<h2>What more I wanted here</h2>
<p>In the second example, I would have liked to have seen some recognition that the first line implies that the system was out-of-memory, and therefore the second line was due to related problems (in fact, the application server was paged out). It’s a lot to ask, but I think it might be possible, given some combination of more expressive prompts, finetuning, and presenting GPT-3 with other select data from the report (in this case, the report also included metrics anomalies showing a plunge in swap free).</p>

<h2><span>A cool direction</span></h2>
<p>You may have noticed that GPT-3 gave us a lot of extra detail about the Linux OOM killer than was mentioned in the log messages themselves. I believe it was able to provide this context in the same way it knew that PSQL referred to a database server: it was trained on the internet. There is likely enough information in the public domain that, as GPT-3 was being trained, it picked up enough cursory knowledge of these sorts of systems to add additional value.</p>

<p>To test my hypothesis, I spent some time fiddling quite unscientifically with the prompt and model parameters, trying to get it to expound on the OOM example as describe above. I also gave the model a much larger budget of response tokens. Eventually, I teased out this response:</p>

<p>The root cause of the …</p></span></p></div></div>

<p>Man, 2021 escalated quickly! With the increased concerns and distrust of public platforms owned by big companies, “something’s gotta give”. That “something” will probably be hallmark Web 3.0 features which have been in the works for a while, as well as some Web 2.0 applications that lost popularity because people didn’t want to (or in some cases could not afford to) pay money, at least until now. But what is “Web 3.0”? Since it is difficult to define the entirety of Web 3.0 before it becomes mainstream, here are some elements I’m expecting to come from it.</p>



<p>The first thing to expect is an explosion of self-hosted solutions for the <a href="https://joshuaaust.in/blog/2020/08/11/open-web/">Open Web</a>, such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, and many others. While that explosion may cool off as quickly as that explosion became hot, it is the first knee-jerk reaction to expect from the distrustful, the censored, as well as for those who wish for a quieter, more thoughtful experience. The hosting has become cheaper as of late – one can self-host a fairly secure WordPress site for as little as $5 a month if they are technically minded, or have someone take care of the technical side for them for as little as $12-15 a month if they are not so technically minded.</p>



<p>The next “big thing” I expect to happen is for <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a> (or at least its underlying concept of decentralized applications) to start becoming more mainstream, as the underlying technology is resistant to even government-level censorship, though currently at the cost of comparatively slow page-loading times.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>At its core, decentralization will be the name of the game for Web 3.0</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>At its core, decentralization will be the name of the game for Web 3.0, and will give companies like Facebook a run for their money. This is why Twitter is already researching how it could potentially morph into a decentralized system in the years ahead.</p>



<p>This will enable both good and bad.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the bad – to be certain, bad people ranging from human traffickers to fake news vendors and everybody in between will harness this to their advantage. This won’t render catching the criminals impossible, it’ll just mean they can’t be easily censored and catching them via the Internet will require a change in strategy.</p>



<p>However, this also opens up the potential for many good things! Soon we may be able to transmit money digitally without the need (or the trust) of a third party vendor, and with increased security measures. As of right now, you can donate the Ether cryptocurrency directly to my decentralized domain name, codextypes.eth, without the need for entrusting PayPal or Venmo’s data warehouses to protect your sensitive financial data. For a transaction fee, I can convert this into fiat currencies where it is legal. In the US, for example, it is currently allowed provided I report any capital gains.</p>



<p>This will also enable religious freedom in new and exciting ways, such as Christian communities being able to archive and share digital copies of the Scriptures in their local languages, both text and audio, without censorship from persecuting governments.</p>



<p>This also has the potential to enable people who previously couldn’t afford a WordPress subscription or hosting plan to have a place where they can share their thoughts and beliefs with full control over their data.</p>



<p>Every major iteration of the Internet won’t help or solve the human condition, but it will attempt to improve upon the technical pain points that came with the previous iteration of the Internet, and that’s something to be excited about!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>The promise of free software is a near-future utopia, built on democratized technology. This future is just and it is beautiful, full of opportunity and fulfillment for everyone everywhere. We can create the things we dream about when we let our minds wander into the places they want to. We can be with the people we want and need to be, when we want and need to.</p>
<p>This is currently possible with the technology we have today, but it’s availability is limited by the reality of the world we live in – the injustice, the inequity, the inequality. Technology runs the world, but it does not serve the interests of most of us. In order to create a better world, our technology must be transparent, accountable, trustworthy. It must be just. It must be free.</p>
<p>The job of the free software movement is to demonstrate that this world is possible by living its values now: justice, equity, equality. We build them into our technology, and we build technology that make it possible for these values to exist in the world.</p>
<p>At the Free Software Foundation, we liked to say that we used all free software because it was important to show that we could. <i>You can do anything with free software</i>, so we did everything with it. We demonstrated the importance of unions for tech workers and non-profit workers by having one. We organized collectively and protected our rights for the sake of ourselves and one another. We had non-negotiable salaries, based on responsibility level and position. That didn’t mean we worked in an office free from the systemic problems that plague workplaces everywhere, but we were able to think about them differently.</p>
<p>Things were this way because of Richard Stallman – but I view his influence on these things as negative rather than positive. He was a cause that forced these outcomes, rather than being supportive of the desires and needs of others. Rather than indulge in gossip or stories, I would like to jump to the idea that he was supposed to have been deplatformed in October 2019. In resigning from his position as president of the FSF, he certainly lost some of his ability to reach audiences. However, Richard still gives talks. The FSF continues to use his image and rhetoric in their own messaging and materials. They gave him time to speak at their annual conference in 2020. He maintains leadership in the GNU project and otherwise within the FSF sphere. The people who empowered him for so many years are still in charge.</p>
<p>Richard, and the continued respect and space he is given, is not the only problem. It represents a bigger problem. Sexism and racism (among others) run rampant in the community. This happens because of bad actors and, more significantly, by the complacency of organizations, projects, and individuals afraid of losing contributors, respect, or funding. In a sector that has so much money and so many resources, women are still being paid less than men; we deny people opportunities to learn and grow in the name of immediate results; people who aren’t men, who aren’t white, are abused and harassed; people are mentally and emotionally taken advantage of, and we are coerced into burn out and giving up our lives for these companies and projects and we are paid for tolerating all of this by being told we’re doing a good job or making a difference.</p>
<p>But we’re not making a difference. We’re perpetuating the worst of the status quo that we should be fighting against. We must not continue. We cannot. We need to live our ideals as they are, and take the natural next steps in their evolution. We cannot have a world of just technology when we live in a world of exclusion; we cannot have free software if we continue to allow, tolerate, and laud the worst of us. I’ve been in and around free software for seventeen years. Nearly every part of it I’ve participated in has members and leadership that benefit from allowing and encouraging the continuation of maleficence and systemic oppression.</p>
<p>We must purge ourselves of these things – of sexism, racism, injustice, and the people who continue and enable it. There is no space to argue over whether a comment was transphobic – if it hurt a trans person then it is transphobic and it is unacceptable. Racism is a global problem and we must be anti-racist or we are complicit. Sexism is present and all men benefit from it, even if they don’t want to. These are free software issues. These are things that plague software, and these are things software reinforces within our societies.</p>
<p>If a technology is exclusionary, it does not work. If a community is exclusionary, it must be fixed or thrown away. There is no middle ground here. There is no compromise. Without doing this, without taking the hard, painful steps to actually live the promise of user freedom and everything it requires and entails, our work is pointless and free software will fail.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s too late for there to be a radical change – the radical change – that allows us to create the utopia we want to see in the world. We must do that by acknowledging that just technology leads to a just society, and that a just society allows us to make just technology. We must do that by living within the principles that guide this future now.</p>
<p>I don’t know what will happen if things don’t change soon. I recently saw someone comment that change doesn’t happens unless one person is willing to sacrifice everything to make that change, to lead and inspire others to play small parts. This is unreasonable to ask of or expect from someone. I’ve been burning myself out to meet other people’s expectations for seventeen years, and I can’t keep doing it. Of course I am not alone, and I am not the only one working on and occupied by these problems. More people must step up, not just for my sake, but for the sake of all of us, the work free software needs to do, and the future I dream about.</p>

	<p>It will span some 170 kilometers, have no cars—and yet promises a 20-minute commute to work. That’s the vision for an ambitious linear city to be built in Saudi Arabia called, fittingly, The Line.</p>
<p>Announced by Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, the development aims to be entirely powered by renewable energy, made more efficient through the use of AI and big data, and producing zero carbon emissions.</p>
<p>The belt of “hyper-connected future communities” will stretch from the Red Sea coast inland through the 26,500-square-kilometer NEOM giga project in northwest Saudi Arabia, according to a press statement.</p>
<p>Plans show a top “pedestrian layer” with no cars or roads, with an infrastructure “service layer” beneath, and a “spine layer” below that with AI-powered transport and freight operations.
</p>

<p>The aim is to have schools, clinics, and leisure facilities within a five-minute walk of people’s homes, with no commute longer than 20 minutes. With construction set to start this quarter, the city is expected to be home to a million people.</p>
<p>“After the Industrial Revolution, cities prioritized machines, cars and factories over people. In cities that are viewed as the world’s most advanced, people spend years of their lives commuting,” said Crown Prince Mohammed.</p>
<p>“Why should seven million people die every year because of pollution? Why should we lose one million people every year due to traffic accidents? And why should we accept wasting years of our lives commuting?</p>
<p>“We need to transform the concept of a conventional city into that of a futuristic one.”</p>
<p>Big data and AI will be harnessed to boost the efficiency of services at the new development, according to NEOM. “An estimated 90 percent of available data will be harnessed to enhance infrastructure capabilities far beyond the 1 percent typically utilized in existing smart cities,” it said. “Communities empowered by AI will learn and predict ways to make life easier to save time for residents and businesses.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>Background: Why I had to pivot</h3><p>Almost 3 years ago I incorporated Kinesis Inc, the corporate entity behind <a href="https://xkit.co/">Xkit</a>. But at the time I was building a non-custodial cryptocurrency exchange. After going through Y Combinator and raising $3.5M from some great investors and building a product I was really proud of, I made the hard decision to <a href="https://sparkswap.com/">shut it down</a> nearly a year ago. We hadn't found an audience that would provide venture scale growth, so it was back to the drawing board.</p><p>I started working on an idea in FinTech, trying to help a friend's company solve a problem with SMB customers not paying on time (or at all) for their services. As I talked to prospective customers about the problem, one thing became abundantly clear: in the time that I had spent away from the SaaS world toiling in the Bitcoin mines, expectations around how SaaS tools work together had radically shifted. It was no longer a "bonus" that you worked with some of their other tools, it was an outright necessity. For the product I was exploring I would be building integrations with Quickbooks, Xero, Stripe, and a few others.</p><p>I asked around if anyone had any good tools to accelerate this process, but the responses I got back were pretty disappointing. Nearly every tool was focused on <em>consumers</em> of SaaS software plugging together the services that they used. Not nearly as much was out there for <em>producers</em> of SaaS software trying to build native integrations to the other tools their customers use. Not only that, but the ones that did exist tried to pretend that we live in a world where powerful integrations are easy to design and maintain with a GUI. While I'm a fan of no-code and low-code solutions, the fact remains that for some tasks, leaning on a software development lifecycle is still the most effective and efficient way to build it.</p><p>In the meantime, the US blew up with COVID, throwing the financial markets (which my new FinTech project was heavily dependent on) into turmoil. So like any good (read: desperate) startup founder, I scrapped the FinTech project and started building the tool that I wish had existed to help me build integrations to my prospective customers' other SaaS apps. And despite never having touched the language, I decided to build it in Elixir.</p><h3>Choosing Elixir</h3><p>I've spent most of my career as a software engineer writing in Javascript and Ruby. I've long been intrigued by the concepts behind functional programming (years ago I wrote a small toy to try to achieve immutability on the web, like a centralized IPFS), and a friend introduced me to Elixir, which incorporated some Ruby syntax, making it a bit friendlier to get started with.</p><p>The concepts behind Erlang/OTP/Elixir make it a great fit for a tool like the one I was building. I knew it would be heavily dependent on outside services, meaning it had to be robust to crashes and other unforeseen events. And I knew high concurrency and low latency would be important features as a piece of developer infrastructure. I also wanted to test out <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html">Paul Graham's theory of hiring programmers</a>: choose a good language and great programmers will always want to work for you. And finally, I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a part of me that just wanted to try something new. I had spent the past two years working an idea I had to shut down, my "big pivot" was a non-starter, I had laid off nearly the entire team, and for product development it was just me in my bedroom. So I liked the idea of learning something new while working on my second pivot in 3 months.</p><h3>Learning Elixir</h3><p>I read through <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">Elixir's fabulous language guide</a>. I mean I really read it, cover to cover, and did pretty much all the examples as they came up. Then I read through a handful of pages in the Phoenix (the most popular web framework for Elixir) guides before I said "f*** it" and started building what became Xkit. My first commit was on May 14, 2020. Commit message: "Initial install with platforms".</p><p>The first week was rough. I wasn't used to moving this slowly, but not only was a learning a new language with features pretty unfamiliar to me like pattern-matching, I was learning a new paradigm. Javascript is whatever you want it to be, which means I had some exposure to FP incidentally, but almost everything I've spent significant time on has had a pretty object-oriented flavor to it, even dating back to when I first got started with PHP. Not to mention the entire ethos of OTP to "fail fast and noisily" which ran counter to so many experiences which focused on avoiding failure at all costs (yes, I've seen some pretty large try/catch blocks in my day). I got pretty discouraged at the pace I was moving, and somewhere about 10 days in I was really regretting not just using Node/Express, a stack I was so familiar with it felt like I could write the app in my sleep.</p><p>But I kept at it (probably more out of pride than anything else) and a few days later I felt things start to shift. I still wasn't moving fast, but I could tell I was improving. Things that only a few days ago had felt foreign and impossible to grasp started to make sense. From that point on I started accelerating, and on June 1st, I sent one of my investors <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dJi3sAsHM0">this video</a> showing the first version of what became Xkit.</p><figure id="w-node-f920538a9a16-bd98eff4"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7dJi3sAsHM0"></iframe></p></figure><h3>Shortcomings of Elixir and Phoenix</h3><p>I started off trying to use a pure Phoenix stack including their new real-time front-end, <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">LiveView</a>. I'll be honest, although I really like Elixir and Phoenix, using Phoenix for the front-end brought me back a bit to my Rails days, and not in a good way. Building a modern web application with those tools felt like I'd be working against the tide. I also am pretty partial to <a href="https://evergreen.segment.com/">Evergreen</a>, the React UI kit by Segment, and I was bearing down on the 6 week timeline I'd set for myself to launch this product. So I ripped out the Phoenix front-end and converted it to be a back-end only application and built a new front-end in React and Evergreen. I did end up using Phoenix's websocket implementation which was a big help integrating the two, although some pieces are not very well documented.</p><p>When I finally getting close to launching, I ran up against the greatest weakness of my choice to use Elixir: deployment. While the world has moved towards a serverless paradigm, Elixir/Erlang/OTP thrive by handling a lot of the same things that "serverless" promises. That means that to really take advantage of all it has to offer, you're better off deploying it on as close to bare metal as you can. That, in addition to some of the architecture choices I made with Xkit (specifically to provision a custom subdomain for every user), made deployment quite a challenge. Failing to find any good documentation about how to deploy a Phoenix application on AWS, I ended up <a href="https://xkit.co/post/deploying-phoenix-for-elixir-on-aws-ec2">writing a blog post about our process</a>.</p><p>You might think it's overkill for a one-person development team to have a one-command deploy process, but I assure you, based on my past experience, it's well worth the effort. You don't want critical DevOps knowledge in one person's head, or worse, on some inscrutable AWS GUI. I want it all in code. Even today, you can take the entire Xkit stack, move it to a new AWS account and have it up and running with a single command in around 30 minutes.</p><h3>Launching Xkit</h3><p>The delays I hit caused me to miss my six week launch goal by two weeks: I launched to some fellow YC founders on July 12 with ~15 connectors and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MqwQ3Czejs">this video</a>. Two weeks after that I launched on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/xkit">Product Hunt</a> and shortly after that on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24121290">Hacker News</a> with over 25 connectors. Since then we've worked with some really great early customers who have helped us refine the product, and I've been able to hire a few friends to help grow the business.</p><figure id="w-node-9133d12a636d-bd98eff4"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7MqwQ3Czejs"></iframe></p></figure><p>We're well over 50 connectors at this point (almost entirely driven by customer requests) and we add so many that we no longer track it as a metric. And while I'm still contributing code, I can safely say that the majority of the coding that I will do for Xkit is now likely behind me. But the process of building Xkit (and learning Elixir in the process) has been incredibly rewarding, and hopefully we're just getting started.</p><p>‍</p><p>PS - In case you're wondering about the answer to PG's theory about language being a good hiring tool - my early results indicate that it is. From a single post on <a href="https://elixirforum.com/">Elixir Forum</a> I met one of the best engineers I've seen, and a few weeks later he recruited one of the best engineers he'd worked with to join the team.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Live chat (Slack, Teams, etc.) sucks for important discussions.</p>



<p>Thinking one line at a time lowers the quality of the <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/01/08/discussion-topics-for-development-teams/">discussion</a>. Knee jerk rapid fire responses become the norm.</p>



<p>Conversations that last weeks or even days get lost and context gets fuzzy. Threads scroll up into the past and are never seen again.</p>



<p>Despite the “asychronous” claim, you have to <a href="https://critter.blog/2019/09/05/the-chatodoro-breaking-the-group-chat-addiction/">keep a steady eye on it</a> and reply in realtime or the conversation will move on without you. Anyone who takes the time to ponder and respond thoughtfully with context and explanation will find that they’re too late. </p>



<p>If you go on vacation or even take a few hours of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/13/heads-down-tuesday/">focused time for deep work</a>, you come back to hundreds or thousands of messages. Often your only option is to declare chat room <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/24/declare-bankruptcy-and-dont-be-ashamed-of-it/">bankruptcy</a> which means missing out on important discussions and big decisions.</p>



<p>I’m not saying live chat is useless. It’s great at some things:</p>



<ul><li>Quick answers to quick questions</li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/15/good-teams-are-noisy/">Low-stakes status updates</a></li><li>Swarming around <a href="https://critter.blog/2016/10/14/making-the-most-of-post-mortems/">red alerts or outages</a></li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/08/the-key-to-happiness-is-to-stop-getting-upset-all-the-dang-time/">Fun and belonging</a> (especially for remote workers)</li></ul>



<p>In other words, <strong>live chat is for the things that can get lost.</strong> </p>



<p><a href="https://critter.blog/2021/01/07/a-simple-process-beats-a-perfect-process/">Rule of thumb</a>: <em>If a discussion will matter after today, don’t have it in a chat room.</em> Check out <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>, <a href="https://twist.com/">Twist</a>, <a href="https://carrot.io/">Carrot</a>, <a href="https://threads.com/">Threads</a>, <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, <a href="https://flarum.org/">Flarum</a>, or heck even GitHub issues. These tools exist for a reason. They solve a real problem.</p>



<ul><li>They encourage longer form responses rather than quick one liner replies. </li><li>They show you a list of threads <em>with titles</em> for maximum <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/05/guerrilla-productivity-tactics/">skim-ability</a>. </li><li>They let you sort (by last comment, for example) and filter threads or archive them once a decision has been reached. </li><li>They don’t show online/offline indicators or timezone notifications or “XYZ is typing…” because nobody expects a quick response anyway.</li><li>Some of them even support multi-level (Reddit-style) threading, which can help if a lot of people are involved.</li></ul>



<p>Try it as <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/12/stop-changing-start-experimenting/">an experiment</a>. For one sprint, ask if your team will put anything that matters after today in a discussion tool instead of a chat room. Then see if they want to switch back after the sprint ends.</p>

      <p>Rumors have been swirling around which stores and spaces will be repurposed as COVID vaccination sites, from Whole Foods&nbsp;to London nightclubs. And this morning, we learned that people might be lining up for their vaccines at the Apple Genius Bar. CBS News reported that Apple will make a big announcement tomorrow, January 13. According to CBS, the forthcoming announcement is not product-related and will&nbsp;have a major impact on the general public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People have been speculating that Apple Stores will be used to administer COVID vaccinations, and, according to our data, they're perfectly positioned for the task.</p>

<p>On the above map, the shaded regions represent areas with&nbsp;large percentages of people with COVID symptoms. The yellow dots are Apple stores. Store locations are largely concentrated where COVID symptoms&nbsp;have been reaching record highs— the northeast, southeast, upper midwest, California. The United States has woefully underperformed its vaccination targets so far. Only about 9 million Americans have received the vaccination thus far, underperforming the CDC's target to have 20 million people vaccinated by the end of 2020. President-elect Joe Biden has announced a drive to have 100 million Americans vaccinated during his first 100 days in office, which will require dozens of new sites to be opened around the country.</p>
<p>If Apple stores do indeed become vaccination centers, that would likely have a positive impact on what has been one of the biggest blockers so far in the distribution chain — getting the vaccine from freezers into peoples' arms.</p>
<p><em>CBS This Morning</em> teased&nbsp;the interview with Tim Cook, which&nbsp;<span>Gayle King</span>&nbsp;conducted at an Apple Store. "What we're going to tell you about tomorrow, it's very exciting news,"&nbsp;King says. "[Cook is] a&nbsp;very strong business leader who deeply cares about this country ... and wants to do good."

      <h3>About the Data:</h3>
      <p>
        Thinknum tracks companies using the information they post online, jobs, social and web traffic, product sales, and app ratings, and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue, and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.

January 12, 2021 | http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<p>Replicated Object Notation (RON) is a format for <em>distributed live data</em>. It guarantees continuous <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ronc.sm">bitwise</a> convergence of replicated data structures in a network of arbitrary <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/network.sm">topology</a>. That makes it a good fit for collaborative software, data synchronization on mobile devices, and broadly defined decentralized apps.
RON was specifically designed for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDTs</a> (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types).
For example, this page is a versioned/collaborative <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@ront">CRDT object</a> containing some CommonMark <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@text">wikitext</a>.
RON can express non-CRDT data too.</p>
<p>RON is op-based, so it expresses objects, patches and separate ops with equal ease. It can work in real-time, it can work offline. Still, it tries very hard to look like your regular notation of the day.
Here is a simple <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> object:</p>
<pre><code>    {   "_id":      "0-2dE-Wares",
        "type":     "apples",
        "quantity": 4,
        "color":    "red"           }
</code></pre>
<p>This is how it may look in RON:</p>
<pre><code>    @0-2dE-Wares :struct,
        type        apples,
        quantity    4,
        color       red;
</code></pre>
<p>This does not seem like a big difference.
Looks like RON is yet another notation, like <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> or something, right?
Key differences are three:</p>
<ol>
<li>RON is op-based, so every line here is an op.</li>
<li>Every op has a globally unique ID, like <code>0-2dE-Wares</code>;
we may skip those IDs when they go in incremental sequence.</li>
<li>RON is typed, e.g. this particular object is a <code>struct</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that RON ops, objects and versions are all addressable.
Every new op gets a unique <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp">logical timestamp</a> ID.
That ID also serves as the ID of the version that op created
(in the context of our <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/oplog.sm">subjective order</a> of events).
The op that created the object gives its ID to the object itself,
e.g. <code>0-2dE-Wares</code>.</p>
<p>Now suppose you ate one apple. How do you convey that?
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902">RFC6902</a> JSON patch may look like this:</p>
<pre><code> [ { "op":"replace", "path":"/quantity", "value":3 } ]
</code></pre>
<p>With RON, you add a new op that references the object.</p>
<pre><code>    @4-2dI-Wares :3-2dH-Wares quantity 3;
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the new op has an ID <code>4-2dI-Wares</code>.
Also, it references the version of the object it amends: <code>3-2dH-Wares</code>.
That was the id of the last op; the one that set <code>color</code> to <code>red</code>.</p>
<p>If you can point to a particular version of the object, why not
request a patch?</p>
<pre><code>    @patch :3-2dH-Wares? 
    @4-2dI-Wares :3-2dH-Wares quantity 3;
</code></pre>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>RON supports arbitrary data structures.
RON Struct is a simple and cheap one, it does not support nesting or complex values.
Although, values of a <code>struct</code> can be IDs referencing other objects, so that way you
can nest other data structures in it.
Still, RON Trie is the best one to represent arbitrary JSON.
Suppose, I list the contents of my shelf in JSON:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "shelf": {
        "jarA": {
            "content": "candies",
            "count": 20
        },
        "jarB": {
            "content": "vitamins",
            "count": 100
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>A <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/rdt/trie.sm">RON Trie</a> is like a regular <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@ront">trie</a>, except it consists of
tuples of RON atoms, not strings of chars.
For our shelf JSON, a <code>trie</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>@0-3d-Wares :trie,
    shelf   jarA    content candies,
    ~       ~       count   20,
    ~       jarB    content vitamins,
    ~       ~       count   100;
</code></pre>
<p>Here, RON shows its tabular nature.
Still, you may also see the trie, defined as a set of tuples/paths.</p>
<p>The directory/file structure of this wiki is stored as a trie.
You may see the resulting <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@trie:DW_ROOT">RON trie</a> or the
<a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@ront:DW_ROOT">original RON trie</a> with all the history and metadata.
You may also see it as <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@json:DW_ROOT">JSON</a>.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a look at
the crown jewel of the system: a type for collaboratively edited text.
Like the one you may find in Google Docs or a similar system. Those need a lot of
rocket science under the hood!
In a real-time collaboratively edited text, every letter is added or removed
by a separate op. That may produce a lot of overheads, so every serialization
of RON (<a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/'serial'/ront.sm">RONt</a>, RONv, RONp) optimizes that case in some way.
RONt uses <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/spreads.sm">spreads</a>: consecutively numbered single-char ops merge into a string. Here you see six formally-identical ways to render "Hello world!":</p>
<pre><code>@0-jG-test :text, ('Hello world!');
@0-jG-test :text, ('Hello world'), '!';
@0-jG-test :text, ('Hello world'), :B-jR-test '!';
@0-jG-test :text, 'H', ('ello world'), 
                            @C-jS-test :B-jR-test '!';
@0-jG-test :text, 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 
                        'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!';
</code></pre>
<p>The underlying CRDT data type is named a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">Causal Tree</a>.
All pages of this wiki are stored as causal tries.
See the <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm?@ront">source RON</a> of this page for an extensive example of
a RONt coded versioned text.</p>
<p>The last but not the least, let's consider such a boring but
essential topic as tabular data.
For your average CSV data-dump cases, RON supports a simple
tabular type <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/rdt/tab.sm">RON Tab</a>. For a CSV like this:</p>
<pre><code>Jar;Content;Count
jarA;candies;20
jarB;vitamins;100
</code></pre>
<p>A <code>tab</code> object would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>   @0-dK2-data :tab  jar    content     count,
                     jarA   candies     20,
                     jarB   vitamins    100;
</code></pre>
<p><code>tab</code> is a cheap and simple type. It can not change the format
of a record; it can only append or remove whole records.</p>
<p>But suppose you need something more like Excel, a lot of action around
your data. Then, you may resort to the most general key-value RON type
named Dict. It maps any RON tuple to another tuple.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>    @0-X3n-data :dict,
        jarA   content   ~   candies,
        jarA   count     ~   20,
        jarB   content   ~   vitamins,
        jarB   count     ~   100;
</code></pre>
<p>A <code>dict</code> can store sparse or multidimensional tables,
as it can update, insert or delete columns, rows or separate cells.
Actually, <code>dict</code> can express a broad range of data structures,
including relational tables.</p>
<p>Now, it is probably the right time to introduce the formal rules of RON.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are four types of RON atoms:
<ol>
<li>UUID, a 128-bit <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/spec/uuid.sm">RON UUID</a> that can be of one of four <em>versions</em>:
NAME, TAG, LAMPORT, YOLO. The last two are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp">logical timestamps</a>.</li>
<li>INT, a 64-bit signed integer,</li>
<li>STRING, a Unicode string,</li>
<li>FLOAT, an IEEE 754 float.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A RON tuple contains zero or more RON atoms, of any types.
Tuple size is limited to 1GB in the <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/%27serial%27/ronc.sm">RONc form</a>.</li>
<li>A RON op is a RON tuple that also has its own globally unique UUID
(of a logical timestamp kind) and references some pre-existing op by
its UUID. This reference attaches the new op to the existing graph
of data. That way, RON builds data structures out of ops.</li>
<li>One or more RON ops form a <em>frame</em>. A frame can be a FACT, a QUERY,
or a CLAIM. In RONt, these are denoted with <code>;</code> <code>?</code> and <code>!</code> terminating signs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what RON is.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-swiftype-name="body" data-swiftype-type="text"><p>Confluent uses <a href="https://www.leadingagile.com/2018/04/step-by-step-toward-property-based-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">property-based testing</a> to test various aspects of Confluent Server’s <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/infinite-kafka-storage-in-confluent-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiered Storage</a> feature. Tiered Storage shifts data from expensive local broker disks to cheaper, scalable object storage, thereby reducing storage costs, rebalancing times, and improving elasticity. However, if Tiered Storage is not implemented correctly, the result can be significant data loss.</p>
<p>Property-based testing is highly effective when used in combination with traditional testing techniques, such as example-based testing, integration testing, and so on. This post describes some of the property-based testing that Confluent performs on the log-orientated storage layer of Confluent Server and how we test the integration of Tiered Storage with Apache Kafka<sup>®</sup>’s traditional storage layer.</p>
<p>Property-based testing aims to test several key behaviors of the log to ensure the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data must never be prematurely deleted due to the different forms of retention or other log operations</li>
<li>Data must never be exposed incorrectly to follower brokers or consumers</li>
<li>We should not tier data that may potentially be truncated due to Apache Kafka’s replication protocol</li>
</ul>
<p>To implement a stateful property test for the log layer, we used <a href="https://www.scalacheck.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ScalaCheck’s</a> <a href="https://github.com/typelevel/scalacheck/blob/master/doc/UserGuide.md#stateful-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stateful testing functionality</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the relevant terms to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log</strong>: the log that stores replica data for a partition</li>
<li><strong>System Under Test (SUT):</strong> the real system being modelled, which is a log in this case</li>
<li><strong>Log model:</strong> the modeled state for the system under test (SUT)</li>
<li><strong>Log segment:</strong> a unit of zero or more record batches; consists of a .log file and associated indices</li>
<li><strong>Active segment:</strong> the segment with the highest base offset and to which new appends will be written</li>
<li><strong>Retention:</strong> the process by which users control the size of a topic’s partitions by duration, size, or triggered deletions</li>
<li><strong>Log start offset:</strong> the inclusive lower bound offset for the log</li>
<li><strong>Log end offset:</strong> the exclusive upper bound offset for the log</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="initial-state-generator"><a id="initial-state-generator"></a>Initial state generator</h2>
<p>Every property test run must start with an initial state—in this case, a model of the log. To create this initial state, we define an initial state generator. The primary behavior that we are testing for is the correct behavior of retention logic. Two critical configurations for this behavior are <code><a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/topic-configs.html#retention.ms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retention.ms</a></code> (retention according to time) and <code><a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/topic-configs.html#confluent.tier.local.hotset.ms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confluent.tier.local.hotset.ms</a></code> (hotset retention). See below for a visualization of how hotset retention causes a Tiered Storage based log to span the tiered set and the local hotset data. Our initial state generator will generate configurations for these settings and an initial state.<br>

<pre>Generator:

hotsetRetentionMs &lt;- Gen.chooseNum[Long](0, 50) config = Map("retention.bytes" -&gt; Long.MaxValue,
             "retention.ms" -&gt; retentionMs,
             "confluent.tier.local.hotset.ms" -&gt; hotsetRetentionMs)

SUT:
log = new Log(generatedConfig)

Model state:
logStartOffset = 0
logEndOffset = 0

deletedLocalSegments = []
tieredSegments = []
deletedTieredSegments = []

</pre>
<h2 id="action-generator"><a id="action-generator"></a>Action generator</h2>
<p>The log property tests generate different sub-actions at various frequencies, ensuring that more common operations are performed more frequently in proportion to the number listed for each action. Descriptions of these actions will follow.</p>
<pre>Gen.frequency(
  (20, Append),
  (20, AdvanceHighWatermark),
  (20, Read),
  (10, AdvanceTime),
  (10, IncrementLogStartOffset),
  (10, TierUploadSegment),
  (10, RollSegment),
  (10, CommitTierState),
  (10, Retention),
  (10, TierRetention),
  (1, CloseAndReopen))
</pre>
<h2 id="append"><a id="append"></a><code>Append</code></h2>
<p><code>Append</code> generates a record batch of different record types, with a bounded range of timestamps and various compression choices. The generated record batch is then appended to the SUT log.<br>
The model state is updated to advance the log end offset and accumulate the records that have been appended.</p>
<pre>Action: Append(generatedRecords):

Generators:
CompressionType:
Gen.oneOf(CompressionType.NONE, CompressionType.SNAPPY, CompressionType.GZIP, CompressionType.LZ4)

Record:
timestamp &lt;- Gen.chooseNum[Long](baseTimestamp, minTimestamp)
key &lt;- Gen.oneOf(Gen.alphaNumStr.map(_.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)), Gen.const(null))
value &lt;- Gen.oneOf(Gen.alphaNumStr.map(_.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)), Gen.const(null))

RecordBatch:
magic &lt;- Gen.oneOf(RecordBatch.MAGIC_VALUE_V0, RecordBatch.MAGIC_VALUE_V1, RecordBatch.MAGIC_VALUE_V2)
records &lt;- Gen.nonEmptyListOf(Record)
compressionType &lt;- CompressionType

SUT action:
log.appendAsLeader(generatedRecordBatch)

Model action:
activeSegment.append(generatedRecordBatch)
records.add(generatedRecordBatch)
logEndOffset = logEndOffset :+ generatedRecordBatch.size
</pre>
<h2 id="advancehighwatermark"><code><a id="advancehighwatermark"></a>AdvanceHighWatermark</code></h2>
<p><code>AdvanceHighWatermark</code> simulates the movement of the high watermark (HWM). In Apache Kafka, high watermark increases occur as follower replicas fetch data from the leader.<br>
The high watermark affects several behaviors of the log. For example, it dictates the upper bounds of allowable retention, segments eligible for tiering, and log start offset movement resulting from <code>DeleteRecords</code> API calls.</p>
<p>Due to how Apache Kafka performs offset translation, we limit high watermark movements such that they align with record batch base offsets or the log end offset. The reason for this will be discussed later.</p>
<pre>Action: AdvanceHighwatermark(newHighwatermark):

SUT action:
log.updateHighWatermark(newHwm)

Model:
hwm = newHwm
</pre>
<h2 id="rollsegment"><code><a id="rollsegment"></a>RollSegment</code></h2>
<p><code>RollSegment</code> forces a segment roll on the SUT’s log. This is necessary because we set <code>segment.bytes</code> and <code>segment.ms</code> to their maximum possible values, given that this logic is currently unimplemented in the model. When it is implemented, this action will no longer be required.</p>
<pre>Action: RollSegment()

Log action:
Log.roll()

Model:
Create a new empty active segment if the existing active segment is empty
</pre>
<h2 id="tieruploadsegment"><code><a id="tieruploadsegment"></a>TierUploadSegment</code></h2>
<p><code>TierUploadSegment</code> checks whether any segments meet the necessary conditions for tiering and then simulates an upload of the segment to object storage. The candidate segment must meet the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The segment must not be the active segment</li>
<li>The segment end offset must be greater than the log start offset</li>
<li>The segment is the first tierable segment that has not otherwise been tiered</li>
<li>The segment end offset must be below the high watermark</li>
</ul>
<pre>Action: TierUploadSegment()

Log action:
simulateUpload(firstTierableSegment)

Model:
tieredSegments.add(firstTierableSegment)
</pre>
<h2 id="committierstate"><code><a id="committierstate"></a>CommitTierState</code></h2>
<p>Tiered logs contain local state consisting of metadata for tiered segments. Confluent Server achieves safety of the overall log by preventing deletion of any local segment covered by tiered segments until after this state has been safely committed (flushed).</p>
<pre>Action: CommitTierState()

Log action:
log.tierPartitionState.flush()

Model:
committedEndOffset = tieredSegments.last.endOffset
</pre>
<h2 id="incrementlogstartoffset"><code><a id="incrementlogstartoffset"></a>IncrementLogStartOffset</code></h2>
<p>The <code>IncrementLogStartOffset</code> action simulates two behaviors in Apache Kafka. The first is when an application or user uses the <code><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/index.html?org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/AdminClient.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DeleteRecords</a></code>API to advance the log start offset. The second is when a leader has a higher log start offset than the follower, which will trigger the advance of the log start offset via the replication protocol.</p>
<pre>Action: IncrementLogStartOffset(newLogStartOffset: Long)
Generated:
newLogStartOffset &lt;- Gen.chooseNum(state.logStartOffset, state.highWatermark)

Log action:
log.maybeIncrementLogStartOffset(newLogStartOffset, ClientRecordDeletion)

Model:
logStartOffset = newLogStartOffset
</pre>
<h2 id="retention"><code><a id="retention"></a>Retention</code></h2>
<p><code>Retention</code> applies Apache Kafka’s local log retention to the SUT in the following order of application:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>retention.ms</code></li>
<li><code>retention.bytes</code></li>
<li>log start offset</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of log start offset retention, any segments lower than the log start offset will be deleted. The retention action must be careful not to delete any local segments that are not deletable due to data that has been tiered. For example, if any tiered segments past the start offset are not deletable, then any following local segments will not be deletable.</p>
<pre>Action: Retention()

Log action:
log.deleteOldSegments()

Model:
Apply retention time retention
Advance the log start offset if any local segments have been deleted
Apply log start offset retention
Apply hotset time retention
</pre>
<h2 id="tierretention"><code><a id="tierretention"></a>TierRetention</code></h2>
<p>The <code>TierRetention</code> action performs retention for the tiered portion of the log. <code>TierRetention</code> is similar to normal log retention, except it is responsible for deletion of the section of the log that has been tiered.</p>
<pre>Action: TierRetention()

Log action:
log.tierDeleteOldSegments()

Model:
Delete the first tiered segment if it is below the log start offset or if maxTimestamp &lt; currentTimeMs - retention.ms
</pre>
<h2 id="closeandreopen"><code><a id="closeandreopen"></a>CloseAndReopen</code></h2>
<p><code>CloseAndReopen</code> closes the log and reopens it. It is important to test the opening of the log as it re-initializes critical variables and may perform log <code>recovery</code> if the log was not closed cleanly. If the generated recover variable is true, the log will be forced to perform log recovery from the beginning of the log as if it were not closed cleanly. This rebuilds in-memory epoch and producer states from local segments rather than restoring them from checkpointed states on disk.</p>
<pre>Action: CloseAndReopen(recover: Boolean)

Log action:
log.close()
new Log(recoveryOffset)

Model:
No action
</pre>
<h2 id="read"><code><a id="read"></a>Read</code></h2>
<p><code>Read</code> performs a read of the log starting at an offset under a particular isolation mode. The offset affects the starting point of the read, and isolation action affects the data that is allowed to be returned by the fetch. For example, for <code>FetchHighWatermark</code>, only records below the high watermark are allowed to be returned.</p>
<p><code>Read</code> is implemented here as an action rather than as a property check for two reasons. The first is that checking every potential combination of <code>fetchOffset</code> and <code>isolation</code> after every action will be expensive. Secondly, reads can affect the behavior of the log by advancing high watermarks, triggering values to be …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A writeup detailing the exposed employee records that Sakura Samurai managed to access during our security research through their vulnerability disclosure program.</p><p>Reading time: 3 minutes.</p><div>
      

<p>We noticed that The United Nations had a Vulnerability Disclosure Program and a Hall of Fame, therefore Sakura Samurai 桜の侍 our security research group, set out to look for vulnerabilities to report to the United Nations. During the research process Jackson Henry @JacksonHHax , Nick Sahler, John Jackson @johnjhacking and Aubrey Cottle @Kirtaner identified an endpoint that exposed Git Credentials. The credentials gave us the ability to download the Git Repositories, identifying a ton of user credentials and PII. In total, we identified over 100K+ private employee records. We also discovered multiple exposed .git directories on UN owned web servers [ilo.org], the .git contents could then be exfiltrated with various tools such as “git-dumper”.</p>

<p><strong>Travel Records [Two Documents: 102,000+ Records]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/travel-records.png" alt=""><br>
Travel Records Included Employee ID Numbers, Names, Employee Groups, Travel Justification, Start and End Dates, Length of Stay, Approval Status, Destination and the Length of the stay.</p>
<p><strong>HR Nationality Demographics [Two Documents: 7,000+ Records]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/nationality-records.png" alt=""><br>
Included Employee Name, Employee Group, Employee ID Numbers, Person’s Nationality, Person’s Gender, Employee Pay Grade, Organization Work Unit Identification Number and Organization Unit Text Tags.</p>
<p><strong>Generalized Employee Records [One document: 1,000+ Records]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/hr-records.png" alt=""><br>
Index Numbers, Employee Names, Employee Emails, Employee Work Subareas and Employee Org Units. Note: The column with the “Red number 1” represent the Employee’s specific work department and was blurred as some of the sub-units are smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Project and Funding Source Records [One Document: 4,000+ Records]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/project-funding.png" alt=""><br>
Included Project Identification Number, Affected Areas, Grant and Co-financing amounts, Implementing Agencies, Countries, Funding Sources, Period of the Project and if the Project/Concept was approved.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation Reports [One Document: 283 Projects]</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/eval-reports.png" alt=""><br>
Overall descriptions of the Evaluations and Reports, Periods Conducted and a link to the report on the project.</p>

<p>In addition, on the lesser side of severity, we managed to takeover a SQL Database and a Survey Management Platform belonging to the International Labour Organization - also in the UN’s VDP program scope. However, it was of note that the ILO vulnerabilities were of little prominence as the Database and Survey Management platform were fairly abandoned in nature and contained hardly anything of use. Nonetheless, a Database takeover and admin account takeover on a platform are still Critical vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>We had performed subdomain enumeration of all of the domains in scope for the VDP offered by the UN. During our research, we began to fuzz multiple endpoints with tooling and initially discovered that an ilo.org subdomain had an exposed .git contents. Utilizing git-dumper [<a href="https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper" title="https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper"><strong>https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper</strong></a>] we were able to dump the project folders hosted on the web application, resulting in the takeover of a MySQL database and of  survey management platform due to exposed credentials within the code.</p>
<p><strong>MySQL Credentials</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/sql.png" alt=""><br>
Note:</strong> <em>We will not provide a picture of the survey platform due to the specific nature of the application.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>After we had taken over one of the International Labour Organization’s MySQL Databases and performed account takeover on the survey management platform, we began to enumerate other domains/subdomains.</p>
<p>Eventually, we found a subdomain on the United Nations Environment Programme that allowed us to discover github credentials after a bit of fuzzing.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/git.png" alt=""><br>
Ultimately, once we discovered the GitHub credentials, we were able to download a lot of private password-protected GitHub projects and within the projects we found multiple sets of database and application credentials for the UNEP production environment. In total, we found <strong>7 additional credential-pairs</strong> which could have resulted in unauthorized access of multiple databases. We decided to stop and report this vulnerability once we were able to access PII that was exposed via Database backups that were in the private projects.</p>

The pandemic pushed us to use the internet in new ways: digital doctor visits, first dates and family dinners over Zoom, grocery shopping via apps.</p>  <p>The pandemic has not only magnified the value of the internet, but also what's <em>wrong</em> with it. Newsfeeds that spread misinformation. Digital ads that track and target us. Algorithms that make opaque decisions about our credit ratings or our dating lives. Smart speakers that listen to —&nbsp;and store —&nbsp;our every word.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In short: the internet is indispensable&nbsp;— and imperfect.</p>  <p>At this fraught moment in our digital society, Canada has a major opportunity to address much of what's wrong online. Several weeks ago, Canadian legislators in the House of Commons introduced<a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/P9TMCG922fJDMJvSKIpFD?domain=parl.ca" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-2/bill/C-11/first-reading" target="_blank"><u>Bill C-11</u></a> to <a href="https://parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-2/bill/C-11/first-reading">enact the Consumer Privacy Protection Act</a>.</p>  <p>Bill C-11 embodies the principles of Canada's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/062.nsf/eng/00119.html" target="_blank"><u>Digital Charter</u></a>, which envisions the internet as a tool for both innovation <em>and</em> the public good. And it hints at an internet where individual Canadians, not big tech platforms, are in full control of their data.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Of course, Bill C-11 is just that —&nbsp;a bill, not yet a law. It holds a great deal of promise, but it needs serious improvements if it is to live up to the vision outlined in the Digital Charter.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Canada is at an inflection point. We can improve this law so that it truly protects and empowers Canadians, giving us control over our relationship with Big Tech, gig economy companies and retailers who constantly track us online. Or, we can pass a law that makes a show of protecting privacy, but leaves many of the worst problems with the internet —&nbsp;limited consumer agency, no accountability for Big Tech —&nbsp; unsolved and unchecked.&nbsp;</p>  <p>For C-11 to succeed, we need movement on three fronts.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5863224.1609951759!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/ap-poll-social-media-trust.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5863224.1609951759!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/ap-poll-social-media-trust.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5863224.1609951759!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/ap-poll-social-media-trust.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5863224.1609951759!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/ap-poll-social-media-trust.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5863224.1609951759!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/ap-poll-social-media-trust.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5863224.1609951759!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/ap-poll-social-media-trust.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Bill C-11 includes privacy-protection measures such as the right to opt out of having personal data collected by third parties.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Rick Bowmer/Associated Press)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>First, we need to make sure the new rights the bill offers Canadians are clear and actionable.</p>  <p>What the bill includes so far is quite promising, things like the right to an explanation of why an artificial intelligence (AI) made a decision about me, or the right to opt out of having my data collected in the first place.</p>  <p>These things may sound abstract, but could have huge benefits in our everyday lives. Imagine if you could press a button to understand why Amazon or an airline is giving you a different price today than it did yesterday (an AI did that!). Or if you could join a points program at a store and understand why you received certain promotions but not others.</p>    <p>For instance, grocery or retail points programs often tailor rewards to match the foods and products that members of the program purchase most often, meaning that different people receive different discounts based on the data that has been collected. While this might seem more efficient, it also creates inequality as people that do not use a program's app cannot access the same modest discounts on everyday essentials available to a member.

<p>May 6<sup>th</sup>, 2020</p>
<p>The title is a bit of a lie. I think Python is a good, practical, language, and relatively easy to learn and to teach. Its vast collection of libraries let you slap together a program to do virtually anything you want. It doesn’t have the beauty of APL or lisp, and certainly nothing like the speed or expressive power of Julia, but it’s a tool anyone can use to make something that solves a real-world, non-trivial problem in a day or two. And if you’re programming the kind of website that uses forms and a database, it has the Django web framework, which alone might be a good enough reason to learn the language.</p>
<p>For me, what sometimes makes Python a pain in the neck is that it is an “object oriented” language. These are not the awesome message-passing objects as they were originally envisioned and implemented in Smalltalk. These “objects” are class based, and are attractively outfitted with multiple inheritance. As an individual programmer, you never need to write a single class. I certainly don’t. I use Python as a functional language. I create a program from many small, composable functions acting on lists, tuples, and dictionaries. This is not a criticism. Python was designed in the 1980s, when most people thought that classes were the way to go. They may still be the best choice for certain types of problems, but now there is growing regret directed at the need to live with and maintain large systems built from piles of classes all keeping secrets and inheriting from each other.</p>
<p>My beloved Django is a good example. If I want to customize its behavior, I need to wander though a maze of magical framework code, and end up littering my own code with opaque references to <em>this</em> and <em>that</em> and <em>super</em> and <em>meta</em>. I don’t bother any more, and just write my own code to replace the parts of Django that I want to be different, bypassing larger and larger parts of the framework. Despite all this, Django is such a mature and solid piece of engineering that I am loathe to abandon it.</p>
<p>As I said, the power of Python is the ability to leverage its libraries, including the ones added by so many people over the years. And here is the problem for the user of the language who might want to avoid the class-based paradigm and write functional code. The libraries are written by real Python programmers, which means that they are object oriented. They often don’t mesh well with code written in the functional style, are a pain to modify, and do things you might not expect.</p>
<p>Here is a little example that, I hope, shows you some of what I mean. I needed to write a program that reads, parses, and writes bibtex files. These are plain-text databases of publications familiar to anyone who uses the LaTeX document preparation system. The database stores the bibliographic information about some list of publications; you just mention its location in your LaTeX document, and you can get citations and a reference section typeset in any style you need. Naturally, there’s a Python library for parsing bibtex: it’s called <code>bibtexparser</code>. Did I mention that there is a library for everything? That’s why we’re using Python. This library can read the file and parse it into a special object, the BibDatabase. This object has a property called <code>entries</code>; the <code>entries</code> is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the bibliographic information for one publication, with keys like <em>author</em>, <em>title</em>, etc. There is a special key called <code>ID</code> that uniquely identifies each publication. It’s chosen by the author as a mnemonic tag for use in citations. The documentation of this library is, frankly, not very good, and I had to experiment to see just how it works. I found that I could modify the <code>entries</code>, or delete from or add to the list, and my alterations were reflected when writing the new bibtex file back to disk. So far, so good.</p>
<p>The BibDatabase object has another way to represent the data. It has an <code>entries_dict</code> property, too, which is a dictionary of dictionaries. Each publication appears as a dictionary with a key that is the publication’s <code>ID</code>. In other words, it’s almost the same as the <code>entries</code> list, but with the data arranged a little differently. Instead of a list of dictionaries, it’s a dictionary whose values are dictionaries and whose keys are the <code>ID</code>s. This makes sense, and is the most natural way to represent this data.</p>
<p>At some point in my program, it became convenient to use the <code>entries_dict</code> version of the data rather than the <code>entries</code> view of it. I found that I could alter the contents of any of the dictionaries, and the changes, again, were faithfully preserved when I converted the BibDatabase into a file on disk. But then I tried to add a new publication by adding an entry to the <code>entries_dict</code> dictionary. The new publication did <em>not</em> appear in the output file.</p>
<p>The documentation was no help. I started reading the source code, and, no surprise, it was based on classes. Not transparent functions transforming data structures, but opaque classes with super-secret methods for doing everything. When the user asks for the <code>entries</code> or the <code>entries_dict</code>, or adds items to them, private code is run behind the scenes, as is common in class-based systems. These secret methods and <code>properties</code> add a publication to the object when you append to its <code>entries</code>, but not when you enlarge its <code>entries_dict</code>. It was easy to modify my code to take this into account. But I wished I had known about it in advance and not wasted an hour or two puzzling over it.</p>
<p>This is a typical Python library, and this is why using Python can be so annoying. If you want to use the library in a way a little differently from how its creator intended, you may trip over surprising behavior, and will have to wade through a maze (sometimes—this library happens to be quite simple) of class-based source code to figure out what all the secret methods are doing. It may be a matter of taste, but I find that using and understanding libraries in Clojure or Julia to be a refreshing contrast.</p>

<p>Developers hate legacy code. It’s dirty, it’s crowded, it’s ugly, it’s messy, it’s… old. But we shouldn’t have a negative outlook on legacy or old code. It’s there for a reason, we just need to appreciate that reason.</p>



<p>When starting a new job and getting your first look at the legacy codebase, it’s easy to be frightened or disgusted. If the code has been around for a long time (in Internet years), it probably doesn’t meet modern style guides or follow modern practices. We can easily look at this code and deem it inferior to the code that is being written presently. To do so, though, is to disrespect the developers and the decisions that came before us.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“<em>Legacy code is established</em>“</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>We need to reframe our minds and stop hating and disrespecting legacy code and instead appreciate it for what it is: legacy code is established. The lines you’re judging are there for a reason; they have lasted the test of time; they have served a purpose. Most importantly of all, they have given you a job. Without those “old” or “ugly” lines of code, you would not have the job that you’re using now to put down that very code.</p>



<p>Programmers don’t set out with the intention of writing bad or ugly code. They don’t sit down and think of the most convoluted solution they can write. Code becomes complex, intertwined, and unpleasant over time. Each feature begins with a single typed character and builds from there. As the business grows and its needs change, so does the code. </p>



<p>A friend of mine once said that “bad” code is the product of not enough time, poorly defined requirements, or inexperience, not necessarily a bad programmer. Business moves fast and as developers, we’re constantly working against the clock to release features to draw in customers and make more money. It’s for these reasons that we must change how we think about and see legacy code – it is not something to be looked down upon, it is a legacy that was passed down to us that we must now carry forward for the next generation of programmers. When we are handed a legacy codebase, it becomes ours to shepherd forward.</p>



<p>Build and improve upon the legacy, but overall, respect it.</p>

<p>A Tesla Model Y Standard Range is spotted with the heated steering wheel option activated. This useful feature for the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/cold-weather/">cold weather</a> is not found in the earlier versions of the Model Ys delivered since last year. Tesla has not yet officially advertised this feature in the online configurator or via an official tweet. </p>



<p>But Tesla has got a large and vibrant community across the social media sphere news outlets like ours to publicize the hidden features and upgrades for the company.</p>



<p>The Kilowatts / Twitter seems to be the first Tesla owner finding out about the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-y/">Tesla Model Y</a> heated steering feature in a recently launched cheapest version of the  Model Y named <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2021/01/08/model-y-rwd-3rd-row-leaked-photos-model-3-compare/">Standard Range RWD</a>.</p>

<p>Interestingly, like Tesla always does, the feature was added to the vehicle for no extra cost or hiking the price of the existing variants.

<p>The following video shows how to turn the heated steering wheel ON or OFF by tapping the climate icon (the fan icon) on the center touchscreen. When the climate control menu pops up, you need to tap the squiggly lines icon on the left to bring up the seat and steering heater controls, now you can turn the heated steering by tapping the tab with the steering icon.</p>

<p>The introduction of the heated steering wheel for the Model Y and even for the base variant might be a step taken to give Volkswagen ID.4 a more tough competition in the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/tesla-in-europe/">European</a> and US market. Tesla China has upgraded the locally made <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Tesla Model 3</a> with the heated steering wheel but we have yet to witness this on a Fremont made US Model 3.</p>



<p>It’s not clear though if Tesla is going to give existing owners the option for a heated steering wheel retrofit, we will soon find out and let you know.</p>



<p>To fight cold weather, Tesla also recently launched a <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/11/13/tesla-introduces-the-new-model-y-20-winter-wheels-and-tire-package/">winter tire and wheels package</a> for the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-y/">Tesla Model Y</a>.</p>



<p>On a side note, a large number of Tesla <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-s/">Model S</a>, 3, X, and Y cars are spotted at a rented parking lot in Dublin, California — seems Q1 2021 has started strongly for Tesla (TSLA) after the record Q4 2020.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We love Hetzner ❤️. </p>



<p>They have a great offering with a lot of stability and great prices. Therefore we basically provide all our services from within one of the many german datacenters. Running our Kubernetes Cluster with them was no question and one year after our first experiments with Kubernetes, we can even see a tight integration with all the Hetzner Cloud Services.</p>



<p>Hetzner currently offers the following cloud services we want to make use of in our Clusters:</p>



<ul><li>Servers (obviously)</li><li>Volumes</li><li>Private Networks</li><li>Load Balancers</li><li>DNS API (not a part of the Cloud offering but important)</li></ul>



<p>Since we are already running multiple Clusters (production, staging &amp; testing) and expect to run even more in the future, as well as the ease of usage we have with it, we are using Rancher and the RKE K8s distribution.</p>



<p>How to setup a rancher instance is pretty well documented around the internet and our recommendation is to start off with a single node install using k3s/rke/microK8s which can then expanded as you go: <a href="https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/">https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/</a></p>



<p>After you have setup the rancher instance, the Hetzner fun begins. The expectation here is that you already are familiar with the Hetzner UI and where to find your API Token and all the features we are talking about. For this way of setting up Rancher and Clusters, we don’t need them to be in the same project. We are recommending one project per cluster you plan to spin up.</p>



<p>All instructions are written as of 12th January 2021 and user Rancher v2.5.</p>



<h2>Rancher Node Driver</h2>



<p>First of we need to give Rancher the ability to spin new nodes (Cloud Servers) up and down. For this we are going to use the <a href="https://github.com/JonasProgrammer/docker-machine-driver-hetzner">Hetzner Cloud Docker machine driver</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mxschmitt/ui-driver-hetzner">custom UI plugin for Rancher</a>. <a href="https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/hcloud-install-rancher-single#step-4---setup-hetzner-cloud-node-driver">Set the Node Driver up in the Global Rancher View</a>, then go on to configure the first <a href="https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/user-settings/node-templates/">node templates</a> in your user profile. Here you need a API token from the project you want the cluster to be in.</p>



<p>Create a private network in the Hetzner Cloud UI and select it in the node template, but don’t select the private network to be used here in the UI, we will do that later.</p>



<p>We recommend one template for the Control Plane and etcd Servers with at least CX21 Servers and another template for the workers wich should realistically also at least be CX21. </p>



<p>Add a label to the worker node template which we will need later for the load balancer. We are using <code>mecodia.cloud/type=worker</code> but it doesn’t really matter. </p>



<p>Save the template and create your first cluster.</p>



<h2>Cluster Creation</h2>



<p>Create a cluster in Rancher. If you are using the cluster seriously start of with 3 management (Control Plane &amp; etcd) servers and 3 worker servers otherwise read up on the pros and cons of having less than 3 management servers.</p>



<p>Now we get to the juicy part of the cluster creation. In the form select cloud provider external and then change into the yaml edit view. Here we need to add some additional info for Rancher and RKE. We use the <code>addons</code> and <code>addones_include</code> directives to setup the <a href="https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-cloud-controller-manager">Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager</a> after we have the nodes ready. </p>



<p>In theory we could also setup other <code>addons</code> here like cert-manager, but since <code>addons_include</code> are resolved and saved into etcd we can only save 1.5 MBytes of data, while cert-manager yamls alone consume 1.6 MBytes.</p>



<pre><code>rancher_kubernetes_engine_config:
  cloud_provider:
    name: external
  addons: |-
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: hcloud
      namespace: kube-system
    stringData:
      token: "API_TOKEN"
      network: "PRIVATE_NETWORK_ID"
  addons_include:
    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mecodia/hetzner-rancher-cluster-base/main/hcloud-cloud-controller-manager.yaml
    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mecodia/hetzner-rancher-cluster-base/main/hcloud-csi-driver.yaml</code></pre>



<p>You can find all files we use here and changed in our github repository: <a href="https://github.com/mecodia/hetzner-rancher-cluster-base">https://github.com/mecodia/hetzner-rancher-cluster-base</a></p>



<p>In difference to the yaml files provided by <a href="https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-cloud-controller-manager">Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager</a> we use the <code>HCLOUD_NETWORK</code> environment variable which enabled the Cloud Controller to tell Kubernetes the internal IP of the Node without attaching the network, because we already did that on node setup or using it for inter pod communication, which we leave that up to our chosen network CNI plugin.</p>



<p>We also deploy the <a href="https://github.com/hetznercloud/csi-driver/">Hetzner CSI Driver</a> into our cluster as the default storage class for <code>PersistentVolumeStorage</code>. The difference to the original yaml is that we use the same secret for the Cloud Controller and the CSI Driver. With the CSI Driver installed we can make use of persistent volume claims in our statefullset deployments like databases or bucket storage.</p>



<p>After you are done, hit the create button at the bottom of the page and wait for the cluster to be ready. This will take a while (between 5 to 10 minutes) until the cluster is completely ready. In the meanwhile we can go back to the Hetzner Cloud UI and setup the Load Balancer.</p>



<h2>The Load Balancer</h2>



<p>To have access to our cluster we have to setup at least one load balancer. In the Hetzner Cloud UI create a new Load Balancer in the same project as the rest of the cluster. Select the same region as your servers and select the same private network. Create a new target by label and use the label you setup for your worker nodes in the node templates. Also select to use the private network.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1014" height="918" src="https://tech.mecodia.cloud/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2021/01/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://tech.mecodia.cloud/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2021/01/image.png 1014w, https://tech.mecodia.cloud/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2021/01/image-300x272.png 300w, https://tech.mecodia.cloud/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2021/01/image-768x695.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1014px) 100vw, 1014px"></figure>



<p>Create two tcp services, one from and to port 80 (HTTP) and one from and to port 443 (HTTPS). In both cases activate the proxy protocol. Choose a algorithm and a name and hit the create button.</p>



<p>This way we have a single IP into our cluster while also having load balancing capabilities. SSL Termination happens on the ingress which allows us to run cert-manager and aquire LetsEncrypt Cerificates, but we loose the ability to have sticky sessions. You have to decide which tradeoff you want, but the setup works for 90% of cases.</p>



<h2>HTTPS Certificates for our Cluster wildcard certificates</h2>



<p>Speaking of HTTPS Certificates, we check if our cluster already is in a ready state and has finished setting up. If the cluster is ready we can install <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/">cert-manager</a> through one of the documented ways. After that we install the <a href="https://github.com/mecodia/cert-manager-webhook-hetzner">cert-manager-webhook-hetzner</a> in the same namespace. This is highly important and will possibly break the webhook if not done correctly.</p>



<p>After we have finished this setup we can setup our ClusterIssuers with Hetzner DNS for wildcard certificates or just simple certificates.</p>



<pre><code>apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha3
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-production
spec:
  acme:
    email: YOU_MAIL_HERE
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      # Secret resource used to store the account's private key.
      name: acme-production-issuer-account-key
    solvers:
      - http01:
          ingress:
            class: nginx
      - dns01:
          webhook:
            groupName: dns.hetzner.cloud
            solverName: hetzner
            config:
              APIKey: HETZNER_DNS_API_TOKEN
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha3
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: selfsign
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
</code></pre>



<p>We also add a selfsigned certificate ClusterIssuer into the mix we can use to generate certificates for other internal services like Databases and others.</p>



<p>Now you can generate Certificates for <code>Ingress</code> resources and validate those either via <code>dns01</code> or <code>http01</code> challenges by using the annotations:</p>



<pre><code>annotations:
  cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production</code></pre>



<h2>Wrapping up</h2>



<p>Now our basic Hetzner cluster setup is done and tightly integrated with all Hetzner services we want to use:</p>



<p><strong>Servers</strong> are deployed by Rancher with the docker-machine driver.</p>



<p><strong>Volumes</strong> are provisioned and managed by the CSI Driver</p>



<p>All our cluster internal traffic is routed through our <strong>private network</strong></p>



<p>The<strong> Load Balancer </strong>is the (web) entrance to our (auto-scaling) cluster and can also be used in ingress deployment by using <code>type: LoadBalancer</code></p>



<p>We provision LetsEncrypt Certificates to our ingresses with the help of the <strong>Hetzner DNS API</strong>.</p>



<p>There are some caveats to this setup, as the LoadBalancer deployed as ingress is not yet as finely tuned as other clouds load balancers and will just target all servers. The private network is only used for node communication with an overlay network for pod communication. Other than that, we are pretty happy with the setup and will probably have more than one cluster running with that setup.</p>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>We are experiencing some of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/days-with-most-us-catastrophe-deaths-16-this-year-2020-12" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>deadliest days</span></a> in American history, but the magnitude of the ongoing disaster defies human comprehension. As the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths climbed during 2020 and reached new heights in 2021, search volumes for Covid-related terms, specifically “cases” and “deaths,” have not followed suit. One might think that concern about the pandemic, measured through these metrics, would closely follow the severity of the disease. Instead, we are seeing just the opposite: people’s interest has, if anything, declined as the disease has intensified. Why is this and how might it be affecting our response to the pandemic?</p>
<!--more-->
<div><p>As the U.S. trudges through the deadliest period of the pandemic so far, The Factual set out to explore why Americans seemingly care less and less about a disease that is killing thousands prematurely every day. We reviewed 31 articles from 26 sources across the political spectrum to examine human responses to immense suffering and why American’s may be numb to the ongoing impacts of Covid-19.</p></div>

<p>These circles represent some of the deadliest days (from a single cause) in the last 100 years.</p>
<h4><strong><br>Declining Searches for “Cases” and “Deaths”</strong></h4>
<p>More than 370,000 Americans have died from Covid-19, with the daily death toll at its highest yet in recent days. On January 7 alone, 4,112 Americans died. That’s the equivalent of nearly 30 standard 737s crashing in a single day, each <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/09/why-minds-brains-cannot-make-sense-coronavirus-enormous-death-toll/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>loaded with 138 people</span></a>. It’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/days-with-most-us-catastrophe-deaths-16-this-year-2020-12" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>more American deaths</span></a> than from D-Day in 1944 and more than from the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. No matter how we split up and conceptualize these numbers — a tactic journalists use to make impacts <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>more tangible</span></a> — we fail to capture each of the individuals that these statistics include.</p>
<p>As thousands die, Americans are seemingly paying less attention. According to Google’s tracking mechanism for online searches, Google Trends, interest in “cases” and “deaths” <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=cases,deaths" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>peaked</span></a> the week of March 22, when cases were <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_totalandratecases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rapidly surpassing</span></a> the 100,000 mark but fewer than 50 Americans had died. (The search terms are closely linked, but not exclusive, to the Covid-19 pandemic.) Smaller peaks appear the week of June 21 and, to a lesser degree, in the weeks prior to Thanksgiving — times when warnings were abound about an impending spike in cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in the subsequent peaks in Covid-19 deaths, and now, with more than 2,000 deaths every day for the last month, searches for these terms have failed to match the severity of the disease (note, however, that searches for “covid” generally have been consistent with trends in severity). For example, searches for "cases" and "deaths" are now at roughly a quarter of their March and April 2020 peaks, even as 10 times as many cases appear every day and twice as many people die.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>This counterintuitive divergence seems to be explained by a combination of psychological, political, and demographic factors. However, at the very least, our inability to comprehend such widespread death continues to undermine our pandemic response.</p></div>

<div><p>Note: Searches are measured on a scale of 1 to 100 from January 12, 2020 to January 9, 2021. 100 represents the highest number of searches in a given week over the time period.<br>Source: <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2020-01-12%202021-01-09&amp;geo=US&amp;q=cases,deaths" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Google Trends</span></a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/united-states?country=~USA" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Our World in Data</span></a></p></div>
<h4><strong>Psychological Factors</strong></h4>
<p>The most common explanations have to do with human psychology and the way we think about problems. For starters, humans have a hard time <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200630-what-makes-people-stop-caring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>comprehending large numbers</span></a> and tend to downplay risk even as the numbers, and risk, increase exponentially. This inability to appreciate larger numbers plays out through “psychic numbing,” a phenomena which suggests that humans are far more impacted and attuned to first instances of danger but grow <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/21/covid-why-we-ignore-deaths/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">less worried</a> as the numbers increase and the threat is prolonged. For example, the difference between no one dying and one person dying is quite large, but the difference between the 100th and 101st death is far less impactful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As evidence, scientists have shown that focusing on individuals and personal suffering, rather than large numbers, is much more effective at attracting interest and attention. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/21/covid-why-we-ignore-deaths/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Popularly cited examples</span></a> come from experiments like those conducted by Paul Slovic, a professor at the University of Oregon, who identified that people are far more likely to donate to help a single starving child than to help successively larger groups of children. Human behavior is prone to connect to individuals and circumstances where we feel we can have an impact. Increasing the number of people dilutes our ability to connect and our perceived ability to make a difference. This effect can be seen elsewhere, such as with <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2020/08/why-dont-dead-matter/167840/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>wars</span></a> and genocides. Slovic’s work, for one, <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>demonstrates</span></a> that in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan genocide “subjects were less willing to send the same amount of aid to a refugee camp of 250,000 than they were to a refugee camp of 11,000.” This mechanism helps to explain how each additional Covid case or death does not equate to an attendant increase in risk or concern, and may even give way to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200630-what-makes-people-stop-caring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>complacency</span></a>.</p>
<div><p>Furthermore, humans are far more attuned to immediate and recognizable risk, such as an armed assailant or an acute natural disaster. It is far more difficult to comprehend the true magnitude of a complex web of <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>seemingly low-risk events</span></a>, be it from a virus with a low mortality rate or from the incremental unseen changes of climate change. Both have effects that are spread over time and hard to capture in any single, concise event. This obscures the connection between human behavior and any positive or negative ramifications. Furthermore, as the symptoms repeat with increasing frequency — be it the 312,672nd death or yet another warmest year on record&nbsp;— each additional iteration tends to make less of an impact. As Melissa Funicane, a social scientist at the Rand Corporation, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200630-what-makes-people-stop-caring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>put it</span></a>: “the average human who’s not a statistical analyst or epidemiologist, doesn’t have the tools you need at their fingertips to make judgements about something as vast and complex as the global pandemic.”</p></div>
<h4><strong>Political Factors</strong></h4>
<p>Another clear potential reason comes from the spurious narrative that many of these deaths are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-94-percent-covid-among-caus/fact-check-94-of-individuals-with-additional-causes-of-death-still-had-covid-19-idUSKBN25U2IO" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>not actually due to Covid-19</span></a>. A popular conspiracy even goes so far as to suggest that medical authorities are attributing deaths from a range of causes to Covid-19 in an effort to make the crisis more dire, spread fear, and permit stronger government action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These narratives have been <a href="https://undark.org/2020/11/10/covid-19-death-counts-conspiracy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>repeatedly</span></a> and <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/trump-baselessly-suggests-covid-19-deaths-inflated-for-profit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>soundly</span></a> <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/30/trump-promotes-the-outlandish-claim-that-covid-19-has-killed-a-minuscule-number-of-americans/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rejected</span></a>, and many suspect the true toll to be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/01/03/trump-claims-covid-deaths-are-exaggerated-as-us-surpasses-350000/?sh=10965bbc37b6" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>even higher</span></a> than the official figures. But whether or not people fully ascribe to the idea that deaths have been over-reported, it has played into doubt around the seriousness of the disease and whether official tallies and government warnings about its seriousness should be trusted. Arguments against the severity of Covid-19, such as that it is little different from the common flu, drive down concern about the virus, especially in more conservative populations. In December, Pew Research <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/12/03/intent-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-rises-to-60-as-confidence-in-research-and-development-process-increases/#republicans-and-democrats-differ-over-outbreaks-threat-to-public-health" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>found</span></a> that just 43% of Republicans see Covid-19 as a major threat to public health, compared to 84% of Democrats. Though there is fixation on Covid-19’s low mortality rate, now <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid?country=~USA" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>just below 2%</span></a> in the U.S., there is a larger failure to recognize the scope of human suffering that mortality rate delivers across millions of cases, let alone from the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22166236/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-symptoms-heart-fatigue" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>10% (or more) of patients</span></a> who exhibit <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-problem-of-long-haul-covid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>long-term effects</span></a>. The severity of the disease, it seems, often fails to resonate until people are <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/12/12/coronavirus-deaths-highest-us-rural-republican-leaning-county/3828902001/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>personally, and often irreversibly</span></a>, affected, a dynamic that is <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>not restricted</span></a> to the U.S. or the issue Covid-19.</p>
<div><p>In hyper-partisan conditions, it is no surprise that as the disease became politicized, certain populations may have begun to pay less attention. If one doesn’t believe that it is as deadly or widespread as is being reported, there’s little reason to monitor its progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>
<h4><strong>Demographic Factors</strong></h4>
<p>A final set of potential factors relates to specific populations that society consistently undervalues. These populations have <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-viz-covid-19-deaths-in-illinois-20210101-etvvpateifbzbbjkf33maqdqme-htmlstory.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>suffered the worst impacts</span></a> but are also those most commonly pushed out of sight, be it the elderly locked away in nursing homes or minority groups relegated to impoverished and underserved communities.</p>
<p>For example, Covid-19’s impacts are particularly acute on the elderly, who account for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/who-is-dying-from-covid-19-why-11601407258" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>roughly 8 in 10</span></a> of those who die. In a range of experiments, scientists have shown globally that people consistently <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/covid-death-toll-us-empathy-elderly/616379/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>undervalue the elderly</span></a> vis-à-vis others, generally falling back on the explanation that those with fewer years left to live are less valuable than those with many more productive years ahead. Even if each of these individuals may be a deeply loved parent, sibling, friend, or mentor, this implicit devaluation plays into an interpretation that the disease is one that specifically impacts the elderly and is therefore less of a concern.</p>
<div><p>The virus has had a similarly outsized impact on <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/14/946045921/how-do-we-grieve-300-000-lives-lost" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>minority communities</span></a>. Data suggests, for example, that Black, Latino, and Indigenous Americans are several times more likely than white Americans to both be hospitalized and die from Covid-19. In LA, the site of the country’s worst outbreak, Latinos <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article247434155.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>account for</span></a> 59% of cases and 48.5% of deaths, even though they only account for 40% of the population. Individuals from these communities make up many of the essential workers who continue to work in <a href="https://theconversation.com/black-and-latino-essential-workers-experience-greater-safety-concerns-than-their-white-counterparts-141180" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>dangerous conditions</span></a> and typically have less of a safety net to fall back on. In a country that has consistently underserved minority communities, especially in <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/23/914427907/as-pandemic-deaths-add-up-racial-disparities-persist-and-in-some-cases-worsen" rel="noopener" target="_blank">matters of public health</a>, it’s no wonder that these communities <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/covid-death-toll-us-empathy-elderly/616379/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>suffer disproportionately</span></a> and that the country as a whole — which is roughly 70% white — may be less attuned to the severity of the problem.</p></div>

                <p>I was 12 years old when I first heard about SQL triggers. My brother, Jonathan, had just begun his software career at a startup. Jonathan came home one day frustrated by a database full of convoluted SQL triggers.</p><p>With my only programming experience being recreating my favorite video game in VB6, I had little consolation to offer.</p><p>Fast forward 16 years, and now I can see from my brother’s perspective. In the world of open source start-up style full-stack development (think Django, Rails, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, Postgres..), ORMs are very popular and features like SQL triggers are far less conventional.</p><p>But there is still value with SQL triggers. During my time working on custom ERP-like software, SQL triggers were an invaluable tool. When building highly data oriented software, especially when the data is of financial nature and accuracy is of high demand, you're more likely to see data being manipulated at a lower level, in a more direct way.</p><p>This article contains all the information I wish I could have shared with my brother on how to effectively use SQL triggers.</p><h3 id="table-of-contents">Table of contents</h3><ul><li><a href="#what-is-a-sql-trigger">What is a SQL Trigger?</a></li><li><a href="#how-to-create-a-sql-trigger-postgres-syntax">How to Create a SQL Trigger - Syntax</a></li><li><a href="#postgres-trigger-example-1-creating-a-time-clock">Postgres Trigger Example 1: Creating a Time Clock</a></li><li><a href="#postgres-trigger-example-2-creating-an-audit-table">Postgres Trigger Example 2: Creating an Audit Table</a></li><li><a href="#additional-considerations-for-triggers">Additional Considerations for Triggers</a></li></ul><h2 id="what-is-a-sql-trigger">What is a SQL Trigger?</h2><p>SQL Triggers, also called Database Triggers, allow you to tell your SQL engine (for these examples, Postgres) to run a piece of code when an event happens, or even before the event.</p><p>In Postgres, you delineate the code to run by creating a function whose return type is <code>trigger</code>. In some other engines like MySQL, the code block is a part of and inside the trigger.</p><p>Before I discuss what the different event types are and the specific syntax for creating a trigger, why would you want to use a database trigger? </p><h3 id="advantages-of-using-sql-triggers">Advantages of using SQL Triggers</h3><h5 id="maintaining-data-integrity">Maintaining data integrity</h5><p>Database triggers have a variety of uses and are an excellent tool to marshal strict data integrity. Alternate solutions like Django's model hooks may fail if you have other application servers or users accessing the database who aren't aware of the specific business logic coded in your application.</p><h5 id="separating-business-logic">Separating business logic</h5><p>Coding critical business logic within the application code also presents problems when the business logic is updated. If you had a business requirement to multiply an incoming number by 10, and you wanted to revise this logic to multiply the number by 20, changing the logic in SQL would guarantee that every piece of data from that exact deploy time on would be affected by the new logic.</p><p>The SQL server acts as a single point of truth. If the logic is implemented on multiple application servers, you can no longer expect a clean, definitive change in behavior.</p><h5 id="atomic-transactions">Atomic transactions</h5><p>Natural atomicity is another desirable feature bundled with triggers. Since the event and the trigger function are all part of one atomic transaction, you know with absolute certainty that the trigger will fire if the event fires. They are as one, in perfect SQL matrimony.</p><h2 id="how-to-create-a-sql-trigger-postgres-syntax">How to Create a SQL Trigger - Postgres Syntax</h2><p>Here are the components to creating a trigger for your database:</p><ol><li>Trigger Event Type</li><li>Before or After the event</li><li>Effect of the Trigger</li></ol><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-10-at-23.30.24.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-10-at-23.30.24.png 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-10-at-23.30.24.png 1000w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-10-at-23.30.24.png 1600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-10-at-23.30.24.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>SQL Trigger Anatomy</figcaption></figure><h3 id="trigger-event-types">Trigger event types</h3><p>Database triggers will monitor tables for specific events. Here are some examples of different events that can activate a trigger:</p><ul><li>Changing data: <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, <code>DELETE</code></li></ul><p>A database trigger can also list more than one of these events.</p><p>If <code>UPDATE</code> was one of the listed events, you can pass in a list of columns that should activate the trigger. If you don't include this list, updating any column will activate it.</p><h3 id="trigger-before-or-after">Trigger <code>BEFORE</code> or <code>AFTER</code></h3><p>A trigger can run either <code>BEFORE</code> or <code>AFTER</code> an event.</p><p>If you want to block an event like an <code>INSERT</code>, you will want to run <code>BEFORE</code>. If you need to be sure the event actually is going to occur, <code>AFTER</code> is ideal.</p><h3 id="effect-of-the-trigger">Effect of the trigger</h3><p>A trigger can run either per row, or per statement. Let's say you run a single <code>UPDATE</code> statement that changes 5 rows in a table. </p><p>If you specify <code>FOR EACH ROW</code> in the trigger, then the trigger will run 5 times. If you specified <code>FOR EACH STATEMENT</code>, then it would only run once.</p><p>And of course we can't forget the actual code to run when the trigger is activated. In Postgres, is placed in a function and separated from the trigger. Separating the trigger from the code it runs creates cleaner code and allows multiple triggers to execute the same code.</p><h2 id="postgres-trigger-example-1-creating-a-time-clock">Postgres Trigger Example #1: Creating a Time Clock</h2><p>A time clock records when an employee comes and leaves from work and calculates his/her total hours worked. Let's create an example time clock and look at how we can use triggers to prevent employees from inputting invalid data. </p><h3 id="setting-up-the-db-schema">Setting up the DB schema</h3><p>The design of this schema treats each punch in and out as separate events. Each event is a row in the <code>time_punch</code> table. Alternatively, you could also make each employee" shift" an event and store both the punch in and punch out time in one row.</p><p>Subscribe to our newsletter to get notified of a future post where I’ll do a deep dive on how to define a strong database schema.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
    <h3>The SQL editor that speeds up your workflow</h3>
    
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>For this example I've gone ahead and defined the schema for our tables. The code below creates an <code>employee</code> and <code>time_punch</code> table and inserts some time punch data for a new employee, Bear. </p><pre><code>create table employee (
  id serial primary key,
  username varchar
);

create table time_punch (
  id serial primary key,
  employee_id int not null references employee(id),
  is_out_punch boolean not null default false,
  punch_time timestamp not null default now()
);

insert into employee (username) values ('Bear');
insert into time_punch (employee_id, is_out_punch, punch_time)
values
(1, false, '2020-01-01 10:00:00'),
(1, true, '2020-01-01 11:30:00');
</code></pre><p>Bear has clocked in at 10:00am and out at 11:30am (long day at work). Let's write a SQL query to calculate how long Bear has worked.</p><p>Take a pause here and think about how you would solve this given our schema and using only SQL.</p><hr><h3 id="using-sql-to-calculate-time-worked">Using SQL to calculate time worked</h3><p>The solution I decided on looks at each "out" punch and matches it with its preceding "in" punch.</p><pre><code>select tp1.punch_time - tp2.punch_time as time_worked
from time_punch tp1
join time_punch tp2
on tp2.id = (
	select tps.id
	from time_punch tps
	where tps.id &lt; tp1.id
	and tps.employee_id = tp1.employee_id
	and not tps.is_out_punch
	order by tps.id desc limit 1
)
where tp1.employee_id = 1
and tp1.is_out_punch</code></pre><pre><code>time_worked
-------------
 01:30:00
(1 row)</code></pre><p>In this query I select all the out punches, then I join them to the closest preceding "in" punch. Subtract the timestamps, and we get how many hours Bear worked for each shift! </p><p>One of the issues with this schema is that it is possible for you to insert several "in" or "out" punches in a row. With the query we’ve created, this would introduce ambiguities that could lead to inaccurate calculations and employees getting paid more or less than they should.</p><h3 id="sql-insert-before-trigger-example-preserving-data-integrity">SQL <code>INSERT BEFORE</code> trigger example - preserving data integrity</h3><p>We need something to prevent the in/out pattern from being interrupted. Unfortunately check constraints only look at the row being inserted or updated and cannot factor in data from other rows.</p><p>This is a perfect situation to use a database trigger!</p><p>Let's create a trigger to prevent an <code>INSERT</code> event that would break our pattern. First we'll create the "trigger function". This function is what the trigger will execute when the event type is detected. </p><p>A trigger function is created like a regular Postgres function, except that it returns a <code>trigger</code>.</p><pre><code>create or replace function fn_check_time_punch() returns trigger as $psql$
  begin
    if new.is_out_punch = (
      select tps.is_out_punch
      from time_punch tps
      where tps.employee_id = new.employee_id
      order by tps.id desc limit 1
    ) then
      return null;
    end if;
    return new;
  end;
$psql$ language plpgsql;
</code></pre><p>The <code>new</code> keyword represents the values of the row that is to be inserted. It also is the object you can return to allow the insert to continue. Alternatively, when <code>null</code> is returned this stops the insertion.</p><p>This query finds the <code>time_punch</code> before and ensures its in/out value is not the same as what's being inserted. If the values are the same, then the trigger returns <code>null</code> and the time_punch is not recorded. Otherwise, the trigger returns <code>new</code> and the <code>insert</code> statement is allowed to continue.</p><p>Now we'll link the function as a trigger to the <code>time_punch</code> table. <code>BEFORE</code> is crucial here. If we ran this trigger as an <code>AFTER</code> trigger it would run too late to stop the insertion.</p><pre><code>create trigger check_time_punch before insert on time_punch for each row execute procedure fn_check_time_punch();
</code></pre><p>Let's try to insert another "out" punch:</p><pre><code>insert into time_punch (employee_id, is_out_punch, punch_time)
values
(1, true, '2020-01-01 13:00:00');</code></pre><pre><code>Output:
INSERT 0 0</code></pre><p>We can see from the output that the trigger prevented the insertion of two subsequent out punches for the same employee.</p><p>It is also possible to raise an exception from the trigger so that your application (or person running the SQL query) receives a failure notice instead of the insert count simply being 0.</p><h2 id="postgres-trigger-example-2-creating-an-audit-table">Postgres Trigger Example #2: Creating an Audit Table</h2><p>Accurately storing employee punch data is critical for businesses.

<p>I recently mass refactored our production codebase at work. And I did so without the fear of breaking things. It was a full-stack refactor, and I did changes to our apps, test code and DevOps code. After finishing the mass refactor, I did zero manual testing. So, how did I do this? With the help of automated testing like this, of course:</p>

<h2 id="what-did-i-do">What Did I Do?</h2>
<p>I have refactored our large production codebase over the span of four months. I did this refactor module by module and product by product. I have probably touched our entire tech stack during this (hence the importance of being a full-stack engineer!). I made changes to our clients (mobile and desktop) in their UI and core code. I adapted our tests code to the changes that I’ve done to the product. I have also changed our DevOps code extensively, to accommodate the changes I’ve done to the product and test code. Following animation is from my method chaining article, which was partly inspired by the changes that I did to our test framework. If you want to check out the full article, it is in the resources section above.</p>

<video width="790" height="300" controls=""><source src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/media/method_chaining.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>Changes were mostly technical (i.e. swap one JSON library with another, adapt the code to new UI libs, use method chaining in test code etc.) so correctness of the changes from product management perspective was not entirely relevant. However, verifying that functionality remained the same, and everything continued to work in production as-is was #1 priority. Further code level changes that I’ve done is not the point of this article so I won’t dig deeper. I did most of my refactors using IntelliJ IDEA, which supports all the programming languages we use and has enormous refactoring capabilities. We also have a ton of static code analyzers, linters, and code reformatters built into our continuous-integration process, which was also very helpful in detecting defects at code level early on. Finally, our code peer-review process using pull-requests has the most important code quality assurance factor.</p>

<p>After I was done with the refactors, I made zero manual testing on our products. Neither did I have any fear of breaking things during this mass refactor. And oh boy, did break things! So why was I not fearful of breaking things? Because I knew that I could identify and fix what I broke during the refactoring process. I will talk more about our quality assurance tech in a moment.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-our-product">What is Our Product?</h2>
<p>Our product is a large enterprise VPN software. It has been under development by a large team for the last 5+ years, so it has a considerably complex codebase. It has key hardware integrations, so reliability is quite important. When you integrate software and hardware features, you get a large surface area for bugs. Testing the hardware integrations is incredibly daunting since you need to get the hardware in test to the right state to test things correctly every time. In addition, we have clients for all major desktop and mobile OSes, and a vast DevOps infrastructure to automate the assembly of these clients. I want to leave a bit of mystery here, as I will write a separate article on what I do in my day-to-day work.</p>

<h2 id="why-was-i-so-confident">Why Was I So Confident?</h2>
<p>As a senior engineer, it is my duty to initiate and take on riskier projects. When done right, a large refactor and a refresh of the codebase can make working with the products a joy again. While initiating this mass refactor project, I was fully confident that I would not end up destroying our products, as I knew that a considerable number of automated end-to-end tests that I implemented over long years got my back. Also, I have recently created a mobile device farm, extending our end-to-end testing coverage to mobile devices. As you can see in the following photo, I have Android devices on the left and iOS devices on the right, and a MacBook as the host. All the connected devices are controller by the host machine:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/device_farm.jpg" alt="My Device Farm Implementation"></p>

<p>Mass end-to-end testing like this, also known as acceptance testing, makes mass refactoring a less worrisome task. However, you still have to trigger tests every time you complete a part of your refactor and make sure to fix any broken tests or features. Depending on the test suite size and availability of automation hardware, this might take days. Of course, to verify the full correctness of my refactors, I had the run the entire test suite, and not just the end-to-end tests. Our unit and integration test coverage is also solid and they run on our CI servers as a part of our build process. Especially having integration tests that verify our software design decisions were invaluable, including our API endpoints and other 3rd party software integrations. Especially when dealing with our software’s modules written in scripting languages (JavaScript, Python, etc.), our unit tests came in quite handy. I depend on those unit tests to verify that I broke none of the expected input/output types, as the compiler cannot do it for me in a dynamic programming languages</p>

<p>Before going into device farms, let me briefly mention automated testing.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-automated-testing">What is Automated Testing?</h2>
<p>In summary, automated testing has three main parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Unit testing. Unit testing tests the smallest sections of your code, which is mostly going to be your functions. You can even have multiple tests per function based on the behavior of your functions. And there are some great frameworks for it like NUnit, JUnit, Mocha, etc. which will help you organize your tests better.</li>
  <li>Integration testing. As the name suggests, integration testing tests the integration of your software components. For instance, one integration test can test the integration of multiple functions, classes, or even modules. You can use the same unit testing frameworks that I mentioned above for integration testing too.</li>
  <li>End-to-end (acceptance) testing. This is the endgame. End-to-end testing is where you test your product just like an end-user would do. You simulate real user interactions with your product using end-to-end testing frameworks like Selenium, Appium, etc. More on this in the next section.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have a complete video on software quality assurance where I describe how software companies test their products, starting with unit tests and going all the way to end-to-end (acceptance) testing level. If you want to see it, link to it is in the resources section above.</p>

<h2 id="device-farms-and-test-labs">Device Farms and Test Labs</h2>
<p>Now comes the fun part. This is where you get to play with your products on real devices. Of course, you don’t want to play with the devices indefinitely; you want to automate that process. For my device farm implementation for our products, I used Appium, which uses Selenium’s WebDriver protocol for all clients. Appium can control both web apps and native apps. It can even control hybrid web UI + native core apps (i.e. Electron apps). A single Appium server instance running in a host machine can control all the connected devices, and the apps and browsers installed on those devices:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/appium_architecture_diagram.png" alt="Appium Architecture Diagram"></p>

<p>In my implementation, I connected all our mobile devices to a single host machine via a USB hub, and the host machine is controller by Appium:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/device_farm_usb_hub.jpg" alt="Device Farm With USB Hub"></p>

<p>Now let’s watch my device farm implementation in live-action in our office:</p>

<video width="790" height="300" controls=""><source src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/media/device_farm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>As you can see, I have both Android and iOS devices connected to a single MacBook. Everything except for one power-hungry tablet is going through the USB hub. It is a little messy, but it has been working great. When someone triggers an automated test run, one of the devices is selected at random for the given platform. Then the entire test suit runs on that device, and the test results are collected. There is quite a bit of room for improvement, but this, along with our similar setup for desktop clients, enabled me to make extensive changes to our sensitive production codebase with confidence.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that automated testing on real devices is substantially better than manual testing in the long run. You will save a ton of time via automation like this, and you can keep expending your testing coverage for your optimum quality assurance needs. You really don’t need to take the route that I took and implement all these yourself. You can utilize ready-to-use device farms provided by Google Firebase Test Lab, Amazon Device Farm, etc.:</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/how-i-mass-refactored-our-production-codebase-without-fear/media/firebase_test_lab.png" alt="Firebase Test Lab"></p>

<p>However, if you choose to implement your own device farm, remember that a lot of the publicly available device farms were born from internal implementations as I did. So you can always provide parts of your infrastructure as a service if you ever decide to go IaaS/SaaS route.</p>

<p>As a bonus in my implementation, people can RDP into the main test machine and control the phones remotely for manual testing when needed. Also, there are …</p></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>This project is a favorite of mine and so I wanted to share a glimpse of what we've been up to with <a href="https://openai.com/" rel="noopener">OpenAI's amazing GPT-3 language model</a>. Today I'll be sharing a couple of straightforward results with basic prompts only. There are more advanced avenues we're exploring for our use of GPT-3, such as fine-tuning (custom pre-training for specific datasets); you'll hear none of that today, but if you're interested in this topic, follow this blog for updates.</p>
<!--more-->

<h2>Our goal</h2>
<p>I believe the future of monitoring has to include autonomous root cause tools. Deployment frequency and complexity make the "new" issue the driver of Mean-Time-To-Resolve (MTTR) today. You may always know when something breaks, but you won't always know what. Problem is, root cause often hides in log files... but since the volume of logs has grown enormous and it's not always clear what to search for when a new issue arises, we saw a need for a smarter tool to help with root cause.</p>

<h2>Our approach in a nutshell</h2>
<p>If you structure logs really well (we do this with machine learning), including free-text logs, even when there are only one or two examples for a given event type, you can start talking confidently about a "rare" event. Severity lets you talk about a "bad" event. So, you can imagine one log stream expressing a "rare" event, and then another log stream expressing an event that is both "rare" and "bad". A simple point process model lets us talk naively about how likely it is that such a pair of events should show up as close together in time or closer, given patterns of "rare" and "rare"+"bad" events in those two streams. Watching the data for a while will let you estimate parameters for this model, and you can start picking out bouts of such event pairs. Zebrium takes such a bout, and generates an incident report from it. The results we are seeing…</p>

<h2>The plain language challenge</h2>
<p>Our approach works really well at generating root cause reports: if there's a root cause indicator in the logs, it will almost always make its way into a concise root cause report. Our approach has proven robust to different kinds of applications and logs; it requires no training or rules, pre-built or otherwise.</p>

<p>However, there's a big challenge remaining here. The last mile of delivering the benefits of autonomous Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is translating even the concise reports we generate into something the user can understand. The user who needs the quick RCA is not always the person who can understand the oblique root cause indicators in a technical log file. Who is to consume these reports, and what composes them?</p>

<p>This challenge is even more stark for an Managed Service Provider (MSP) or enterprise. At a small company, engineers may be responsible for front-line triage. At a large company or MSP, there will be a front-line, typically junior person who needs a quick RCA; they can't be expected to know all the different intricacies of application logs and what those logs mean. To bring value over the last mile to them, we need plain-language.</p>

<h2>Enter GPT-3</h2>
<p>Now that I've set the stage, let me show you a couple of examples that I think make it clear how transformational GPT-3 can be in the context of our problem. I think you'll agree with me that autonomous RCA seems a lot more real when it's translated into plain-language, and surely a lot more accessible by a lot of users.</p>

<p>GPT-3 is a state-of-the-art bidirectional autoregressive transformer model, with parameters in the hundreds of billions. It is produced, trained, and maintained by OpenAI, and it has really brought start-of-the art, deep NLP to developers’ fingertips.</p>

<p>The most basic procedure for using GPT-3 looks like this -</p>

<p>1) Construct a “prompt” for the model – this is a sort of open-ended document that leaves the model to “continue the story”, as it were; the continuation or response is called a “completion”. For the below two-line examples, I used the following simple prompt construction:</p>

<p>An expert examined the logs for the incident.</p>
<p>The first log message was: &lt;first_line_goes_here&gt;</p>
<p>The last log message was: &lt;second_line_goes_here&gt;</p>
<p>The expert described what had happened, in plain English:</p>

<p>2) Select model (I used davinci) and parameters - for the below examples, I used the following parameters to the davinci GPT-3 model:</p>

<p>{</p>
<p>"max_tokens": 128,</p>
<p>"temperature": 1,</p>
<p>"top_p": 0.05,</p>
<p>"presence_penalty": 0.3,</p>
<p>"frequency_penalty": 0.3,</p>
<p>"best_of": 10</p>
<p>}</p>

<p>3) Call the API; post-process completion for dangling or repeated phrases, to-taste. Serve warm.</p>

<h2>Example one: Database shutdown</h2>
<p>We shut down the Postgres database backing our Atlassian stack. Thousands of events, largely errors, ensued in the logs. Zebrium dutifully generates a root cause report, based on an ML-driven auto-detection. The report looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png" alt="postgres incident" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=520&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1559&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=2078&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=2598&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=3117&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>As you can see, Zebrium pulled about a dozen log events into the report; the first 9 are shown in the image. You’ll notice that the first event is colored green and the last event purple; these are the “FIRST” and the “WORST”, and we use these to characterize the incident in the incidents list. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png" alt="postgres incident summary" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=520&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1559&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=2078&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=2598&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=3117&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>OK, so Zebrium did a pretty good job here. It autonomously picked these two log events out of thousands to display to the user on the list page. Often, the “FIRST” event reflects root cause and the “WORST” reflects follow-on problems; you’ll note here that the first is not even an error, but it’s rare, and happens too close to other incident events, according to our model, to be a coincidence.</p>

<p>Now in this case, it’s pretty clear to someone who has looked at a log file before that the database was shut down by the administrator. You’ll also notice, though, above the log events, a field called “DESCRIPTION”: this was generated by GPT-3. It says:</p>

<p>“The database server was stopped by the administrator.”</p>

<h2>Why this summary is also amazing</h2>
<p>We passed in the “FIRST” and “WORST” events, as described above, to GPT-3. Notice that the first line says that the “PostgreSQL RDBMS” was “Stopped”. The second line says that there was a “PSQLException” indicating that a connection was “terminating due to administrator command”.</p>

<p>The word “administrator” appears on a different line than the word “PostgreSQL”, and nowhere in the log messages are the words “database” or “server” to be found at all.</p>

<p>The algorithm is doing the following:</p>

<p>1.) Inferring that the statements on the two lines are related</p>
<p>2.) Inferring that they are both speaking about a “database server”</p>
<p>3.) Putting the two statements together: “stopped by the administrator”</p>

<p>Essentially, this is the sort of summary someone would put into a ticketing system; here, it’s being done automatically, thanks to an appropriately selected pair of log messages coupled with a language model.</p>

<h2><span>Example two: Out of memory</span><span></span></h2>
<p>In this case, and using the same parameters as were used in the previous example, we take a root cause report for what turns out to be an out-of-memory issue to GPT-3 and see what sort of summary it gives us.</p>

<p>This particular report was generated in response to a signal from a monitoring tool that saw endpoint latencies spike too high. The system was configured with Zebrium to provide root cause observability across the stack. Here is the report Zebrium ML generated:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=oom_incident.png" alt="oom_incident" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=520&amp;name=oom_incident.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=oom_incident.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1559&amp;name=oom_incident.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=2078&amp;name=oom_incident.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=2598&amp;name=oom_incident.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=3117&amp;name=oom_incident.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>As you can see, Zebrium pulled about a dozen log events into the report; the first 9 are shown in the image. You’ll notice that the first event is colored green and the last event purple; these are the “FIRST” and the “WORST”, and we use these to characterize the incident in the incidents list. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=908&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png" alt="oom_incident_summary" width="908" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=454&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 454w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=908&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 908w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=1362&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 1362w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=1816&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 1816w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=2270&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 2270w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=2724&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 2724w" sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px"></p>

<p>In this case, it’s not so clear that the problem is due to an out-of-memory issue, unless the reader is familiar with Linux and the OOM killer facility. There are a lot of technical parameters in these events as well, obscuring what was really at the heart of the problem.</p>

<p>Taking a look above the log messages again, in the “DESCRIPTION” field, let’s see what GPT-3 gave us:</p>

<p>“The memcached process was killed by the OOM killer</p>
<p>because it was consuming too much memory. The OOM killer</p>
<p>is a Linux kernel feature that allows the system to kill</p>
<p>a process when <strong><u>the system is running out of memory</u></strong>.”</p>

<h2>Why this summary is also amazing</h2>
<p>What this summary tells us explicitly in plain-language is that the system was running out of memory. This is in fact the root cause of the original incident, tallying up a successful root cause summary.</p>

<p>For an L1 or L2, the Zebrium root cause summary may not be enough. That person won’t necessarily know that OOM means out-of-memory, or that the “FIRST” message isn’t talking about an application issue entirely within memcached.</p>

<h2>What more I wanted here</h2>
<p>In the second example, I would have liked to have seen some recognition that the first line implies that the system was out-of-memory, and therefore the second line was due to related problems (in fact, the application server was paged out). It’s a lot to ask, but I think it might be possible, given some combination of more expressive prompts, finetuning, and presenting GPT-3 with other select data from the report (in this case, the report also included metrics anomalies showing a plunge in swap free).</p>

<h2><span>A cool direction</span></h2>
<p>You may have noticed that GPT-3 gave us a lot of extra detail about the Linux OOM killer than was mentioned in the log messages themselves. I believe it was able to provide this context in the same way it knew that PSQL referred to a database server: it was trained on the internet. There is likely enough information in the public domain that, as GPT-3 was being trained, it picked up enough cursory knowledge of these sorts of systems to add additional value.</p>

<p>To test my hypothesis, I spent some time fiddling quite unscientifically with the prompt and model parameters, trying to get it to expound on the OOM example as describe above. I also gave the model a much larger budget of response tokens. Eventually, I teased out this response:</p>

<p>The root cause of the …</p></span></p></div></div>

<p>ExaGear is a dynamic binary translation layer to run x86_32 and x86_64 applications on Arm 64-bit Linux systems.</p>



<p>You can download it <a href="https://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/kunpeng/archive/ExaGear/ExaGear_V100R002C00.tar.gz">here</a>. On an RPM-based distribution, just unpack the archive and install.</p>



<p>A CentOS 7 rootfs is shipped, you might want to install vte-profile afterwards.</p>



<h4>Hardware requirements</h4>



<p>A 64-bit Arm CPU with floating point and SIMD extensions. If it can run a conventional Linux distribution, it’ll be able to run this.</p>



<h4>Kernel requirements</h4>



<p>You’ll have to install the p64k variant for systems with a 64KB page size set up (which ships with the x86_64 -&gt; arm64 translator only, not the x86_32 to arm64 one). Some applications might not work on such a system.</p>



<p>You’ll also need a kernel with 48-bit VA space, 39-bit of VA space kernel configurations are not compatible with ExaGear.</p>



<h4>Memory model</h4>



<p>ExaGear does not follow TSO completely by default, using heuristics instead. This can be configured through /etc/exagear-x86_64.conf.</p>



<p>SMO_MODE=fbase is the default, with SMO_SEVERITY=smart. For full compliance, you can run those commands:</p>



<pre><code>sudo sed -i -e '/EXAGEAR_SMO_MODE="/s/fbase"/all"/' /etc/exagear-x86_32.conf
sudo sed -i -e '/EXAGEAR_SMO_MODE="/s/fbase"/all"/' /etc/exagear-x86_64.conf</code></pre>



<p>On Tegra K1 64-bit and Tegra Xavier, you’ll want to set SMO_MODE=none, as their CPU implements sequential consistency as the memory model. This setting provides a free performance boost with no downsides on that hardware.</p>



<h4>Performance</h4>



<p>For running your Docker containers or whatever on an Apple Silicon Mac too, this is a much faster solution than qemu-user.</p>



<p>Some performance numbers on Tegra Xavier: <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/4206324?baseline=4206183">https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/4206324?baseline=4206183</a>. (Geekbench arm64 Android compared to x86_64 Linux Geekbench results on the same hardware)</p>



<p>Because ExaGear doesn’t implement the AES instructions, the scores for those is an outlier. Apart from that case, the results are pretty good.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Data has gone from being a sparse resource to a commodity. Many companies try to collect as much data as possible, leading to questions about the best way to keep data.</p><p><strong>Data warehouses allow companies to keep their data in one, unified place. Data warehouses are capable of storing large amounts of data at an affordable rate.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Data warehousing has become an increasingly common tool in digital companies. But we already have databases capable of storing large amounts of data. So why are data warehouses such a big deal?&nbsp;</p><h3>The problem with datasets<br></h3><p>Before data warehouses became popular, datasets were stored in separate places. Some datasets were incompatible with other datasets and couldn’t be used for the same analysis. In other cases, datasets were owned by third-party providers, who offered only limited interaction with the data.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Why did this happen? Data originates from different places. For example, you may keep a database with all the information related to your product such as account credentials, profile information, product information, etc. But you also have a database for keeping track of the interaction users have with your product. On top of that, you could be gathering information on business-related topics such as financials, emails with leads, marketing clicks, and so on. At the moment of creation, one database seems to have no relation to another database.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Eventually, companies started to notice that interacting with each dataset individually was too clunky. Companies wanted the ability to maintain this information in one, unified place. This is exactly what data warehouses were created to do. When all your data is in one place and in the same format, you may synthesize data from various levels of organization and conduct a holistic analysis. Data warehouses have fundamentally changed the way companies gather and analyze data.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>How to leverage data warehouses?</h3><p>Once you have a data warehouse, there are two main avenues for analysis:</p><ul role="list"><li>Business Intelligence tools &amp; SQL queries</li><li>Automated Analytics &amp; Business Analysis tools</li></ul><p>‍</p><h4>Business Intelligence &amp; SQL queries</h4><p>In order to answer specific business questions with a data warehouse, you need to know SQL. SQL gives you the flexibility of querying the data in virtually any way but with the drawback of requiring coding skills.&nbsp;</p><p>Most popular Business Intelligence tools are <a href="https://chartio.com/">Chartio</a>, <a href="https://mode.com/">Mode</a>, <a href="https://looker.com/">Looker</a>, <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a>, <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/">Google Data Studio</a>. At Lantern, we particularly like new players such as <a href="https://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a> and <a href="https://popsql.com/">PopSQL</a>.<br></p><p>In order to let non-technical roles gain insight from data, companies traditionally rely on data analysts. However, as more and more roles need frequent access to company data, data analysts have become a bottleneck.</p><h4>Automated Analysis tools<br></h4><p>This increasing reliance on data insights by non-technical roles has created a space for a new breed of products: automated data analysis tools. <a href="https://www.lantern.so/">Lantern</a> is a part of this group. Data warehouses offer easy and structured access to all the data of the company, which is a perfect setup for automated tools to offer simple answers on specific topics.<br></p><p>Automated tools do not require SQL or a data analyst to answer your questions. This combination returns control to both technical or non-technical data consumers alike.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The category of automated analysis tools is relatively new and has been well-received by companies. Besides Lantern, which focuses on serving startup product teams, other automated analysis tools target various teams in larger enterprises such as <a href="https://www.anodot.com/">Anodot</a>, <a href="https://sisudata.com/">Sisu</a>, and <a href="https://outlier.ai/">Outlier</a>.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Warehouses have transformed the way modern companies use data. You can now afford to track all your data in the same place. This unlocks a whole new level of analysis, allowing you to put data together from various points or perform a more holistic analysis.<br></p><p>A key win enabled by data warehouses has been the emergence of a new breed: automated analysis tools, which pro-actively send you insights about changes in your data.<br></p><p>If you are interested in giving a try to such an automated analysis tool for user behavior and product usage, you can access Lantern's early access program <a href="https://www.lantern.so/">here</a>.<br></p></div></div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to our newsletter</p><div><div><p>Thank you!

The woman then punches her mother in the face, leaving her bloodied.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The woman who threw the punch identified herself online as Ashanti. On GoFundMe, she said she was fired from her job and is facing criminal charges for defending herself from a group of Trump supporters who she says hurled racial slurs at her, and tried to steal her phone, keys and mask.</p>  <p>"I think the woman thought she was in danger, rightfully so, and reacted accordingly," Duke said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The online fundraiser garnered more than $75,000 US in donations as of Monday evening.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Duke identified her mother as Therese Duke, who, according to LinkedIn, was an employee at UMass Memorial Health Care in Worcester, Mass.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The health-care provider has since <a href="https://twitter.com/umassmemorial/status/1347664055121686528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1347664055121686528%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.boston.com%2Fnews%2Flocal-news-2%2F2021%2F01%2F10%2Ftherese-duke-umass-memorial-capitol-siege"><u>issued a statement on Twitter</u></a>, which reads: "Over the past 24 hours we have received numerous expressions of concern through social media regarding a UMass Memorial caregiver who may have been involved in this week's violent events at the nation's capitol. The employee in question is no longer a part of our organization."</p>  <p>Duke confirmed that her mother lost her job, "because she does work at a hospital and she obviously went to a protest with many people and she wasn't wearing a mask."</p>  <p><em>As It Happens </em>was unable to reach Therese Duke for comment, and she hasn't spoken publicly since her daughter identified her.</p>  <p><span><blockquote lang="en"><p>Hi this is the liberal lesbian of the family who has been kicked out multiple times for her views and for going to BLM protests to care what happens to me so: &lt;br&gt;Mom: Therese Duke&lt;br&gt;Uncle: Richard Lorenz&lt;br&gt;Aunt: Annie Lorenz &lt;a href="https://t.co/cuBAPJ3GJA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cuBAPJ3GJA&lt;/a&gt;</p>&amp;mdash;<a href="https://twitter.com/duke_helena/status/1347267376488853508">@duke_helena</a></blockquote></span></p>  <p>Duke says her family has been torn apart during Donald Trump's presidency as she watched her mom become increasingly radicalized by right-wing rhetoric and online conspiracy theories.</p>  <p>The people who protested in D.C. last week, as well as those who later stormed the Capitol, believe Trump's unfounded claims that he actually beat Joe Biden in the U.S. presidential election. It's not clear whether Duke's family members were at Capitol Hill the day of the siege.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"She actually has been a Democrat her whole life up until the Trump presidency. And it was unsettling seeing how quickly she had changed to a radically right ideology," Duke said.</p>  <p>"The things that she was saying really didn't make sense. A lot of them were conspiracy theories, almost a delusional kind of mindset. And I think it was just her belief system entirely was focused around what President Trump was saying."</p>  <p>She and her mother came to an impasse, she says, after the police killing of George Floyd in June 2020.</p>  <p>"When I had told her I would be going to Black Lives Matter protests … she told me that I wasn't allowed to go because she believed that Black Lives Matter was a violent organization and they were going to incite violence and that I would have been in harm's way," she said.</p>  <p>"I ended up going anyway.

January 12, 2021 | https://summitroute.com/blog/2021/01/12/2021_aws_security_maturity_roadmap_2021/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://summitroute.com/blog/2021/01/12/2021_aws_security_maturity_roadmap_2021/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>This is the third annual release of my “<a href="https://summitroute.com/downloads/aws_security_maturity_roadmap-Summit_Route.pdf">AWS Security Maturity Roadmap</a>” to give companies a series or actionable steps to improve the security of their AWS environments. Each year I update this with the latest features of AWS, along with improvements based on my discussions with clients, other consultants, and more who have gone through some of these activities or encountered challenges, or have mentioned new ideas.  This includes companies of all sizes, risk tolerances, and integration (from lift and shift to completely serverless).</p>

<p>Changes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added that your root email addresses should be under your company domain and on email distribution lists as I’ve found many accounts during assessments that were associated with old aol.com emails and other personal accounts. This is how AWS communicates with you and is an important part of account recovery.</li>
  <li>Added <a href="https://summitroute.com/blog/2021/01/06/opting_out_of_aws_ai_data_usage/">opting out</a> of the AI services from sending your data outside of the regions you put it in.</li>
  <li>Added budget alarms to Stage 1. Although less likely to provide as much value for larger enterprises, these are very important for individuals and small businesses. Also mentioned <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cost-management/preview-anomaly-detection-and-alerting-now-available-in-aws-cost-management/">Cost Anomaly Detection</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cost-management/get-started-with-aws-budgets-actions/">Budget Actions</a>.</li>
  <li>Mentioned that you should consider using GuardDuty’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/identify-unintended-resource-access-with-aws-identity-and-access-management-iam-access-analyzer/">S3 monitoring</a>, which for monitoring, is as an alternative to Macie.</li>
  <li>Mentioned the use of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-use-aws-cloudformation-stacksets-for-multiple-accounts-in-an-aws-organization/">CloudFormation StackSets with Organizations</a> which is an Organization feature that deploys a CloudFormation StackSet whenever a new account is created to ensure it is initialized with your baseline.</li>
  <li>Discussed using a ticketing system for alerts, as I’ve found the ways in which companies receive alerts to vary in maturity which impacts their ability to properly monitor and respond to incidents.</li>
  <li>Discussed turning on more log sources, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/log-your-vpc-dns-queries-with-route-53-resolver-query-logs/">VPC DNS queries</a>, VPC Flow Logs, S3 access logs, etc. and linked to a post by <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewdfuller">Matt Fuller</a> for a list of log sources on AWS: <a href="https://matthewdf10.medium.com/how-to-enable-logging-on-every-aws-service-in-existence-circa-2021-5b9105b87c9">How to Enable Logging on Every AWS Service in Existence (Circa 2021)</a>.</li>
  <li>Mentioned that IAM user access keys, when required, should ideally be put in a single account and assume roles into other accounts as it makes detection of compromise easier.</li>
  <li>Mentioned that Access Advisor now shows the use of s3:ListAllMyBuckets, so you should use that to remove that specific privilege when not needed.</li>
  <li>Discussed the need to plan how accounts will be connected, as the security boundaries of separate accounts can become blurred due to trust relationships of resource policies, network connections, and other mechanisms.</li>
  <li>Expanded on the discussion of using SCPs to mention how exceptions can be made for specific roles, and SCPs can vary between accounts. Therefore, you can initialize an account by configuring it’s network configuration in advance and restricting changes via SCPs, such that a dev account may be restricted from making any resources public. Also listed possible SCPs to deploy, which are described in my post <a href="https://summitroute.com/blog/2020/03/25/aws_scp_best_practices/">AWS SCP Best Practices</a>.</li>
  <li>Mentioned <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/accelerate-infrastructure-as-code-development-with-open-source-former2/">former2</a> for helping transition to IaC (Infrastructure as Code).</li>
  <li>Mentioned that IaC scanning tools can be used, referencing <a href="https://twitter.com/christophetd">Christophe’s</a> post <a href="https://blog.christophetd.fr/shifting-cloud-security-left-scanning-infrastructure-as-code-for-security-issues/">Shifting Cloud Security Left — Scanning Infrastructure as Code for Security Issues</a>.</li>
  <li>Removed mention of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-use-tag-policies-to-manage-tags-across-multiple-aws-accounts/">Tag Policies</a> as this service is limited in various ways that make it not worth bothering with.</li>
  <li>Merged “Stage 8: Enhance detection” and “Stage 9: Auto-remediation and privilege refinement” into one stage. Mostly because I wanted this to be 10 stages. :)</li>
  <li>Mentioned Client Side Monitoring as part of the least privilege improvements, and linked to the cloudonaut article <a href="https://cloudonaut.io/record-aws-api-calls-to-improve-iam-policies/">Record AWS API calls to improve IAM Policies</a>.</li>
  <li>Mentioned the AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/">Network Firewall</a> as a solution for monitoring and protecting your networks.</li>
  <li>Mentioned the use of microservices to access resources instead of direct access so that better monitoring, restrictions, and rate limiting can be performed.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Building a startup is like climbing a mountain. Except this mountain has no trails, so you can only use your best guess to reach the summit. Every startup will have a different set of peaks to climb, but planning and strategizing are important to reaching the top, no matter the specific goal.</span></p>

<p><span>In planning your 2021 goals, start by answering three questions:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Where do you want to be in 12 months?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>What are the metric(s) of success?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>How do you get there?&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>To get the most value out of goal setting for your startup, be flexible, measure along the way, and check in on your progress at clear intervals.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>Create Anti-Goals</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.biznews.com/thought-leaders/1986/06/13/charlie-mungers-speech-to-the-harvard-school-june-1986" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>“Invert. Always Invert” - Charlie Munger</span></a></p>
<p><span>Startups face a hazy, treacherous path from the start. Most of the time, it can feel like we are struggling to see only a few days or weeks ahead, let alone 12 months. Because early-stage companies cannot be sure of what the coming months will look like, it can sometimes be more practical to approach goal setting by developing anti-goals.</span></p>
<p><span>By inverting the problem of long-term goal setting, your team will mark out where they </span><b><i>don’t</i></b><span> want to be and work backwards.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Some anti-goals may include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Not having a product in the market by EOY</span></li>
<li><span>Not having closed any sales</span></li>
<li><span>Having fewer customers than you have today</span></li>

<li><span>Losing a key employee(s)</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Mark out clear initiatives that prevent you from ending up where you don’t want to be. It could be something like setting as many prospecting calls as possible over the first few weeks of the year. Or, maybe it's breaking down all the product features needed to get you to an MVP and entering them into your project management software. Or perhaps it's having thoughtful 1-1s each week with your key reports and getting it on the calendar today.</span></p>
<p><span>With a sense of what needs to be done, next establish a cadence and system to keep you in check.</span></p>

<p><b>1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 quarter, 1 year.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Using time segments to establish goals forces you to be realistic. Annual revenue goals follow from quarterly revenue goals, which in turn follow from monthly prospect appointment goals. If you have a plan to increase your revenue by $2,000,000, set a quarterly revenue goal of $500,000. To achieve that quarterly goal, back into how many sales meetings will need to be set per month. Using these time-based stair-steps, create secondary checkpoint goals to evaluate success along the way to your annual goals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Melanie Perkins, CEO and co-founder of Canva, has a </span><a href="https://www.33voices.com/posts/how-to-set-and-achieve-your-startup-goals" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>weekly goal setting meeting with her leadership team</span></a><span>. This helps set targets for the current week based on the goals for the&nbsp; quarter or year. Using this idea, schedule a weekly meeting with stakeholders to course correct from the previous week. Similarly, schedule a monthly review meeting to zoom out and ensure you are on target.</span></p>

<p><b>Use a Compass.</b></p>
<p><span>Travel certain trails in the Adirondacks, and you will notice colored markers nailed to trees every 200 feet. These markers help you correct course as you hike. To have the same for your startup, l</span><span>ay out the markers to success before you begin your journey.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To ensure success on our journey, first formalize what KPIs are tracked to evaluate success and then set recurring monthly (or weekly) meetings to review with the broader team. If you're still determining which KPIs might be right, look through some of the </span><a href="https://www.notion.so/Startup-KPIs-to-Track-bd38b695c93b444ebc1e819143c543ec" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>examples we put together.</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At each meeting, evaluate and adjust your path. If you set a goal of 40 customer development meetings this month and blew past it, maybe it’s time to revise your year end goals upward.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>As you work towards your annual goals throughout the coming year, keep in mind that </b><a href="https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><b>the map is not the territory</b></a><span>. Even the best laid plans are merely abstractions of the reality they are intended to represent. Be vigilant in constant re-evaluation of the goals set for yourself and your team. In your meetings, constantly question your assumptions to ensure you don’t look back in 12 months and ask yourself how you missed your goals by so much. Armed with this process to navigate your journey, you will be prepared to start the climb to the peak.&nbsp;</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Data is a valuable currency in the modern digital economy. However, it is still a challenge to keep pace with the rapid changes in enterprise data and the growing demand for information; thereby, providing the raison d’etre for the movement of data from legacy mainframe server-type infrastructures to the cloud to scale data-driven decision-making.</span></p><p><span>Experts agree that cloud-based technologies are integral to ensuring data security, management, process compliance, and privacy across the entire enterprise data spectrum. However, there is one ongoing conundrum or debate, and that is how to process data faster with particular reference to streaming data versus batch data.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Consequently, let’s open this discussion with a brief definition of, and comparison between, streaming data and batch data.</span></p><h2><b>Differences Between Streaming Data and Batch Data</b></h2><h3><span>1. Batch data</span></h3><p><span>Succinctly stated, batch data processing is the processing of large data volumes in batches or groups. This data typically consists of millions of daily records, accumulated and stored in a central location before being processed.</span></p><p><span>In other words, as explained by the</span> <a href="https://www.upsolver.com/blog/etl-process-flow-batch-etl-vs-streaming-etl"><span>Upsolver.com team</span></a><span>, batch processing is the mechanism used by users to “</span><i><span>collect and store data in batches during a batch window. This can save time and improves the efficiency of processing the data and helps organizations and companies in managing large amounts of data and processing it quickly</span></i><span>.”</span></p><p><span>Ergo, it is a highly effective method of processing sequential records collected over time in a non-stop, sequential order.</span></p><h3><span>2. Streaming data</span></h3><p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The counterbalance to batch data is streaming data. It is the mechanism by which data is analyzed almost instantaneously or continuously. This analysis occurs as the data flows through the system with no time limitations on the output. It is highly effective and beneficial if the events that produce this data occur frequently and occur at short intervals.</span></p><p><span>The Upsolver.com article quoted above adds value to the “what is streaming data” discussion by stating the following.</span></p><p><span>“</span><i><span>Streaming allows you to stream events from any source, and it helps you make changes to the data while you’re on the run</span></i><span>.”</span></p><h2><span>The SQL WINDOW function and its advantages over traditional SQL aggregation functions</span></h2><p><span>A</span> <a href="https://learnsql.com/blog/why-should-i-learn-sql-window-functions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>SQL WINDOW function</span></a><span> is an aggregate function that performs a calculation across a set of table rows related to the current row. This is similar to the traditional aggregate function where according to the Microsoft Transact SQL documentation,</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“</span><i><span>An aggregate function performs a calculation on a set of values and returns a single value. Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement</span></i><span>.”</span></p><p><span>However, the SQL WINDOW function takes the basic aggregate function further in that it does not group rows into a single output row. The rows retain their separate identities. It is also worth noting that the WINDOW function and the SQL aggregation function cannot simultaneously be used in the same SQL query.</span></p><p><span>By way of expanding on this definition, let’s look at the difference between the aggregate and WINDOW function, using the following FOREX data on currency exchange rates.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><span>CurrencyPair</span></td><td><span>DateTime</span></td><td><span>Close</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:00:00</span></td><td><span>1.24438</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:01:00</span></td><td><span>1.24454</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:02:00</span></td><td><span>1.24455</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:03:00</span></td><td><span>1.24461</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:04:00</span></td><td><span>1.24487</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:05:00</span></td><td><span>1.2448</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:00:00</span></td><td><span>1.11633</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:01:00</span></td><td><span>1.11617</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:02:00</span></td><td><span>1.11627</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:03:00</span></td><td><span>1.11636</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:04:00</span></td><td><span>1.1163</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:05:00</span></td><td><span>1.1162</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span> This table contains the closing prices for the currency pairs, GBP/USD, and EUR/USD.

Let’s use the same base data as described above and look at the SQL statement and the outcome.</span></p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">SELECT *, AVG(Close) OVER (PARTITION BY CurrencyPair) AS average_closing
FROM CURRENCYTRADE;
</pre><table><tbody><tr><td><span>Currency Pair</span></td><td><span>DateTime</span></td><td><span>Close</span></td><td><span>Average Closing</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:00:00</span></td><td><span>1.24438</span></td><td><span>1.244625</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:01:00</span></td><td><span>1.24454</span></td><td><span>1.244625</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:02:00</span></td><td><span>1.24455</span></td><td><span>1.244625</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:03:00</span></td><td><span>1.24461</span></td><td><span>1.244625</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:04:00</span></td><td><span>1.24487</span></td><td><span>1.244625</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>GBPUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:05:00</span></td><td><span>1.2448</span></td><td><span>1.244625</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:00:00</span></td><td><span>1.11633</span></td><td><span>1.116276</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:01:00</span></td><td><span>1.11617</span></td><td><span>1.116276</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:02:00</span></td><td><span>1.11627</span></td><td><span>1.116276</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:03:00</span></td><td><span>1.11636</span></td><td><span>1.116276</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:04:00</span></td><td><span>1.1163</span></td><td><span>1.116276</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>EURUSD</span></td><td><span>2019-07-23 14:05:00</span></td><td><span>1.1162</span></td><td><span>1.116276</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span>There are considerable advantages to using the WINDOW function over the traditional aggregation function. The SQL code is simpler and easier to maintain, and it is much simpler to assign a value to a current row from a previous or successive row. This is a faster option than creating cursors and subqueries.</span></p><p><span>However, its most important benefit is found in its fundamental difference. Ergo, the primary difference between the aggregation function and the WINDOW function is that the rows in the WINDOW function’s result set are not collapsed. This construct is beneficial as information because it displays both the aggregated information and the single rows simultaneously.</span></p><h2><span>Breaking the traditional mold: The SQL WINDOW function in stream analytics</span></h2><p><span>The SQL WINDOW function has been adopted by data streaming experts to provide similar information. It is very useful for streaming data analytics.</span></p><p><span>Nonetheless, the principle is more complicated. Let’s look at a step-by-step guide to creating and implementing this function on streamed data.</span></p><p><span>Note: Data stream-driven architecture produces individual records known as events. Users can subscribe to the events in a particular service and will receive the analytical information as soon as it is available. And, because every service has near-real-time access to the data streamed events, they do not have to wait for ETL processes to finish.</span></p><p><span>Because streams are by definition unbounded, creating aggregated views is challenging without introducing boundaries.</span></p><p><span>Enter windowing: a mechanism to group the streamed events based on common event attributes. As an aside, the most common characteristic used to group events into windows is time. Also, a single event might be assigned to multiple windows. For instance, the output of event counts based on overlapping windows will differ from the output of event counts based on distinct windows.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;There are four different, commonly used</span> <a href="https://dev.to/frosnerd/window-functions-in-stream-analytics-1m6c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>window functions</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><span>1. The Tumbling Window</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span>Each tumbling window has a fixed length and is placed consequently in a row on a time axis. Tumbling windows do not overlay each other. In other words, each event is only assigned to one window, and each window fits on the time axis one after the other.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Tumbling windows are designed using one attribute: time. Consequently, each window only contains a single event, providing a robust use case for simple reporting. For instance, tumbling windows produce useful results when asked to aggregate all the number of website clicks, based on the visitor’s country of origin, and grouped in a 20-second tumbling window.</span></p><p><span>The SQL code is as follows.</span></p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">SELECT Country, Count (*) AS VisitorCount
FROM ClickStream TIMESTAMP BY CreatedAt
GROUP BY Country, TumblingWindow(second, 20);
</pre><h3><span>2. The Hopping Window</span></h3><p><span>The hopping window also has a fixed length. However, it has two configuration parameters (the time s and the hop size h) instead of just one (s) as with the tumbling window. Thus, instead of moving the window forward by s, it is driven forward by h.</span></p><p><span>Actually, tumbling windows are a form of hopping windows where s = h. And the challenge is that if s &gt; h (overlapping windows) and if s &lt; h, some events might not be assigned to a window. This is a point to take note of when implementing the hopping window construct. The most common use case for hopping windows is to calculate moving averages.</span></p><p><span>Let’s reuse the example cited in the tumbling window; except, we want to see the moving average of the number of website clicks, based on the visitor’s country of origin, grouped in a 20-second window hopping 2 seconds.</span></p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">SELECT Country, AVG (*) AS Average_Clicks
FROM ClickStream TIMESTAMP BY CreatedAt
GROUP BY Country, HoppingWindow(second, 20, 2);
</pre><h3><span>3. The Sliding Window</span></h3><p><span>Sliding windows are hopping windows, where h 0. In other words, this window does not hop by a time interval; it slides along. It moves along the time axis as the tumbling window does, but it groups together events within the window length s. In other words, the input stream is discrete, but the subsequent, aggregated stream is not. Because the data points are discrete, it is possible to implement a sliding window based on actual events rather than continuous time. The next window is constructed whenever an event enters or exits in the forward-moving sliding window.</span></p><p><span>As with hopping windows, sliding windows are used to compute moving averages. Their uniqueness is that they provide a resolution based on the event time pattern in the data stream. If the event density increases, the moving average will increase. Juxtapositionally, if no new events are entering the sliding window, the moving average stays the same.</span></p><p><span>This SQL statement is similar to the hopping window’s SQL statement.</span></p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">SELECT Country, AVG (*) AS Average_Clicks
FROM ClickStream TIMESTAMP BY CreatedAt
GROUP BY Country, SlidingWindow(second, 20);</pre><h3><span>4. The Session Window</span></h3><p><span>The session window function is the only window that is not a fixed length; it is an ever-changing length. Therefore, when using this function, you must enumerate the maximum time threshold between successive events. This window can be implemented by keeping current events in a buffer and adding new events as long as they are within the session interval. …</span></p></div></div>

        <section>
            <div><p>About 18 months ago <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/faas-containerd-serverless-without-kubernetes/">I started a project</a> which developed directly against containerd. This presented a problem which I'd not really encountered before - <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> on my Mac were no longer enough, I needed a Linux environment.</p>
<p>To begin with I just used an old 2016 model Dell XPS which gave me everyting I needed, but when others started to contribute, they were using Macs and so we had a problem. <a href="https://multipass.run/">Multipass</a> was the answer to our woes and we were pleasantly surprised by it and wondered why more people weren't using it every day.</p>
<p>I want to tell you a bit about our experience in the <a href="http://github.com/openfaas/">OpenFaaS community</a> developing <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a> - a portable FaaS framework, just like OpenFaaS, but without the complexity and overheads of a Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<h2 id="whatscontainerdeverdoneforus">What's containerd ever done for us?</h2>
<p>Some time ago the original version of Docker was actually written in Python, and then morphed over time into a Go re-write. The Go version was seen as monolithic by some consumers, particularly the Kubernetes community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Docker did many things, and at one point clustering and multi-node orchestration was even added to that list (think Docker Swarm and Docker EE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the codebase was refactored two projects emmerged: containerd and runc.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc">runc</a> was a tiny Go binary that had one job: run a container based upon a spec. runc was also the driver for the <a href="https://opencontainers.org/">OCI specification</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd">containerd</a>'s job was to get things ready for runc - such as pulling images and defining specs</li>
</ul>
<p>Docker then remained as a thiner layer on top of both of these tools to bring a user-friendly developer-experience, networking, high-level API and CLI.</p>
<p>Over time containerd has shifted into the lime-light and in Kubernetes 1.20, it will take over duties for running containers in Kubernetes clusters. Now not a lot changes, because containerd was always there along with runc, we just skip a few levels of indirection.</p>
<p>containerd doesn't provide networking out of the box, and that was one of the hardest challenges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not because it's technically complex, but there was a severe lack of documentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/cni">Container Network Initiative (CNI)</a> filled a gap for us and enabled us to build a network between our containers.</p>
<p>When you squint at faasd, you see something that looks a lot like a single-node Kubernetes cluster, using the same projects you'd find on most nodes: containerd, runc and CNI.</p>
<h2 id="whywouldyoudevelopwithcontainerd">Why would you develop with containerd?</h2>
<p>There were two main reasons for creating "faasd" - the first was that we were hearing from users that they didn't want to run an entire Kubernetes cluster just to run a handful of functions, APIS or webpages. The second was that I fancied doing some learning and low-level coding.</p>
<p>Whilst containerd has a socket available, and can be mounted or forwarded, it doesn't work as you would expect. The containerd client tries to run containers on the host it's executing on and just synchronises state with the containerd socket. I found that very confusing, but was reassured that is the way it was designed to work.</p>
<p>You can see our code which has developed into two main services shipped in a single binary.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/cmd/up.go">faasd</a> - starts all the core services for OpenFaaS: the gateway, NATS, Prometheus and our queue worker. <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml">A docker-compose file</a> is used to define versions of images, and the dependency graph for starting up services.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/tree/master/pkg/provider">faasd-provider</a> - a HTTP interface that performs invoke and CRUD for functions and secrets</li>
</ul>
<p>Both are installed with systemd unit files, it was refreshing to lean on the host system for once, instead of using abstractions.</p>
<h3 id="theshortversion">The short-version</h3>
<p><a href="https://multipass.run/">multipass</a> is a <a href="https://canonical.com/">Canonical</a> and its open source components and usage instructions are <a href="https://github.com/canonical/multipass">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multipass is a lightweight VM manager for Linux, Windows and macOS. It's designed for developers who want a fresh Ubuntu environment with a single command.</p>
<p>Since it supports metadata for cloud-init, you can simulate a small cloud deployment on your laptop or workstation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On MacOS it is currently using hyperkit to run VMs, which is another thing we can thank Docker for building. On Windows and Linux it uses different virtualization technology, but has the same simple user-experience which means we get to write one tutorial and to be done with it. As a busy maintainer, I see that as a big win.</p>
<p>Here's how you get a VM launched with the latest version of Ubuntu Server:</p>
<pre><code>multipass launch --name faasd
</code></pre>
<p>Shell into the VM:</p>
<pre><code>multipass exec faasd /bin/bash
</code></pre>
<p>We then realised that multipass supported cloud-init, so morphed our README to the following:</p>
<pre><code>curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openfaas/faasd/master/cloud-config.txt
multipass launch --cloud-init cloud-config.txt  --name faasd
</code></pre>
<p>I had the pleasure of speaking to the engineering manager and PM for multipass on Zoom today and they told me you can even pass the cloud-init file as a URL, so our tutorial becomes even simpler:</p>
<pre><code>multipass launch --cloud-init https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openfaas/faasd/master/cloud-config.txt  --name faasd
</code></pre>
<p>From there, you have a full Linux system with a working version of containerd and Container Network Initiative (CNI) plugins running, and most importantly faasd is up and running.</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli list
faas-cli store deploy figlet
faas-cli invoke figlet &lt;&lt;&lt; "faasd"
</code></pre>
<p>Whilst I've not used it yet, I'm told you can also mount folders from your base system to synchronise your GOPATH. So you could write code using VSCode and have the built-in terminal pane running "multipass exec /bin/bash" or an ssh session.</p>
<p>I recently wrote a post on <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/memory-lane-raspberry-pi-zero/">One last trip down memory lane with the Raspberry Pi Zero</a> where I tried to port faasd to a Raspberry Pi Zero. The Go build for faasd was taking so long that I gave up, opened multipass and cross-compiled it. That whole process was quicker than waiting for the poor little armv6 service to finish its work.</p>
<h3 id="multipassforkubernetes">multipass for Kubernetes</h3>
<p>You can also use multipass to run other workloads, I tried to deploy Kubernetes with microk8s, but ran into some issues with the default limits.</p>
<p>First of all: there was not enough RAM alloacted, then there was not enough disk, finally there were not enough vCPUs. After working all that out I came up with the following:</p>
<pre><code>multipass launch --name microk8s -m 8G -c 2 -d 80G
</code></pre>
<p>Now it's not that much of a surprise that we never ran into that issue, because faasd is designed to be ridicuously lean. It even runs on a Raspberry Pi 3 which only has 1GB of RAM.</p>
<h2 id="wrappingup">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>multipass has been useful for us whenever we need to access a Linux VM from a Mac. It could even be used for running a Kubernetes cluster, but I would usually prefer to deploy Kubernetes in a Docker container using either <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/">KinD</a> or <a href="https://github.com/rancher/k3d">k3d</a> for the sheer speed and efficiency of it.</p>
<p>multipass is a much leaner alternative to tooling like VirtualBox and Vagrant. The team are looking for feedback and are already planning for a way to launch custom images. Think: <code>multipass launch openfaas</code> or <code>multipass launch gitlab</code> for instance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We see multipass being an important part of enabling collaboration with users from all-over the world, whether they use Linux, MacOS or Windows on their desktop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Around 20 people have contributed to faasd directly, and many more indirectly. It worked very well for us and we believe that multipass deserves more attention.</p>
<p>Go and try it out, let them know what works for you and where it can be improved for your workflow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Users have already suggested using <a href="https://github.com/canonical/multipass/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+qemu">qemu on MacOS</a>, and the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization">Virtualization.Framework</a> introduced in Big Sur could also have some impact on the future roadmap and M1 support.</p>

<h3 id="whataboutfaasdvsopenfaasonkubernetes">what about faasd vs. OpenFaaS on Kubernetes?</h3>
<p>faasd now fills a nice gap where Docker Swarm used to live in the OpenFaaS ecosystem. If you're working your way up to production with Kubernetes, or already have experience then you may benefit from a cluster and installing OpenFaaS to it.</p>
<p>If you're wanting to run a few functions, start small, keep costs down, then faasd may be a better fit. Managing and keeping up with Kubernetes versions can be its own challenge. So if you want to deploy code for a customer and barely give it another thought, then package faasd as a VM or cloud-init script and be done with it.</p>
<p>faasd can be run for 5-10 USD on a cloud VPS, or on your Raspberry Pi for free using <a href="https://docs.inlets.dev/">an inlets tunnel</a> to get it a public IP address.</p>

<p>Russia is a large market with incredible potential. This is understood by technology giants (for example, the Russian market is one of the main ones for Apple pay) and small startups from neighbouring countries.</p>



<p>If you want to enter this market and become part of a startup ecosystem, you need to understand its structure. We have collected the most important things to start this acquaintance with.</p>



<p>In 2020, 2.8 million enterprises and 6.7 individual entrepreneurs worked in Russia (a type of entrepreneurial activity in which an individual conducts commercial activity with some restrictions and tax benefits). The entire business generated $2.4 trillion in revenue in 11 months of 2020. </p>



<p>This is one of the highest percentages of entrepreneurial activity in Eastern Europe – 7.9% of the economically active population is in business.</p>



<p>Among 9.5M entrepreneurs, 450K are involved in the startup economy of the country (provide services to startups, work in a startup or plan to launch a startup in the next 6 months). Since the last survey (аugust 2019), the audience has grown by 50K members.</p>



<blockquote><p>The male/female ratio shifted towards the former. The audience of women increased slightly (by 3K), mainly due to the audience of 45+. There are almost 50K more men.</p></blockquote>



<p>The average participant in a startup ecosystem is a 35-44 year old male (23.7%). </p>



<p>More than half of the people involved in the startup ecosystem (52%) are located in Moscow. In second place – St. Petersburg (8%), both of these cities added, after the last report, by one percent.</p>



<p>In your pocket – except for a Samsung phone with a mobile operator MTS or Megafon. Also a Tinkoff or Raiffeisenbank card.</p>



<p>Political views can be said to be moderate (certainly not liberal). They enjoy reading the blog of Sobyanin (the current mayor of Moscow) and Prokhorov.</p>



<p>Read regional Russian-language blogs <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://vc.ru/" target="_blank">vc.ru</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sostav.ru/" target="_blank">Sostav</a>, <a href="https://www.cossa.ru/">Cossa</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hbr.org/" target="_blank">HBR</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rb.ru/" target="_blank">RB</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://secretmag.ru/" target="_blank">Secret Firmy</a>.</p>



<p>Many designated Internet media can easily be entered with a press release under the heading “guest post” and get the attention of the target audience.</p>



<p>They can be seen in the DO coworking spaces, Flacon and the Skolkovo Technopark. </p>



<blockquote><p>Use the data received from Panoptic Insights in order to better understand the audience of the Russian startup market. We hope that this data will help you decide whether to enter this rich market or not.</p></blockquote>

You pick up your phone to check the time or your to-do list, and the first thing you see is that you've received 9 messages from 4 different people, who are waiting for your response. Let’s start with an assessment.</p><h2>What is the state of play with notifications?</h2><h3>They capture our attention</h3><p>In 2015, researchers from Florida State University published <a href="https://www.fsu.edu/indexTOFStory.html?lead.distraction" target="_blank">this study</a> on attention and phone notifications. Participants worked on an attention-demanding task on a computer, during which some received automated call or text alerts on their personal phones. As it turns out, those who received text notifications performed poorly compared to participants who didn’t. Those who received call notifications performed even worse than those who got text messages. Here’s the most interesting part: simply knowing that you have received a text or missed a call might impact your attention as much as actually using your phone. That’s because some of your focus is now allocated to remembering this notification that’s waiting for you.</p><h3>They get in our way</h3><p>Fast-forward to the 20’s. Today, push notifications may be the most obvious form of interruptions because they pop up on or slide into our screens ; but they’re not the only ones that cut off our flow. For instance, I would love to have Discord open, or to use Twitter, without having the constant reminder that I have things to catch up on. The notification badge, with or without count, disrupts our focus. If you open Twitter because you want to message someone, the badge immediately calls for your attention instead of letting you pursue the task you had in mind.</p><p>An alternative design could be one that lets you check your notifications whenever it suits you, making it a deliberate choice, by removing their constant presence on the homepage and keeping them contained to a dedicated zone. Dr. Richard Davidson, founder and director of the Center for Healthy Minds, and professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, uses <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/11/28/18102745/cellphone-distraction-brain-health-screens-kids" target="_blank">this expressive comparison</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Our attention is being captured by devices rather than being voluntarily regulated. We are like a sailor without a rudder on the ocean — pushed and pulled by the digital stimuli to which we are exposed rather than by the intentional direction of our own mind.”</em></p></blockquote><h3>What’s with the red?</h3><p>There’s also the issue of the colour. Many notification badges are <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/why-apples-notification-bubbles-are-so-stressful-65a544e51f10" target="_blank">red by default</a>. Red is the colour that stands out the most in our daily life. Whether in a city, in nature, or at home, this hue contrasts the best against any background. As a result, red is also consistently used to alert us of important signals, including in the physical world. By important, I mean “that which could have strongly negative consequences if we miss them”. The stop sign, the red light, the no-crossing light, the stove, the train’s emergency window breaker, the car dashboard’s red lights, and more, use red as a signifier.</p><p>So not only is red more striking, but we’re also conditioned to be particularly attentive to red signals. Now, I ask you: is the content you’re alerted about with notification badges important enough to use red? I’m curious where your mind is at. I created a poll on Twitter, and you can vote below or <a href="https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow/status/1348978819189927937">over there</a>.</p></div></div><div data-block-json="{&quot;cache_age&quot;:&quot;3153600000&quot;,&quot;authorUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:550,&quot;height&quot;:null,&quot;hSize&quot;:null,&quot;resolveObject&quot;:&quot;Tweet&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<blockquote class=\&quot;twitter-tweet\&quot;><p dir=\&quot;ltr\&quot; lang=\&quot;en\&quot;>Let's talk about notification badges.<br>They're often red to better call for our attention.<br><br>I'm curious about your opinion: is the content you\u2019re alerted about with notification badges important enough to use red?</p>\u2014 This Too Shall Grow \uD83C\uDF31 (@This2ShallGrow) <a href=\&quot;https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow/status/1348978819189927937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;>January 12, 2021</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\&quot;\&quot; src=\&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\&quot; charset=\&quot;utf-8\&quot;></script>&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow/status/1348978819189927937&quot;,&quot;resolvedBy&quot;:&quot;twitter&quot;,&quot;floatDir&quot;:null,&quot;authorName&quot;:&quot;This Too Shall Grow \uD83C\uDF31&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,&quot;resolved&quot;:true,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;rich&quot;,&quot;providerName&quot;:&quot;Twitter&quot;,&quot;providerUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;}" data-block-type="22" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610456282977_18734"><div><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Let's talk about notification badges.<br>They're often red to better call for our attention.</p><p>I'm curious about your opinion: is the content you’re alerted about with notification badges important enough to use red?</p></div>— This Too Shall Grow 🌱 (@This2ShallGrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/This2ShallGrow/status/1348978819189927937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2021</a></blockquote>

We’re constantly being summoned: we switch between tasks and different platforms without dedicating appropriate levels of attention to each. In the example I mentioned above, you 1) open twitter.com, but before completing the “send message to friend” task, you 2) are prompted by the notification badge. So you 3) open the notifications panel, switching to a “read notifications” task. Some of them require a reaction from you, where you 4) switch to “post reply” or “like tweet”. Once you’re done going through this list, you 5) can finally return to your original messaging task.</p><p>“I have strong willpower, I would stick to the original task without checking my notifications”, you say? That’s great! Though as we’ve seen above, the niggling awareness of new information waiting for you is enough to impede your focus.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610452215955_15957"><div>

Take emails: a promotional newsletter from The Fork, or the LinkedIn announcement that someone you don’t know started a new job, are given the same importance as an email from your client saying they accepted your budget. Gmail tabs and inbox filters can help with that, but most email providers don’t have that kind of feature enabled by default. John Herrman, tech and media reporter, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/magazine/red-dots-badge-phones-notification.html" target="_blank">eloquently written</a> about this topic:</p><blockquote><p>“<em>I’ve met dots that existed only to inform me of the existence of other dots, new dots, dots with almost no meaning at all; a dot on my Instagram app led me to another dot within it, which informed me that something had happened on Facebook: Someone I barely know had posted for the first time in a while</em>.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“<em>The same badge might lead to word that Grandma’s in the hospital or that, according to a prerecorded voice, the home-security system you don’t own is in urgent need of attention or that, for the 51st time today, someone has posted in the group chat. New and flourishing modes of socialization amount, in the most abstract terms, to the creation and reduction of dots, and the experience of their attendant joys and anxieties</em>.”</p></blockquote><p>Here are some examples of irrelevant notifications:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Other people - whom I don’t know - commented on a post I’ve commented on</p></li></ul></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610452215955_22192"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610452215955_30798"><div><p>Those are what Adrian Zumbrunnen calls “<a href="https://medium.com/s/story/the-rise-of-anti-notifications-6c92e355612b" target="_blank">anti-notifications</a>”: notifications that aren’t about you or meant for you, but are instead about others. None of the screenshots above concern me, yet LinkedIn decided on my behalf that having them in my feed wasn’t enough, but that I should also be notified of them.</p><h2>How are mindful notifications helpful?</h2><p>What are mindful notifications? Here’s my attempt at constructing a definition.</p><p>“Notifications are mindful when their mental cost and attention required are suitable to the information communicated to a given user. It enables them instead of hindering them. As much as possible, it’s signalling instead of interrupting.”</p><p>I asked people in the <a href="https://nesslabs.com/" target="_blank">Ness Labs community</a> to tell me about their relationship with notifications. Here’s what they shared:</p><blockquote><p>“<em>I've turned most notifications off, entirely, especially sounds but also quite a few badges. This has increased my productivity and my equanimity. I find myself no less informed as a result. I am experimenting with widgets on my iPhone to surface the information I want convenient access to” - </em><a href="https://twitter.com/manleywalker" target="_blank">Manley</a></p></blockquote><p>I also found <a href="https://twitter.com/_middlesister" target="_blank">Karin</a>’s approach interesting. She has a feature phone for personal use, and a smartphone for her professional life only. On her smartphone, everything is off by default - including badges and sound - and she only allows a few selected apps to notify her. This mindset of starting with a clean slate and only turning on the relevant alerts helps ensure that she makes her digital life work for her, and not the other way around.</p><p>Another member mentioned she has no social media, and that she keeps her phone free from work emails and news apps. She can still log in to her personal emails and calendar if needed, but she purposefully added friction to make it a difficult and deliberate act.</p><h2>Designing mindful notifications</h2><h3>Managing the level of attention</h3><p>Dear designer, what’s it going to be? A mobile and/or desktop push notification? An email? An SMS? An in-app notification only? A blinking LED? A sound? A badge? A vibration? And chances are… a blend of those?</p><p>Designers have a range of signifiers they can use and potentially combine, to adapt to the appropriate level of attention required. Does it require users’ full attention, right away? Does it just need to be available for users when they want to retrieve that information? What's the worst case scenario if users miss the notification?</p><p>To be mindful of users’ attention, here’s what factors in:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>The urgency</strong>. “In 10 min: call with x person” lets you know that it’s time to finish your current task, take a short <a href="https://thistooshallgrow.com/blog/better-breaks" target="_blank">break</a>, and pour yourself another tea before your meeting.</p></li><li><p><strong>The importance</strong>. “You have 2 months to fill in your income tax papers” isn’t urgent, but you certainly don’t want to miss that task. Thus, this information might not require a push notification, but it needs to stand out.</p></li><li><p><strong>The context</strong>. “Here’s your QR code ticket for train 1234, carriage 5, seat 6” is a very relevant …</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

<p>A few weeks ago, Chip compared the state of real-time machine learning in China and US: While many Chinese companies have adopted real-time ML, US companies are still assessing its value. She also wrote about ML going real-time <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/12/27/real-time-machine-learning.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<div>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Talking to Internet companies in China gives me the impression that their MLOps infra is away ahead.</p><p>Many US Internet co. are still wondering if there's value in real-time ML. Chinese counterparts are already doing real-time inference + online training.</p><p>Are my samples biased?</p></div>— Chip Huyen (@chipro) <a href="https://twitter.com/chipro/status/1337077324936663040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2020</a></blockquote> 
</div>
<p>This post continues the thread and shares <strong>how real-time ML looks in practice</strong>. Drawing from my experience and industry papers/blogs, weâ€™ll discuss <strong>real-time recommendations</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>When does real-time recommendation make sense? When does it not?</li>
<li>How have China and US companies implemented real-time recommenders?</li>
<li>How can we design and implement a simple MVP?</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: This discussion assumes basic knowledge of recommendation systems, such as the difference between item-to-item and user-to-item, and the candidate generation &amp; ranking paradigm. Fret not if those terms are unfamiliar. Weâ€™ll have two primers to help you get up to speed. Click on the ðŸ‘‰ below to start with the first.</p>
<details><summary id="primer-i">Primer I: Collaboration vs. Content-based, item-to-item vs. user-to-item</summary>
<div>
<p>If you understand the difference between collaboration vs. content-based recommendations, and item-to-item vs. user-to-item, feel free to skip this section.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration-based recommendations are based on user behavior</strong>. Assume I like movie <code><span>X</span></code> and dislike movie <code><span>Y</span></code>. To recommend movies to me, we first find users similar to me (i.e., like <code><span>X</span></code>, dislike <code><span>Y</span></code>). Then, from those users, what are movies they liked, but Iâ€™ve not watched? Those movies are then recommended to me. With user behavioral data, users can â€œcollaborateâ€� to create recommendations for each other. Collaborative filtering is probably the most well-known approach.</p>
<p><strong>Content-based recommendations are based on item metadata</strong>. Given the movies Iâ€™ve watched (and enjoyed), content-based recommenders suggest movies of similar genre, time period, director, etc. Relative to collaboration-based recommenders, content-based recommenders tend to be more effective when the movie is new and we donâ€™t have enough user behavioral data about it yet (i.e., cold-start problem)</p>
<p><strong>In item-to-item (i2i) recommendations, given an item, we recommend other items</strong>. Hereâ€™s an example of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116629/" target="_blank">i2i recommendations on IMDB</a>, under the â€œMore Like Thisâ€� widget. This works well in scenarios where the focus is the item (e.g., item detail page).</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/mlt.jpg" loading="lazy" title="More like Independence Day on IMDB" alt="More like Independence Day on IMDB"></p><p>More like Independence Day on IMDB</p>
<p><strong>In user-to-item (u2i), given a user, we recommend items</strong>. We see this on the home page of Netflix, Amazon, Taobao, sometimes with the name of â€œRecommended For Youâ€�. Our social media feeds (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook) are u2i recommendations too. In such scenarios, the user (and their historical preferences) is the focus.</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/rfy.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Recommended For You on Amazon" alt="Recommended For You on Amazon"></p><p>Recommended For You on Amazon</p>
<p>Taken together, i2i and u2i recommendations provide coverage for the bulk of user traffic via detail pages and home pages.</p>
</div>
</details>
<h2 id="when-not-to-use-real-time-recommendations">When <em>(not)</em> to use real-time recommendations?</h2>
<p>Before we get too excited, let me first say that <strong>most use cases wonâ€™t need real-time recommendations</strong>; batch recommendations are good enough.</p>
<p>Relative to real-time recommendations, batch recommendations are computationally cheaper. They are usually generated once a day and benefit from batch processingâ€™s economies of scale. The recommendations are then loaded into a key-value store (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB) and served via a key-value lookup.</p>
<p>Batch recommendations are also simpler ops-wise. By caching pre-computed recommendations (in our key-value store), we decouple computation from serving. Thus, even if the compute step fails, thereâ€™s no customer-facing impact; we continue to serve the previous batch of (slightly stale) recommendations. The cache provides a buffer and ensures almost 100% uptime, reducing ops burden on the team (e.g., on-call, complaints).</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/batch-vs-stream.jpg" loading="lazy" title="Batch vs. streaming in the case of analytics" alt="Batch vs. streaming in the case of analytics"></p>
<p>Batch vs. streaming in the case of analytics (<a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/11/09/converged-data-platform-unifying-streaming-data-using-mapr/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p>
<p>In contrast, real-time recommendations usually require more computation. For example, we might aggregate streamed events (e.g., click, like, purchase) and generate new recommendations on-demand, based on user interactions. (In comparison, batch recommendations only compute a single set daily.) Furthermore, such computation is done individually and does not benefit from economies of scale. (Nonetheless, we save on not generating recommendations for customers who donâ€™t visit our app).</p>
<p>Operating real-time recommendations in production is also far tricker. Instead of using ephemeral Spark clusters (for compute) and a DynamoDB (for serving), weâ€™ll need low-latency high-throughput APIs with 24/7 uptime. In the strictest scenario, we wonâ€™t have our key-value store as a buffer. The line between compute and serving disappears. Ops burden will increase (read: weâ€™ll be paged in the middle of the night for an outage in another timezone ðŸš¨).</p>
<p><strong>Why real-time recommendations then?</strong> Theyâ€™re useful when the customer journey is mission-centric and depends on the context. Such missions are often time-sensitive. Real-time demand fades quickly; demand could be met (on a competitor site) or the user might lose interest. Weâ€™ll examine this in two examples: shopping and watching a movie.</p>
<p>Shopping is a <strong>mission-centric activity</strong>. Though a customer might predominately purchase a category of products, their shopping behavior is often punctuated with tangential missions. For example, if I usually shop for clothes, my u2i recommendations will mostly be fashion recommendations. However, if I need a new wide-screen monitor and start browsing for one, my u2i recommendations should update ASAP to help me quickly fulfill my mission (lest I go to a competing app).</p>
<p>In this scenario, batch recommendations donâ€™t react fast enough. And even when the recommendations are updated, due to the data imbalance, such mission-related needs are not met (More in Section 2.1 of this <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3240323.3240372" target="_blank">Netflix paper</a>).</p>
<p>The movies we watch <strong>depend on context</strong> (though our long-term preferences are fairly stable). For example, we might watch different movies depending on whether weâ€™re alone, with friends, with a romantic interest, or with children. It might also depend on our mood, as well as the time of day. Similar to shopping, daily batch recommendations face the same challenges here.</p>
<p>Other than the examples above, real-time recommendations are also handy in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel (our vacation destinations are often changing)</li>
<li>YouTube (we watch videos for coding, yoga, and recipes within the same day)</li>
<li>Serving ads (our interest is time-sensitive; our attention spans are shrinking)</li>
</ul>
<p>Real-time recommendations are also useful when the majority of our customers are new (i.e., cold-start). This happens when weâ€™re in the customer acquisition stage, such as when weâ€™ve just launched a new product or entered a new market (e.g., e-commerce in Southeast Asia in 2013 - 2015).</p>
<p>Imagine youâ€™ve just downloaded an e-commerce app. Since weâ€™re uncertain of your gender, the home page will have a mix of categories catering to each gender, from dresses to menâ€™s shirts, from GPUs to makeup. If you click on a dress, we can immediately build a persona (that youâ€™re female) and personalize your shopping experience. In this case, the u2i recommendations on your home page will tilt towards female products.</p>
<p>Given that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/nearly-1-in-4-people-abandon-mobile-apps-after-only-one-use/" target="_blank">1 in 4 users abandon mobile apps</a> <em>after only one use</em>, quickly responding to customer needsâ€”from the very first touchpointâ€”helps with acquisition and retention.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did you miss the first primer (collaborative vs. content-based, item-to-item vs. user-to-item)? Click on the ðŸ‘‰ <a href="#primer-i">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most modern recommenders have two key components: candidate generation and ranking.</p>
<p>Candidate generation is a fastâ€”but coarseâ€”approach to get (hundreds of) item candidates from millions of items. We trade off precision for efficiency to reduce the search space (e.g., from 100 million to 1,000 candidates, a 99.999% reduction). This is usually done via metadata-based filters (e.g., category, brand) or k-nearest neighbors.</p>
<p>Ranking is a slowerâ€”but more preciseâ€”approach to sort and select top recommendation candidates. We have leeway to include features that might not have been feasible in the candidate generation step. Such features include user persona (e.g., demographics, price propensity), item metadata (e.g., attributes, engagement statistics), cross features (e.g., interaction between each feature pair), and media embeddings.</p>
<p>Ranking can be framed as either a classification or learning to rank problem. As a classification problem, we can score candidates based on probability of click or purchase. Logistic regression with crossed features is simple to implement and a difficult baseline to beat. Decision trees are also commonly used. As a learning to rank problem, commonly used algorithms include <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/ranking-boosting-and-model-adaptation/" target="_blank">LambdaMart</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754" target="_blank">XGBoost</a>, and <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/hash/6449f44a102fde848669bdd9eb6b76fa-Abstract.html" target="_blank">LightGBM</a>. Neural networks are also gaining adoption, thanks to <a href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/notes-from-sparkai-summit-application-agnostic/#scaling-up-deep-learning-by-scaling-down-24th-june" target="_blank">gains in model efficiency</a> via distillation, pruning, quantization, etc.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://blog.csdn.net/xwd18280820053/article/details/90316416" target="_blank">general reference</a> sheds light on recommendation systems from a Chinese perspective. Itâ€™s organized based on the paradigm discussed, with sections for candidate generation (â€œMatchâ€�) and ranking (â€œRankâ€�). It also discusses two other components: profile (building user preferences) and post-processing (e.g., excluding previously purchased goods, item-deduplication across recommendation sets).</p>
<p><strong>To see how recommendations can be incrementally updated</strong>, weâ€™ll discuss two algorithms: the humble collaborative filtering (CF) and Alibabaâ€™s Swing algorithm that improves on CF.</p>
<p>Collaborative filtering (for i2i recommendations) is implemented via the three formulas below. Letâ€™s try to understand what they do and the intuition behind them.</p><p></p></div></div>

<p>Developers and software teams already know that one of the biggest challenges of their job is <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/how-to-scope-software-projects">accurately scoping work</a>, and being able to consistently and predictably deliver results to clients within the promised timeline.</p>



<p>Yet another challenge is finding ways to streamline workflows so <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/healthier-work-systems">missed deadlines due to inaccurate scoping</a> become 100 percent a thing of the past. Lead time, cycle time, and takt time are just a few metrics that software teams can track and optimize to boost their efficiency and productivity —&nbsp;but these are also metrics that are often confused with one another.</p>



<p>Each one of them —&nbsp;lead time, cycle time, and takt time — is an individual metric that helps developers monitor, track, and evaluate <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/autonomy-software-teams">how efficiently your team completes projects</a>. Optimizing each of them for better efficiency doesn’t only boost client satisfaction; it also makes your team better, faster, and stronger.</p>







<p>But doing that requires understanding what each metric is, how to calculate it, and the role it plays in the overall project scope. By understanding the differences between lead time, cycle time, and takt time — and how and when to use each metric —&nbsp;developers can discover paths to better scoping and increased productivity.</p>



<h2>Lead Time vs Cycle Time vs Takt Time: What Are They</h2>



<p>Lead time, cycle time, and takt time all come from Kanban, a workflow management method that was originally created to help streamline manufacturing processes. Many of the principles of Kanban translate well to the process of software development, so it’s become a common practice for managing workflows for software teams, as well.</p>



<p>Lead time, cycle time, and takt time are all metrics used to track, measure, and evaluate efficiency at different parts of the production process. If that doesn’t make sense just yet, don’t worry —&nbsp;we’ll explain each one in better detail down below.</p>



<h3>What Is Lead Time?</h3>



<p>Lead time is the total amount of time between when a new task or project enters your workflow, and when it leaves your workflow. In other words, it’s the total time from when your team agrees to take on a project, to when you deliver it to the client.</p>



<h4>How Is Lead Time Calculated?</h4>



<p>The formula for lead time in a manufacturing setting is:</p>

<p>In the context of a software team, that might look like this:</p>



<ul><li>After the client makes a request that includes three deliverables, it takes your team two days to process it.</li><li>Then, it takes four months (~120 days) to complete the project.</li><li>Once the project is finished on your end, the client takes two weeks (14 days) to review it and make the final payment.</li></ul>



<p><strong>In this case, the lead time would equal 2 days + 120 days + 14 days, or 136 days.</strong></p>



<h4>Why Is Lead Time Important for Software Teams?</h4>



<p>Lead time provides you with a good overview of how long a project takes from start to finish. You can compare your lead time to your cycle time to determine some insights about your team’s productivity and customer satisfaction, but more on that in a minute.</p>



<h3>What Is Cycle Time?</h3>



<p>Cycle time is how you can measure how long it takes your team to complete work on a project. In manufacturing, cycle time means the amount of time it takes to complete a production cycle from beginning to end. For software teams, that usually translates to the amount of time from when your team starts coding, to when the software is released.</p>



<p>Cycle time differs from lead time in that it measures <em>only</em> the time your team spends in production. Lead time takes that measurement, then combines it with the time it takes your team to receive and process requests, deliver them to the client, and receive approval and payment.</p>



<h4>How Is Cycle Time Calculated?</h4>



<p>The formula for calculating cycle time is:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="264" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-1024x264.jpg" alt="How Is Cycle Time Calculated" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-1024x264.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-300x77.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-768x198.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-1536x396.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-2048x528.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Let’s take the same example from above, and calculate the team’s cycle time.</p>



<p>It took the team 120 hours to complete the three deliverables the client requested. So cycle time could be calculated in two different ways.</p>



<ul><li>120 hours divided by three deliverables = 40 hours of cycle time per deliverable; or</li><li>120 hours divided by one project for the client = 120 hours of cycle time</li></ul>



<h4>Why Is Cycle Time Important for Software teams?</h4>



<p>Cycle time is one of the most important metrics you can compare to your lead time, and how those two differ can tell you quite a bit about your team’s efficiency.</p>



<p>For example, if your cycle time is much lower than your lead time, it shows that your team is either taking a long time to process requests and begin projects, or projects are lingering in the approval phase. This could mean your team is leaving loose ends and not moving through the entire workflow efficiently.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if your cycle time is equal to your lead time, it could be because you’re allowing processing and approval times on projects to overlap. While this might be an efficient use of your software team’s time, it may also lower the quality of the customer service you deliver.</p>



<h3>What Is Takt Time?</h3>



<p>And now, let’s look at time measurements from a different angle with takt time. Takt time is a measurement of how quickly or efficiently your team is able to meet the needs of your client or production schedule. “Takt” comes from the German word for “pulse,” and that’s a good way of looking at it —&nbsp;this measurement finds your team’s ideal “pulse” of work, that allows you to deliver projects as needed without underworking or overworking the team.</p>



<h4>How Is Takt Time Calculated?</h4>



<p>The formula for calculating takt time is:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="264" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-1024x264.jpg" alt="How Is Takt Time Calculated" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-1024x264.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-300x77.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-768x198.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-1536x396.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-2048x528.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>This can be a little trickier to apply to work like software development (though that doesn’t make it a less useful metric!).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the example we’ve been using above, we can take those three deliverables the client needs, and divide them into the 120 hours your team has available for the project. In that case:</p>



<p>Takt time = 120 / 3 = 40 hours per deliverable.</p>



<p>But we know software development isn’t always that easy to segment. So, to look at this another way, let’s say your team has scoped the client’s project and determined there are 6 smaller goals you need to achieve during your sprints. So in this case:</p>



<p>Takt time = 120 / 6 = 20 hours per sprint. That means your team can plan on completing two sprints per week to hit their optimal pulse, or takt, for this project.</p>



<h4>Why Is Takt Time Important for Software Teams?</h4>



<p>Takt time tells you whether your team is overworked and unable to keep up with demand, or underworked and not being as productive as it could be.</p>



<p>For example, if you calculate your takt time to be 120 hours per project, but your team’s cycle time is 150 hours, your team won’t be able to deliver on the deadlines it’s scoping.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if your takt time is 120 hours and your cycle time is 100 hours, you’re leaving 20 hours per project in your scope as wasted time.</p>



<h2>How Can You Measure Lead Time, Cycle Time, and Takt Time?</h2>



<p>We know time tracking <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/timekeeping-is-not-toxix">isn’t a favorite topic among developers</a>. But for getting the valuable insights that lead time, cycle time, and takt time can provide, it’s 100 percent necessary.</p>



<p>So why not use a time tracking tool that’s built into your existing systems, but stays in the background, out of your way while you do the job you’re here to do? <a href="https://www.7pace.com/">7pace Timetracker</a> is just that — it’s a time tracking tool built for developers, by developers who use it themselves. It integrates directly into Azure DevOps, Azure Boards, and <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/7pace-for-github-announcement">GitHub</a>, so no matter where and how you work, it’s always where you need it to be —&nbsp;tracking time so you don’t have to worry about it.</p>



<p>But we know we’re not going to sell you on a time tracking tool unless there’s real value your team can gain. That’s why it’s not so important <em>how</em> you track different time metrics —&nbsp;what matters is <em>why</em> you track them (and how you use the insights they give you).</p>



<h3>Why Should You Track All These Time Metrics?</h3>



<p>Tracking time metrics like lead time, cycle time, and takt time comes with a whole pile of potential benefits for your team. These metrics can:</p>



<ul><li>Help your team identify bottlenecks in your workflow;</li><li>Give you a better understanding of your team’s capacity for work;</li><li>Help you more accurately scope new projects.</li></ul>



<p>The most important takeaway here is that tracking different time metrics gives you a complete view of how your team is spending time. That allows you to identify any workflow problems, and identifying them is the first step toward eliminating them — and getting as close as possible to maximum productivity with your team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is important to note and recognize that time metrics will be constantly changing, so this isn’t a one-and-done kind of assessment. In order to keep getting the maximum value out of tracking time metrics, you’ll have to continue to track and analyze them over time, on all your projects —&nbsp;and adjust your workflow accordingly. Sometimes changes you put into place based on one set of time metrics will end up getting reversed later based on a newer set of time metrics — software teams are made up of people, after all, and not robots.</p>



<p>It takes some time and effort to constantly track time metrics, but we think the value of the insights you can gather makes the endeavor well worth it. If you’re ready to start tracking your team’s time metrics —&nbsp;from lead time to cycle time to takt time and even more — you need the time tracker that will automate the most tedious parts of the process.

From the Snowden revelations we learned not only about NSA data collection projects, but also about many software tools that are used to analyze and search those data. These programs run on secure computer networks, isolated from the public internet. Here we will provide an overview of these networks that are used by the US military and US intelligence agencies.</p><p>

Besides computer networks, they also use a number of dedicated telephone networks, but gradually these are transferred from traditional circuit-switched networks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP" target="_blank">Voice over IP</a> (VoIP). This makes it possible to have only one IP packet-switched network for both computer and phone services. It seems that for example NSA's <a href="http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2014/02/nsa-director-alexanders-phones.html#nsts">NSTS</a> phone system is now fully IP-based.</p><p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hfFQW77nKhY/VPUo9x2bk3I/AAAAAAAACOc/MvGIApP5UE0/s1600/nsa-nsoc2006.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hfFQW77nKhY/VPUo9x2bk3I/AAAAAAAACOc/MvGIApP5UE0/s1600/nsa-nsoc2006.jpg" width="450"></a><br>

The main US military and intelligence computer networks are (of course) only accessible for authorized personnel from the United States. Special security measures are in place to prevent interception by foreign intelligence agencies. Most of the tools and programs used by NSA run on JWICS and NSANet, but here we only mention them when this is confirmed by  documents. </p><blockquote>

These various military and intelligence networks run on a world-wide physical infrastructure that is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Information_Systems_Network" target="_blank">Defense Information Systems Network</a> (DISN), which is maintained by the <a href="http://www.disa.mil/" target="_blank">Defense Information Systems Agency</a> (DISA) and consists of landline, mobile, radio and satellite communication links.</p><p>

Most of these communication links are not connected to the public internet, but because radio and satellite transmissions can easily be intercepted by foreign countries, the security of these networks is assured by encryption. This encryption can also be used to run higher classified traffic over communication links with a lower classification level through Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels.</p><p>

Classified communications have to be protected by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_Suite_A_Cryptography" target="_blank">Suite A Cryptography</a>, which contains very strong and classified encryption algorithms. On most networks this is implemented by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_1_product" target="_blank">Type 1</a> certified <a href="http://www.gdc4s.com/products/secure-voice-and-data-products-catergory-listing/network-encryption.html?taxonomyCat=326" target="_blank">TACLANE</a> (KG-175A/D) in-line network encryptors made by General Dynamics:</p><p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x4T0EMTWJlI/VP_kSFDBEDI/AAAAAAAACQ0/b3HG2jTkZqg/s1600/taclane_interop_2011.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x4T0EMTWJlI/VP_kSFDBEDI/AAAAAAAACQ0/b3HG2jTkZqg/s1600/taclane_interop_2011.jpg" width="400"></a><br>

As long there's the appropriate strong link encryption, only the end points with the computer terminals (where data are processed before they are encrypted) need strict physical and digital security requirements in order to prevent any kind of eavesdropping or interception by foreign adversaries.</p><p>

Most American military bases are connected to the SIPRNET backbone, but for tactical users in the field, the SIPRNet and JWICS networks can extend to mobile sites through Satellite Communications (SATCOM) links, like for example <a href="http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/TROJAN_SPIRIT" target="_blank">TROJAN SPIRIT</a> and TROJAN SPIRIT LITE, which consist of a satellite terminal that can be on a pallet, in a shelter, on a trailer or even connected to a transit case.</p><p>

Besides the aforementioned networks that are only accessible for authorized military and intelligence personnel from the United States, there are also computer networks set up by the US for multinational coalitions, and which therefore can also be used by officials from partner countries. </p><p>

The group of countries that have access to such coalition networks is often denoted by a number of "Eyes" corresponding with the number of countries that participate.</p>

    <p><img src="https://techaid24.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Switch-Case-In-Python.jpg" alt="Python Switch Case"></p>

<p>The <em>switch</em> is a statement that evaluates the accuracy or similarity of the value of a certain input.
But isn’t that the same thing that the <em>if</em> statement does?
Let’s see this statement starting with <strong>bash</strong> scripting language.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>case</span> EXPRESSION in

  PATTERN_1<span>)</span>
    STATEMENTS
    <span>;;</span>

  PATTERN_2<span>)</span>
    STATEMENTS
    <span>;;</span>

  PATTERN_N<span>)</span>
    STATEMENTS
    <span>;;</span>

  *<span>)</span>
    STATEMENTS
    <span>;;</span>
<span>esac</span>
</code></pre></div><p><em>EXPRESSION</em> is an expression (command) or a variable. <em>PATTERN_N</em>, is a value that is expected from <em>EXPRESSION</em>. <em>*</em> is default value.</p>
<p>So given an <strong>EXPRESSION</strong>, I evaluate the <strong>PATTERN</strong> cases and if they don’t fit into the latter, the default <strong>*</strong> comes into play. Simple. Let’s see her at work.</p>
<h2 id="switch-work">Switch, work!</h2>
<p>Which fruit do you want?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>echo</span> -n <span>"Enter the name of a fruit "</span>
<span>read</span> FRUIT

<span>echo</span> -n <span>"The </span><span>$FRUIT</span><span> is "</span>

<span>case</span> <span>$FRUIT</span> in

  apple<span>)</span>
    <span>echo</span> -n <span>"apple"</span>
    <span>;;</span>

  banana<span>)</span>
    <span>echo</span> -n <span>"banana"</span>
    <span>;;</span>

  blueberries <span>|</span> raspberries <span>|</span> <span>"blue currant"</span> <span>|</span> currant<span>)</span>
    <span>echo</span> -n <span>"berries"</span>
    <span>;;</span>

  *<span>)</span>
    <span>echo</span> -n <span>"unknown"</span>
    <span>;;</span>
<span>esac</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In bash everything is very simple and clear. Let’s see what happens in other languages.</p>
<h2 id="switch-in-other-languages">Switch in other languages</h2>
<p>In other languages such as Java and .NET C#, the switch case is a bit more complicated. However, compared to the simplicity of the bash case, the purpose is clear.
An example in <strong>Java</strong>.</p>

      <span>}</span>
   <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>They are very similar. We built a fruit selector, like the one in bash.</p>
<h2 id="but-in-python">But in python?</h2>
<p>Python does not have any <em>switch</em> statements.
A <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3103/">PEP 3103</a> has been evaluated and created, but the conclusion is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the mean time, Python is fine without a switch statement, and perhaps those who claim it would be a mistake to add one are right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I was reflecting above, the switch case is very similar to the if statement.
An early form of switch in python could be given by <strong>if/elif/else</strong> statements.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>fruit</span> <span>=</span> <span>"banana"</span>
<span>if</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>==</span> <span>"apple"</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"The fruit is apple"</span><span>)</span>
<span>elif</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>==</span> <span>"banana"</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"The fruit is banana"</span><span>)</span>
<span>elif</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>in</span> <span>(</span><span>"blueberries"</span><span>,</span> <span>"raspberries"</span><span>,</span> <span>"blue currant"</span><span>,</span> <span>"currant"</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>)</span>
<span>else</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"The fruit is unknown"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This is simple to both read and understand. But it’s still not a switch statement. The switch evaluates the accuracy but also the similarity of a word.
There is an object in python which acts as a selector. Not for nothing have the two classes written in Java and C# above called “<em>Selector</em>”.</p>
<p>A selector evaluates an <strong>EXPRESSION</strong>, takes its value and checks the accuracy of the <strong>PATTERN</strong>, otherwise, it returns a default value (<strong>*</strong>).
The dictionary object is a kind of selector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A mapping object maps hashable values to arbitrary objects. Mappings are mutable objects. There is currently only one standard mapping type, the dictionary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being based on hash indexes, it is much faster in retrieving values. Let’s try to create our selector.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>myfruit</span> <span>=</span> <span>"banana"</span>
<span>fruits</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"apple"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is apple"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"banana"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is banana"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"blueberries"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"raspberries"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"blue currant"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"currant"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>fruits</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>myfruit</span><span>,</span> <span>"The fruit is unknown"</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In this way, we made our switch selector, beautiful and “<em>pythonic</em>”. But still, the exactness but also the similarity of a word is not evaluated.</p>
<h2 id="can-it-be-improved">Can it be improved?</h2>
<p>Yes, of course!
Let’s now create a function that will act as a selector, as we’ve seen done in Java and C#.
There is a python builtin that applies filters. The function is called <em>filter</em>. Apply a function to an iterable. Functions such as terables are python objects and can be assigned as arguments to other functions. Also, our fruit selector (dictionary) is an iterable. We just need a function that evaluates the similarity of the keys.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>FruitSelector</span><span>(</span><span>fruit</span><span>):</span>
    <span>fruits</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"apple"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is apple"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"banana"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is banana"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"blueberries"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"raspberries"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"blue currant"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"currant"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"default"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is unknown"</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>key</span><span>:</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>in</span> <span>key</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>fruits</span><span>.</span><span>items</span><span>()))</span>

<span>FruitSelector</span><span>(</span><span>'banana'</span><span>)</span>
<span>FruitSelector</span><span>(</span><span>'anana'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In python, methods of classes and functions are objects of type <em>Callable</em>. Being objects, information can be stored in them.
We will transform our selector into a switch, with an added value: the cache of the last selected fruit.
In python everything is an object and therefore can be treated as such.
If we wanted to abstract our selector even more to make it become a switch in effect, that’s it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>switch</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>,</span> <span>dictionary</span><span>,</span> <span>default</span><span>=</span><span>"no match"</span><span>):</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>key</span> <span>in</span> <span>dictionary</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>():</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>match</span> <span>in</span> <span>key</span><span>:</span>
            <span>switch</span><span>.</span><span>last_match</span> <span>=</span> <span>key</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>dictionary</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>default</span>

<span>fruits</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"apple"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is apple"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"banana"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is banana"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"blueberries"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"raspberries"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"blue currant"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"currant"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The fruit is berries"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>switch</span><span>(</span><span>'banana'</span><span>,</span> <span>fruits</span><span>)</span>
<span>switch</span><span>(</span><span>'anana'</span><span>,</span> <span>fruits</span><span>)</span>
<span>switch</span><span>(</span><span>switch</span><span>.</span><span>last_match</span><span>,</span> <span>fruits</span><span>,</span> <span>default</span><span>=</span><span>"The fruit is unknown"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="a-callable-switch">A callable switch</h2>
<p>Also, since functions in python are objects, it is possible to replace string values of the dictionary with functions and return them if the keys match, in this way, can be called. A very simple example.
In effect, that’s it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>switch</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>,</span> <span>dictionary</span><span>,</span> <span>default</span><span>=</span><span>"no match"</span><span>):</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>key</span> <span>in</span> <span>dictionary</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>():</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>match</span> <span>in</span> <span>key</span><span>:</span>
            <span>switch</span><span>.</span><span>last_match</span> <span>=</span> <span>key</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>dictionary</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>default</span>

    <span>"minus"</span><span>:</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>-</span> <span>y</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>plus</span> <span>=</span> <span>switch</span><span>(</span><span>'plus'</span><span>,</span> <span>calc</span><span>,</span> <span>default</span><span>=</span><span>"unintended function"</span><span>)</span>
<span>minus</span> <span>=</span> <span>switch</span><span>(</span><span>'minus'</span><span>,</span> <span>calc</span><span>,</span> <span>default</span><span>=</span><span>"unintended function"</span><span>)</span>

<span>plus</span><span>(</span><span>6</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>minus</span><span>(</span><span>6</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In fact, <strong>python</strong> doesn’t need a switch statement. Do other programming languages really need it? I believe that in simple languages like <strong>bash</strong>, there is a real need for this construct. In <strong>Java</strong> you could do the same thing I did in python via a map object and same thing in <strong>C#</strong>. Finally, I agree with the conclusions of PEP 3103: <em>“In the mean time, Python is fine without a switch statement, and perhaps those who claim it would be a mistake to add one are right."</em></p>

            </small></p><p><a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/">Ohm</a> is an open-source parsing toolkit for JavaScript which <a href="http://www.tinlizzie.org/~awarth/">Alex Warth</a> and I have been working on since 2014. You can use it to parse custom file formats or quickly build parsers, interpreters, and compilers for programming languages.</p>
<p>This article is not about Ohm itself, but about the <strong>Ohm visualizer</strong>, which I designed and built in 2015 while working on Alex’s team at CDG.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Later, the team expanded the visualizer into the <a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/#30325d346a6e803cc35344ca218d8636">Ohm Editor</a>, which we continued to actively develop over the years. The editor itself has been <a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/pubs/live2016/">presented before</a>, so I’ll focus specifically on the visualization here.</p>
<p>Creating the visualization was one of the most difficult and interesting design challenges I’ve ever tackled — so it’s been rewarding to hear from people who have found it to be helpful:</p>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey, I used Ohm for the first time a couple days ago.</p><p>I used to have an irrational fear of writing parsers.</p><p>Your visualization cured it.<br>Thanks a lot!</p></div>— Anselm Eickhoff (@ae_play) <a href="https://twitter.com/ae_play/status/1347325515770826757?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2021</a></blockquote>


<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Ohm is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar">parsing expression grammars</a> (PEGs), which are a formal way of describing syntax, similar to regular expressions and context-free grammars. Like other PEG-based tools, it uses <em>packrat parsing</em>, a form of top-down parsing with unlimited lookahead.</p>
<p>One of Ohm’s main goals is ease-of-use —&nbsp;not only for the end users of languages, but also for grammar authors. And debugging grammars can be a notoriously painful. So I designed and built an interactive visualization that makes the entire execution of the parser visible and tangible. This lets grammar authors <em>follow the flow</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> rather than “playing computer” and trying to simulate the execution in their head.</p>
<p>When creating or debugging a grammar, there are a few things you might be interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the parse succeeded…<ul>
<li>…what does the parse tree look like?</li>
<li>Did it parse the input the way I intended? If not, why not?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the parse failed, why did it fail?</li>
</ul>
<p>Initially, I explored two different design directions: one focused on the output (the parse tree), and another that focused on the algorithm execution. The big challenge was to come up with a design that could do both.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> You can try out all the examples here online in the <a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/">Ohm Editor</a>.</em></p>
<h2>Visualizing Parse Trees</h2>
<p>To visualize the parse tree, I chose a variant of the icicle plot (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2685881?seq=1">Kruskal and Landwehr 1983</a>). Some people may be more familiar with the <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">flame graphs</a> used in software profilers, which are basically inverted icicle plots.</p>
<p>Each node is represented by a <span>gray rectangle</span>, with its children directly below it. A <span>dashed bottom border</span> indicates a node with hidden children. You can click on a node to show or hide its children.</p>
<p>Unlike most icicle plots, the absolute width of a box is not meaningful — only its width and position relative to the input text. Nodes always sit directly below the input text they consumed.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> This is emphasized by highlighting the relevant portion of the input when the cursor is over the node:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/arithmetic-parse-tree-hover.png" width="320px"></p>
<p>This means that the node must be at least as wide as its consumed input. We also ensure that the nodes are always wide enough to display the full label. So unlike most hierarchicial visualizations, there’s no need to hover over a node to see its label.</p>
<p>To satisfy both of these width constraints, the layout algorithm will expand the letter spacing of the input text where required:</p>

<h2>Visualizing the parser execution</h2>
<p>A parse tree visualization can help you understand what the parse tree looks like, but only if the parse succeeded. If the input failed to parse, or if the parse tree is not what you intended, you’ll want to understand <em>why</em>.</p>
<p>To answer this question, I designed the “explain parse” feature, which shows a visual explanation of the parser’s execution. This can be enabled via the option panel in the lower right corner:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/explain-parse-checkbox.png"></p>
<p>Like other PEG-based tools, Ohm uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">recursive-descent parsing</a>. A useful property of recursive-descent parsing is that parser’s execution (e.g. as represented by a dynamic call graph) has a very similar structure to the parse tree. This made it possible to design a single visualization that serves both purposes.</p>
<p>Let’s take a simple grammar for parsing credit card expiry dates. The animation below shows a trace of the logical steps taken to parse the input “08/24”.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/explain-parse-expiry.gif">
<figcaption>Stepping through the parse of “08/24”.<br><i>(click to replay)</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can see that the tree is built in a top-down, left-to-right manner. Each non-leaf node is visited twice: once on the way down, and again on the way up. This is the basic structure of recursive-descent parsing. </p>
<p>In this extremely simple example, every step taken by the parser succeeds. So the execution trace looks <em>exactly</em> like the parse tree. This is not usually the case. Let’s take a look at a more complex example:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/parse-tree-and-grammar.png"></p>
<p>In this example, several steps in the parsing failed to match any input (shown with <span>red labels</span>). This doesn’t mean something went wrong — this is just part of the way that a packrat parser works. The screenshot above shows two different types of match failure that can happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Failed branches of an <a href="https://github.com/harc/ohm/blob/master/doc/syntax-reference.md#alternation">alternation expression</a>, as seen under <code>idFirst</code>. The parser first attempts to match an underscore (<code>"_"</code>), which fails, before successfully matching <code>letter</code> on the second branch.</li>
<li>The last child of an <a href="https://github.com/harc/ohm/blob/master/doc/syntax-reference.md#repetition-operators---">repetition expression</a>. The repetition expression <code>idRest*</code> means  to match <code>idRest</code> as many times as possible; the last attempt will always fail by definition.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/highlighted-failures.png"></p>
<h3>Backtracking</h3>
<p>Another challenge in designing the visualization was how to deal with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking">backtracking</a>. In a packrat parser, backtracking happens when a successful match is part of a larger expression which fails.</p>
<p>For example, many programming languages contain <em>keywords</em> (e.g. <code>function</code>) which can appear in the same position as a variable name. A common way to handle this is to use <a href="https://github.com/harc/ohm/blob/master/doc/syntax-reference.md#negative-lookahead-"><em>negative lookahead</em></a> to prevent incorrectly matching a keyword at the beginning of an identifier like “functional”.</p>
<p>Here is the same grammar from before, modified to include a <em>functionKeyword</em> rule. And here is the visual explanation of matching the the input “functional”:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/functional-parse-tree-and-grammar.png"></p>
<p>The nodes with a <span>pink background</span> are nodes which successfully matched some portion of the input, but were ultimately discarded during backtracking.</p>
<h3>Left recursion</h3>
<p>One thing in Ohm that’s different from many similar tools is its special support for <em>left recursion</em>. The <a href="https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/#30325d346a6e803cc35344ca218d8636">arithmetic grammar</a> included in the Ohm Editor has some examples of left-recursive rules:</p>
<pre><code>  AddExp
    = AddExp "+" MulExp  -- plus
    | AddExp "-" MulExp  -- minus
    | MulExp
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the first two branches of <em>AddExp</em> begin with a recursive application of <em>AddExp</em> itself — that’s left recursion. In a typical recursive-descent parser, this would result in infinite recursion. However, since it’s so convenient to define left-associative operators this way, the Ohm parsing algorithm detects these rules and handles them specially.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Ohm handles left recursion by iteratively trying to expand the input consumed by the left-recursive rule, and stopping when it can’t be expanded any further. As a grammar author, you might sometimes wonder why it stopped when it did. To find out, you can look at the special <span>[Grow LR]</span> node that appears as the last child of any left-recursive rule application:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/grow-left-recursion.png"></p>
<h2>Single-stepping</h2>
<p>One other feature of the visual parse explanation is the ability to single-step through the parser’s execution. In terms of information content, it doesn’t show anything that’s not already visible in the full visualization — so in a sense, it’s not strictly necessary. However, I hoped that it might help new users learn how the visualization works.</p>
<p>Single-stepping can be controlled through the buttons in the option panel:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/step-controls.png"></p>
<p>You can also right-click on any node and choose “step into” or “step out”:</p>
<p><img src="https://dubroy.com/blog/images/step-into.png"></p>
<p>From there, you can use the arrow keys to step forwards (→) or backwards (←) through the logical steps of the parser execution:</p>

<p>As I explained at the beginning, my goal with the Ohm visualizer was <strong>to make entire execution of the parser visible and tangible</strong>. In the end, I think I was able to achieve that — but I’m sure there are also many aspects of the design that could be improved. If you have ideas, please feel free to get in touch!</p>

        <p id="69014b56-b04f-4baf-be70-2c0ba0ad30e9">I love building products like Notion, but building these kinds of products is hard. For two reasons:</p>

              <p id="64d9a82d-8237-4a9f-b83f-eb9eae786157">Underneath any end-user database is <em>another</em> database and so much complexity arises from the challenge of building a database inside a database. Solutions to this problem vary widely and make some sort of trade-off between scalability (performance) and complexity.</p>
              <p id="9dd2cc1a-1eb6-4af8-9c22-d486c3e9dc99">Some applications load the entire end-user database in-memory. This creates long initial load times, but really performant interactions once the application loads. There are obvious scalability issues with this approach, but it is fairly simple to implement.</p>
              <p id="e10696df-1d8a-47ff-9365-701d9ff58d00">Other applications resort to O(n) scans on the server to fetch data and filter/sort records in memory with a few caching and indexing optimizations when convenient. The problem here is that users can create their own columns and filters dynamically. If your cloud application is backed by a SQL database, for example, it’s worrisome to allow users to edit the database schema and create an unbounded number of tables and indexes. Thus, you must resort to filtering records in-memory.</p>
              <p id="30d92414-92a1-4469-99ba-643219826c94">If you're dedicated to O(log n) queries, you'll need to build indexes yourself (unless there's some amazing database I am unaware of). On every write, you can compute what indexes need to be updated and you write to a NoSQL database to incrementally update a cached query result. This can lead to a good solution, but it comes at the cost of consistency. Now that you're building your own indexes outside of the database, writes are no longer transactional and you lose the guarantee of being able to read your own write.</p>
              <p id="c04b352e-bd9a-44ad-ba88-17ac5cc502ff">Another solution is to have a separate database for every user and allow users to edit the schema of their own isolated database. This allows writes to be transactional, but creates other kinds of collision problems (i.e. dealing with merge conflict) when you want users to be able to collaborate. With separate databases for each user, you're also doing a lot more computing labor, especially if the same records are shared amongst many people.</p>
              <p id="7c45a3a9-7051-4386-a53f-d246c9ba7310">Long story short, existing databases are not great for building end-user databases.</p>

        <p id="1d0ea7ea-6760-43cc-a728-4b3a1d7efe3b">I'll introduce databases as an abstract concept and then we'll work through a real-world example to explore how databases leverage sorting and filters to lookup information quickly.</p>
        <p id="088e64ab-1cbd-49c2-85e5-ac16a93efcfa">By the end, I hope to show you how these information architecture concepts are immensely powerful and totally approachable for non-technical people. </p>
        <p id="69cf1cd2-0e55-4a55-8d70-a407a8cba1e3">Lastly, I want to convince you that software based on these concepts will be far superior to anything we use today for end-user database applications.

Databases are no different, they're also containers of sorted information.</p>

        <h2 id="b5562604-4d38-4feb-84bd-6f536aea58cc">What is sorted information?</h2>
        <p id="2238e190-e73f-43c3-96d3-44daa545e966">Alphabetical, numerical, compound, lexicographical Encodings.</p>
        <p id="e4db1ca2-03e3-4767-883b-83b12f484fd6">The simplest way to sort something is alphabetically (a.k.a <em>lexicographically</em>) and this is how words are sorted in the dictionary. But we often find ourselves sorting by more than one property. For example, a contact list is often sorted by last name, <em>then</em> first name. This is called a <strong>compound sort</strong>. </p>
        
        <p id="3f686c5c-6eed-4ad6-8eb3-73168fa60be6">For example, notice that "Thomas Robins" should come before "Charlie Robinson" when sorting this way and that a compound sort is fundamentally different from simply joining the words together and then sorting.</p><pre id="82947e67-674e-4edd-8b12-6d7a800dee7a"><code>// Compound Sort: Last, First
Robins, Thomas
Robinson, Charlie

// Joining the words, then sorting: Last + First
RobinsonCharlie
RobinsThomas</code></pre>
        
        <p id="c545d059-b2b0-4678-8fd4-40aa6d7bdafd">We do this kind of compound sorting all over the place. Dates, in particular, are compound sorted by year, <em>then</em> month, <em>then</em> day.</p><pre id="cc0fb85d-ab5f-4e44-8947-0a504713b758"><code>January 10, 2019

        <p id="ef7175d9-a258-4f95-afe7-0ce9b274df54">Notice that this kind of sorting isn't exactly alphabetical. The months in a year are definitely not sorted alphabetically — each month has an underlying order within a year. Even days of the month aren't alphabetically sorted — they're numerically sorted.</p>
        
        <p id="9d475882-2657-4dc0-a0d4-7e8456c1a201">Numerical sorting is different from alphabetical sorting because alphabetical sorting compares letter-by-letter. For example, if we sorted numbers alphabetically, then 10 would come before 2 because the first digit "1" is before "2".</p><pre id="e4876df9-d390-4c6e-b0a8-c3201a7e43fa"><code>// Alphabetical Sort

        <p id="934e9af4-eb81-43ab-8dd1-9d973c87eb93">A simple way to represent numbers in a way that can be sorted alphabetically is to put zeros at the beginning of the number.

        <p id="82017443-040f-4acf-9810-23cd870f9c5e">Representing dates this way is convenient because it doesn't require domain knowledge to understand how to sort them. There are an infinite number of things that can be sorted arbitrarily: a deck of cards, the status of a project, your rock collection—they are all just different types of things.</p>
        <p id="7ddb731a-5ae6-4745-8134-9dc166ec26f4">In general, lexicographical encodings are important because they allow databases to store arbitrary information in the correct order without needing additional knowledge about the type of information that is being sorted.</p>

To explore this analogy further, let's imagine that you are in charge of administering a police department where you keep track of a variety of information about every police officer in your region — name, badge number, address, and precinct, among other details.</p>
        
        <p id="60068181-62be-45e4-979e-b7a04b4d0ed9">As the administrator of this information, you're responsible for making sure that everything is up to date and easily accessible.</p>
        
        <p id="244c9ed1-6e90-4a3b-a370-59fa67d0cd5f">To keep things simple, you start by keeping all officer information in a filing cabinet sorted by badge number. This makes it easy to retrieve information about any officer based on their badge number, for example when an officer gets promoted or moves to a new address.</p>

        <p id="47066dd1-5373-4fac-8a18-0a29a5703390">One day, the police chief asks you for the address of every officer in the 60th precinct.</p>
        <p id="46c18841-1de6-4cd9-a084-cb39b033b939">With all of this information in a single filing cabinet sorted by badge number, this is a painful request because you have to scan through every file and check if each officer is in the 60th precinct.</p>
        <p id="9fb77909-54eb-4ecb-9059-10642f19e8f1">Maybe this is just a one-time request so you can labor over it and be done with it, but the police chief says that every month he wants to mail a bonus check to every officer in the precinct with the most arrests. If you're going to have to do this every month, maybe it's worthwhile to make this job a bit faster.</p>
        
        <p id="da5b845b-2a98-48f0-a688-857dd844a990">To solve this problem, you create another filing cabinet where you sort all officers by precinct.

Now when the chief asks you to get the address of every officer in a precinct, you can use this new filing cabinet to quickly retrieve …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>DarkMarket, the world's largest illegal marketplace on the dark web, has been taken offline in an international operation involving Germany, Australia, Denmark, Moldova, Ukraine, the United Kingdom (the National Crime Agency), and the USA (DEA, FBI, and IRS). Europol supported the takedown with specialist operational analysis and coordinated the cross-border collaborative effort of the countries involved.</p>
<h3>DarkMarket in figures:</h3>
<ul><li>almost <strong>500 000 users</strong>;</li>
<li>more than <strong>2 400 sellers</strong>;&nbsp;</li>
<li>over <strong>320 000 transactions</strong>;</li>
<li>more than <strong>4 650 bitcoin</strong> and <strong>12 800 monero transferred</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>At the current rate, this corresponds to a sum of more than <strong>€140 million</strong>. The vendors on the marketplace mainly traded all kinds of drugs and sold counterfeit money, stolen or counterfeit credit card details, anonymous SIM cards and malware.</p>
<h3>Germany takes the lead</h3>
<p>The Central Criminal Investigation Department in the German city of Oldenburg arrested an Australian citizen who is the alleged operator of DarkMarket near the German-Danish border over the weekend. The investigation, which was led by the cybercrime unit of the Koblenz Public Prosecutor's Office, allowed officers to locate and close the marketplace, switch off the servers and seize the criminal infrastructure – more than 20 servers in Moldova and Ukraine supported by the German Federal Criminal Police office (BKA). The stored data will give investigators new leads to further investigate moderators, sellers, and buyers.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Europol's involvement</h3>
<ul><li>Facilitated international information exchange.</li>
<li>Provided specialist operational support.</li>
<li>Provided advanced analytics that assisted the German authorities in identifying and tracking down the alleged administrator.</li>
<li>Supported Germany in coordinating the cross-border collaborative effort involving international partners.</li>
</ul><h3>Europol's Dark Web Team</h3>
<div><p>One of Europol's initiatives is to create a coordinated law enforcement approach to tackle crime on the dark web. This involves law enforcement agencies from across and outside the EU and other relevant partners and organisations, such as Eurojust.</p><p>
&nbsp;
To achieve this goal, Europol’s <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3">European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)</a> has established a dedicated Dark Web Team to work together with EU partners and law enforcement across the globe to reduce the size of this underground illegal economy.&nbsp;</p></div>
<p>It will deliver a complete, coordinated approach:&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li>sharing information;</li>
<li>providing operational support and expertise in different crime areas;</li>
<li>developing tools, tactics and techniques to conduct dark web investigations;</li>
<li>identifying threats and targets.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>The team also aims to enhance joint technical and investigative actions, organise training and capacity-building initiatives, together with prevention and awareness-raising campaigns – a 360° strategy against criminality on the dark web.</p>
<p>A shared commitment across the law enforcement community worldwide and a coordinated approach by law enforcement agencies have once again proved their effectiveness. The scale of the operation at Europol demonstrates the global commitment to tackling the use of the dark web as a means to commit crime.&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>Headquartered in The Hague, the Netherlands, Europol supports the 27 EU Member States in their fight against terrorism, cybercrime, and other serious and organized crime forms. Europol also works with many non-EU partner states and international organisations. From its various threat assessments to its intelligence-gathering and operational activities, Europol has the tools and resources it needs to do its part in making Europe safer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>Despite your expectations I’m going to support that cheesy header with a real
talk! Fraudsters will hate you.</p>
<p>We have this site with classified ads in Ukraine, <a href="https://vsevolod.net/antifraud/olx.ua">OLX</a> and it is
completely plagued with spam and fraud. I create an ad to sell something I don’t
need anymore, and within a couple of hours I have some stupid fraud in my
inbox. What baffles me is that it’s very easy and simple to fix, and they do
nothing.</p>
<p>Back in 2006 I was involved in one of the forks of an open source project
<a href="https://www.l2jserver.com/">L2J</a> (so-called “server emulator”), which was a
re-creation of the server part of then-popular game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineage_II">Lineage
II</a> of MMORPG genre.</p>
<p>A lot of the servers were plagued with bots (official servers too). There were
two variants for the bot software — a standalone one that communicated with a
server on its own, and another one that controlled an interface of an actual
client (in-game bot).</p>
<p>In-game bot required much more resources to run (basically, a separate computer
per bot), so the majority of the problems were created by standalones, you could
easily run ten of them from a regular computer.</p>
<p>We discussed this problem in a developer chat and had an idea — maybe these
standalone bots have some differences while talking to the server? We tried to
investigate that and indeed, the order of packets was completely different
between a standalone bot and a regular game client.</p>
<p>It was straightforward to detect and reject bots on connect, but then it would
be too obvious. So we started detecting them on connect, and disconnecting and
banning after some random time online, like 2..5 minutes.</p>
<p>Of course, generally bot developers aimed at official servers and couldn’t care
less about some anti-bot defense on free emulator servers, so we didn’t spend
too much brain activity on it. Nevertheless, it was committed into the
Subversion repository with a completely unsuspicious “small fix” message (open
source!).</p>
<p>It sounds a lot like security by obscurity, as I’m writing it now. I am not an
anti-fraud expert, however, it looks like it really is — we need to detect some
suspicious activities, and then stop them in a way that doesn’t immediately tell
fraudsters about it. Why? To make “debugging” around our defense a much harder
problem.</p>
<p>For example, if we needed to do better with those bots, one way to go was to
keep track of a cumulative bot time on a player’s account in a database and ban
it some time into the future. Maybe an hour or two, maybe a day, or even a week.</p>
<p>There is also a technique called “shadow ban”, that’s sometimes used on
forums. For a shadowbanned person everything looks the same, they can view
everything and post comments, just their responses are not visible to anyone
else (except moderators), so they’re not causing a stir on a forum, and do not
launch attacks onto it from other places, because they do not perceive it as an
attack on them.</p>
<p>We could have employed something akin to a shadow ban. Stop bots from interacting
with other users from time to time. Drop their packets a lot when they’re in a
battlefield, so they and their party-members end up being killed by mobs.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s always possible to employ these delayed responses — anything
financial and we’re out of luck? I’m not familiar with that field, never worked
at a bank or a payment processor. Would be interesting to learn a bit about
that.</p>
<p>So, back to classified ads. They could raise their defenses a bit, and with a
clever shadow ban technique (mark messages as read when a recipient logs in,
etc) it would eliminate a lot of the fraudulent activity from the platform.</p>
<p>If a fraudster tries this and tries that and there is no apparent benefit and it
seems like everything works, but people just don’t fall for a scam — will they
continue to try more and more sophisticated attacks? To a certain extent, later
they’ll get bored with having no results.</p>
<p>We also need good anomaly detection mechanisms. It starts with good logging and
monitoring, and with user complaints, just like any other performance problem or
a bug. Of course, later you can start to employ different machine learning
techniques, but it shouldn’t be the first step, and you need to do it really
carefully.</p>
<p>It’s very maddening for legit users to fall prey to some stupid algorithm that
can be hard to fix. Gather more cases and re-train a model? Maybe employ
heuristics to fix some corner-cases? In any case, a model's decision should be
overridable by moderators.</p>
<p>Sometimes people will pierce through your defenses anyway, so you’ll have to
react quickly, identify new patterns, shadow ban them, etc.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be fixed by a product change. For example, if there is some
kind of bonus system, make it so users can spend bonuses only on themselves,
ship products paid with bonuses to the existing address only (that has a history
of successful deliveries from a given account), etc.</p>
<p>Removing an incentive to fraud is the best strategy.</p>
<p>After running a service for some time you’ll get a grip on how these things are
done.</p>
<p>Even Twitter seemingly managed to remove that Bitcoin “ElonMuskque
giveaways”. What took them so long I don’t understand, but if even Twitter did
it — you can do it too.</p>
<p>Just do it.</p>

  <div>
    
    

<p>Open Source Security, Inc is proud to announce its funding of a full-time and 
public development effort of a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> front-end for <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.
In this blog post, we'll detail the motivations for our involvement and the benefits the public will reap
as a result of this effort.</p>

<h2>A Security Need</h2>

<p>In July of last year, shortly after my virtual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Kza6fdkSU">presentation</a> at the Linux Security Summit 
North America entitled <a href="https://grsecurity.net/10_years_of_linux_security.pdf">"10 Years of Linux Security - A Report Card"</a>, we put out a 
<a href="https://twitter.com/spendergrsec/status/1283005179135221761">call</a> to other 
companies interested in funding a GCC front-end for Rust.

The motivation for this arose
from outreach from Nick Desaulniers of Google on <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKwvOdmuYc8rW_H4aQG4DsJzho=F+djd68fp7mzmBp3-wY--Uw@mail.gmail.com/T/">LKML</a> 
to discuss the possibility of Rust support in the Linux kernel at the upcoming Linux 
Plumbers Conference.  One obvious hurdle mentioned immediately was that the kernel is most 
commonly compiled with GCC, while Rust currently requires rustc/LLVM.  According to reports of
the resulting discussion, kernel 
developers were open to the idea of allowing the kernel to be built with GCC and the Rust 
portions with LLVM, as long as the two were ABI compatible.</p>

<p>Such discussions appeared to sidestep a more fundamental issue however: the security 
viability of a mixed assembly/C/Rust execution environment and how cohesive security 
functionality could be provided while mixing different compilers with different 
implementations/availability of said functionality.  The importance of this topic, though apparent 
on reflection, was formalized just recently in a paper by Michalis Papaevripides and Elias 
Athanasopoulos of the University of Cyprus entitled <a href="https://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy/~eliasathan/papers/tops20.pdf">"Exploiting Mixed 
Binaries"</a>.  In it, they detail how the overall security of an execution 
environment can be reduced by the introduction of code written in Rust or that of another 
language where the same binary-level security is not provided by the compiler.  An excerpt from page 3 of the paper makes the impact clear:</p>

<blockquote>
"We experimentally show that CFI can be bypassed using Rust/Go code for developing clearly 
more straight-forward exploits than current state-of-the-art CFI bypasses [57, 70]. Our 
exploits do not rely on respecting the statically computed Control-flow Graph (CFG) for 
bypassing the enforced CFI and are much simpler to implement. [ ... ]
Again, we stress here that in the absence of the safe part (Rust/Go code), the unsafe part 
cannot be trivially exploited."
</blockquote>

<p>
The same exact scenario above was one of the motivations for Microsoft to recently push for their
<a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/08/17/control-flow-guard-for-clang-llvm-and-rust/">Control Flow Guard (CFG) support</a>
in Clang and Rust (see the heading of "Rust linked with C/C++").
</p>

<p>As the source of the GCC plugin infrastructure in the Linux kernel and nearly all of the GCC plugins adapted
for inclusion in the upstream Linux kernel, we too immediately spotted the importance of this problem and set out
to ensure both those plugins as well as the security features built-in to GCC itself are able to instrument code
from all languages supported by the Linux kernel with compatible and consistent security properties.</p>

<h2>Funding Process</h2>

<p>So despite not expecting Rust code to land in the Linux kernel in the near future, we reached out to other 
companies as mentioned above to pull together funding for the GCC front-end effort.  None of the leads 
came to fruition, so we as a company decided to bootstrap the process, in the hopes that as progress in the work
is observed, others would join in.  Further, we wanted to offer funding under the same terms we would want as developers, 
across the entire spectrum: stability, salary, benefits, ownership, etc -- not token compensation or bounties 
that treat those working on free/open source software for the public as somehow <em>less</em> than 
developers of proprietary code.  To that end, we decided to fund the first year of a full-time
developer for the work ourselves.</p>

<p>If the failed experiment of the Core Infrastructure Initiative (<a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">CII</a>) taught us anything, it's that
one finds dedicated and competent developers for some work not among whoever happens to apply, but 
among those already involved in the work as a passion project.  This led us to reach out 
to <a href="https://thephilbert.io/">Philip Herron</a>, who we noticed was <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">already working</a> on a GCC front-end for Rust with involvement
of external contributors.  We were extremely pleased to hear Philip was interested in performing the work 
full-time.</p>

<p>News of our outreach eventually extended to the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/steering.html">GCC Steering 
Committee</a>, who contacted us to coordinate efforts.  They were very helpful in recommending to us <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/">Embecosm</a>, a UK-based company with deep experience and involvement in 
GCC/LLVM development, among many other areas.  Embecosm graciously offered to contribute to the effort by 
handling Philip's employment and, at no cost to us, providing project management services to help ensure the project's success.  
The location, expertise, and sharing of our vision of doing right by the developer couldn't have been a 
better match.</p>

<h2>Vendor-Neutral, Developed in the Open</h2>

<p>To make sure the project remains vendor-neutral and in the public interest, Open Source Security, Inc. will not own any of the copyright over the code developed through its funding.
All relevant GCC code for the project is GPLv3-licensed and copyright is assigned, as required for upstream GCC inclusion, to the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  The work is being performed in the open, with Philip providing public monthly status updates on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting</a>.  Reports are already available for the months of November and December.
</p>

<h2>Get Involved</h2>

<p>For more information about the "how" of this effort, Embecosm has prepared a 
blog at <a href="https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/">https://www.embecosm.com/2021/01/12/gcc-rust-how-it-can-be-achieved/</a> that we encourage 
all those interested to read.  To get involved in contributing technical work to the 
effort, Philip can be found on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/the_philbert">@the_philbert</a> or committing to the project's Github repository at <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs</a>.

<p>The device in question is a NT analog phone, based on the classic Western Electric model 500. The models are very similar with only minor differences, for example the printing of the numbers on the dial is slightly different for models from Canada. Based on the stamp marks on the bottom, I believe this phone was manufactured in 1969 and installed shortly after, which does match up with when my grandparents would have purchased their first phone.</p>
<p>On its own, this telephone would not work with any modern telecom system. The ‘pulse dial’ that it produces is not compatible with modern telephone equipment and VoIP adapters alike.</p>
<p>I can’t get a good source on this, but most telephone exchanges in urban areas haven’t accepted pulse dial signals for decades. Some areas may still accept pulse signalling depending on the age of their equipment, but in 2021 I doubt there are many left. Seeing as how Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling">DTMF</a>) signalling has been the standard for over forty years, <em>nearly all</em> VoIP equipment was manufactured without support for old devices.</p>

<p>Pulse dialing is very simple as it is derived from the mechanical rotation of the dial. As it turns from the dialed digit back to the resting position it toggles the local loop voltage to transmit the data to the FXO. In the old days, these voltage ‘ticks’ were used to rotate mechanical switches in the exchange stations to connect physical circuits needed to complete a call.</p>
<h3 id="dtmf-dialling">DTMF Dialling</h3>
<p>DTMF on the other hand is an in-band signalling method using eight different frequencies transmitted in pairs. To use the example from Wikipedia, to transmit a ‘1’ on a DTMF system it will transmit two tones, 1209Hz and 695Hz together:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>These tones are the beeps we’re used to hearing when dialing. Even my cell phone creates these tones when you type on the on-screen keypad in the ‘Phone’ app, though it’s mostly for ‘cosmetic’ reasons. Theoretically one could use these tones to dial on a rotary phone if you held the speaker of the cell phone up to the microphone of the telephone while dialling, though I couldn’t get it to reliably work.</p>
<h3 id="converting-signalling">Converting signalling</h3>
<p>So, the first piece of equipment I needed was a pulse-tone converter. Indeed, such a device does exist to convert the ‘ticks’ produced by the rotary dial to the ‘beeps’ produced by most keypad phones. I was a little squeamish about tearing apart a working antique, so I opted to buy an external dial tone converter box from <a href="https://www.oldphoneworks.com/pulse-to-tone-converters/">OldPhoneWorks</a>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It’s a very simple device which listens for the pulse tones and using tiny DSP chips converts them to DTMF tones. If your only goal was to use the old phone with a POTS landline this would be sufficient, but I want to connect this to VoIP.</p>
<h3 id="the-sip-ata-box">The SIP ATA box</h3>
<p>There are <em>heaps</em> of Analog Telephone Adapter (ATA) boxes on the market, but in the interest of keeping this project low-cost I opted to purchase a new-old-stock <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/csbpvga/pap2t/administration/guide/pap2t_user.pdf">Linksys PAP2T-NA</a> device from eBay. I wasn’t too worried about security since the device sits in the ‘enclave’ part of my home network isolated from personal devices, and won’t have any ports forwarded to it. I was initially worried that my custom <a href="https://nbailey.ca/post/linux-firewall-ids">Linux router</a> would cause issues with the UDP traffic RTP creates, but it handled it wonderfully.</p>
<p>Setup was fairly straightforward to begin with, entering my sub-account credentials and SIP proxy server. Without too much fuss the device was registered and communicating with my provider.</p>
<p>However, I did run into some strange issues after initially setting it up. First, the ring pattern was intermittent and sounded <em>strange</em>. After a couple test calls I also found that both sides of the conversation were quiet when using the vintage phone. With some fiddling, I rectified these by increasing power limits slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed ring waveform to Sinusoid</li>
<li>Changed ring voltage to 90</li>
<li>Changed FXS port power limit -3 -&gt; 5</li>
<li>Changed FXS port input &amp; output gain -3 -&gt; 0</li>
</ul>
<p>I chalk these up to the mechanical nature of the ringer and the age of the mic/speaker. After all, there’s a lot more energy involved in moving a hammer around than powering a little beeper.</p>
<h3 id="making-calls">Making calls</h3>
<p>That night, I successfully ordered a pizza using an antique phone. Dialing was laborious, but novel for somebody my age, and honestly kind of fun.</p>
<p>Monthly costs are minimal, only $0.80 for the DID number and an additional $0.005 per minute. Calls are clear and sound great, and after nearly a month of use I can say that it’s reliable and solid as a ‘landline’ replacement. Plus, it makes a great conversation piece!</p>
<p>There are certainly improvements I would could make, for example adding SRTP to add another layer of security for my calls. It would also be nice to add additional handsets to my house to build an ‘intercom’ - that is if I can find more old phones.</p>

Last week we shared <a href="http://www.bti360.com/what-ive-learned-in-45-years-in-the-software-industry/">Joel’s lessons from 45 years of making software</a>. Today we share an interview exploring Joel’s more than four decades in the software industry.</h2><hr><h3>Let’s start at the beginning. What did you study in school?</h3><p>I started as a math major at UMBC with no thought of working with computers. A chess friend pushed me to take Intro to Computer Programming, and I reluctantly enrolled.</p><p>After struggling through the first half of this poorly taught Fortran class, it clicked and I was hooked. UMBC was too small to offer a CS major at the time. I took the three computer classes they offered, and then transferred to University of Michigan.</p><p>At that time there were three big players in mainframe computing: IBM, Univac, and Burrows. Michigan was an IBM school, so I learned IBM mainframe assembler, data structures, computer theory, and operating systems. Operating systems were tough. We wrote in IBM assembler adding paging and virtual memory to a fixed memory operating system.</p><h3>What was your first job out of school? What kind of technology were you using back then?</h3><p>I started my career working for the Detroit area school districts. COBOL was the lingua franca in 1975, although PL/1 and IBM assembler were occasionally used where I worked. Everything was batch processing, key punch cards, card readers, and flat files (which were mostly on tape because disk storage was so expensive). Online systems and databases had yet to hit the mainstream.</p><p>At my first job, I mainly supported batch COBOL applications for the school districts. We used Job Control Language (JCL)—a rather confusing “language” in its own right—to direct what programs to run, what files to read and write, and where to print the reams of output. We carried these JCL decks (to print, compile, and run) in our shirt pockets and always had rubber bands around our wrists.</p><p>The term “killing trees” was not an exaggeration! Computers didn’t have monitors. A single compile could generate 10 or more printed pages of 14″x11″ green bar paper, whereupon you’d find a typo in your program, re-punch a card, stick it in the deck and run it again. If the program compiled but blew up, you’d get a single error code and reams of hexadecimal core dump to decipher as you looked for your logic error.</p><h3>How did your early experiences shape your approach to programming?</h3><p>My very first assignment was to modify a complex statistical test scoring program in PL/1. The author, a PhD in statistics, fancied himself a programming wizard as measured by . . . brevity. Seriously!</p><p>This genius used one character variable names (a, b, c, etc..) or two if absolutely necessary (aa, ab, ac). He nested loops three-deep on one line. In a word, his code was undecipherable.</p><p>As I untangled his code, I vowed to myself I would never do that to anybody. I realized that we always write for the next person who will read our code. Code should be as clear and understandable as I can make it. This was before any standards or formalized methodologies existed. Today we call this idea “clean code” and it’s baked into the culture of BTI360.</p><h3>Can you summarize the changes you’ve seen over 4+ decades in this field?</h3><p>The technical changes are too vast to adequately describe: from punch cards and a “cutting edge” 16 MB IBM mainframe to Object-Oriented Programming, big data, and the internet of things. So many tools that we take for granted, like relational databases, did not exist when I started.</p><p>Corporate culture was also very different in my early career. Cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking was rampant until the late 80s. I’d sit in smoke-filled meetings and come out wheezing, reeking of tobacco. Also, the dress was different. I was required to wear a conservative suit, tie, and leather shoes until around 2000 when business casual became popular (my employer waited until <em>after</em> IBM relaxed their dress code).</p><p><a href="http://3skoz1yr97849dum72v8p1rj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="4297" data-permalink="https://www.bti360.com/interview-looking-back-on-4-decades-in-the-software-industry/joelandles-captioned2/" data-orig-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2.jpg" data-orig-size="875,679" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="JoelAndLes-captioned2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2-400x310.jpg" data-large-file="https://www.bti360.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2.jpg" loading="lazy" src="https://3skoz1yr97849dum72v8p1rj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2.jpg" alt="" width="875" height="679" srcset="https://3skoz1yr97849dum72v8p1rj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2.jpg 875w, https://3skoz1yr97849dum72v8p1rj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2-400x310.jpg 400w, https://3skoz1yr97849dum72v8p1rj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2-768x596.jpg 768w, https://3skoz1yr97849dum72v8p1rj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/JoelAndLes-captioned2-564x438.jpg 564w" sizes="(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px"></a>Maybe more surprising is how my own perspective shifted over four decades. Initially, I was attracted to programming because of all the cool stuff you could do with technology. But as I think back on my career, I realize that my focus gradually shifted to the high-powered teams and great relationships you could build around technology.</p><h3>Tell us about your experience working with W. Edwards Deming.</h3><p>Sure, for those who don’t know, Deming was an engineer turned management consultant. He went to Japan and had an enormous impact on their manufacturing industry. Many credit him with sparking the miraculous Japanese post-war economic recovery in the 1950s.</p><p>I encountered Deming when I was working at GM. He was brought in to consult with the division I was working in. I attended meetings with Deming and somewhere I have a grainy, out-of-focus photo of us together.</p><p>Deming was ahead of his time. He had a lot of ideas that were quite provocative to American automakers in those days. Some of his best ideas for GM were around improving the systems in which their employees worked—creating an environment for success. Management was so obsessed with individual performance, that they could miss systemic factors that were holding everyone back.</p><p>Of course, Deming’s influence continues to this day. You see his ideas reflected in agile methodologies as well as in books like <em>Drive</em> by Daniel Pink.</p><h3>You worked for Ross Perot as well?</h3><p>Yes. In 1984 GM acquired Ross Perot’s software company, EDS. All of GM’s IT folks either transitioned to EDS or quit. Although Perot is best known nationally for his quirky presidential bid and debate performances, he was very effective in the contexts where I encountered him.</p><p>Perot had been the top-selling salesman at IBM. He wanted them to get into software services, and when they didn’t he founded EDS to fill the need himself. EDS grew to be a multi-billion dollar company. Perot had a folksy, charming manner. I can still picture him sitting on a table in the front of a meeting room, rather than using the podium.</p><p>Perot was known for being loyal to his people. The most famous example is when he sent a team of civilians to Iran to free two wrongfully imprisoned EDS employees who had been working in Tehran. Perot oversaw the mission personally from Turkey. It’s a wild story that was documented in a best-selling book, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Wings_of_Eagles">On Wings of Eagles</a></em>. I met one of the EDS employees who was rescued.</p><h3>What’s next for you in retirement?</h3><p>Plans?? I thought retirement was the time in my life I didn’t need to follow any plans! I certainly have a lot of interests and activities to keep me busy. I’ll continue to stay active with biking, running and swimming and do the occasional triathlon. I’ve always been intrigued by riding a unicycle. I plan to learn. I’d like also to get back into woodworking and photography.</p><p>My biggest near-term project is my retirement puppy, Cosmo, a little Havanese. I’m currently learning to be a dog owner and train a puppy. Eventually, I would like to train and certify him as a therapy dog and take him to comfort kids and the elderly in hospitals and long-term care facilities.</p><h3>Thanks so much for sharing these reflections with us, Joel. We’ll miss you around here, but we wish you the best in this next stage of your life!</h3><hr><h2>Like What You Hear?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Welcome to all our new subscribers! I write a weekly newsletter, sent out every Sunday, with curated quotes and one-line takeaways from material that I think is worth reading. Occasionally, I share my own thoughts, inspired by others’ writings, on Tuesdays. If you enjoy our newsletter, please share it with a few friends/colleagues or follow me on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ButWhatForBlog">Twitter</a>.</em></p><p><em>As always, any suggested materials for our Sunday newsletter can be sent to social@butwhatfor.com. </em></p><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shel_Silverstein">Shel Silverstein</a></strong> was an American writer, poet, cartoonist, songwriter, and playwright. He is known for his cartoons, songs, and children's books. His books have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold more than 20 million copies, and he was the recipient of two&nbsp;Grammy Awards (“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZNZt5qVgvM">A Boy Named Sue</a>” as popularized by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR5XGTpophI">Johnny Cash</a>, and a recording of his famous “<a href="https://amzn.to/35xJz6N">Where the Sidewalk Ends</a>”).</p><p>For her first Christmas, my parents got my niece Shel Silverstein’s <em>Where the Sidewalk Ends </em>(apparently expectations are high for the six-month mark). I grew up reading its collection of poems, over and over. I even - to the horror of some of my readers, I am sure - used colored pencils (because I didn’t yet appreciate the waxy beauty of crayons) to color in some of Silverstein’s famous illustrations. </p><p>The gift sent me down memory lane. Re-reading a selection of those poems from all those years ago, I was struck by just how much more there is to much of Silverstein’s writing than his characteristic style and funny words.</p><p>Take the namesake of that book - <em>Where the Sidewalk Ends</em> - for example. As a child, reading the poem brought to me images of running out into a grassy field somewhere. And that is what Silverstein is writing about. </p><p>But why didn’t I realize that the place “before the street begins” was so radiant? It is “soft and white,” burning “crimson bright,” with a mint-sweet smell in the air. What happens, once we arrive in the city, that changes nature into a place where the “smoke blows black” and the winding “dark streets” are pitted and cracked?  </p><p>Are the “asphalt flowers” supposed to be nature succumbing to industry? Or are we even talking about nature?</p><p>Maybe we are the flowers, trapped in cracks of a toiling modern life - meaning we never grow into what we were meant to be? Why is it that only the children see the “chalk-white arrows” and know they lead to “the place where the sidewalk ends,” while adults might have forgotten how to get there altogether?</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Where the Sidewalk Ends</strong></em></p><p>There is a place where the sidewalk ends<br>And before the street begins,<br>And there the grass grows soft and white,<br>And there the sun burns crimson bright,<br>And there the moon-bird rests from his flight<br>To cool in the peppermint wind.</p><p>Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black<br>And the dark street winds and bends.<br>Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow<br>We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>And watch where the chalk-white arrows go<br>To the place where the sidewalk ends.</p><p>Yes we’ll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>And we’ll go where the chalk-white arrows go,<br>For the children, they mark, and the children, they know<br>The place where the sidewalk ends.</p></blockquote><p>And what about the unhappy crocodile with a toothache? Isn’t it true that we often run through life <a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/">not listening to other’s difficulties because of our preoccupation with solely our own lives</a>, meaning others have no option but to do the same?</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>The Crocodile's Toothache</strong></em></p><p>Oh the Crocodile<br>Went to the dentist<br>And sat down in the chair,<br>And the dentist said, 'Now tell me, sir,<br>Why does it hurt and where?'<br>And the Crocodile said, 'I'll tell you the truth.<br>I have a terrible ache in my tooth.'<br>And he opened his jaws so wide, so wide,<br>That the dentist he climbed right inside,<br>And the dentist laughed, 'Oh, isn't this fun?'<br>As he pulled the teeth out, one by one.<br>And the Crocodile cried, 'You're hurting me so!<br>Please put down your pliers and let me go.'<br>But the dentist just laughed with a Ho Ho Ho,<br>And he said, 'I still have twelve to go --<br>Oops, that's the wrong one, I confess.<br>But what's one crocodile's tooth, more or less?'<br>Then suddenly the jaws went snap,<br>And the dentist was gone right off the map.<br>And where he went one could only guess...<br>To North or South or East or West...<br>He left no forwarding address.<br>But what's one dentist more or less?</p></blockquote><p>And we all need to remember to not take ourselves too seriously because creativity doesn’t come without the chance of looking at least a little bit silly.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Put Something In</strong></em></p><p>Draw a crazy picture,<br>Write a nutty poem,<br>Sing a mumble-grumble song,<br>Whistle through your comb.<br>Do a loony-goony dance<br>'Cross the kitchen floor,<br>Put something silly in the world<br>That ain't been there before.</p></blockquote><p>But then I came across one of Silverstein’s works that I had not read before - thanks to the power of Google and the <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/02/12/the-missing-piece-meets-the-big-o-shel-silverstein/">endless curiosity of Maria Popova</a>.

<p><span>L</span>ast year, as Russia faced a rising tide of coronavirus infections, Tatyana Bakalchuk stepped into the spotlight. Newly <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/02/20/wildberries-founder-becomes-russias-richest-woman-a69365">crowned</a> as the country’s richest woman, the owner of online retail giant Wildberries released <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/public/3HAf/4TwvE8ZGU">a video statement</a> promising that digital merchants would rise to the challenge of lockdown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sitting alone on a large sofa with her hands clasped firmly in her lap, Bakalchuk outlined a set of rules for pandemic-era internet trading before attacking shopping malls and stores for their irresponsible approach to safety, arguing they should instead be repurposed as collection points for online orders. “Stay at home, and we’ll take care of you and your loved ones,” pledged the founder. “We’re a great country that has more than once gotten out of the most difficult situations.”</p>



<p>Such public leadership was a departure for the poetry-writing former English teacher. In her 16 years in business, Bakalchuk typically avoided media scrutiny and claimed in an <a href="https://tass.ru/business-officials/8759963">interview last year</a> that she aspired to a “quiet life.” But as Wildberries consolidates its position as Russia’s biggest online retailer — its unmissable pink-and-purple branding can be found from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean — she has stepped out of the shadows. In recent years, Bakalchuk has, among other things, appeared at business conferences, held public meetings with ministers, and even attended celebrity events in an attempt to boost her public profile. A Wildberries spokesperson, however, declined to answer questions for this article.</p>



<p>Wildberries is comfortably ahead in the cutthroat race to become Russia’s Amazon. The company has underwritten its growth by catering to low-income consumers via offline collection points, free delivery, and rolling discounts. And the coronavirus pandemic has only strengthened its lead. With almost a million orders a day, Wildberries all but doubled its payroll last year and quadrupled the size of its supplier network to almost 80,000 firms and individuals. While real estate tycoon Elena Baturina officially reclaimed her title as Russia’s richest woman in 2020, <a href="https://www.forbes.ru/milliardery/414621-ocenka-sostoyaniya-vladelicy-wildberries-tatyany-bakalchuk-vyrosla-do-10-mlrd"><em>Forbes</em> magazine</a> has suggested that Bakalchuk’s personal fortune could be as much as $10 billion.</p>



<p>Bakalchuk has described how she set up the company a month after giving birth in 2004, while still suffering from postpartum depression. “I didn’t want to be known as just ‘someone with a child,’” she said in her first-ever video interview 14 years later. “I tried to return to what I was doing previously — I was a foreign-language tutor — but it didn’t work out because, of course, my child didn’t care about my schedule.” Instead, she invested $700 in a website that sold clothes, and a little more in online advertisements. When the first orders came in, she used her apartment as a makeshift warehouse and took public transport to deliver the packages herself. According to Bakalchuk, Wildberries has grown organically ever since.</p>



<p>This rags-to-riches origin story makes Bakalchuk highly unusual in Russia, where the state controls huge swathes of the economy, and the wealthy elite is almost entirely male. And it means Bakalchuk stands out from the country’s other billionaires, the majority of whom made their fortunes, directly or indirectly, from the extraction of mineral resources. Just like Wildberries’ name — chosen for its evocations of color and dynamism — Bakalchuk is seen as a breath of fresh air in Russia’s business world. Cultivating this persona has opened the doors of government ministers keen to cultivate homegrown business success and helped Bakalchuk win a following among members of the younger generation.</p>



<p>Despite its healthy lead in the e-commerce industry, Wildberries’ total dominance is far from guaranteed. The market in Russia is unusual because it consists almost entirely of local firms, including state-backed ventures, and is far more fragmented than its Western and Asian counterparts. Most experts believe the sector is on the brink of a turbulent period that will see the emergence of a few major players. “The market is moving toward consolidation because of rapid growth, not via mergers and acquisitions,” said Fedor Virin, co-founder of Russian e-commerce analysis firm Data Insight. Competition to come out on top is intense, pitting influential billionaires against state-owned financial behemoths.</p>

<p><strong>Wildberries has repeatedly</strong> denied ever receiving any significant outside investment, but many in the Russian e-commerce world are deeply skeptical of Bakalchuk’s “self-made” rhetoric, pointing to the company’s phenomenal growth and powerful friends as evidence. In 2019, year-on-year sales rose 88%, and analysts predict it will be over 100% in 2020, rising more than 2.5 times faster than the market as a whole. Even competitors with significant investments struggle to grow at these rates, fueling rumors of a secret investor or high-level state support. “There are concerns that a road is being cleared for Wildberries,” said retail sector analyst Aleksei Petrovsky.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company’s business tactics unquestionably play a major role in its popularity among Russia’s 95 million active internet users (the largest in Europe). Wildberries operates a huge network of over 14,700 collection centers in low-rent suburban areas that also function as mini-distribution points and provide customers with a place to try on their purchases. It provides free delivery and free returns and has historically focused on products with higher profit margins, like clothes and shoes, which, as of May 2020, accounted for over 50% of sales.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“The secret of successful online business in Russia is to be as little online as possible.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>A physical presence in towns and cities has, at least in the short term, helped Wildberries overcome the major hurdles facing other e-commerce companies in Russia: long delivery distances, scattered populations, a notoriously unreliable postal service, and a deep mistrust of upfront payment, a legacy of the turbulent transition from communism in the 1990s. </p>



<p>“The secret of successful online business in Russia is to be as little online as possible,” Dmitry Alekseev, co-owner of large electronics retailer DNS, told <em>The Bell</em> last May. “Wildberries has more offline outlets than we do.”</p>

<p>Wildberries’ success is also built in part on its 2014 decision to transition to an Amazon-style marketplace, in which suppliers are simply offered a platform to make sales. The company doesn’t have to sink its own money into products and is able to retain control of pricing, meaning it can pressure suppliers to offer big discounts. This policy has alienated some of the companies that work with Wildberries, which accuse the retail giant of forcing their hand. “If you only work with Wildberries, you can easily destroy the rest of the market for yourself,” said one supplier who requested anonymity.</p>



<p>Grabbing market share has long been the company’s overriding goal. “[They] were always compulsively drawn to growth. They sensed that if they were not developing rapidly, they would be caught, overtaken, and trampled into the ground,” recalled a former employee, who feared retaliation. Occasionally, growth was prioritized over profit. The decision to implement free deliveries, for example, initially hit the company’s bottom line.</p>



<p>As the company began to reach into households all over the country, and Bakalchuk attracted increasing interest from both the media and senior government officials, it was no longer possible to outright refuse interviews and dismiss the need for a PR department.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Around the start of 2018, Wildberries hired an external PR agency, which helped craft the tale of self-made female entrepreneurship, a narrative that Bakalchuk has since adopted as her origin story in interviews with top Russian media outlets. On the back of this carefully curated image of independence, however, the company has forged links in the heart of Moscow. One of Bakalchuk’s biggest cheerleaders is Trade and Industry Minister Denis Manturov, who has traveled with Bakalchuk on domestic business trips, announced major corporate decisions, and lobbied Wildberries’ interests abroad. And during the pandemic, Bakalchuk’s increasingly public reputation helped propel Wildberries to the top of Russia’s e-commerce sector.</p>

<p><strong>Bakalchuk’s neatly packaged</strong> origin story downplays some key details. For starters, she is not the only decision-maker at Wildberries. Vladislav Bakalchuk, her husband — a soft-spoken man who reportedly owns 1% of Wildberries — was a successful businessman in the early 2000s and received a windfall when the internet provider he’d partly owned was sold in 2007. He and bodybuilder Sergei Anufriev occupy key positions in Wildberries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anufriev played an especially intriguing role in the early days of the company, brokering a large delivery of Adidas-branded goods for Wildberries in the late-2000s, after several other buyers declined, according to the former Wildberries employee. Back then, many Russian retailers were dependent on unwanted stock from major Western brands, a sizeable portion of which was shipped into the country using false customs declarations (the Russian Central Bank estimated in 2005 that these “gray imports” constituted as much as 20% of all imports).&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the extent of Anufriev’s influence today is unclear, the heavily discounted Adidas items were the backbone of Wildberries’ catalogue during a crucial growth period for the company. Several years later, reputable Russian media outlets <a href="https://retailer.ru/asos-vstretjat-po-odezhke/">repeatedly identified</a> Anufriev as a co-owner of Wildberries. And the former …</p></div></div>

									<p>All modern computers have the ability to play high-quality digital sound, thanks to the presence of a dedicated sound card or an audio chip on the motherboard. Today’s computers produce lifelike, realistic audio, enabling us to listen to digital music collections, watch online videos and play action-packed games. However, the audio capabilities of today’s computers are the culmination of decades of development, and it took a significant contribution from the computer game industry to get us here. Without that contribution, anyone who isn’t a professional musician might still be listening to little more than beeps on his or her computer today.<br>

<p>If you had an IBM PC computer or a 100-percent compatible clone between 1981-1988, you were most likely listening to — or cutting the wires of — your computer’s internal speaker. The PC speaker was solely a rudimentary tone generator. It played one note at a time, didn’t have different instruments for composers to choose from and even lacked volume control. As a result, music played on the PC speaker tended to sound tinny and grating. Composers could get around these problems by varying the pitch of a note slightly to create vibrato and playing fast arpeggios to simulate the sound of multiple notes being played simultaneously. By playing short “blips” between notes — short low-pitched sounds in the middle of a longer, high-pitched sound, for example — it was possible to simulate percussion. However, most PC speaker music didn’t have this much effort put into it; game music from this era often sounded rather monotonous. Through a clever hack, some computer games from the late ’80s actually played 6-bit digital sound through the PC speaker. However, this technology was used in few games because it was difficult to play digital sound through the speaker without sacrificing speed. When sound cards began to drop in price, the digital sound hack became irrelevant.</p>

<p><em>Composed by Nobuyuki Aoshima, Mecano Associates, Hibiki Godai, Fumihito Kasatani and Hiromi Ohba. Developed by Game Arts and published by Sierra On-Line.</em></p>
<p>This piece from the <em>Silpheed</em>&nbsp;soundtrack&nbsp;illustrates the technique most composers used when writing music for the PC speaker; the speaker plays the main melody only, and no tricks are used to simulate rhythm or accompaniment.</p>

<p>Hearing digital samples from an IBM-compatible computer before the release of the Sound Blaster was quite a novelty. Because of space limitations — <em>Space Racer</em>&nbsp;shipped on just one 5.25-inch floppy diskette — each sample is stored on the disk only once. The song is played by triggering the samples in a specific order.</p>

<p>While PCjr and Tandy 1000 owners were treated to a wonderful three-voice opening theme when playing <em>Rendezvous With Rama</em>, the PC speaker version of the theme switches confusingly from one “instrument” to another in an attempt to create the same effect.</p>

<h2>1984: IBM PCjr and Tandy 1000</h2>
</a><p><a name="2"></a><br>
<img loading="lazy" title="IBM PCjr" src="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IBM-PCjr.gif" alt="IBM PCjr" width="250" height="212">The PCjr was released by IBM in 1984 as an attempt to provide better competition for Apple in the home computer market. The PCjr included features designed to appeal to home users, such as an infrared wireless keyboard, cartridge slots and expansion hardware that could be installed without opening the computer. More importantly, the PCjr featured enhanced graphics and a sound chip that could play three voices simultaneously rather than the one voice of the original IBM PC. IBM contacted the game company Sierra On-Line, asking them to design a game that would show off the enhanced graphics and sound of the PCjr. The result was <a title="King's Quest" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/kings-quest" target="_blank">King’s Quest</a>. The game became an enormous hit, saving Sierra from a failed investment in cartridge-based games just before the <a title="Video Game Crash of 1983" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_video_game_crash_of_1983" target="_blank">video game crash of 1983</a>&nbsp;and spawning a series that lasted 14 years.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Tandy 1000" src="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Tandy-1000.jpg" alt="Tandy 1000" width="250" height="111">Some of IBM’s design decisions for the PCjr were poor ones, and the computer ultimately failed. However, Radio Shack’s Tandy 1000 — an IBM-compatible computer with the same video and sound capabilities as the PCjr — was a big seller. IBM still set the computing standard at that point, and since the PCjr wasn’t a success, not all games took advantage of the Tandy 1000’s advanced sound capabilities. Those that did provided a significantly better audio experience on the Tandy 1000 than they did on the IBM PC.</p>
<h3>Listen to the Tandy 1000</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Silpheed Game Screenshot" src="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Silpheed-Game-Screenshot.gif" alt="Silpheed Game Screenshot" width="320" height="200"><span><strong>Silpheed (1988)</strong></span></p>
<p>Although the sound chip of the Tandy 1000 lacked an effects channel for percussion, the three-voice polyphony made it possible to construct a full piece of music with melody, harmony and bass. The Tandy 1000 version of the <em>Silpheed</em>&nbsp;soundtrack was a significant improvement over the PC speaker version.</p>

<p><audio id="audio-3009-6" preload="none" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Silpheed-Tandy-1000.mp3?_=6"><a href="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Silpheed-Tandy-1000.mp3">http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Silpheed-Tandy-1000.mp3</a></audio></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Rendezvous With Rama Game Screenshot" src="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Rendezvous-With-Rama-Game-Screenshot.gif" alt="Rendezvous With Rama Game Screenshot" width="320" height="200" srcset="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Rendezvous-With-Rama-Game-Screenshot.gif 320w, http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Rendezvous-With-Rama-Game-Screenshot-300x187.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px"><span><strong>Rendezvous With Rama (1984)</strong></span></p>
<p>The Tandy 1000 version of the introduction piece for <em>Rendezvous With Rama</em>&nbsp;conveys the full effect of what the composer intended, while the PC speaker version could only “fake” it by switching from voice to voice. Because the quality of PC game music was generally rather low in the early ’80s, hearing such a complex piece at the beginning of a game was a real treat.</p>

<p><audio id="audio-3009-7" preload="none" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Rendezvous-With-Rama-Tandy-1000.mp3?_=7"><a href="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Rendezvous-With-Rama-Tandy-1000.mp3">http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Rendezvous-With-Rama-Tandy-1000.mp3</a></audio></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Music Construction Set Game Screenshot" src="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Music-Construction-Set-Game-Screenshot.gif" alt="Music Construction Set Game Screenshot" width="320" height="200" srcset="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Music-Construction-Set-Game-Screenshot.gif 320w, http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Music-Construction-Set-Game-Screenshot-300x187.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px"><span><strong>Music Construction Set (1984)</strong></span></p>
<p>The PC speaker version of <em>Music Construction Set</em>&nbsp;was done so well that the difference between it and the Tandy 1000 version isn’t quite “night and day” as it is with some other games. However, because the Tandy 1000 could play multiple voices without tricks, the tones do sound less “fuzzy.”</p>

<p><em>Composed by Hibiki Godai. Developed by Game Arts and published by Sierra On-Line.</em></p>
<p><em>Thexder</em>, the pinnacle of PC action gaming in 1987. features an appropriately energetic soundtrack that makes use of arpeggios to suggest chord changes. If the music sounds familiar to you, it may have something to do with the fact that Hibiki Godai also contributed to the <em>Silpheed</em>&nbsp;soundtrack.</p>

<h2>1987: AdLib Music Synthesizer</h2>
</a><p><a name="3"></a><br>
<img loading="lazy" title="AdLib Music Synthesizer Card" src="http://macgateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AdLib-Music-Synthesizer-Card.jpg" alt="AdLib Music Synthesizer Card" width="250" height="205">A few different sound cards were available to purchase in 1987, but few people other than professional musicians were aware of them. Sierra On-Line became a driving force in the evolution of computer sound again, approaching AdLib and Roland about putting together bundles of their products — the AdLib Music Synthesizer card and Roland MT-32 sound module — for Sierra to market. Sierra then hired&nbsp;professional musicians such as William Goldstein (<a title="Wikipedia: Fame" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fame_(1982_TV_series)" target="_blank">Fame</a>) and Bob Siebenberg (<a title="Supertramp" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertramp" target="_blank">Supertramp</a>) to compose soundtracks supporting these devices for their upcoming games. Sierra also mailed&nbsp;<a title="A Letter From Ken Williams" href="http://queststudios.com/quest/music.html" target="_blank">letters</a> and demonstration cassettes to its customers&nbsp;to promote the AdLib and Roland MT-32, and the consumer sound card market was born.</p>
<p>Although the Roland MT-32 was a far better synthesizer, it was the AdLib Music Synthesizer card that would set the standard in PC audio for the next few years — mostly due to its lower price tag. The AdLib cost $200, making it far more affordable than the $550 MT-32 ($1,053 in 2012 dollars). The AdLib generated music with a&nbsp;Yamaha YM3812 chip, which produced sound through FM synthesis. The YM3812 was also known as the FM Operator Type-L 2 or OPL2&nbsp;chip; it could play up to nine voices simultaneously and produced tones by manipulating waveforms such as sine and half-sine waves. The sound quality was not unlike that of the inexpensive Japanese keyboards that many families had stashed under their couches in the late ’80s. The AdLib lacked the ability to produce true stereo audio or play digital sound samples of any kind. Nevertheless, it could produce rich, full sounds in the hands of skilled composers, as demonstrated by some of the samples below. Its primary shortcoming stemmed from the fact that many game music composers focused most of their efforts on high-end MIDI hardware such as the Roland MT-32 and Sound Canvas SC-55. In converting these soundtracks for the AdLib, little time was spent tweaking the music to highlight the AdLib’s strengths. Some of the best AdLib music was composed by <a title="Wikipedia: Demoscene" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene" target="_blank">demoscene</a> members and shareware game companies, …</p></div></div></article></div>

It’s amazingly well done:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBNOavRoNL0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Additionally, you can visit the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/basic-types.html">Basic Types</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/basic-operators.html">Basic Operators</a> guides on Elixir’s webpage.</p><h2 id="pipes">Pipes</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/kc/kcyxakor.pasted_image_0_(8).png" alt="Mario image that somehow ilustrates Elixir pipes" loading="lazy"></p><center><i>Hop into the pipes, and they take you weird places.</i></center><p>The pipe operator is the main operator for function composition in Elixir.</p><p>It takes the result of the expression before it and passes it as the first argument of the following expression. Pipes replace nested function calls like <code>foo(bar(baz))</code>with <code>foo |&gt; bar |&gt; baz</code> .</p><h3 id="example-of-pipes">Example of pipes</h3><p>For example, here’s a function that makes a string into an exclamation sentence.</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>exclaim</span></span>(string) <span>do</span>
  string
    |&gt; String.trim()
    |&gt; String.capitalize()
    |&gt; Kernel.&lt;&gt;(<span>"!"</span>)
<span>end</span>
</code></pre><p>Here, we take a string and pass it through various string methods. Since Elixir functions return the result of the last evaluated value, we don’t have to return anything. Data and transformations applied to it are clearly delineated.</p><p>Pipes look even more incredible when you use them to compose higher-level functions. The whole program can easily be one large pipe, consisting of smaller pipes, which consist of even smaller pipes. Pipes all the way down!</p><h2 id="higher-order-functions">Higher-order functions</h2><p>Elixir, as a functional programming language, makes heavy use of higher-order functions.</p><p>Higher-order functions take in other functions as arguments. A few examples of HOFs are map, filter, and reduce.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/na/na14enxf.pasted_image_0_(9).png" alt="Higher-order functions" loading="lazy"></p><center><i>Source: <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2018/course/TDA452/lectures/HigherOrderFunctions.html">http://www.cse.chalmers.se/</a> </i></center><p>In Elixir, most of these functions live in the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html">Enum</a> module of the standard library and operate on anything that is <em><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enumerable.html">Enumerable</a></em>: lists, maps, ranges, etc.</p><p>Using HOFs is a good substitute for loops: instead of a for-in, iterate over the elements of the list with <code>Enum.map</code>.</p><pre><code>iex(<span>1</span>)&gt; list = [<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>7</span>]
[<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>7</span>]

iex(<span>2</span>)&gt; Enum.map(list, <span>fn</span> x -&gt; x * x <span>end</span>)
[<span>1</span>, <span>9</span>, <span>25</span>, <span>49</span>]
</code></pre><p>In the function above, we provided the square function as <code>fn x -&gt; x * x end</code>. This is Elixir’s syntax for anonymous functions. There is also another way to provide functions, and that is through the <em><a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2016/08/05/understand-capture-operator-in-elixir">capture operator</a></em>.</p><pre><code>iex(<span>3</span>)&gt; Enum.map(list, &amp;(&amp;<span>1</span> * &amp;<span>1</span>))
[<span>1</span>, <span>9</span>, <span>25</span>, <span>49</span>]
</code></pre><p>The <code>&amp;</code> initiates a new anonymous function, while the <code>&amp;1</code> denotes the first argument of that function. It’s debatable whether it makes it easier to read in this case. 😅</p><h3 id="example-of-higher-order-functions">Example of higher-order functions</h3><p>Let’s say we need to read a list of lines from a file, make them into exclamation sentences, and print them out to the console.</p><p>While we could usually do that with a loop, now we need another way. You can easily do it with a map function.</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>exclaimify</span></span>(file) <span>do</span>
  file
    |&gt; File.read!()
    |&gt; String.split(<span>"\n"</span>, <span>trim:</span> <span>true</span>)
    |&gt; Enum.map(<span>fn</span> x -&gt; exclaim(x) <span>end</span>)
    |&gt; Enum.join(<span>"\n"</span>)
    |&gt; IO.puts()
<span>end</span>
</code></pre><p>Remember the capture operator we talked about? Here, you can use it to make it simpler to call <code>exclaim</code>. Just switch up the map function to <code>Enum.map(&amp;exclaim/1)</code>!</p><h2 id="pattern-matching">Pattern matching</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/rr/rr7zgnre.pasted_image_0_(10).png" alt="Elixir pattern matching meme" loading="lazy"></p><center><i>Sneakily borrowed from <a href="https://www.ludu.co/course/discover-elixir-phoenix/pattern-matching">https://www.ludu.co</a></i></center><p>Pattern matching is one of the most powerful parts of Elixir. Any kind of control flow that you write, it’s a reasonable heuristic to check whether you can’t do it with pattern matching.</p><p>Basically, pattern matching works by providing some <em>pattern</em> you expect in the data and then checking whether this pattern <em>matches</em> the data.</p><p>It all starts with the match operator, <code>=</code>. Yup. In Elixir, we don’t assign variables; we <em>match</em> them.</p><pre><code>iex(<span>1</span>)&gt; x = <span>1</span>
<span>1</span>
</code></pre><p>What happens here is that Elixir checks whether the structure of both sides is the same. If it is, unassigned variables on the left side get assigned the values from the right side. If it is not, it will skip to the next match statement (or give you MatchError if the match wasn’t exhaustive).</p><p>We can play around with it in IEx.</p><pre><code>iex(<span>2</span>)&gt; <span>1</span> = <span>1</span>
<span>1</span>

iex(<span>3</span>)&gt; <span>1</span> = <span>2</span>
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side <span>value:</span> <span>2</span>

iex(<span>5</span>)&gt; x = <span>1</span>
<span>1</span>
</code></pre><p>It starts to get much more useful when the structures are more complex, enabling you to destructure tuples, lists, and nested maps quite easily.</p><p><strong>Tuples</strong></p><pre><code>iex(<span>1</span>)&gt; {x, y} = {<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>}
{<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>}

iex(<span>2</span>)&gt; x
<span>1</span>

iex(<span>3</span>)&gt; y
<span>3</span>

iex(<span>1</span>)&gt; {x, y} = {<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>}
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side <span>value:</span> {<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>}
</code></pre><p><strong>Lists</strong></p><pre><code>iex(<span>1</span>)&gt; [head | tail] = [<span>"Many"</span>, <span>"years"</span>, <span>"later"</span>, <span>"as"</span>, <span>"he"</span>, <span>"faced"</span>, <span>"the"</span>, <span>"firing"</span>, <span>"squad"</span>]

%{<span>age:</span> <span>27</span>, <span>name:</span> <span>"Andrew"</span>}

iex(<span>2</span>)&gt; x
<span>27</span>
</code></pre><p>Elixir’s <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/case-cond-and-if.html">case statement</a> operates on pattern matching – you can use it to match values or structures.</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age</span></span>(person) <span>do</span>
  <span>case</span> person <span>do</span>
    %{<span>name:</span> <span>"Andrew"</span>, <span>age:</span> x} -&gt;
      {<span>:ok</span>, x}
    %{<span>name:</span> _, <span>age:</span> _} -&gt;
      {<span>:error</span>, <span>:not_andrew</span>}
    _ -&gt;
      {<span>:error</span>, <span>:not_person</span>}
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre><p>In the case of the code above, we can go even more idiomatic.</p><h3 id="multiple-function-clauses">Multiple function clauses</h3><p>Elixir supports pattern matching in function clauses. Therefore, instead of writing long-winded control flow statements, you can create multiple functions.</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age</span></span>(%{<span>name:</span> <span>"Andrew"</span>, <span>age:</span> x}), <span>do:</span> {<span>:ok</span>, x}
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age</span></span>(%{<span>name:</span> _, <span>age:</span> _}), <span>do:</span> {<span>:error</span>, <span>:not_andrew</span>}
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age</span></span>(_), <span>do:</span> {<span>:error</span>, <span>:not_person</span>}
</code></pre><p>Whoah! 🤯 If done correctly, this makes the code more extensible and easier to read.</p><h3 id="guards">Guards</h3><p>But there’s even more modularity incoming.</p><p>Let’s imagine we wanted to get the age only if Andrew is of legal age. We can easily accomplish this with a guard, an additional construction that augments pattern matching.</p><p>Guards consist of <code>when</code> and a boolean expression, and are added to the function clause. They support only a limited set of expressions, which you can check out in the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/guards.html">documentation</a>.</p><p>Here’s how our code would look with guards:</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age_if_legal</span></span>(%{<span>name:</span> <span>"Andrew"</span>, <span>age:</span> x}) <span>when</span> x &gt;= <span>18</span>, <span>do:</span> {<span>:ok</span>, x}
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age_if_legal</span></span>(%{<span>name:</span> <span>"Andrew"</span>, <span>age:</span> x}) <span>when</span> x &lt; <span>18</span>, <span>do:</span> {<span>:error</span>, <span>:not_legal_age</span>}
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age_if_legal</span></span>(%{<span>name:</span> _, <span>age:</span> _}), <span>do:</span> {<span>:error</span>, <span>:not_andrew</span>}
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_andrews_age_if_legal</span></span>(_), <span>do:</span> {<span>:error</span>, <span>:not_person</span>}
</code></pre><h3 id="overloading-functions">Overloading functions</h3><p>There’s this cool thing with Elixir functions where you can have functions with different argument counts, and they get counted as different functions even though they have the same name. In other words, you can overload functions via arity.</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>add</span></span>(x,y), <span>do:</span> x + y
<span><span>def</span> <span>add</span></span>(x,y,z), <span>do:</span> x + y + z 
</code></pre><p>One of these functions in Elixir-speak is actually add/2, the other is add/3.</p><p>And, by using multiple functions and pattern matching, we can do a nice trick in our Elixir code that comes up quite often.</p><p>We can define an x-argument function that will serve as the outer shell of our function. Then, we use that x-argument function to launch an x+1-argument function that will track the state as an argument, not a variable.</p><p>It’s easier if you look at it in action. Here’s a function that reverses a list.</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>reverse</span></span>(list), <span>do:</span> reverse(list, [])

<span><span>def</span> <span>reverse</span></span>([], list), <span>do:</span> 
<span><span>def</span> <span>reverse</span></span>([head | tail], reversed_list), <span>do:</span>
</code></pre><p>I have left the implementation details unfinished, and you might have a question or two about what is happening. Stay with me for a while. To fully explain it, we need to turn to recursive functions.</p><h2 id="recursive-functions">Recursive functions</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/ko/kodpjcyk.pasted_image_0_(11).png" alt="XKCD tail recursion" loading="lazy"></p><center><i>Source: <a href="https://xkcd.com/1270/">xkcd</a></i></center><p>A recursive function is simply a function that can call itself.</p><p>One of the typical examples is calculating a certain Fibonacci number, a naive implementation of which in Elixir would be:</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>fib</span></span>(0), <span>do:</span> 0
<span><span>def</span> <span>fib</span></span>(<span>1</span>), <span>do:</span> <span>1</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>fib</span></span>(n), <span>do:</span> fib(n<span>-1</span>) + fib(n<span>-2</span>)
</code></pre><p>(Take note of our use of pattern matching covered above.)</p><p>We can find two things in each sane recursive piece of code: a base case and a recursive call.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Base case.</strong> This is the point where recursion terminates. It’s the result you want to achieve, and it will not call itself.</li>
<li><strong>Recursive call.</strong> This is where the program will do most of the computation. With it, you will reduce your task to a smaller one, and it will call itself.</li>
</ul><p>Basically, you can think of the base case as <em>the simplest possible example</em> of the task you want to solve and the recursive call as <em>a way to simplify</em> any given problem. In the example given, <code>fib(0)</code> and <code>fib(1)</code> are base cases, <code>fib(n)</code> is the recursive call.</p><h3 id="looping-with-recursion">Looping with recursion</h3><p>In Elixir, we use recursion much more frequently than you would in a non-FP language since we don’t have access to things like loops. Recursion mimics imperative behavior quite well.</p><p>For example, if we need to do something a set amount of times, we can create a recursive function with a number as an argument.</p><p>Let’s say that we want to duplicate a string any given number of times.</p><pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>repeat</span></span>(string, times), <span>do:</span> repeat(string, times, <span>""</span>)

<span><span>def</span> <span>repeat</span></span>(_string, 0, acc), <span>do:</span> acc
<span><span>def</span> <span>repeat</span></span>(string, times, acc), <span>do:</span> repeat(string, times - <span>1</span>, acc &lt;&gt; string)
</code></pre><p>Instead of initializing a variable in the function, we add one more argument to the function. Then we call it again and again, each time decreasing <code>times</code> and increasing <code>acc</code>.</p><p>In the end, we have achieved the same result as instantiating two variables – <code>i</code> and <code>acc</code> – and creating a while loop that decrements <code>i</code> until it is equal to 0 and adds <code>string</code> to <code>acc</code> on each iteration.</p><p>Now, I believe you will find it easy to complete the <code>reverse</code> example in the pattern matching section; it’s rather similar to <code>repeat</code> in structure.</p><h2 id="structs">Str…</h2></div></div>

      </section>
<p>2020 was a particular year for everyone, and Progressive Web Apps are no exception. In terms of innovation in the PWA space, it was the laziest of the last five years.</p>

<p>I will try to answer the most challenging question: <em>what's the market share of PWAs</em>? The only two companies with an accurate answer are Google and Samsung from their or WebAPK minting servers. Unfortunately, they are not sharing the data with us. Samsung disclosed a number at the end of 2019, but the company didn't update it since then. You can see it in the previous article <a href="https://firt.dev/pwa-2020">Progressive Web Apps in 2020</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A WebAPK minting server operates in the cloud and generates an APK (Android Package) -or delivers a cached version- every time you install a PWA when WebAPK is enabled. For Google Chrome, that's every time the browser is used to install a PWA that passes the PWA criteria, and for Samsung, it's every time Internet Browser is used in the same situation on a Samsung device. They have the data of how many unique manifest URLs -hence PWAs- are out there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite not having that information, we can extrapolate some data from different sources, including <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/pwa">HTTP Archive 2020 Almanac</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of 2020, approximately <em>1% of websites included a Service Worker, and 2.2% had an installable Web App Manifest file</em>. Remember that some platforms -such as Safari on iOS or Chrome on Android- do not require a Service Worker to have a standalone experience after installation. We can assume that 2.2% of websites are installable, and 1% may pass the PWA criteria on Android, 71% of which offer some offline experience.</p>
<p>If we extrapolate the HTTP Archive data, the 2019 data shared from Samsung and apply the growth from HTTP Archive; the numbers will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>~120,000 domains may host at least one PWA.</li>
<li>~1,500,000 websites may be installable on mobile home screens, offering an app experience.</li>
<li>~600,000 websites may be offline-capable.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can compare this with app stores stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>~800,000 publishers on both Play Store and AppStore.</li>
<li>~2,000,000 apps in the AppStore, ~3,000,000 in Play Store.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's quite tricky to get this data accurate without real information from browsers, but it's clear that <em>PWAs are still behind native apps in the store in quantity and downloads</em>. Also, having <em>x</em> amount of websites that are ready to be installed doesn't mean users are actually installing them or even that they are aware that they are installable.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE</em> After publishing the first version of this post, the Chrome team reached me on a <a href="https://twitter.com/b1tr0t/status/1347656636991590401?s=20">Twitter thread</a> to share some of the public data they have from the WebAPK Minting server:</p>
<ul>
<li>WebAPK Installations per months: <em>10s of millions installations</em> only on Chrome for Android (compared that with around 10 billion installations per month on stores, iOS, iPadOS and Android)</li>
<li><em>Number of origins with PWAs has grown 170% in 2020</em>, outperforming the trend line for prior years. This is for domains with a minimum number of installs (so they are not just tests or internal PWAs)</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, many solutions appear these days (low-code, no-code, CMS plugins) that will start creating a significant number of new PWAs. That situation is also possible on app stores with native apps, but each app needs an individual entry in the store, and app stores may limit similar apps. On the PWA side, you can create infinite different PWAs just by creating different manifest URLs, so it's always unfair to compare.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-pwas-in-the-stores%3F">What about PWAs in the stores? <a href="#what-about-pwas-in-the-stores%3F">#</a></h3>
<p>As with the rest of the data, it's challenging to find an answer here. First, TWA-based PWA launchers are still new in the Play Store, so they don't appear in the stats. The only thing that we can measure is how many hybrids are in the Play Store -apps using the WebView, including Cordova and Capacitor apps-.</p>
<p>Using data from <a href="https://www.appbrain.com/stats">AppBrain Stats</a> we can conclude that <em>12% of apps in the Play Store (around 360,000 apps) are using the Web View</em>. However, these apps are typically on the long tail as <em>they count as 2% of the downloads</em>.</p>
<p>While some of them may be using offline HTML content in the APK or using native plugins not available in the Web Platform, many are candidates to be replaced in the future with a Trusted Web Activity APK. We don't have data on AppStore, but we can assume that at least 50% of those apps in the Play Store are also available in the AppStore with the same codebase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Check my latest course in 2021: <a href="https://firt.dev/publishing-pwa">Publishing Progressive Web Apps</a> for info and tips on how to publish a PWA to App Stores.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The data seems low, but when you look at browsing market share instead of quantity of apps, we can see that at 2021, <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/990">18% of page loads</a> have a Service Worker controlling them. It's also good to compare the platform's growth: <em>Service Workers' usage has increased 38% in the last year</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The platform is growing slowly, but it's not replacing the native world as some people were expecting a few years ago. Those of us in the Web space typically have a vision of PWAs not shared among the rest of the mobile app space. For example, Flutter had exponential growth in interest and usage last year, while PWA kept itself inside a niche.</p>

<p>Will it change during 2021? We'll see in the rest of the article.</p>
<h2 id="current-state-of-compatibility">Current State of Compatibility <a href="#current-state-of-compatibility">#</a></h2>
<p>I'm currently maintaining a full <a href="https://firt.dev/notes/pwa/">live document with PWA compatibility</a>, so I don't want to repeat myself here. Let's see a summary and what has changed in the past year.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Android</em>
<ul>
<li>Browser: Chrome (WebAPK), Samsung Internet (WebAPK on Samsung devices), Firefox, Edge, UCWeb, Opera, Baidu, Brave, Huawei</li>
<li>Play Store: Trusted Web Activities</li>
<li>Enterprise: Managed Play iframe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>iOS and iPadOS</em>
<ul>
<li>Browser: Safari</li>
<li>AppStore: WKWebView with App-Bound Domains (14+)</li>
<li>Enterprise: Mobile Configuration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Windows 10</em>
<ul>
<li>Browser: Chrome, Edge</li>
<li>Microsoft Store: EdgeHTML engine, Chromium engine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Windows 7 and 8.x</em>
<ul>
<li>Browser: Chrome, Edge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>macOS</em>
<ul>
<li>Browser: Chrome, Edge</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="compatibility-in-numbers">Compatibility in numbers <a href="#compatibility-in-numbers">#</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of 2021, from users browsing the Web (data from <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/">Statcounter</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>95.1% support Service Worker</em></li>
<li><em>85.2% can install a PWA from their browser</em></li>
<li><em>76.3% can install a PWA from the store</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This data shows an increase of 2%－4% from a year ago.</p>
<p><em>Why isn't it 100%?</em> Let's see</p>
<ul>
<li>For Service Workers support, we still have some users browsing the Web on IE/Old Edge (1%), Chrome on iOS and iPadOS before 14 (1%), Android Browser (0.5%), older Safari on mac (0.5%) and a mix of other older browsers.</li>
<li>For browser installation (Add to the Homescreen/Install), we have Safari on macOS (4%), Firefox on Desktop (3.2%), Chrome on iOS and iPadOS on all versions (1.5%), IE/Old Edge (1%), Opera for Desktop and other browsers.</li>
<li>And the difference on store installation has to do mainly with macOS 10.x (7%), Windows 7 (6%), Windows 8.x (1.6%), and Windows XP (0.5%).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compatibility-changes-during-2020">Compatibility changes during 2020 <a href="#compatibility-changes-during-2020">#</a></h3>
<p>In the past year, the changes in PWA compatibility were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Huawei Browser</li>
<li>AppStore: WKWebViews with App-Bound domains for iOS 14, iPadOS 14, and macOS 11 (Big Sur)</li>
<li>Play Store on ChromeOS: Trusted Web Activity</li>
<li>Microsoft Store: Chromium-based WebView</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="huawei-browser">Huawei Browser <a href="#huawei-browser">#</a></h4>
<p>The Huawei Browser is a Chromium-based browser that appeared in 2020 for HMS-based devices, without Google Services, such as the Huawei P40 series. That browser supports the installation of PWAs, probably because it was already written in the Chromium code but not because there was a conscious decision.</p>
<p>In fact, during 2020, Huawei launched the <a href="https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/huawei-quickApp/">Quick Apps project</a> with other Chinese vendors, a sort of web app that can be used without installation, so it seems their way to support web apps in the platform.</p>
<h4 id="app-store-and-wkwebviews">App Store and WKWebViews <a href="#app-store-and-wkwebviews">#</a></h4>
<p>I will cover WKWebViews later in the article, but for now, let's say that PWAs are officially possible on the AppStore now, thanks to a new feature known as App-Bound Domains. It's available from iOS and iPadOS 14 and macOS from Big Sur, and Apple shipped it without any official word about their usage for the App Store.</p>
<p>I'm covering more about it in my recently published course <a href="https://firt.dev/publishing-pwa">Publishing Progressive Web Apps.</a></p>
<h4 id="play-store-on-chromeos">Play Store on ChromeOS <a href="#play-store-on-chromeos">#</a></h4>
<p>From ChromeOS 86, Trusted Web Activities are supported, so PWA Launchers distributed in the Play Store can be using TWAs. BubbleWrap CLIs and PWABuilder support the creation of PWA Launcher APKs just for ChromeOS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Check my latest course in 2021: <a href="https://firt.dev/publishing-pwa">Publishing Progressive Web Apps</a> for info and tips on how to use Trusted Web Activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="microsoft-store">Microsoft Store <a href="#microsoft-store">#</a></h4>
<p>At the end of 2020, Microsoft announced <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/">WebView2</a> and support from <a href="https://medium.com/pwabuilder/bringing-chromium-edge-pwas-progressive-web-apps-to-the-microsoft-store-c0bd07914ed9">PWABuilder to create PWA launchers</a> for the Microsoft Store that can use the Chromium-based engine instead of the old EdgeHTML engine. Apart from the modern engine, there are several advantages, including sharing storages with the Edge browser installed in that device.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you change your PWA engine, you will also lose access to the UWP APIs available in previous versions. These APIs let you create, for example, Live Tiles for the Start screen.</p>
<h2 id="more-pwas-from-companies%2C-in-silent-mode">More PWAs from Companies, in silent mode <a href="#more-pwas-from-companies%2C-in-silent-mode">#</a></h2>
<p>Many companies during 2020 launched new PWAs. Progressive Web App development is becoming a default for most companies, so they make it PWA …</p></section></div>

    Posted on January 11, 2021
    
        by Troels Henriksen
    
</p>

<p>I have written several posts on <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2019-12-18-design-flaws-in-futhark.html">things that we got wrong in Futhark</a>, <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2018-12-08-why-futhark-sometimes-goes-wrong.html">why the compiler goes wrong</a>, as well as posts about <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2020-03-15-futhark-0.15.1-released.html#size-types">complicated features</a> where it is still unclear whether the feature works well enough. However, there are also some parts of Futhark’s design that I feel pretty good about! This post will discuss some of them. I will focus on very concrete details, rather than grand observations such as “bulk-parallel functional programming is a good paradigm for numerical programming”. Such doctrinal statements are more of an entire <em>thesis</em>, and require much richer and more qualified answers than just “this turned out pretty well”. Everything to follow is what I don’t <em>regret</em>, so it is necessarily subjective, but maybe other language designers will find it useful or amusing.</p>
<h2 id="short-names"><a href="#short-names" id="short-names-link" title="short-names">Short names</a></h2>
<p>Naming things is one of the two most difficult problems in computer science, and in contrast to the other two (cache invalidation and off-by-one errors), there is no tooling or theory to tell you when you pick a bad name. Matters are even graver when it comes to names that are part of public interfaces. You may well receive acclaim for fixing a subtle cache invalidation bug in old and widely used code, but do not expect similar praise if you also change the naming convention of the public API from underscores to CamelCasing along the way.</p>
<p>Futhark exposes many names, both in its command line interface and its <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/docs/prelude/">built-in libraries</a>. Many of the names have been changed over the years. When we initially fleshed out the primitive type system, I agonised over how to name the new types. Should 32-bit signed integers be <code>Int32</code> as in Haskell, or <code>i32</code> as in Rust? I worried the latter was <em>too short</em>. Yet in the end, that was the scheme we went with: <code>i8</code>/<code>i16</code>/<code>i32</code>/<code>i64</code> for the signed types, <code>u8</code>/<code>u16</code>/<code>u32</code>/<code>u64</code> for the unsigned, and <code>f32</code>/<code>f64</code> for floats.</p>
<p>Incidentally, here is a piece of advice: if you are ever agonising over some design detail that is not core to what makes your language special, and all options seem equally reasonable, just go with whatever Rust does. Odds are that whatever Rust decided was preceded by significant debate, and that whatever they picked has few gotchas. Lexical syntax is one area where this is particularly good (and easy) advice to follow.</p>
<p>But back to naming things. The terse type names turned out to work fine. In fact, I realised that <em>I have never regretted making a name too short</em>. The names I still regret tend to be those that are too imprecise or <em>too long</em> - the <code>negate</code> function in the <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code> modules should have been <code>neg</code>, for example. I am not quite sure why this is. When I code in Haskell, I have a preference for relatively verbose names for top-level definitions. In Futhark, short names just seem to fit better with the language aesthetics. Maybe that is just the nature of numerical code? I don’t know. But I definitely rely on this observation to guide future naming of things.</p>
<h2 id="file-orientation"><a href="#file-orientation" id="file-orientation-link" title="file-orientation">File orientation</a></h2>
<p>While Futhark is not designed for large programs, we still want to support multi-file programs. Code in a file <code>A</code> must be allowed to reference definitions in some other file <code>B</code>. Languages differ significantly in how they go about this. Futhark went for a particularly simple model: the declaration <code>import "foo"</code> allows access to the definitions in the file <code>foo.fut</code>, looked up relative to the importing file. That is all there is to it. If you know how a hierarchical file system works, then you know how Futhark looks up files. This is not textual inclusion as in C - each file still has to be syntactically valid on its own. We are not barbarians.</p>
<p><a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2018-06-18-designing-a-programming-language-for-the-desert.html">The philosophical background is spelled out here</a>, but the basic rationale is that <em>nobody enjoys learning about language import mechanics</em>, and in Futhark we can get away with doing something stupidly simple. Other languages, like Haskell and Java, put more effort into decoupling the notion of a “module” or “compilation unit” from that of a physical file. Even languages that reason in terms of files usually also provide support for a “search path”, where you provide the compiler with additional directories that are searched when including files.</p>
<p>The downside of this approach is that for larger programs with multiple directories of source files, a file has no unique way to be referenced (except for its absolute pathname, which is not practical), so you may need to use different relative paths in different files (e.g. <code>"../lib/foo"</code> and <code>"../../lib/foo"</code>). Another downside is that you cannot have a central repository of “system files” that are always checked (like <code>/usr/include</code> in Unix).</p>
<p>A <em>major</em> advantage of the design is that each file in a program can be processed as the “root”, without having to look for some kind of project definition file that contains necessary compiler directives such as include paths. This has allowed very lightweight zero-config tooling, such as a “go to definition” command in <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark-mode">futhark-mode</a> and showing the types of variables - something that most Emacs modes definitely do not have without additional configuration.</p>
<p>Clearly this solution wouldn’t work for all languages, but it has worked really well for Futhark. I was initially worried because this design is much more similar to <em>bad</em> languages (like shell script) than to <em>good</em> languages (like Haskell), but it hasn’t caused problems yet, and I don’t recall any Futhark programmers ever being confused about how <code>import</code> works. This is the right design for Futhark, and I don’t expect to regret it any time soon.</p>

<p><a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2017-10-10-block-comments-are-a-bad-idea.html">These remain a bad idea</a>. Emacs has <code>M-x comment-region</code> and inferior editors likely have something similar. No regrets. In fact, my experience writing more <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2019-08-31-beginning-a-collection-of-futhark-examples.html">semi-syntactic tooling</a> has only strengthened my conviction. Line comments are easy to parse in an ad-hoc way, and it is particularly nice that there is only one way of writing comments.</p>

<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>type</span> t = {foo: i32, bar: bool}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In a function definition we can bind variables <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> to the field contents as follows:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>let</span> f ({foo=a, bar=b}: t) = ...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And if we wish to bind variables with the same names as the fields, there is a shorthand syntax inspired by OCaml and Haskell:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>let</span> f ({foo, bar}: t) = ...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These languages also support an even more concise form:</p>

<p>This implicitly binds variables with the same names as the record fields. Futhark does <em>not</em> support this. The reason is a philosophy of never bringing names into scope unless those names are actually syntactically present at the binding site in some form. There are many things I enjoy about programming, but guessing where some variable comes from is not among them. I find C++’s policy of implicitly bringing class fields into scope inside method bodies to be particularly confusing.</p>
<p>My distaste for complex binding structure goes further: Futhark requires that all definitions occur <em>before</em> their first use. Originally this was just for implementation simplicity, but I have come to enjoy the restriction. It’s nice not to worry so much about the best definition order, because the compiler already ruled out most options. OCaml and SML have similar restrictions, so this is not <em>just</em> Futhark aping some 70s Pascal dialect.</p>
<p>The one exception to this explicitness principle is the <code>open</code> statement, which brings names from another module into scope. While a plain <code>open</code> is rare, it is used implicitly by <code>import</code>. There are also <em>local open</em> expressions, which allow us to write e.g. <code>M.(x*y+z)</code> with the names in module <code>M</code> in scope within the parenthesised expression. This is <em>really</em> convenient when writing advanced modularised numerical code, as the alternative is the much more clumsy <code>x M.* y M.+ z</code>. I am not sure how to reconcile this with our general principle, but maybe you just can’t be a fundamentalist all the time.</p>
<h2 id="no-dependencies"><a href="#no-dependencies" id="no-dependencies-link" title="no-dependencies">No dependencies</a></h2>
<p>Futhark is written in Haskell, and all of its code dependencies are either pure Haskell libraries or embed small amounts of C code. This means that it is quite easy to build the Futhark compiler - all you need is a standard Haskell build tool like <code>stack</code> or <code>cabal</code>, which is supported and documented on most operating systems. I do not recall anyone having trouble installing the compiler itself. Difficulties tend to be more in the direction of setting up GPU drivers on Linux (yet another of the great unsolved problems in computer science).</p>
<p>This policy is not all upside. For many years, we lugged around a home-brewed implementation of algebraic simplification because we were averse to native code dependencies. We also generate C code (compiled with the system C compiler) rather than interacting directly with LLVM the way <a href="http://www.acceleratehs.org/">Accelerate</a> does it. This means that there are some things we cannot efficiently express in our generated code. On the other hand, Accelerate’s dependency on LLVM can make it tricky to install, unless your system happens to have the right version of LLVM installed (and HPC systems and servers running <em>mature</em> versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux tend not to). <a href="https://ispc.github.io/">ISPC</a> provides compiler binaries that embed a statically linked version of LLVM - this <em>may</em> be a direction we could go in, but I suspect statically linking LLVM with a Haskell program is more tricky than linking it with C++. And frankly, I think I already spend too much time hacking on build systems and CI setups.</p>
<p>We have gone quite far with this focus on installation simplicity. For example, the <a href="https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/futhark-pkg.html">Futhark package manager</a> does not even use native code to download packages. Instead, it shells out to <code>curl</code>. This has allowed us to statically link the Futhark binary that we provide for releases, a well as not having to worry about certificate store configuration. If you can download with <code>curl</code> in the command line, then <code>futhark pkg</code> will work. And if your system requires you to configure a special proxy or whatnot, then whichever configuration files or environment variables that <code>curl</code> respects will also work for <code>futhark pkg</code>.</p>
<p>I was initially hesitant about this …</p></div></div>

    <p id="desc">Why pretrained machine learning models are often unusable and irreproducible — and
      what we can do about it.</p>
    <p id="by_who">By <a href="https://www.twitter.com/abidlabs/">Abubakar Abid</a></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      A useful approach to designing software is through <em>contracts</em>. For every function in your codebase, you
      start by writing its contract: clearly specifying what inputs are expected and valid for that function (the
      <em>precondition</em>), and what the function will do (the <em>postcondition</em>) when provided an appropriate input.
      This is often explicitly stated in the docstring of a function. Consider this example from the <strong>math</strong> module
      in Python (implemented in C):
    </p>
    

    <p>
      The contract in the docstring has two parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Precondition</strong>: input should be an integer between 2⁶² and 2⁶⁴</li>
      <li><strong>Postcondition</strong>: output is an integer within 1 of the square root of the input</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The contract is powerful because when the code is published, other developers <strong>do not need to test the function</strong> themselves, <strong>nor consider its internal implementation</strong>. They can read off the range of valid
      inputs for the function and start using it immediately. Conversely, they operate knowing that <em>if the
        precondition is not satisfied, then neither is the postcondition guaranteed</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Nowadays, <strong>pretrained machine learning models are increasingly being deployed as functions and APIs</strong>. They
      are part of companies’ internal codebases [1], released externally for use through APIs [2], and, in research,
      pretrained models are published as part of the review and reproducibility processes [3].</p>

    <p>
      A pretrained model is essentially a function: it takes in a particular input sample and makes a prediction as the
      output. And as users of these models, we need to know what data is valid to feed into the model, and which data
      can lead to unreliable predictions. <strong>It is usually infeasible to test the model ourselves with all possible
        data, and impossible to inspect the internal implementation</strong>, so if we are provided a contract with a clear
      specification of the valid input data, we can start using the model immediately and confidently. However,
      specifying “valid data” for machine learning models is much harder than it may sound. Let’s consider a few
      challenges, illustrated with examples of publicly released models, all taken from this year’s NeurIPS conference:


    </p><h3>1. When input data needs to be preprocessed in very specific ways</h3>
    <p><strong>Paper</strong>: SEVIR: A Storm Event Imagery Dataset for Deep Learning
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In this paper from MIT, the authors collect a rich dataset of satellite images of storm events recorded over time.
      Helpfully, the authors also release to the community several pretrained models on this dataset.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to use one of the pretrained <em>nowcasting</em> models (used to predict storm movement patterns over the
      next hour) by inputting satellite images from the author’s own dataset into the model, and <strong>started getting
        predictions that didn’t make any sense</strong>. Normalizing the images in different ways didn’t seem to help. I
      traced down the example jupyter notebook that the authors had provided and saw these lines of code:
    </p>

    

    <p>It turns out that <em>some</em> of the channels in the input images were supposed to be rescaled in a <em>very
        specific way</em> for the model to produce reasonable outputs. This information was not packaged in any way with
      the pretrained model, even though it is crucial for the model to work properly. In this case (and as is commonly
      the case), the model did not throw any errors even though the data was not scaled properly. It chugged along,
      making nonsensical predictions, and I was left to realize on my own that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Information related to preprocessing of the input data should be included in the documentation of pretrained
      models; otherwise, we are left to figure out for ourselves on how to prepare data for inference. <strong>But it is at
        least conceivable that these preprocessing details <em>could</em> be included in technical documentation</strong>.
      Sometimes, it’s not just preprocessing…
    </p>
    <h3>2. When input data needs to come from a specific dataset</h3>
    <p>
      Paper: Object-Centric Learning with Slot Attention
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
      As we shall see, this third example is particularly problematic, in that it is extremely difficult to specify in
      advance what kind of images the model can accept and where it fails. The authors publish a state-of-the-art
      super-resolution model that takes in a low-resolution or standard-resolution of an image, and outputs a
      higher-resolution version. Here’s an example of the released pretrained model working beautifully:</p>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/68WpY48/DAN.png">
    <p>However, let’s try the same model with a different image:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*XooM_r2OGcMOHfbNR65jcA.png">
    <p>
      How strange! I certainly was not expecting this blueish image as the output of a state-of-the-art super-resolution
      model. Certainly, this failure mode would not happen with a classical image processing algorithm for sharpening
      images. But with this machine learning model, we do not have any idea of the internal implementation, and because
      there is no contract, we do not know which images we can trust this model with!
    </p>

    <p>
      After spending hours wrangling with the model, I couldn’t figure out what images the model correctly resolves and
      which ones produce these strange blue outputs. Because the model is missing a contract, this is a significant
      waste of engineering effort: I spent a significant amount of time getting the model loaded and running locally
      only to realize that it won’t work for some of my data.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion — is there a solution?</h3>
    <p>
      We machine learning developers often assume that if we are able to get good performance on our test sets, our
      models are ready to deploy and release. <strong>We do not concern ourselves enough with how downstream users are using
        models with data that might look quite different from our training and test sets</strong>. However, this is happening
      more and more: as machine learning models are being released as APIs for general use, or are being deployed
      internally but data streams are changing over time, <strong>we can no longer assume that a model’s test performance is
        indicative of its performance in the real world</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We need to provide contracts that make it clear to users what input data are valid for our models. Otherwise,
      machine learning models will work properly until they don’t. Systems built on top of machine learning models will
      fail.
    </p>
    <p>At the same time, we’ve seen that specifying valid input data through explicit instructions is difficult. What
      can be done? I have two suggestions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>We develop better methods for determining whether a sample belongs to our model’s “valid data distribution.”
        Perhaps contracts can themselves be “contract functions,” which assess whether an input sample is valid if it is
        “similar” enough to our training distribution. Such methods for detecting in-distribution and
        out-of-distribution data are being developed [4], though there are caveats to using them in practice [5].</li>
      <li>We make it easier to test models so that model failures are identified easily and earlier in the model
        development process. This helps model creators know and communicate the preconditions of their library, and
        helps end users quickly know if a model is suitable for their use. This is the motivation behind our open-source
        <a href="https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio">gradio</a> library. In fact, the failure points identified in the
        models above were all easily done with the library.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And of course, we can pursue both solutions at the same time — we make it easier to identify model failure points,
      but also invest in developing contract functions for machine learning models going forward.

      <section>
        <p>Something really interesting happens when you consume a boatload of information: your brain begins to pick out patterns from the mass of stories in your head. This is true regardless of whether it’s books that you’re reading, or podcasts, or even just research programs that you’re executing (I know friends who — on becoming a parent — go <em>deep</em> into child development research; the same thing probably happens for them once they cross a certain threshold of information consumption.)</p><p>I read 53 books last year, most of it as an alternative to therapy for pandemic-related burnout. If a stranger were to look at my list of books, it would look like a random grab bag of topics, authors, and ideas. But when <em>I</em> look at my list, I see books falling into clusters, each cluster representing a set of questions I want answered, and in some cases have been investigating for a number of years now.</p><p>I thought I’d start 2021 with one of the questions that leapt out at me over the course of 2020, along with the books (and external sources!) that I consumed in order to investigate it.</p><h2 id="uber-how-do-you-see-into-the-future">Uber: How Do You See Into The Future?</h2><p>I read Mike Isaac’s <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44573628-super-pumped">Super Pumped</a></em> and Brad Stone’s <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29905580-the-upstarts">The Upstarts</a></em> fairly late in the year last year, shortly before the Airbnb IPO, and two years after the Uber one.</p><p>The books are ostensibly about Uber’s rise to greatness (and in <em>Super Pumped</em>, Uber’s fall from greatness). Both authors spend some time on the structural and technological changes that led to the rise of the sharing economy, but the bulk of the book is focused on the narrative arc of the main actors. I sometimes read such business biographies and struggle to find useful, generalisable things that I can learn from them — you would think that in Uber’s case, the lessons might be “winning at any cost is often not worth it” or “<a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/the-uber-dilemma/">VCs might stab you in the back if you represent too large a size of their portfolio, because this turns things into a finite game</a> (vs an infinite one)” and “you really really <em>really</em> need to get lucky if you want to take advantage of a structural shift; nobody recognised the underlying reasons for the sharing economy until <em>after</em> the fact”. As with many business biographies, the lessons are often too specific to the story to matter; you read the narrative simply to add an extra business pattern to your head.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>But that last lesson — on the recognition of structural shifts — isn’t exactly true. While nobody could say that they understood the <em>full</em> opportunity in ride-hailing, I think there’s a plausible case that Uber board member and venture capitalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gurley">Bill Gurley</a> saw more than most. I spent three books and a couple of podcast episodes looking into it last year — mostly because I was interested in the kind of thinking that allowed Gurley to bet big on Uber. In other words: what did Bill Gurley <em>see</em>? What did he focus on in the fog of uncertainty around early ride-hailing? And how did he pick the right horse?</p><p>It’s easy to forget that in the early days of ride-hailing, it wasn’t at all clear that Uber would emerge as the winner. One of the dangers of reading business history is that everything seems pre-ordained — <em>of course</em> Uber would win; <em>of course</em> they would prevail against government regulation; <em>of course</em> Kalanick was a ridiculously effective combatant in the ride-hailing wars. But for a taste of what it must’ve felt like circa 2011, <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/what-uncertainty-feels-like/">recall how the fog of uncertainty felt in the early days of the pandemic last year</a>, or even the confusion one feels about the multitude of crypto projects today.</p><p>To hear Isaac and Stone tell it, Gurley met with <em>every</em> Uber-like startup in the 2010-2011 period, long before ride-hailing was on most peoples’s radars. He eventually backed Travis Kalanick and Uber. The story isn’t that straightforward, however: before he found Kalanick, he offered $8 million to Taxi Magic at a $32 million valuation (he was turned down), and tried to get into an early Cabulous financing round (the founder, John Wolpert, told him the round was ‘full’).</p><p>How did Gurley win? One — trite — answer is that Gurley got lucky. He had been searching for taxi-related marketplace startups for many months, and found Uber only after every other competitor had turned him down. It was thus a stroke of luck that the first — and last! — deal he made in the market turned out to be the winning one.</p><p>But that trite answer obscures another fact: when it comes to marketplace startups, Gurley has had a hell of a track record. He invested in GrubHub, Nextdoor, LiveOps, OpenTable, Stitch Fix, and Zillow, amongst others. And indeed, whenever I listen to Gurley talk about marketplaces or network effects on a podcast or at an interview, his comments tend to be a <em>lot</em> more nuanced when compared to his contemporaries. You get the feeling that he’s skimming from the surface of a very deep pond.</p><p>Take, for instance, this <a href="https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/12224182/gurley-all-things-business-and-investing">interview</a> with Patrick O’Shaughnessy:</p><blockquote><strong>Gurley:</strong> And I've come up with this phrase I use internally that I made up. So one day I'll have to write a definition of it, but I call it liquidity quality. And I tell entrepreneurs, “I care way more about that than I do how broad you are. We can use venture dollars and growth playbooks to go broad if the fires burning bright. And so how do you get this liquidity quality high?” And Jeremy <em>(the Yelp founder)</em>, being at those nightclubs in San Francisco and people being super passionate and their review frequency being high, that caused the quality of the experience, even though it was in a very small area.<p>And so I very frequently run into entrepreneurs who think they need to expand to 10 cities really quickly to raise their A or their B or whatever. And I'm like, “No, if you have like incredible unit economics and growth metrics in a single city where it's obvious that your playbook's working and things are spinning and things are getting better and you're basically having network effects, that's way more interesting.”</p><p><strong>O’Shaughnessy:</strong> Are there interesting markers of whether it's liquidity quality or the health of the network itself in a contained area that you find especially interesting?</p><p><strong>Gurley:</strong> I mean, I think that's exactly what you have to look for. The reason I can't say measure A, B and C is you have to know the system that you're looking at and then define what that is. But I think every company that's trying to build a marketplace, UGC <em>(user generated content) </em>and network effect, should have some definition of what quality looks like or liquidity threshold that matters and track it like crazy.</p></blockquote><p>Gurley’s conception of ‘liquidity quality’ made me sit up. If you spend enough time sniffing for <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-mental-model-faq/">tacit mental models</a>, you would learn to recognise signs of expert pattern recognition. Gurley’s inability to articulate ‘liquidity quality’ was likely due to the <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/">tacit</a> nature of his recognition: that is, the LQ metric was different for every marketplace startup that Gurley had seen; he could — to paraphrase Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart — “know it when he saw it”. Later on in the podcast, for instance, Gurley explains:</p><blockquote><strong>Gurley:</strong> … Tinder, ironically did this with parties, not really a UGC, but kind of a UGC company in each city that they would launch in because you want to get the quality up to a certain high level. And Nextdoor, we did the craziest thing in the world. We said, "Until you get to 10 members, you can't open your neighbourhood." So intentionally restrictive because we didn't want ghost town experiences and we knew quality of the experience was a function of how many neighbours were in your system.<p>So we thought the anticipation of getting in was a better user experience than getting in and finding it poor. And so we'd encourage you to go find the other so you could unlock your neighbourhood, is almost like a game heuristic. And so every one of these you'll find there's somebody that understands that nuance and about how this is going to tip and have some type of growth playbook is what people would call it. But I find the number of entrepreneurs that are capable of successfully launching a UGC play is a very small fraction, maybe less than 1% of all entrepreneurs. And they just tend to have a nuanced feel for what it takes to make something come alive and the feature sets that matter and how much they care about quality, I keep going back to that word, but it's what makes the kind of fire burn and then makes it possible to grow into ever bigger circles.</p></blockquote><p>Think about the implication of that insight: Gurley and company restricted the growth of Nextdoor in order to optimise for ‘liquidity quality’ — that ineffable mix of user value and density; they only allowed it to spread to neighbourhoods that were <em>adjacent</em> to existing ones with high LQ. That way, when you signed up for Nextdoor, you would be able to search for reviews of local businesses and services, because it would have already been filled in by users in the adjacent neighbourhoods.</p><p>My point: Gurley appears to have thought <em>really deeply</em> about the nature of networked marketplaces, at a level above many of his peers. One reason for this might be that he started much earlier compared to everyone else:</p><blockquote><strong>Gurley:</strong> So between '93 and '96 I was working on Wall Street at Credit Suisse First Boston in the research department. And literally the first or second day fell into a friendship with Mike Mauboussin, who you've had on many times and who you know well. And Mike and I, even though he was the food analyst and I was the tech analyst, we started sharing ideas and books and whatnot and I actually don't remember which one of us, he might remember, had a book called Complexity by Mitchell Waldrop which was about the rise of the Santa Fe Institute. And in that book, Brian Arthur is one of the heroes, early professor at Santa Fe Institute and someone that had a lot of different radical ideas. And so we had read that book and I think visited Santa Fe and met Brian, but this notion of increasing returns that some company that got to a big level would find it even …</blockquote></section></div></div>

<p>On Tuesday, 15<sup>th</sup> of December, Ethiopian federal troops and Amhara militia approached the Mariam of Zion cathedral in the Tigrayan city of Aksum. It is possible that they thought that Tigrayan troops were sheltering in the church – taking advantage of the ancient right of sanctuary. According to a number of sources the church was full, with some saying that up to 1,000 people were in the building or the compound surrounding it.</p>
<p>The advancing soldiers caused consternation: a chapel in the compound is believed by Ethiopians to house the biblical Ark of the Covenant. Only a monk – appointed as its guardian – may see it. There was a huge commotion. Amhara soldiers are reported to have shouted that “the Ark belongs in Addis Ababa!” but this cannot be confirmed. Those inside the cathedral came out to try to defend the sacred object.</p>
<p>A confrontation ensued. Everyone in the compound was forced into the square outside the cathedral. As the crowd milled around, there was further shouting and the troops opened fire on the protesting crowd. As many as 750 people are reported to have been killed.</p>
<p>News of the massacre has only gradually reached the outside world. People walked over 200 kilometres to the regional capital, Mekelle, and from there the story gradually filtered out – despite the clamp-down on the media in Tigray.</p>

<p>News of the massacre follows confirmation by the Ethiopian authorities that one of the most sacred Islamic sites, the Nejashi Mosque in the town of Wukro, had been badly damaged in fighting.</p>
<p>It was <a href="https://www.omanobserver.om/the-untold-story-of-king-negash-and-the-al-nejashi-mosque/">built</a> in the 7th century by the companions of the Prophet Mohammad, some of whom are buried at the site.</p>
<p>The Ethiopian government accepts the damage took place, and promises to restore the building, which is one of the oldest mosques in the world.</p>
<p>The government say it was attacked after Tigrayan troops dug trenches around the mosque.</p>
<p>Independent journalists are being prevented from visiting the Tigray region – the site of a fierce conflict between Tigrayan fighters and Ethiopian and Eritrean troops, supported by Amhara militia.</p>

        <p>In this post, I want to briefly discuss the Hausdorff distance, its
uses, and its extensions. Prior to delving into this, we need to
understand our setting here. We are dealing with a metric space $(X,
\operatorname{d})$ and its subsets. A metric space is, in some sense,
one of the most fundamental mathematical objects that everyone is
working with, either consciously or unconsciously. It is defined as
a space, i.e. a set of points&nbsp;(or objects in general, but for the
sake of intuition, I will only refer to points), together with a distance
function $\operatorname{d}\colon X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$, the
eponymous <em>metric</em> of the space. This function must satisfy three
properties for all points $x, y, z \in X$:</p>
<ol>
<li>$\operatorname{d}(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$</li>
<li>$\operatorname{d}(x, y) = \operatorname{d}(y, x)$</li>
<li>$\operatorname{d}(x, z) \leq \operatorname{d}(x, y) + \operatorname{d}(y, z)$</li>
</ol>
<p>These properties are usually also known as the ‘identity of
indiscernibles’, ‘symmetric’, and the ‘triangle inequality’,
respectively. Property 1 just tells us that we can always distinguish
between points that are <em>not</em> the same—the metric is zero if and only
if the points are identical. Property 2 is a symmetry condition, telling
us that the order in which we evaluate the arguments of the function
does not matter. Finally, Property 3 indicates that the distance between
two points is never larger than adding a third point in-between. It is
called the <em>triangle inequality</em> because the sides of a triangle can be
seen to satisfy this. We can also reformulate it as stating that the sum
of the lengths of any two sides in a triangle must be greater than or
equal to the length of the last side.</p>
<p>The quintessential example of a metric space is the $d$-dimensional
Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ with the usual Euclidean distance between
points, i.e. $\operatorname{d}(x, y) := \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^d(x_i - y_i)^2}$.
While there are all kinds of interesting relaxations of the three
aforementioned properties, leading to things such as pseudometrics,
I want to focus on a very simple question here: given two finite
subsets $X_1, X_2 \subset X$, possibly of different sizes, can we
measure their distance from each other?</p>
<p>It turns out that we can and this is where we need the Hausdorff
distance! Before giving definitions, let us look at an example and see
how we could define such a distance ourselves. To this end, assume that
these are our two subsets $X_1$&nbsp;(in red) and $X_2$&nbsp;(in blue):</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/point_clouds.svg" alt="An example of two sets in a metric space" height="128"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p>To motivate our first definition for the Hausdorff distance, note that
if $X_1 \subset X_2$&nbsp;(or vice versa), it would be easier to
calculate the distance, because we would only have to account for the
parts that are <em>not</em> part of the subset, and we would have to measure
how far it is to every other point of the smaller subset. With this in
hand, let’s <em>pretend</em> that $X_1$ and $X_2$ can be <em>turned</em> into subsets
of each other! To this end, we define the $\epsilon$-thickening for
$\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ as the space we obtain by replacing every
point $x$ in the sample by an $\epsilon$-ball, i.e. the set of all points in
the metric space $X$ that are at most $\epsilon$ units away from $x$.
This has the effect of ‘squinting’ at a subsample. Let’s illustrate this
for the circle:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/circle_05.svg" alt="An $\epsilon$-thickening of a circle" height="128"> <figcaption>
            <p>An $\epsilon$-thickening for $\epsilon = 5$</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

</div>
<p>We can of course increase $\epsilon$ to ‘squint even more’:</p>
<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/circle_10.svg" alt="An $\epsilon$-thickening of a circle" height="128"> <figcaption>
            <p>An $\epsilon$-thickening for $\epsilon = 10$</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

</div>
<p>How do we know when to <em>stop</em>, though? Well, we can stop once <em>both</em>
$X_1$ and $X_2$ are subsets of an $\epsilon$-thickening of the
respective other space!  Using the notation $X_1^{(\epsilon)}$ for the
$\epsilon$-thickening of $X_1$&nbsp;(and analogously for $X_2$), this
leads to our first definition of the Hausdorff distance as
$\operatorname{d}_{\mathrm{H}}(X_1, X_2) := \inf \left\{ \epsilon &gt; 0 \mid X_1
\subset X_2^{(\epsilon)} \text{ and } X_2 \subset X_1^{(\epsilon)}
\right\}$.</p>
<p>Let’s briefly disentangle this! We define the distance between $X_1$ and
$X_2$ as the <em>smallest</em> $\epsilon$ that we need such that both $X_1$ and
$X_2$ are subsets of an $\epsilon$-thickening of the other space. As
a simple example, consider thickening both $X_1$ and $X_2$ with
increasing values:</p>

            <p>$\epsilon = 40$</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

</div>
<p>We can see that it takes large values of $\epsilon$ for $X_1
\subset X_2^{(\epsilon)} \text{ and } X_2 \subset X_1^{(\epsilon)}$ to
hold. Let’s take a look at an alternative definition. To this end,
assume that an adversary can place you on one point of one of the sets.
Your goal is to travel as quickly as possible to the <em>other</em> set. The
Hausdorff distance is now the <em>longest</em> distance the adversary
can force you to travel. We can formulate this as follows:</p>
<p>$$d_{\mathrm{H}}(X_1, X_2) := \max\left\{\sup_{x_1 \in X_1} \inf_{x_2 \in X_2} d(x_1, x_2), \sup_{x_2 \in X_2} \inf_{x_1 \in X_1} d(x_1,x_2)\right\}$$</p>
<p>Note the inherent symmetry of the two terms in the distance here. The
first one calculates the distance from the perspective of $X_1$, looking
for the point $x_1 \in X_1$ that <em>maximises</em> the <em>minimum</em> distance to
$X_2$. The second term works analogously.</p>
<p>The two definitions yield the same distance.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This is intuitive
to see when you consider that if we follow the first definition, we end
up with a value for $\epsilon$ that is precisely the worst-case bound
for the distance one needs to travel to go from set to the other set. On
the other hand, following the second definition, we can construct the
$\epsilon$-thickening and it will be guaranteed—thanks to the
symmetry condition—that there is no point in either one of the sets to
lie outside the thickened space.</p>
<p>This covers the case for subsets from the <em>same</em> metric space $X$. But
what can we do if we have two <em>different</em> compact<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> metric spaces $X$ and $Y$&nbsp;(or subsets
thereof), each one with their own metric? To solve this case, we will
use a trick and use an intermediate space. This leads to the
Gromov–Hausdorff distance $d_\mathrm{GH}(X, Y)$, which is defined as
the <em>infimum</em> of all Hausdorff distances $d_\mathrm{H}\left(f(X), g(Y)\right)$,
where $f\colon X \to Z$ and $g\colon Y \to Z$ are <em>isometric embeddings</em>
into a shared metric space $Z$.</p>
<p>In other words: we are looking for two functions $f$ and $g$ that leave
the distances in $X$ and $Y$ intact—hence the term <em>isometric</em>—so
that we can measure the Hausdorff distance in the shared space $Z$
instead. As you can imagine from the definition, the
Gromov–Hausdorff distance is tough to calculate because finding an
appropriate $f$ and $g$ is not easy. Nevertheless, the Gromov–Hausdorff
distance has some fascinating properties and is one of the ‘workhorses’
in geometrical data analysis. If you want to learn more, I can highly
recommend reading the paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1057432.1057436">Comparing Point Clouds</a> by <a href="https://people.math.osu.edu/memolitechera.1">Facundo
Mémoli</a> and <a href="https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/guillermo-sapiro">Guillermo Sapiro</a>.</p>
<p>Happy distance calculations, until next time!</p>

        <div>
            <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

    

    <div itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 id="prologue-getting-muted-in-a-a-video-conference">   Prologue: getting muted in a a video conference <a href="#prologue-getting-muted-in-a-a-video-conference">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>As is the trend for many since 2020, I am working remote, and as a result in a lot of video conferences.</p>

<p>One silver lining with being remote is the ability to take notes: by nature of video conference, you’re in front of the computer, so it’s a lot easier to take notes on your computer without looking like you’re not paying attention.</p>

<p>In one such meeting, I was notified how I was muted in the middle while someone else was talking: it turns out my keyboard noise was quite audible! How embarassing.</p>

<p>So thus started the quest to find the quietest keyboard possible.</p>
                <h2 id="whats-causing-the-noise-when-i-type">   What’s causing the noise when I type? <a href="#whats-causing-the-noise-when-i-type">#</a>   </h2>
                    

<p>For context: I use an <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">ergodox-ez</a>. I didn’t realize it, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoDoxEZ/comments/9ls494/ergodoxez_case_seems_very_loud/">loud noise with the Ergodox EZ is a common issue</a>.</p>

<p>On the ergodox-ez page, there is a lot of discussion around keyswitches (the thing that detects the key being pressed) and how much they affect noise. I chose the <a href="https://www.cherrymx.de/en/mx-original/mx-brown.html">Cherry MX Browns</a> since they are made to be silent, but still provide a tactile feel.</p>

<p>But after experimenting with different keyboards, removing some pieces, and changing my style, I’ve found that keyswitches are just one piece of the puzzle. The additional factors I found were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keycaps: the cap you put on the key switches. Once you put the keycap on, the clacking becomes louder, seemingly due to the resonation of the keys to the bottom of the switch.</li>
  <li>keyboard housing: the reverberation that occurs in the housing can be significant. This occurs while the key is being pressed, and even once it’s released.</li>
</ul>

<p>When holding a decibel meter up to where my microphone is during calls, and when typing a single key in a rhythmic fashion, I found that my ErgoDox produces noise of 62.8 decibels (dB) of loudness. My voice talking normally (and also much closer to the mic) is roughly 72 dB.</p>

<p>To be silent for practical purposes, the keyboard would have to produce below 40dB of noise: that’s roughly the loudness of a library.</p>
                <h2 id="keyboard-components-in-depth">   Keyboard components in depth <a href="#keyboard-components-in-depth">#</a>   </h2>
                    
                <h3 id="keycaps">   Keycaps <a href="#keycaps">#</a>   </h3>
                    

<p>As mentioned previously, keycaps are the cover for a key, and is often marked with the key that would be typed if pressed. A little research shows that <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=69537.0">PBT plastic dampens higher frequencies</a>. These seemed to be loud in my case.</p>
                <h3 id="o-rings">   O-rings <a href="#o-rings">#</a>   </h3>
                    

<p>If your keypresses are loud, it’s common to just add o-rings (plastic rings that wrap the stem of your keycap) rather than brand by new switches. I’ve found the use of o-rings to be hit or miss, but generally they do play a part in reducing the noise of your keypresses, at the cost of the “feel” of your keys (the press feels a little squish at the bottom due to the ring being compressed rather than hitting whatever bottom it normally does).</p>
                <h3 id="key-switches">   Key switches <a href="#key-switches">#</a>   </h3>
                    

<p>Key Switches are the mechanical components which are responsible for “actuation”, in other words registering a key press.</p>

<p>There are a few general properties that can be used to categorize switches:</p>
                <h4 id="clicky-or-silent">   Clicky or silent <a href="#clicky-or-silent">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>If the switch is clicky, then the actuation includes a purposeful “click” sound. The click is actually not necessary to register the key press.</p>
                <h4 id="tactile-or-linear">   Tactile or linear <a href="#tactile-or-linear">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>For silent switches, tactile switches include physical feedback when the key is actuated. You feel a little resistance, and once that gives way you know you’ve pressed the button.</p>

<p>With a linear switch, the resistance is the same all the way through, which doesn’t give you a way to physically determine when the press was made.</p>
                <h4 id="travel-distance">   Travel distance <a href="#travel-distance">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>The distance the switch travels between pressed and unpressed. Typically a few millimeters.</p>
                <h4 id="actuation-force">   Actuation force <a href="#actuation-force">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>The total amount of force that must be applied to actuate the switch. The key will feel harder to press if the actuation force is higher.</p>
                <h4 id="my-conclusion-on-switches">   My Conclusion on Switches <a href="#my-conclusion-on-switches">#</a>   </h4>
                    

<p>I chose a switch with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>highest possible actuation force and travel distance. I tend to hit keys quite hard, and to minimize sound I need to try to actuate the key, but not actually “bottom out” and have my switch hit the bottom.</li>
  <li>Silent and linear attributes. Silent since the whole goal is to not make sound, and I found through testing that silent tactile switches result in additional noise when you hit the tactile feedback. The linear has no such noise.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the switch brand themselves, I found that Cherry MX, Gateron, and Kailh brand switches made roughly the same amount of noise. However, the <a href="https://zealpc.net/products/healio">ZealPC Healios</a> were orders of magnitude quieter in my HotDox. I’m not sure on exactly why, but it was impressive. Combined with the fact that they were linear switches, the Healios were the winner.</p>
                <h3 id="keyboard-housing">   Keyboard housing <a href="#keyboard-housing">#</a>   </h3>
                    

<p>The keyboard housing played a big part, based on my experiments (details below).</p>

<p>Housings that had less air inside produced less noise, since there wasn’t space for reverberation and the force of the keypress was more dampened by the material the keybaord was on.</p>

<p>Based on reviews, I read that the <a href="https://www.alpacakeyboards.com/">Hot Dox</a> keyboard was very silent (acrylic case with very little empty space inside). To further reduce any chance of reverberation, I added some <a href="https://kbdfans.com/collections/keyboard-foam/products/kbdfans-module-foam">EVA foam</a> to fill the space between the PCB and the metallic cover on top.</p>

<p>There is also a material called <a href="https://www.sorbothane.com/">Sorbothane</a> that dampens things even better than foam, but I didn’t go that route because it would require hand-cutting it, and the material is hard to cut. If I tried to cut it without special equipment, I would probably end up with a rather uneven and unpleasent look.</p>

<p>I also found that the material the keyboard is on made a difference, although of a couple decibels. Typing on hard wood was louder. I read that using a keyboard / mousepad mat and putting your keyboard on top helps, so I purchased <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014CP231W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">a cheap one on Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>To verify what I read, I tried to take some measurements with the loudness of various keyboards and configurations.</p>

<p>Although I originally tried to test the various scenarios with a decibel app on my phone, I found that the sensitivity wasn’t good enough to capture even relative differences between the different configurations. So I purchased a real decibel meter.</p>

<p>To measure the volume, I hovered the decibel meter about 3cm directly above the key being pressed. I pressed with the same rhythm, setting the decibel to “max” setting to capture the loudest the keypress ever is.</p>

<p>All experiments were with PBT Keycaps.</p>

<p>I started with a keyboard that was very loud (72.9 decibels), and was able to finish with a setup that was roughly 20dB quieter! Although the real noise reduction may be lower due to the microphone being more than 3cm away from the keyboard, the relative comparison is going from a noisy restaurant (70db) to a quiet office (50db).</p>

<p>My final build is:</p>

                    Two Jewish restaurant owners in the eastern city of Strasbourg have filed a complaint against Deliveroo after at least one of its couriers refused to deliver their meals.

However, with the development of technology, the support has included more and more new functions, and its importance has grown. The COVID-19 pandemic also contributed to the development of IT support. In this article, we will figure out why IT support is important for business, why its quality directly affects the company’s profits, and what the prospects for this area are.</span></p>
<h2><span>The historical value of IT support</span></h2>
<p><span>The responsibilities of this service have grown in number steadily as technology, methodologies, and customer relationships have evolved.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, the main functions of the IT help desk include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>technical support for the company’s employees;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>support of external clients – users of the company’s products;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>maintenance of the company’s infrastructure and its applications/products;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>control over the execution of requests at the agreed service levels;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Call Center/Help Desk;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>work with the Service Desk system;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>filling the knowledge base;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>monitoring the quality of the company’s IT services;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>communication with clients, employees, contractors.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>And this is without a lot of smaller tasks that differ depending on the specifics of a company. Most of them are hidden from prying eyes like the underwater part of an iceberg.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the deepness of modern IT support, there is an opinion that this support for both employees and customers does not have an essential impact on the financial performance of the company. This point of view has been formed over decades, so no wonder that changing it is very difficult. But the world does not stand still, and changes have affected this function of the business as well.</span></p>
<p><span>It is the support service that is often the first point of contact between customers and a company, and it has great potential to take their relationship to the next level. Modern IT support specialists are no longer bearded geeks in sweaters who speak incomprehensible tech jargon.</span></p>
<p><span>Nowadays, a qualified IT support specialist is a person with a high level of sociability and empathy, as well as teamwork and problem-solving skills. Such a specialist is constantly evolving and puts the needs of the client first. And they can give the business something more than solving clients’ problems and advising them.</span></p>
<h2><span>COVID-19: a tragedy or a chance?</span></h2>
<p><span>The coronavirus pandemic directly affected the development of IT support services, just as it affected all businesses across the world. From the digital transformation era perspective, these changes present a tremendous opportunity for CEOs around the world.</span></p>
<p><span>The pandemic has greatly accelerated the global development of digital processes. Companies that managed to implement digital solutions in time have already seen practical benefits for their businesses. Those that hadn’t, realized their oversight with the beginning of the transition of the whole world to remote work. There is no doubt that the trend will not decline but, vice versa, only grow in the coming years.</span></p>
<p><span>This opens up new opportunities and forces businesses to be more flexible, including in IT processes. In addition, the massive transfer of IT teams around the world to remote work has opened the eyes of companies to the effectiveness of remote support. More and more companies are announcing their plans to work in this mode at least for the whole of 2020, and some are organizing this process on an ongoing basis.</span></p>
<p><span>The work of IT support is going to a new level and increasing the value of the outsourcing format. Outsourcing companies often have a higher level of process maturity and a larger pool of resources than internal IT teams. Moreover, outsourcing services also actively introduce new digital approaches and change their models in accordance with modern customer requirements. Their flexibility is now extremely high, and the benefits of using their services are maximized.</span></p>
<p><span>These companies operate at agreed levels of service, so the client can be confident in the quality of service they will receive and how much it will cost. Both </span><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/customer-service-support/insights/trending-topics/coronavirus-impact"><span>Gartner</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/digital-transformation/articles/delivering-customer-service-during-COVID-19.html"><span>Deloitte</span></a><span> are reporting the increased value of outsourcing services during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span>There are many examples of successful transfer of customer service to outsourcing companies, including by such well-known entities as Microsoft, Dell, Ford Motor Company, CISCO, General Electric, American Express. Cost reduction remains one of the major reasons for such transfers, but </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/operations/articles/global-outsourcing-survey.html"><span>Deloitte research shows</span></a><span> that modern companies are concentrating more on the overall value they can get from the outsourcing services instead of just cost savings.</span></p>
<h2><span>The digital future of IT support services</span></h2>
<p><span>Digital transformation is primarily perceived as the introduction of new technologies and communication channels in the work with clients. More and more companies are implementing chatbots, virtual assistants, notifications via messengers, polls via social networks, etc. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Big Data are also increasingly used to create additional customer benefits in IT services.</span></p>
<p><span>But even this is not enough to get the maximum benefits of the current period of digital transformation. Now the most important thing is to change how the operating model of IT support works with clients. All operational processes need to be improved to meet the new service requirements that are put forward by today’s customers.</span></p>
<p><span>IT support teams should reorient from their usual performance indicators to those that are more important for the business:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Net Promoter Score</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Customer Lifetime Value</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Customer Profitability.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The new benchmarks for the IT support function should be aimed at increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty by creating additional benefits for them. And IT support team leaders should reconsider processes much more often. This will ensure that the quality of their teams’ work meets the current requirements of clients.</span></p>
<p><b>Additional features of the support service that add value to your business:</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Analyzing customer needs and behaviors</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Identifying key touchpoints of customers</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Growing customers’ loyalty through a personalized experience</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Demonstrating to customers how they can get the best from the new digital solutions</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Providing fast feedback about the efficiency of new methods and technologies</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span>All this makes it obvious that there is a need for urgent changes in the operational approaches of IT support for every company that wants to achieve maximum success in working with clients. The old approaches are hopelessly outdated, and the competition is higher than ever before. At the same time, the scale of the ongoing digital changes is enormous and brings many benefits to the business.</span></p>
<p><span>Those companies that adapt to the demands of the new era faster than others will be the first to maximize their competitive advantages. And clients, for their part, will tend to work with those companies that are actively implementing digital solutions in their work for the sake of the clients’ convenience. This is a win-win situation.</span></p>
<h2><span>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span>The transformation has already affected all aspects of the business: sales, marketing, development, and so on. But the support service has one big advantage over all others: it historically has the maximum flexibility necessary to work effectively with customers. In a fast-paced world, support teams who work directly with customers on a daily basis are used to changing their approaches and tools as soon as required.</span></p>
<p><span>Since customers now more than ever dictate to companies the level of service they receive, the willingness of organizations to respond quickly to these requirements plays center stage. And here, the flexibility of customer service specialists and their developed software skills will be more useful than ever.</span></p>
<p><span>The determination to act and change is needed for one more reason. Digital transformation is not the last of the key trends affecting the business environment. It will be followed by other trends, also critical for business development. The sooner companies start implementing technological innovations, the sooner they will have the opportunity to be among the leaders in their field.</span></p>
<p><span>This mindset is now more important than ever for leaders who determine the strategy for support services for the coming months and years. Today, clients are very demanding and highly value quality service. The opportunities that have opened up for companies in the current era of digital transformation may be exactly the accelerator that many of them dream of. The only question is who is ready to change quickly for the benefit of clients and for the sake of their future – in practice, not just in words.</span></p>

When I first discovered it in 2016, I really liked how it can almost be fully customized as per the likes. Well, almost, because there was no way you could add or configure any buttons on the top side of the editor. FYI, this is possible in many popular IDEs like IntelliJ, Eclipse, Visual Studio, and even Notepad++. I was more of a mouse-guy back then so the lack of GUI buttons was hindering my so called <em>developer productivity</em>.</p><p>I decided to build an extension for this. That would add handy buttons for many common commands like save file, format (beautify) file, show opened files list, etc. To build this, I followed VSCode extension development docs and learned typescript along the way. I named it <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jerrygoyal.shortcut-menu-bar">Shortcut Menu Bar</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://gourav.io/_next/static/media/pages/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project/1.png" alt="Shortcut Menu Bar"><figcaption>Shortcut Menu Bar</figcaption></figure><p>Fast-forward to 2020, and it got over 10k+ downloads and multiple 5-star ratings. I guess I wasn't the only mouse-guy out there.<br>
<!-- -->Out of Covid boredom, I decided to put a donate button to see what happens. I explored few platforms to create donation links like buymeacoffee.com (charges 5% fee), patreon.com (more geared towards recurring donations, 5% fee), PayPal (UI sucks), Ko-Fi.com (0% fee and nice clean UI).</p><p>I made a free account on ko-fi.com, linked my PayPal account, and created a donation link. I added that link to the extension description.</p><figure><img src="https://gourav.io/_next/static/media/pages/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project/2.png" alt="Buy me a coffee"><figcaption>Buy me a coffee</figcaption></figure><p>And guess what? someone donated 5$.</p><figure><img src="https://gourav.io/_next/static/media/pages/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project/3.png" alt="donation via ko-fi.com"><figcaption>donation via ko-fi.com</figcaption></figure><p>I know I know, it's not that big amount, but somebody put an effort to make that transaction means he cared about it and found it useful.
I hope it inspires people who want to contribute and build stuff in the FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) community. It's so captivating that the whole tech industry relies (and thrives) on open source software made by people in their free time.<br>

Despite living in Switzerland, since I am Portuguese, I usually fly with <a href="https://www.flytap.com/">TAP</a> at least to go home.</p><p>When I visit TAP's website, I am presented with a website in German. This is normal. Switzerland is a country with four national languages: German, French, Italian and Romansh. The most common one is German, so it stands to reason that most websites targeted at (or from) Switzerland present themselves in German on your first visit when they see you are coming from Switzerland.</p><p>Sadly, I don't know German (yet), so every time I enter a website in German, I start looking for the language picker so I can change the language to one that I might understand. Once I do this on TAP's website, I can finally get down to business and buy my tickets and when I do, I'm happy and leave the website thinking about the beaches and the sand waiting for me.</p><p>Sadly, five minutes later, I'm not that happy anymore because I just realized that I needed to travel with a check-in luggage that I forgot to add. No worries, I go back to <a href="https://www.flytap.com/">TAP</a> to fix the issue, but I'm greeted again with a website in German?!?</p><hr><p>This situation is common: you visit a website, you change the language to one you understand. Once you get what you need, you leave. The next time you come back, the website is once again in a language you do not understand instead of the one you picked on your last visit.</p><p>Some will say that this is nothing. In fact, it is nothing. A nothing that can be fixed in a couple of clicks. A nothing without any real impact. It is true but it is a nothing that happens every day, multiple times per day.</p><blockquote><p>Every time this happens it's something small, like a drop of water... but after a while, your cup will probably be full.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.flytap.com/">TAP</a> is a single example out of hundreds, probably thousands. Go ahead, try this at <a href="https://www.comparis.ch/">comparis</a> or even <a href="https://www.migros.ch/">migros</a>. Look for other Swiss websites but don't forget to close the page after picking the language and re-opening it to check what language you will be presented with. If you read until now, you already know the result.</p><h2>We as web developers</h2><p>As a web developer, this makes me mad. Why is the user presented with a default language he does not understand, if he already chose his preference before? If you have a good reason I'd really like to know. If not, can we do better? After all, Switzerland is mostly German but not only.</p></div></div>]]>

  <p>Using events is a common way of integrating different parts of a modular system. But while the concept is easy to grasp, the implementation can be tricker.</p>

<p>Integrating subsystems is hard, and there are always trade-offs. Events are not different.</p>

<p>There are many possible ways of event handling. Choosing the wrong one for your needs can be a serious mistake.</p>

<p>This article shows you some of the choices available and trade-offs you have to consider with each of them. Some are related to Elixir itself, and some are technology-agnostic.</p>

<h2 id="1-synchronous-processing">1. Synchronous processing</h2>

<p>The simplest way to process events is to do this synchronously:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Accounts</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>sign_up</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>,</span> <span>event_handlers</span> <span>\\</span> <span>[</span><span>Mailer</span><span>,</span> <span>Notifications</span><span>])</span> <span>do</span>
    <span># You can wrap the entire function in a transaction</span>
    <span># to ensure strong consistency.</span>
    <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>save_user</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>)</span>

    <span>event</span> <span>=</span> <span>%</span><span>UserSignedUp</span><span>{</span>
      <span>user_id:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>name:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span>
      <span>email:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>email</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>for</span> <span>event_handler</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>event_handlers</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>event_handler</span><span>.</span><span>handle_event</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span>
    <span>end</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>user</span><span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Synchronous processing has multiple benefits and <strong>it should probably be the first step</strong> (especially for existing applications) unless you need the benefits of asynchronous processing.</p>

<p>If you’re running a modular monolith with a single database, you can even use a database transaction to guarantee strong consistency between the data and the event.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/synchronous.png" alt="synchronous processing"></p>

<p>That way, you can start decoupling your contexts logically (see: <a href="https://mkaszubowski.com/2019/06/28/events-and-different-kinds-of-coupling.html">Events and different kinds of coupling</a>) without dealing with the technical challenges of asynchronous code and eventual consistency.</p>

<p>The trade-off is that synchronous processing and/or a transaction means <strong><em>all or nothing</em> semantics</strong>. Either everything works correctly, or nothing is saved.</p>

<p><em>All or nothing</em> makes the code more predictable and easier to debug, but it’s not always desirable. When it’s an issue? When the customer places an order, you probably want that information saved even if there’s a temporary bug in the code handling that shipping.</p>

<p>When to consider synchronous event processing?</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you have little experience with events.</li>
  <li>If you don’t want to introduce additional technical complexity and infrastructure costs.</li>
  <li>In a monolith system, which you’d like to make more modular.</li>
  <li>As a replacement for other mechanisms in the test environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>When is synchronous processing <strong>not</strong> a good idea?</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you need to isolate failures.</li>
  <li>When quick response is crucial (and you know what you’re doing).</li>
  <li>For long-running, asynchronous, or third-party side effects. If side effects are out of your control, it might be a better idea to handle them in a proper asynchronous fashion.</li>
  <li>When side-effects can be delayed or batched in the background for better performance.</li>
  <li>When you’re communicating across different services (in other words - in a distributed system).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-process-based-pubsub">2. Process-based PubSub</h2>

<p>Since processes and message passing are basic building blocks in Elixir, we can use an in-memory PubSub mechanism (for example <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Registry.html#module-using-as-a-pubsub">Registry</a> or <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_pubsub/Phoenix.PubSub.html#direct_broadcast/5">Phoenix PubSub for a single node</a>) to broadcast events to subscribers.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/pubsub.png" alt="in-memory PubSub"></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Subscriber</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>GenServer</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>start_link</span><span>()</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>GenServer</span><span>.</span><span>start_link</span><span>(</span><span>__MODULE__</span><span>,</span> <span>name:</span> <span>__MODULE__</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>init</span><span>([])</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>PubSub</span><span>.</span><span>subscribe</span><span>(</span><span>"user_sign_ups"</span><span>,</span> <span>self</span><span>())</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>%{}}</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>handle_info</span><span>(%</span><span>UserSignedUp</span><span>{}</span> <span>=</span> <span>event</span><span>,</span> <span>state</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>:ok</span> <span>=</span> <span>Mailer</span><span>.</span><span>send_welcome_email</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:noreply</span><span>,</span> <span>state</span><span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Such in-memory PubSub offers at-most-once delivery semantics</strong>. That means that the message will either be received once or won’t be delivered at all.</p>

<p>At-most-once delivery means that if we handle side effects or events using an in-memory PubSub mechanism, <strong>the side effects are not guaranteed to be executed:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If a subscriber exits before the message is received, it won’t receive the message again.</li>
  <li>If a subscriber crashes when processing the side effect, it won’t try to process it again after restarting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This approach should only be used if losing some messages is OK</strong>. Some common examples are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In-app notifications.</li>
  <li>Transient application state (e.g. cache).</li>
  <li>Things that can be corrected by next messages or a periodic job.</li>
</ul>

<div><p>Be careful when sending in-memory messages from within a DB transaction: </p><p> 
1) The transaction can be rolled back after a message has been sent. <br>
2) It can lead to hard-to-debug errors when a subscriber receives the message and tries to read the data before a transaction has been committed.</p></div>

<h2 id="3-multi-node-process-based-pubsub">3. Multi-node, process-based PubSub</h2>

<p>Multi-node PubSub (like <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_pubsub/Phoenix.PubSub.html">Phoenix PubSub</a>) allows you to broadcast messages to subscribers on multiple nodes.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/multi-node.png" alt="multi-node in-memory PubSub"></p>

<p>Multi-node PubSub is usually useful for stateful processing when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You need to synchronize state across multiple nodes (e.g. distributed cache).</li>
  <li>You have clients with long-running connections (WebSocket, long-poll, …) - that’s why Phoenix Channels and LiveView use a multi-node Phoenix.PubSub).</li>
</ul>

<p>As with a single-node PubSub, message delivery is not guaranteed. Use this solution only if losing some messages is fine</p>

<p>With multi-node PubSub, you have to remember to make sure that the <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/distributed.html">nodes are connected to form a cluster</a>.</p>

<h2 id="4-same-database-for-events--smart-consumer-with-polling">4. Same database for events + smart consumer with polling</h2>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/polling.png" alt="polling for events"></p>

<p>If you need every event to be processed in an async environment, you need some kind of persistent storage.</p>

<p>The first and simplest option is to use a single database for data and events. Then, you can have multiple subscribers fetching the data and processing the events asynchronously.</p>

<p>Benefits of this approach include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Low operational cost - you don’t need to add any additional infrastructure.</li>
  <li>The same database for data and events means it’s easier to maintain consistency since you can save events in a transaction. There’s no chance of “orphaned” events and no risk of not saving an event when something happens.</li>
</ul>

<p>Drawbacks of this approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Harder to scale for multiple services because of the coupling to the same DB.</li>
  <li>Harder to scale if the data exceeds a single DB.</li>
  <li>Each subscriber has to implement the logic to fetch the events, keep track of which events it’d already processed, and handle deduplication of events. This can be a lot of repetitive work for a larger system.</li>
  <li>Polling for events in a loop can have higher latency.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alternative-use-listennotify">Alternative: Use Listen/Notify</h3>

<p>You can modify the following approach to limit the number of queries done by polling the DB for new events. <a href="https://blog.lelonek.me/listen-and-notify-postgresql-commands-in-elixir-187c49597851">If you use PostgreSQL, you can use Listen/Notify</a> to notify subscribers of new events. This way, you only have to ask the DB once (at startup) for the events missed by the subscriber:</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/listen-notify.png" alt="listen-notify"></p>

<h2 id="5-events-in-separate-dbmessage-queue">5. Events in separate DB/message queue</h2>

<p>Once you use a lot of events, or you have multiple services, you will probably use a separate message queue for events. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RabbitMQ</li>
  <li>Amazon SQS</li>
  <li>Google Cloud PubSub</li>
  <li>Kafka</li>
  <li>EventStore</li>
</ul>

<p>(While there are many differences between them, it’s way out of the scope of this article to describe them.)</p>

<p>The major drawback of this solution is that you can no longer rely on DB transactions to maintain consistency between your data and the events.</p>

<p>Consider the example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Accounts</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>sign_up</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>save_user</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>)</span>

    <span>event</span> <span>=</span> <span>%</span><span>UserSignedUp</span><span>{</span>
      <span>user_id:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>name:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span>
      <span>email:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>email</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>:ok</span> <span>=</span> <span>save_event</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>user</span><span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s no guarantee that the user and the event will be saved atomically.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/timeline.png" alt="timeline of function calls"></p>

<p>If anything goes wrong before those two function calls (or the second one fails), the event is gone forever.</p>

<p>One way of dealing with this is to <strong>treat events as a source of truth.</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Accounts</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>sign_up</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>event</span> <span>=</span> <span>%</span><span>UserSignedUp</span><span>{</span>
      <span>user_id:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>name:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span>
      <span>email:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>email</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>:ok</span> <span>=</span> <span>save_event</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>event</span><span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/cqrs.png" alt="cqrs"></p>

<p>You might have heard about this pattern as <strong>Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).</strong> The biggest challenge with this approach is that we’re now in the realm of <strong>eventual consistency.</strong> The user will eventually be saved in the database, but there’s some unknown delay. CQRS and eventual consistency make the code more complicated at the cost of lower operational coupling.</p>

<p>The important conclusion is that everything is a trade-off and there’s a price to pay for everything. You might lower the operational coupling by introducing a separate message queue, but the price for that is more complicated code and higher operations and infrastructure cost.</p>

<h2 id="6-the-outbox-pattern">6. The outbox pattern</h2>

<p>You can use the outbox pattern when you use events for integration and not as a source of truth, but you cannot lose any events.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/outbox.png" alt="outbox pattern"></p>

<p>The Outbox pattern relies on having an outbox table in the same database as the data. We use a DB transaction to atomically save the data (the user) and the event. A separate process reads the outbox table in the background, publishes the events to the external message queue, and deletes the events from the outbox.</p>

<p>Outbox pattern guarantees that <strong>each event will be published at least once</strong>, which means that we still have to make sure we can handle duplicated events (but this is a good practice anyway since most message queues have at-least-once delivery semantics).</p>

<h2 id="performance-warning">Performance warning</h2>

<p>It might be tempting to use asynchronous processing to make the system “faster” by doing some of the work after returning a response to the client. Unless you know what you’re doing, <strong>don’t do that.</strong></p>

<p>Doing work in the background doesn’t make it faster. It only hides the work from the client.</p>

<p>Synchronous calls serve as automatic <a href="https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/glossary#Back-Pressure">back pressure</a>. Since the clients wait for the response before making new requests, the server does only as much as it can handle. As the workload increases, so do the response times - which means that each client sends requests at a lower frequency.</p>

<p>Synchronous processing allows your system to slow down gracefully without collapsing. The system slows down, but it doesn’t crash.</p>

<p>If you do some work in the background, the clients can start sending the next requests much …</p></div></div>

Elixir is immutable and as such if you want to append a single item to a list, Elixir will create a whole new copy of the list (Elixir can't modify the last item to point at your new item - immutable we said ;-). On the opposite, prepending to a list will only create a new item that will point to the previous untouched list. That's why Elixir gives us a powerful prepend operator <code>prepended_list = [item | list]</code></li><li><strong>Elixir most common APIs hide a few jewels</strong> that I never used in 4 years of Elixir Programming. With AOC I discovered <code><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#chunk_every/4">Enum.chunk_every</a></code>, <code><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#chunk_while/4">Enum.chunk_while</a></code>, <code><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#zip/1">Enum.zip</a></code> or <code><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#unfold/2">Stream.unfold</a></code></li><li>You have all <strong><strong>Erlang magic at hand</strong></strong>. I solved some of the challenges by using raw Erlang APIs such as <code><a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/ets.html">ets</a></code>, <code><a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/digraph.html">digraph</a></code>, or the fairly new <code><a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/atomics.html">atomics</a></code> module.</li><li><strong>Immutability brings safety</strong>. Some challenges were tricky to code in some other languages because if you didn't take care of doing deep copies of your data structure you ran into an inconsistent state. In Elixir, there is no such thing as shared mutable state, so deep copy comes for free 😎</li><li><strong>Immutability is slower. </strong>The cost of safety is that any write operation in Elixir will be slower than in any other languages with mutable data structures. <code><a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/ets.html">ets</a></code> or <code><a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/atomics.html">atomics</a></code> Erlang APIs can sometimes be handy.</li></ul><h2 id="final-words"><strong><strong>Final words</strong></strong></h2><p>If you didn't know Advent Of Code before or just never tried, I hope this post will convince you to give a shot at it. AOC is not timebound and you can follow any event whenever you want at your own pace.</p><p>Oh, I forgot to mention that AOC is also a bit addictive and I may have started over from year 2015 🙊 😁 🎄</p>

<h2 id="bastille-default-templates">Bastille Default Templates</h2>
<p>Beginning with Bastille 0.8.20210101 the <code>Bastillefile</code> format is now standard
and the template system is fully native. This means that Bastille will use
default templates to apply base configuration of all new containers.</p>
<p>These default templates can also be customized or extended to meet your
specific needs.</p>
<p>In this post I will outline the Bastille template system and how it is used to
configure all new containers.</p>
<h3 id="template-overview">Template Overview</h3>
<p>Bastille templates are simple text files defining the automation needed to
configure a container. These templates can range from simple to complex. To see
a list of available templates visit <a href="https://gitlab.com/bastillebsd-templates/">BastilleBSD
Templates</a></p>
<h3 id="bastillefile">Bastillefile</h3>
<p>A <code>Bastillefile</code> is the “script” that is executed when a template is applied.
Each template will have a unique <code>Bastillefile</code>.</p>
<p>These files can also <code>INCLUDE</code> other Bastillefiles. This allows you to keep the
files relatively simple and organize logical components into separate
templates.</p>
<p>The <code>Bastillefile</code> template syntax follows a simple format of a Bastille
sub-command followed by its arguments. Inside a <code>Bastillefile</code> you do not need
to specify a TARGET. The target is defined when applying the template.</p>
<p>Given these simple requirements you can execute any Bastille sub-command in any
order by defining them <em>one per line</em> in the <code>Bastillefile</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Simple Bastillefile Example: nginx</strong></p>
<pre><code>PKG nginx
CP usr /
SYSRC nginx_enable=YES
SERVICE nginx start
RDR 443 443
</code></pre><p>This <code>Bastillefile</code> would perform the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the <code>nginx</code> binary package inside the container.</li>
<li>Recursively copy <code>usr</code> from the template directory into container / path.</li>
<li>Enable the nginx service at container startup.</li>
<li>Start the nginx service in the running container.</li>
<li>Redirect port 443 traffic from host into container.</li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming the required nginx configuration files were included in the <code>usr</code>
directory (overlay), that container is now configured, enabled, running and
accepting traffic.</p>
<p>The “UPPERCASE lowercase” format is a simple visual representation of the
sub-command (UPPERCASE) and the arguments to that sub-command (lowercase).</p>
<p>Any Bastille sub-command that targets a container can be used within a
<code>Bastillefile</code>.</p>
<h3 id="default-templates">Default Templates</h3>
<p>As of version 0.8.20210101 Bastille ships with a handful of “default”
templates. These are used to apply any default configuration to newly created
containers. These “default” templates are:</p>
<ul>
<li>base</li>
<li>empty</li>
<li>thick</li>
<li>thin</li>
<li>vnet</li>
</ul>
<p>These default templates are defined in the <code>bastille.conf</code> like so:</p>
<p><strong>bastille.conf</strong></p>
<pre><code>+## Default Templates
+bastille_template_base="default/base"      ## default: "default/base"
+bastille_template_empty="default/empty"    ## default: "default/empty"
+bastille_template_thick="default/thick"    ## default: "default/thick"
+bastille_template_thin="default/thin"      ## default: "default/thin"
+bastille_template_vnet="default/vnet"      ## default: "default/vnet"
</code></pre><p><strong>If upgrading from a previous release be sure these lines have been merged
into your bastille.conf</strong></p>
<p>These templates are included in the installation at
<code>/usr/local/share/bastille/templates/default</code>.</p>
<p>The default <code>base</code> template is applied to all new containers. This base
template is applied by way of an <code>INCLUDE</code> statement within the other
templates.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>Below is a copy of these five default templates for reference.</p>
<p><strong>default/base</strong></p>
<pre><code>ARG HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf

CMD touch /etc/rc.conf
SYSRC syslogd_flags="-ss"
SYSRC sendmail_enable="NO"
SYSRC sendmail_submit_enable="NO"
SYSRC sendmail_outbound_enable="NO"
SYSRC sendmail_msp_queue_enable="NO"
SYSRC cron_flags="-J 60"

CP "${HOST_RESOLV_CONF}" /etc/resolv.conf
</code></pre><p><strong>default/thin</strong></p>
<pre><code>ARG BASE_TEMPLATE=default/base
ARG HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf

INCLUDE ${BASE_TEMPLATE} --arg HOST_RESOLV_CONF="${HOST_RESOLV_CONF}"
</code></pre><p><strong>default/thick</strong></p>
<pre><code>ARG BASE_TEMPLATE=default/base
ARG HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf

INCLUDE ${BASE_TEMPLATE} --arg HOST_RESOLV_CONF="${HOST_RESOLV_CONF}"
</code></pre><p><strong>default/vnet</strong></p>
<pre><code>ARG BASE_TEMPLATE=default/base
ARG HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf

INCLUDE ${BASE_TEMPLATE} --arg HOST_RESOLV_CONF="${HOST_RESOLV_CONF}"

ARG EPAIR
ARG GATEWAY
ARG IFCONFIG="SYNCDHCP"

SYSRC ifconfig_${EPAIR}_name=vnet0
SYSRC ifconfig_vnet0="${IFCONFIG}"
# GATEWAY will be empty for a DHCP config. -- cwells
CMD if [ -n "${GATEWAY}" ]; then /usr/sbin/sysrc defaultrouter="${GATEWAY}"; fi
</code></pre><p><strong>default/empty</strong></p>
<pre><code></code></pre><p>As the name implies this is an empty container. No custom configuration
is defined.</p>
<h3 id="template-arg">Template ARG</h3>
<p>The keen observer will notice many of the default templates use the keyword
<code>ARG</code> to define variables. In this case:</p>
<pre><code>ARG BASE_TEMPLATE=default/base
ARG HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf
</code></pre><p>These variables can be referenced later in the template:</p>
<pre><code>INCLUDE ${BASE_TEMPLATE} --arg HOST_RESOLV_CONF="${HOST_RESOLV_CONF}"
</code></pre><p>The above example variables would translate into:</p>
<pre><code>INCLUDE default/base --arg HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf
</code></pre><p>Additionally you can define and later <code>RENDER</code> these custom variables inside
configuration files.</p>
<p>Tip: The variables <code>${JAIL_NAME}</code> and <code>${JAIL_IP}</code> are automatically included
and can be used within container configuration files.</p>
<p><strong>Example: RENDER file</strong></p>
<pre><code>PKG nginx
CP usr /
RENDER /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
</code></pre><p><strong>Example: RENDER directory (recursive)</strong></p>
<pre><code>PKG nginx
CP usr /
RENDER /usr/local/www
...
</code></pre><h3 id="customizing-default-templates">Customizing Default Templates</h3>
<p>As you can see from the included default template examples, most configuration
is done in the <code>default/base</code> template and the other templates <code>INCLUDE</code> that
and (optionally) extend with additional changes.</p>
<p>The best way to customize the default templates is to extend them in your own
custom template. These custom templates can then be configured as the defaults
for your environment by updating the <code>bastille.conf</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note: In order to avoid having your changes clobbered with a Bastille package
update it is not recommended to edit the default template(s) themselves.</strong></p>
<p>Create a new template namespace at <code>/usr/local/bastille/templates/</code>. This
new template namespace is often a username or team/project name. Within this
namespace you can create new templates and extend the defaults.</p>
<p><strong>Example for admin: cedwards</strong></p>
<pre><code>mkdir /usr/local/bastille/templates/cedwards/base 
</code></pre><p>From here we can extend the <code>default/base</code> template with our own template.</p>
<p>Included below is an example <code>Bastillefile</code> that enables outbound sendmail.</p>
<p><strong>cedwards/base/Bastillefile</strong></p>
<pre><code>ARG HOST_RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf
INCLUDE default/base --arg HOST_RESOLV_CONF="${HOST_RESOLV_CONF}"

SYSRC sendmail_outbound_enable="YES"
SYSRC sendmail_msp_queue_enable="YES"
</code></pre><p>Update the <code>bastille.conf</code> to use <code>cedwards/base</code> as the new default:</p>
<pre><code>bastille_template_base="cedwards/base"      ## default: "default/base"
</code></pre><p>With this configuration every new container would have <code>default/base</code> applied
(due to the <code>INCLUDE</code> from <code>cedwards/base</code>) followed by the additional
configuration in the <code>cedwards/base</code> template.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Bastille templates are a simple and effective way to automate container
creation and management. Who knew automated configuration management could be
so simple?</p>
<p>Customizing a default template <code>Bastillefile</code> will allow you to change the way
every new system is configured. These defaults can be set for each main
container type and can be extended using any Bastille sub-command.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>I wrote a post at the start of last year thinking about <a href="http://www.erisian.com.au/wordpress/2020/01/07/bitcoiner-maximalism">my general priorities for Bitcoin</a> and I’m still pretty happy with that approach — certainly <em><strong>“store of value” as a foundation</strong></em> feels like it’s held up!</p>



<p>I think over the past year we’ve seen a lot of people starting to hold a Bitcoin balance, and that we’ll continue to do so — which is a win, but following last year’s logic also means we’ll want to start paying more attention to the later parts of the funnel as well: if we (for instance) double the number of people holding Bitcoin, we also want to double the number of people doing self-custody, and double the number of people transacting over lightning, eg; and ideally we’d want that in addition to whatever growth in self-custody and layer 2 transactions we’d already been aiming for if Bitcoin adoption had remained flat.</p>



<p>That said, I’m not sure I’m in a growth mindset for Bitcoin this year, rather than a consolidation one: consider the BTC price at the start of the past few years: 2016: ~$450, 2017: $1000, 2018: $13,000, 2019: $3700, 2020: $8000, 2021: $30,000. Has there been a 8x increase in security and robustness during 2016, 2017 and 2018 to match the 8x price increase from Jan 2016 to Jan 2019? Yeah, that’s probably fair. Has there been another 8x increase in security and robustness during 2019 and 2020 to match the 8x price increase there? Maybe. What if you’re thinking of a price target of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hitting-200k-by-december-2021-is-now-conservative-willy-woo">$200,000</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionusd/status/1343140448160915457">$300,000</a> sometime soon — doesn’t that require yet another 8x increase in security and robustness? Where’s that going to come from? And those 8x factors are multiplicative: if you want something like $250k by December 2021, that’s not a “three-eights-are-24” times increase in robustness over six years (2016 to 2022), it’s an “<strong>eight-cubed-is-512</strong>” times increase in robustness! And your mileage may vary, but I don’t really think Bitcoin’s already 500x more robust than it was five years ago.</p>



<p>So as excited as I am about taproot and the possibilities that opens up (PTLCs and eventually eltoo on lightning, scriptless scripts and discreet log contracts, privacy preserving proof of reserves, cheap multisig — the list might not be infinite but at least seems computationally intractable), I think I’m now even more of the view that <em><strong>it’s probably more important to work on things that reinforce the existing foundations, than neat new ideas to change them</strong></em> than I was this time last year.</p>



<p>There are already a bunch of areas where Bitcoin’s approach to security and robustness has improved technically over the past few years: we’ve got more people doing reviews (eg, via the PR review club, or getting introduced to Bitcoin via the Chaincode Residency etc), we’ve got deeper and more diverse continuous integration testing (thanks both to more integrations being enabled via github, and travis becoming unreliable enough to force looking at other approaches), fuzz testing has improved a lot and become a bit more broadly used, and I think static analysis of the codebase has improved a bit. There have been a bunch of improvements in code standards (eg using safe pointers, locking annotations, spans instead of raw pointers) too, I think it’s fair to say. I haven’t done an analysis here, just going from gut feel and recollection.</p>



<p>With a focus on robustness, to me, the areas to prioritise in the short term are probably:</p>



<ol><li>Modularisation — eg, so that we can better leverage process separation to reduce security impacts, and better use fuzz testing to catch bugs in edge cases. There’s already work to split the gui and wallet into separate processes, though while that’s merged, it’s not part of the standard build yet. Having the p2p-network-facing layer also be a separate process might be another good win. While it’s a tempting goal, I think libconsensus is still a ways off — p2p, mempool management, and validation rules are currently pretty tightly coupled — but there’s steps we can make towards that goal that will be improvements on their own, I think.</li><li>The P2P network — This is the obvious way to attack Bitcoin since by its nature everyone has access to it. There are multiple levels to this: passively monitoring the p2p network may allow you to violate users’ privacy expectations, while actively isolating users onto independent networks can break Bitcoin’s fundamental assumptions (you can’t extend the longest chain if you can’t communicate with any of the people who have the longest chain). There are also plenty of potential problems that someone could cause in between those extremes that could, eg, break assumptions that L2 systems like lightning make. Third-party (potentially centralised) alternatives as backups for the p2p network may also be valuable support here — things like Blockstream Satellite, or block relay over ham radio, or headers over DNS: those can mend splits in the p2p network that the p2p layer itself can’t automatically fix. Or efficiency improvements like erlay or block-relay-only can allow a higher degree of connectivity making attacks harder.</li><li>CI, static analysis, reproducible builds — Over the past year, travis seems like it’s gone from having the occasional annoying problem to being <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/travis-cis-new-pricing-plan-threw-wrench-my-open-source-works">pretty much unusable</a> for open source projects. CI is an important part of both development and review; having it break makes both quite a lot harder. What we’ve got at this point seems pretty good, but it’s new and not really time-tested yet, so I’d guess a year of smoothing out the rough edges is probably needed. I think there’s other “CI”-ish stuff that could be improved, like more automated IBD testing (eg, I think <a href="https://bitcoinperf.com/d/YiV16Vsik/overview?orgId=1&amp;from=now-6M&amp;to=now">bitcoinperf</a> is about 3 months out of date). Static analysis serves a similar goal to tests in a different way; and while we’ve already got a lot of low hanging fruit of this nature already integrated into CI via linters and compiler options, I suspect there’s still some useful automation that could happen here. Finally, nailing down the last mile to ensure that people are running the software the devs are testing is always valuable, and I think the nixos work is showing some promise there.</li><li>Third-party validation — We’ve had a few third-party monitoring tools arise lately — various sites monitoring feerate and mempool sizes, forkmonitor checking for stale blocks (and double-spends), or, at a stretch, optech’s reviews of wallet behaviour and segwit support. There’s probably a lot of room for more of this.</li></ol>



<p>I’d love to list formal verification at the consensus layer as a priority, but I think there’s too much yak-shaving needed first: it would probably need all the refactoring to get to libconsensus first, then would likely need that separated into its own process, which you could only then start defining a formal spec for, which in turn would give you something you could start doing formal verification against. I suspect we’ll want to be at that point within another cycle or two though.</p>



<p>I’m not concerned about mining — eventually there might be a risk that the subsidy is too small and there’s not enough fee income, but that’s not going to happen while the price doubles faster than the pre-scheduled halvings. There’s certainly centralisation risks, whether in ASIC manufacture, in hardware ownership/control, or at the pool level, but my sense of things is that’s not getting worse, and is not the biggest immediate risk. Maybe I’m wrong; if so, hopefully the people who think so are working on preventing problems from arising, rather than taking advantage of them.</p>



<p>There are other levels of robustness and security beyond just “keep the network working”, if you consider the question of “how to prevent my coins from being lost/stolen?” more broadly. The phishing attacks and potential for physical attacks resulting from the Ledger leak are an easy example of a problem of this sort, but exchange hacks/failures in general, malware swapping addresses so your funds go to an attacker instead of the intended recipient, and lost access to keys are also pretty bad. I think descriptors, miniscript and taproot multisig probably provide for a good path forward to help prevent losing access to keys; and it’s possible that progress on BIP322 (signing messages against a Bitcoin address) may provide a path to avoiding address swapping attacks.</p>



<p>Technical solutions are, in some sense, all you can hope for if you’re doing self-custody; but where a bank/custodian is involved (good) regulation might be useful too: requirements to keep customer data protected or destroyed, third-party audits to ensure the best-practices procedures you’re claiming to follow are actually being followed, etc. If custodians store funds in taproot addresses, it may be feasible to do privacy preserving (zero-knowledge) <a href="https://twitter.com/n1ckler/status/1334240709814136833">proofs of solvency</a>, eg, making it harder for fly-by-night folks to run ponzi schemes or otherwise steal their customers’ funds.</p>



<p>Obviously where possible these sorts of standards should be implemented via audited open source code rather than needing extensive implementation costs by each company. But one other thing to think about is whether regulations of this nature could be setup as industry standards (“we comply with the industry standard, competitor X doesn’t”) rather than necessarily a government regulator — for one, it certainly seems questionable whether government regulators have the background to pick good best practices for cryptocurrency systems to follow. Though perhaps it would be to have something oriented towards “consumer rights” than “industry” per se, to avoid it just being a vector for regulatory capture.</p>



<p>I think there’s been good progress on stabilising Bitcoin development — in 2015 through 2017 we were in a phase where people were seriously thinking of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/according-viabtc-team-bitcoin-core-developers-fired/">replacing</a> <a href="https://blog.plan99.net/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7">Bitcoin’s</a> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-2017-bitpay-ceo-bitcoin-fork">developers</a> — devs were opposing a quick blocksize increase, so the obvious solution was to replace them with people who weren’t opposed. If you think of Bitcoin as an experimental, payments-oriented, tech startup, that’s perhaps not …</p></div></div>

	<p><strong>FEROZ KHAN HAS</strong> spent his whole life in Dubai, and hadn’t ever considered leaving until last year. The IT professional, 37, worked for Emirates airline in aviation technology until August, when he was made redundant. He was there for 14 years.</p>
<p>Khan applied for dozens of technology and startup jobs in the weeks since, both in the UAE and around the world. He gave himself until the end of the year to find something else, or else he’s heading for Canada to do a master’s degree. He probably won’t come back.</p>
<p>“I’m fairly well networked here in the industry, but anyone I’ve asked has said they’ll have to wait until [2021] to hire,” he says. “The toughest part for me is that I was born here. This is home—I have never known anywhere else. Thirty seven years in this city and I’m now wondering if I made a huge mistake by getting too deeply attached here.”</p>
<p>Over the months, Khan has watched as friends in the industry, mostly programmers and IT professionals, have been made redundant or have moved home because their spouses have lost their jobs, or found the IT salaries aren’t what they used to be.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen people who’ve been here 40 years who say they can’t afford to live here anymore. I think they need to have a good look and see how the expat model is going to work. There are so many people leaving.”</p>
<p>As Covid-19 wreaks havoc on the job market in the Gulf, expats are returning home in unprecedented numbers. A report from Oxford Economics suggests the UAE alone could lose 10 percent of its population due to the impact of the pandemic, but some believe it could be more.</p>
<p>And while this expat exodus is happening across industries—there are multiple reports of blue-collar workers, many from South Asia, leaving—what for the tech industry, a sector that the UAE, and many of its neighbors, have staked their futures on?</p>
<p>As the industry hemorrhages foreign talent due to industry-wide layoffs, can it still experience the record-breaking growth that was expected?</p>
<p>Experts say it’s possible—but companies will have to think hard about how they lure people back as things calm down, or figure out how to leverage foreign expertise in a world more accepting of virtual workplaces.</p>
<p>In 2019, the Middle East and North Africa experienced a boom in tech activity. A record 564 startup investments were made in the region, accounting for $704 million in funding, according data platform Magnitt. Philip Bahoshy, the company’s chief executive, believes if it had not been for Covid-19, that number would have hit $1 billion in 2020. And it was certainly on track to do so: the average deal size in the first half of this year was $4.1 million, more than double the $1.9 million seen in 2019. Funding to June 2020 already accounted for 95 percent of that for the whole of 2019; Bahoshy believes, however, that this has now slowed significantly as investors, cautious of market volatility, put their money into more established, but far fewer, startups.</p>
<p>The UAE has spent years positioning itself as a regional haven for tech companies and startups, with the Abu Dhabi and Dubai governments pouring millions into incubators and accelerators to help tech entrepreneurs and savvy businesspeople bring their ideas to fruition. The country’s 50-year plan heavily relies on its development as a knowledge- and technology-based economy focused on developing entrepreneurial ventures. But that hasn’t saved even the biggest startup stars in the country from the pandemic, which has hit both revenues and workforces.</p>
<p>Ride-hailing firm Careem in May cut almost a third of its workforce, accounting for 536 jobs. Meanwhile Fetchr—once one of the rising stars of the Middle East’s burgeoning startup scene, valued at almost $300 million in a 2017 fundraising round—shed 1,230 jobs across its operations, although its troubles pre-date the pandemic, having found itself on the brink of collapse in late 2019. It has since raised new funding however, and made a push into Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>But the list goes on. In late August, Dubai-based retail platform Awok closed only a year after raising $30 million in one of the largest investment rounds for an e-commerce startup in the region. According to its LinkedIn page, Awok employed 700 people.</p>
<p>With such a saturated market of technology professionals now out of work and many heading home, some worry for the future of the industry in the Gulf. However, Bahoshy says tech talent has “always been a challenge for startups in the region,” and redundancies are actually having some positive effects, with cases of out-of-work staff becoming entrepreneurs in their own right. “Having said that, the region continues to require experienced tech talent and now would be an opportune time to look beyond the region to attract individuals,” he adds.</p>
<p>Bahoshy is expecting further layoffs in the tech industry as mergers are explored by companies seeking to strengthen their position in the market.</p>
<p>Ray Dargham, chief executive of Step Group, which hosts tech shows, was more optimistic. Step Conference 2020 was held in February, and was its largest conference to date, with 300 startups participating. The Gulf tech scene has come a long way since Step began in 2012, Dargham says, producing several $100 million startups and one unicorn exit (Careem, which was acquired by Uber for $3.1 billion).</p>
<p>“The second cycle of the startup ecosystem, whereby the founders and staff who benefited from these exits will go on to launch new startups or funds, has just started,” he says.</p>
<p>However, the industry continues to be hindered by regulation as well as high setup costs, Dargham says. There was also beginning to be some market saturation, especially in e-commerce, food-tech, and logistics, which is where many of the redundancies are now coming from.</p>
<p>However, Dargham, who is originally from Lebanon, is optimistic that a possible influx of his countrymen into Dubai—as they flee their homeland’s economic crisis, which was exacerbated by the devastating explosion in Beirut in August—could bring about a new wave of tech entrepreneurs. After all, the Lebanese built much of the region’s advertising industry as they fled the country’s civil war between 1975 and 1990, and settled in nearby countries, such as Kuwait, Greece, and Cyprus. Later, many of the agencies’ head offices moved to Dubai, resulting in a thriving local advertising industry. So could we see something similar happen now?</p>
<p>Dargham believes so, but it’s a bittersweet moment for him. “Witnessing the vast numbers of Lebanese friends fleeing to Dubai is both heartbreaking and relieving for me,” Dargham says. “It’s heartbreaking because of all that’s happening in my country. It’s relieving because I know that they are coming to a great home, which has always been safe and prosperous for many Lebanese and Arabs running away from our countries’ miseries. If it weren’t for Dubai, I don’t know where we would go.”</p>
<p>Bahoshy agrees that Dubai could become a safe haven for Lebanese tech experts. “Talent in Lebanon has always been a strength for its ecosystem and economy, and yet as an economy or market for startups, has always been limited for growth. These startups can export their businesses to markets with larger consumer access while further developing their propositions,” he says.</p>
<p>Carrington Malin, a UAE-based entrepreneur and consultant, believes there has never been a more exciting time for the tech industry, due to the Covid-induced demand from the private and public sectors. But as lower oil revenues and the pandemic force companies to become leaner than ever, job roles are being adjusted—and this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. “Overall, this could be a blessing in disguise. Most businesses don’t look at new ways of doing things quite often enough,” he says.</p>
<p>The pandemic has meant that Gulf countries are now more resolute that new technologies will play a central role in their economic and social development, Malin says, and are “putting the initiatives in place to turn these into reality.” This means that future careers in technology and IT could be more attractive than ever for citizens and expats alike.</p>
<p>But, especially in the UAE, with 80 percent of its workforce coming from outside the country, has enough been done to bring Emiratis into the startup fold? Last year, a report on pre-seed startups by entrepreneurship platform Wamda found that Emiratis make up just 3 percent of the entrepreneurs in the UAE, despite the country’s best efforts to foster local talent.</p>
<p>Malin believes this is because the growth of Gulf economies has outstripped the local talent base, and “government departments have tended to monopolize the employment of top local IT talent.” This means Emiratis in tech have traditionally moved into roles in management. But that could be set to change.</p>
<p>“It’s not the best way to foster innovation, entrepreneurship, local research and development, nor leadership in the tech sector,” he says. “Attitudes are changing though and we’re now seeing a wide range of initiatives put in place by governments that will incentivize youth to look toward technology as a career. We’re going to see the Gulf’s pool of homegrown tech talent grow much faster now.”</p>
<p>Massimo Cannizzo, Middle East chief executive of startup support platform Gellify, which is headquartered in Italy but has a hub in Dubai, believes 2020 could herald a new age of globalization in Gulf tech. Companies could be more willing to leverage expertise remotely, he says. “It was previously necessary to have people here in the office and be part of an organization and move their family here. But remote working has changed that.”</p>
<p>However, for companies to be particularly innovative, there needs to be person-to-person …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Approaching this behemoth of an industry called web development can be overwhelming at times, everybody had that feeling of missing out on web development, especially the chaos that's happening in the <em>front-end world</em>...</p>
<p>...But just like any other problem, you break it down into smaller pieces. Think of the areas in web development you're lacking knowledge, then look for resources to fill that gap.</p>
<p>You also need to <em>practice learning</em> to be more proficient in it. Have a really good understanding of the basic programming principles first, that drive web development.</p>
<p>Focus on the fundamentals if you think you're lacking knowledge in that area, then build on top of that the new techniques and strategies that interest you.</p>
<p>There's too much noise on the Internet as it is, especially in tech, you need to focus on <em>extracting the signal</em> from the noise. By focusing on the programming principles you're building on top of a solid foundation because programming principles rarely change, it gets re-invented. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a> is not new, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a> isn't either, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle">SRP</a> were all invented in the 70s and 80s.</p>
<p>With experience, you'll realize that a solid foundation is key, and the major difference between most web development programming languages is just the syntax only.</p>
<p>You’ll need to have a very narrow set of problems that only a specific programming language can solve, in other cases it truly is just a matter of preference, community adoption and the available resources you have on hand.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about good programming principles, check out my blog post on the <a target="_blank" href="https://primalskill.blog/10-books-every-programmer-should-read">10 books every programmer should read</a> where I cover books presenting these programming principles.</p>
<p>The bottom line is you need to love web development, love programming, then learning will be easy, but if you're a <em>9 to 5</em> programmer, not really interested in software, then you're going to have a hard time leveling up to be a better programmer.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t have a life outside work, on the contrary, work-life balance is really important.</p>
<p><strong>You need to invest time and energy every week to learn something new.</strong></p>
<h2 id="old-is-new-again">Old is New Again</h2>
<p>There's no such thing as the wrong approach in web development, it's more like the wrong solution to that set of problems you're trying to solve, and showing off your new programming techniques is usually the wrong solution for the problem. 😃</p>
<p>It's perfectly okay <strong>NOT</strong> to use the latest and greatest packages, modules, or techniques in your codebase, changing it out every day because something newer and shinier was released is almost always the wrong approach.</p>
<p>It's a much better strategy to use tried and battle-tested code instead, especially because of the dynamic nature of software development.</p>
<p>It's also a fallacy that not using the newest programming language or the latest framework you'll be doing a disservice to your project. You can solve 99% of the problems with any programming language. </p>
<h2 id="cut-out-90-of-the-news">Cut out 90% of the news</h2>
<p>Get off social media, stop procrastinating, and cut out any distractions while you're working. Practice async, passive information gathering, meaning, not to jump on a new video, blog, or podcast instantly, instead save it for later and keep a schedule for learning new things.</p>
<p>You can organize your streams and feed with a note-taking app, and keep a <em>log</em> of what you've learned on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>You can use apps like <a target="_blank" href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a>, created for this purpose, to filter the information overload you're being bombarded with daily. They even use an AI assistant that will learn from your habits and will filter out news for you.</p>
<h2 id="start-your-own-blog">Start your own blog</h2>
<p>If you want to really get neck-deep in a subject you want to learn, I think, the best way to do it is to write about it. You'll be <em>forced</em> to research the topic in-depth filling the gaps in your knowledge in the process.</p>
<p>Starting a blog is not complicated anymore, with services like <a target="_blank" href="https://hashnode.com/">Hashnode</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.to/">DEV</a> it's 5 minutes to create your own blog and start writing.</p>
<p>The benefit of creating a blog on such services is that you will also get a huge audience from the get-go.</p>
<h2 id="other-tips">Other Tips</h2>
<p><strong>Read source code: </strong> most beginner developers I've met just don't read other developers source code at all. Why? Reading source code should be thought in schools 😁, it's one of the most fundamental things you should do if you're in software development.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this: Do you know what's inside <code>node_modules</code>? Do you know what code a module or package contains? </p>
<p>You can learn awesome techniques, simply by, reading other developer's code, and more importantly, you can <strong>vet</strong> that code for security exploits, maybe even fix it and create PRs, it's a win-win.</p>
<p><strong>Share and discuss:</strong> news, tutorials, and techniques with your friends in tech or your co-workers. It's very important to get feedback on your ideas, programming techniques, and the like.</p>
<p><strong>Get active on forums:</strong> it may be counterintuitive, and I personally, don't like to follow a bunch of people on social media, because it usually adds noise to my daily work, but by following a narrow set of topics on Reddit or Twitter can be okay.</p>
<p><strong>Get familiar with Github:</strong> look at what's <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/trending">trending on the website</a>, watch releases for repositories you're interested in, or popular repos, just to stay up to date on what direction the industry is pulling right now.</p>
<p>You can also follow <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/topics">topics</a> which gives you an overview of repository and user activities related to that topic, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/topics/data-structures">data structures</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/topics/docker">Docker</a>.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>It's important to <em>learn how to learn</em> new things, but also to find the <em>signal in the noise</em>. Here are a couple of resources, that you could use to stay up-to-date with the new info.</p>
<h3 id="blogs">Blogs</h3>
<p>Find information hubs on the topics you're interested in. Blogs are a great resource for that, subscribe to influential authors' feed, remember RSS? Google tried to kill it, but it's coming back! 😊</p>
<p>Follow tech information <em>hubs</em>, but be vary, the content on these websites can be overwhelming and of lower quality unless it’s a curated feed.</p>
<ol>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://hashnode.com/">Hashnode</a> - is a good place to find articles organized by topics (e.g. tags), just follow a couple of tags that you're interested in.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://dev.to/">Dev.to</a> - same as Hashnode, subscribe to topics of interest and you'll get a timeline with posts from those topics.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://daily.dev/">Daily.dev</a> - a website where you'll get daily curated programming news.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://hackernoon.com/">Hackernoon</a> - another curated news website including everything tech and software.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://dzone.com/">DZone</a> - a massive news website giving you the highlights and trends in tech.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> - as surprising as it sounds, there is a lot of really good content on the website. You can join tech groups or follow hashtags. It evolved a lot in recent years.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="newsletters">Newsletters</h3>
<p>Newsletters are an awesome way to get tech-related content that's curated by other developers. Getting a weekly e-mail overview on web development is almost guaranteed that it keeps you in the loop.</p>
<ol>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://javascriptweekly.com/">JavaScript Weekly</a> - a newsletter of JavaScript articles, news and cool projects.</li>

<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Podcasts are a great resource where experts give their opinion on web development, it's great if you can listen to it in the background while you're working. If you like podcasts you can subscribe to these ones:</p>
<ol>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://syntax.fm/">Syntax FM</a> - specifically created for web developers.</li>

                    This is an example customer lifecycle definition with

                    and a simple conversation plan infinitely looped for the demonstration purposes. 
                    The actual process can be of any complexity, contain nested sub-processes, invoke 
                    other processes by starting or signaling them, call external services or publish 
                    services to be called externally.
                <br>
                    This is a BPMN-style editor for a 
                    <a href="http://sborex.com/poc/">Sborex</a> system entity.

                    select the gears <img src="http://sborex.com/poc/gear.svg"> to see the element's attributes.
                    
                    Press Views, Beans or Resources buttons to see the diagram entity level attributes.
                    
                    BPMN diagram button downloads a definition XML file; SVG image button generates a vector image.
                    
                    See the small <a href="http://sborex.com/poc/doc/">Sborex tutorial</a> for details.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>James Clear is the author of Atomic Habits, who popularized the idea of habits over goals. Last month he shared <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1344776679315689480">the rules he uses for running his business</a>, based on his 10-year experience. Among the rules was this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build assets that compound. Eliminate problems, responsibilities, and obligations that compound. Your business should feel easier to sustain each year.</p>
<p>James Clear (from <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1344776679315689480">How I run my business</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Your business should feel easier to sustain each year." What if, instead of business, we focus on building software? And what if we turn the advice into a question? Then, we get: <em>does our codebase feel easier to sustain each year?</em></p>
<p>I love that question:</p>
<ul>
<li>It reveals the long-term vision of how to approach software engineering.</li>
<li>It encourages challenging missions to <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/">remove complexity</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/oTugjssqOT0?t=1256">target the important non-urgent quadrant</a>.</li>
<li>It exposes the murky alternative, that is, descending further into the complexity tar pit.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I've found that the question brings fresh air and whirls settled dust.</p>

<b>Ask Marilyn ®</b> by Marilyn vos Savant is a column in <i>Parade Magazine</i>,
published by PARADE, 711 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10017, USA.
According to Parade, Marilyn vos Savant is listed in the
"Guinness Book of World Records Hall of Fame" for "Highest IQ."
</p><div><a name="FAQ">
</a><li><a name="FAQ">What is Marilyn's email address?
</a><p><a name="FAQ">PARADE announced on June 8, 1997 that email to Marilyn can be sent to
</a><a href="mailto:marilyn@parade.com">marilyn@parade.com</a>
</p></li><li>Precisely where (edition and category) is Marilyn listed in <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i>?
<p>
<a href="mailto:Citeon@prodigy.net">Citeon &lt;Citeon@prodigy.net&gt;</a>
reports that:
</p><blockquote>
She is listed on page 26 of the 1989 Edition.
It says "...as a ten year old achieved a ceiling score for 23-year-olds,
thus giving her an IQ of 228."
Her record was retired to the guinness hall of fame because scores that
high are no longer possible due to a lowering of test score ceilings.
(As I'm sure you're already guessing it's because scores that high
weren't very valid in the first place.)
</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="mailto:DOlmstead@aol.com">Linda &lt;DOlmstead@aol.com&gt;</a>
disagrees with Citeon about the validity of high test scores:
</p><blockquote>
IQs that high are legitimate.  None of the standard IQ tests in use today for children
(Stanford-Binet Fourth Edition and WISC-III) were designed to identify the
highly gifted.  It is standard practice to use the older Stanford-Binet Form
L-M when a child is at or near the ceiling score on the other newer test.
<p>
Please check out Linda Silverman's
<a href="http://www.gifteddevelopment.com/">Gifted Development Center</a> web site
for more information on identification, assessment, counseling, learning styles,
programs, presentations, and resources for gifted children and adults.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Here are some <a href="http://www.wiskit.com/marilyn/iq.html">additional comments about Marilyn's IQ</a> <small> (10/03/98) </small>
</p><p>
According to <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/course/topics/Monty_Hall.html">
Behind Monty Hall's Doors</a>, Marilyn's IQ is 228.

</p></li><li>What books has Marilyn written?
<ul>
<li><i>Ask Marilyn</i>, St. Martin's Press, 1992, ISBN 0-312-08136-7.
</li><li><i>The World's Most Famous Math Problem:
       The Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and Other Mathematical Mysteries</i>,
       St. Martin's Press, 1993, 0-312-10657-2.
</li><li><i>The Power of Logical Thinking</i>, St. Martin's Press, 1996, 0-312-15627-8.
</li><li><i>Of Course I'm for Monogamy: I'm Also for Everlasting Peace and an End to Taxes</i>, Martin's Press, 1996, ISBN 0-312-16951-5.
</li><li><i>I've forgotten everything I learned in school!</i>, St. Martin's Press, 1994, ISBN 0-312-10457-X.
</li><li><i>Brain building: Exercising Yourself Smart</i>, Bantam Books, 1991, ISBN 0-553-35348-9.
</li><li><i>More Marilyn: Some Like it Bright!</i>, St. Martin's Press, 1994, ISBN 0-312-11384-6.
</li></ul>

</li><li>Is Marilyn married? Who is her husband?
<p>
<a href="mailto:rory@carmelnet.com">Rory Sellers &lt;rory@carmelnet.com&gt;</a>
reports that Marilyn is married to the "Jarvik guy who invented the artificial heart".

</p></li><li>How do you feel about Marilyn?
<p>
Marilyn is more intelligent than I am, as measured by standard intelligence tests.
There are some areas in which I am more knowledgeable (trained or educated) than
Marilyn, just as there are some areas that Marilyn is more knowledgeable than I.
</p><p>
I do not hate Marilyn, and I am not jealous of her. I respected her more in the
past than I do now. I do not think I am better than Marilyn, and Marilyn certainly
has answered questions that would have stumped me. Furthermore, I am sure that
Marilyn is far more profitable for <i>Parade Magazine</i> than I could ever be.
</p><p>
I am concerned that some people believe that everything Marilyn says is correct
(except in the few cases that Marilyn has admitted error), just because she is
smarter than we are.
</p><p>
<b>This is not true!</b> Marilyn <b>does</b> make mistakes, and here they are.
</p><p>
I do wonder, though, why Marilyn considers this web site "a little creepy" (see below).
Is she afraid to confront her mistakes?

</p></li><li>Does Marilyn know about this web site?
<p>Eric Zorn, of the Chicago Tribune, reports that
<a><img src="http://www.wiskit.com/marilyn/broken.gif" alt="[BROKEN]"></a> <u>http://www.chicago.tribune.com/columns/zorn/archives/80597z.htm</u>
Marilyn is aware of this web site, but has never visited.
</p><p>Rich Morin, of the Washington Post, reports that
<a><img src="http://www.wiskit.com/marilyn/broken.gif" alt="[BROKEN]"></a> <u>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/1998-06/14/133l-061498-idx.html</u>
Marilyn considers this web site "a little creepy".
</p><p>The attorneys for Parade Magazine are also aware of this web site (see below).

</p></li><li>Why was your site shut down between June 9 and June 30, 1998?
    And why do you no longer include the original question and Marilyn's answer?
<p>The attorneys for Parade Magazine claimed that the amount of copyrighted material that I used
   exceeded what is permissible under the fair use provision of the copyright laws.
   Rather than contest their claim, I shut down the site until I could remove the offending material.
   I have tried to avoid biasing the material in my paraphrasing.

</p></li><li>How can I judge for myself whether Marilyn is Wrong if you no longer include
    the original question and answer published in Parade Magazine?
    Is there any way for me to obtain the original columns?
<p><a href="http://www.parade.com/reprint/index.html">Back issues</a> are now available directly from
    <a href="http://www.parade.com/reprint/index.html">Parade Magazine</a>
    for $3.00 per issue.
    Thanks to <a href="mailto:bs25@cornell.edu">Ben Sandler &lt;bs25@cornell.edu&gt;</a>
    for pointing me to <a href="http://www.parade.com/">Parade Magazine</a>'s web site.  <small> (06/14/00) </small>

</p></li><li>Does Marilyn have a research staff or depend upon outside assistance to answer the
    questions that appear in her columns?
<p><a href="mailto:bratach@gate.sunquest.com">Pete Bratach &lt;bratach@gate.sunquest.com&gt;</a> provides some information about <a href="http://www.wiskit.com/marilyn/research.html">Marilyn's Research Staff</a>  <small> (11/01/99) </small>

</ul><p>Ahead of Budget 2021, India is mulling imposition of an additional COVID cess or surcharge on high income earners. This could be to meet the increased expenditure due to the pandemic and the upcoming vaccination drive.

According to an ET 
<a target="_blank" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/taxed-by-covid-govt-mulls-covid-cess/articleshow/80205285.cms" rel="nofollow">report</a>, preliminary talks on revenue-raising measures include a cess on high income earners, as well as additional levy on fuel. A call on the new COVID cess will likely be taken closer to February 1, when the budget is scheduled to be announced.
</p><p>
    If the government implements the COVID cess, it will be the latest in line of measures to boost revenue at a time when it has implemented several policies that either reduce government collections or increase its spendings.

<p>States have been facing pressure in revenues because of economic slowdown and corporate tax cuts, which means that the government is stretched to meet its spending needs. Goods and services tax (GST) collections have also struggled for a good part of 2020, in large part due to the pandemic and lockdown. Further, India’s growth rate is

There has also been a proposal to add a cess to excise on petrol and diesel on top of custom duties. A cess is a good way for the centre to raise funds as central cess collections are not shared with the states.
</p>
<p>The industry in its recommendations on the budget has asked that no new taxes should be levied as the economy is already under stress due to the pandemic. Experts too agree that the timing is not right.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1773">
    
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>I have been toying with the idea of migrating this blog to a static site to simplify its maintenance for some time. While <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress </a>is a great tool, this blog is a side project and any time I have to spend maintaining WordPress gets deducted from the time I have to write for the blog. Keep in mind that I’m self-hosting this blog and it’s actually running on a Linux VM that only handles the blog. That is yet another server that I need to administer, and it’s the odd one out, too, as all of the others are FreeBSD or OpenBSD servers.</p>
<p>Oh, and one of the big advantages of using a static site generator is that the whole site can be put in version control, archived there and also quickly re-generated from there should I manage to spectacularly mess up the host. A WordPress restore is a fair amount more work, as I found out about two years ago.</p>
<p>The only parts that don’t back up that well are the comments, especially if I use a self-hosted system for them.</p>
<h2>Migration is fine, but what to?</h2>
<p>For that reason, I had experimented with moving the blog to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for quite a while. In fact, I have maintained a parallel Jekyll blog for years now. For a smooth switch over, the devil was in the details though, and I was never happy enough to actually migrate and shutdown the WordPress site.</p>
<p>After another patchapalooza, I revisited the idea of converting the blog to a static site and looked at several other static site generators. I also decided to resurrect an experiment I had started with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. My first attempt hadn’t been very successful, so I stuck with Jekyll. This second attempt however is a lot more successful as it addressed a couple of the issues that kept me from being happy with Jekyll:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hugo builds the site much faster than Jekyll</li>
<li>I found a <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-future-imperfect-slim/">theme</a> that I’m really happy with.</li>
<li>It looks like some of the details that I found hard to get right in Jekyll are already handled nicely in Hugo. This is mostly around the RSS feed generation – Hugo by default generates category feeds in addition to the regular “full” feed. It also looks like the category feeds are very similar path-wise to what WordPress uses, so hopefully the RSS feeds should continue working with the couple of aggregators that picked up this blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, this time I succeeded in importing the site from Jekyll into Hugo. It took some work to clean up some of the artifacts that originated in the WP-to-Jekyll conversion, and then I had to convert the Liquid template code to Hugo shortcodes. The latter was pretty easy, but a bit tedious. Just not tedious enough to write a script to do it.</p>
<h2>Hugo can render org-mode files (and so can Jekyll, apparently)</h2>
<p>Another nice feature is that my workflow can still use org-mode for when I want to use it to write longer posts. Shorter posts I usually crank out in Markdown, but for the more complex posts it’s nice to have org-mode as an option. <em>Especially</em> if the post contains source code.</p>
<p>While the setup I described before with using org-mode to post to WordPress is mostly working, it’s a bit clunky especially if you’re using more than one computer to work on blog posts. Both Jekyll and Hugo can handle org-mode files directly – in fact, even though this file would be as effortless to write as Markdown, what you are currently reading is actually a processed org-mode file. Assuming that you’re reading this on the <a href="https://static.lonecpluspluscoder.com/">static site</a>, that is.</p>
<h2>What’s left to before the actual cutover?</h2>
<p>There are two fairly large items I have to tick off the todo list before I can cut over for good.</p>
<ul>
<li>Migrate the comments. Now this blog doesn’t get a ton of comments, but I appreciate all of them and am trying to migrate them over to this blog. As I believe in self-hosting everything, I’m experimenting with <a href="https://posativ.org/isso/">isso</a>, and I need to redo some of the experiments with Hugo as so far, they’ve been completely focussed on Jekyll. Hugo does have built in support for disqus, plus this theme has support for staticman, but neither of the two are my preferred alternatives.</li>
<li>QA the site, especially the RSS feeds so that they hopefully keep working as they do right now.</li>
<li>There are still some minor tweaks to be done, analytics integrated and all that, but those are probably going to happen slowly after the cutover.</li>
<li>Oh, and the last item is all of the draft posts that have accumulated on WordPress that I somehow never got around to finishing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The beta of the static site is <a href="https://static.lonecpluspluscoder.com/">here</a> if you want to have a look. Any feedback is welcome.</p>

        <p>Of all the projects I’ve made, I receive the most questions about the <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/ink">Ink programming language</a>. Most questions fall into three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why did you make a programming language?</li>
<li>I want to make my own programming language – any advice?</li>
<li>Why does Ink work the way it does?</li>
</ol>
<p>This post aims to answer questions (1) and (2) and provide some resources for you to get started on your own language. I think (3) is best left for its own, more technical post.</p>
<p>This post is organized into a few sections.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#why">Why should you?</a></li>
<li><a href="#design">Design</a></li>
<li><a href="#impl">Implementation</a></li>
<li><a href="#other">Other considerations</a></li>
<li><a href="#start">Start small, get creative, ask questions</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-should-you">Why should you?</h2>
<p>Making an interpreter for a new programming language is the most technically rewarding project I’ve worked on. It pushed my understanding of fundamental software concepts and helped me comprehend how a computer works at a deeper level.</p>
<p>Programming languages and compilers / interpreters can be black boxes for programmers starting out. They’re tools taken for granted, and you can write good software without necessarily worrying about how the languages and primitive tools you’re using work under the hood. But writing a programming language involves understanding the most meaty parts of the computing stack, from the CPU and memory up through the operating system, in-memory data structures, processes, threads, the stack, all the way up to libraries and applications. It’s the floodgate to the most interesting mathematics in computing – category theory and type systems, algebras, lots of applications of graph theory, complexity analysis, and more. <strong>Writing and studying programming languages, I found myself getting more familiar with both the mathematics and the mechanical underpinnings of how computers work.</strong></p>
<p>The project made me a better developer as a result, even if my day-to-day work rarely concerns programming language tooling or compiler writing.</p>
<p>A programming language also has lots of room for expansions, optimizations, and extra creativity even after the project’s version one is “finished”. If you design the initial implementation carefully, you can add new keywords, new features, optimizations, and tools to your language and interpreter / compiler incrementally over time. It’s easy to turn a language into a long-term project and creative outlet, and I’ve enjoyed expanding on my initial implementation while studying other languages after my version-one was complete.</p>
<h3 id="the-pl-world-is-broad-and-deep-pick-your-battles">The PL world is broad and deep; pick your battles</h3>
<p>Unlike some other areas of software that follow hype cycles, the programming language field has grown and deepened steadily and constantly for a long time in both academia and industry. There’s a <em>lot</em> of literature, research, prior art, and practical advice in the wild about a million different concepts that can be combined into a new language, and a million different variations on how to implement them.</p>
<p>Especially for a personal-project language, I think the most fruitful approach is to <strong>pick one or two interesting ideas from the archaeology of computing, and build a programming language that examines and expands on those ideas deeply</strong>, rather than try to build the One True Language that’s best at everything and combines the best features of all the languages. Not only is it impossible to make such a language for all use cases, I think that kind of mindset also slows down development, adds unnecessary work, and doesn’t give you the mental space to learn as much about a few interesting topics you might be interested in.</p>
<p>For example, you might be interested in functional programming and immutable data structures. You could try to build a language that’s designed around storing all state in immutable data structures, and study how such data structures can be optimized and manipulated efficiently in a compiler. Or maybe you’re interested in low-level C programming and systems languages, in which case you might try to build a scripting language whose primary goals include elegant interoperability with C APIs and binary interfaces.</p>
<p>Where you start also determines the challenges and tradeoffs you’ll contend with. You might have an easier time writing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> interpreter due to its simpler syntax, because it’s easy to parse compared to, say, a more complex syntax for a language with a static type system. However, Lisps tend to have semantics that are further-removed from the low-level machine code that runs, like closures. So you may trade off the ease of parsing with execution complexity.</p>
<p>Pick your battles carefully, and stick to a few core ideas that you want to study deeply.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>Before you write either an interpreter or a compiler, you need to <em>design</em> a language. You can spend time studying category theory and type systems and programming paradigms, but the best thing you can do for yourself at this stage is to study ideas from a wide breadth of programming languages. Don’t just limit yourself to “modern” languages like Rust and Python; reach back into computing history. There’s rich ideas to be reinvented and combined in interesting ways reaching back at least a century into computing and mathematics.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get stuck in the mental model of popular modern OOP-like languages (Python, Ruby, Swift, C++) and spend the most time in this phase designing <em>syntax</em>. But designing the <em>semantics</em> of the language is where you should spend the most of your time, because it’s where the language gets its “feel” and where you’ll learn the most. Semantics are also more difficult to change after the fact than syntax. Some questions to ask yourself, to start thinking about language semantics and ergonomics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What types does your language have? Is it checked at compile-time? Does it automatically convert between types as necessary?</li>
<li>What’s the top-level organizing unit of programs in your language? Languages commonly call this modules, packages, or libraries, but some languages may invent their own concept, like Rust <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/crates.html">Crates</a>.</li>
<li>How does the language deal with exceptional conditions, like a missing file, a network access error, or a divide-by-zero error? Do you treat errors like exceptions that bubble up through the call stack, or are errors treated like values, as in C and Go?</li>
<li>Does your language perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail recursion optimization</a>? Or do you provide native control-flow tools for looping, like <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops?</li>
<li>How much utility do you want to build into the language, as opposed to a standard library? C, for example, doesn’t know about strings – string semantics are provided by the C standard library. Maps and lists are fundamental language constructs in most high-languages, and not so in most low-level ones.</li>
<li>How does your language think about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management">allocating memory</a>? Is memory automatically allocated as needed? Does the developer need to write code to do so? Is it garbage-collected?</li>
</ul>
<p>To answer these questions, I think it’s most helpful to just get a taste of a variety of languages in the wild. Here’s a small starter set that I recommend you take a look at, and what ideas I personally found intriguing from each language or language family.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lua</strong>: a data structure called <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/2.5.html">tables</a>, Lua <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/9.1.html">couroutines</a>, using strings as byte slices, interoperability with C</li>
<li><strong>Scheme / Clojure</strong>: Metaprogramming with macros, homoiconicity, closures, control flow with recursion. Die-hard Common-Lispers may disagree, but Scheme and Clojure are the easiest languages in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> family of languages for me to learn. You should study at least one kind of Lisp.</li>
<li><strong>Go</strong>: structural typing with <a href="https://tour.golang.org/methods/9">interfaces</a>, concurrency with blocking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads">green threads</a></li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: callback-style concurrency and asynchronous programming, first-class functions, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop">event loop</a>, Promises</li>
<li><strong>Awk</strong>: Awk is a great example of a small, simple language optimized for one use case: manipulating text files and textual data. It’s very well designed for that workflow, and a inspiration for how effective a small, domain-specific language with simple semantics can be.</li>
<li><strong>APL</strong> / <strong>J</strong>: APL and J are both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming#Array_languages">array languages</a>, which is a fascinating family of languages well known for its brevity</li>
<li><strong>Ruby</strong>: syntax. Ruby’s well known for its super-flexible syntax, because it lends itself easily to DSLs based on Ruby, like ActiveRecord.</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>: I like C mostly for its simplicity and minimalism, and an uncompromising commitment to compatibility</li>
<li><strong>Haskell</strong>: the type system and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism">parametric polymorphism</a>, variant types, partial application and function type syntax. Once you wrap your mind around it, Haskell is also a good place to start diving deeper into the kinds of elegant programs possible with functional programming.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Once you have a design for how a language should work and feel, you should first “test-drive” it to see how programs written in the language feel to use.</p>
<h3 id="test-drive">Test-drive</h3>
<p>In this phase, I usually keep a text document where I experiment with syntax by writing small programs in the new as-yet-nonexistent language. I write notes and questions for myself in comments in the code, and try to implement small algorithms and data structures like recursive mathematical functions, sorting algorithms, and small web servers. I usually hold myself to this stage until most of my questions about syntax and semantics are answered. I also use this phase to test my hypotheses about the core ideas behind the language design. If I designed a language around functional programming and asynchronous, event-driven concurrency, for example, I’d write some sample code in this phase to validate that those ideas combine well together, and lends itself to programs that I’d enjoy writing. If I’m proven wrong, I’ll update my assumptions or play around with the language design to reflect what I’ve learned.</p>
<p>This straw-man design phase is a quick way to make sure that the language you’ve invented in your head could work well for the kinds of programs you want to write, without having to write much implementation.</p>

I have <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/hoods/">written about 56 of the 77</a> Chicago neighborhoods but left out 21 of them; the reason why is because those 21 neighborhoods do not have a significant enough gang history throughout the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries due to a lack of poverty, consistent strong community ties and being consistently economically flourishing.&nbsp; Neighborhoods like Mount Greenwood and Edison Park have been known to have zero homicides for 10 or more years at a time.&nbsp; Neighborhoods like Forest Glen, North Center, O’Hare, Norwood Park, North Park and Beverly are very close to Mount Greenwood and Edison Park with almost no murders and no gang violence.&nbsp; Anywhere you look on the internet or read stats about these neighborhoods you will see a correlation with the lack of gang activity in these neighborhoods past and present with low crime rates; another interesting thing is most of these neighborhoods border the suburbs.</p>
<p>Some neighborhoods had a stint of gang activity in decades past; however, it was not enough to delve into a whole history of the neighborhood as there was no real socioeconomic or any other sociological reasons gangs were there in such neighborhoods as: Dunning, Jefferson Park, Portage Park and Montclare.&nbsp; Some neighborhoods I did not get into because they have some roughness throughout history, but not enough to really delve deeper, these neighborhoods such as: West Ridge, West Lawn, Edgewater, West Elsdon, East Side, Avondale, Hegewish, Ashburn and Clearing have only had a moderate level of gang violence over the course of history mainly though the 20<sup>th</sup> century and most importantly no significant street gangs were formed in any of the 20 neighborhoods I just mentioned. The only one that had a significant gang form within its borders was Hyde Park that is the home of the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/gang/black-disciples/">Devil’s Disciples. </a>At the time of the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/gang/black-disciples/">Disciples</a>&nbsp;being founded, the northern part of Hyde Park was a little rough for the first half of the 1960s decade but the issues that brought about the gangs were long ago eradicated and there was nothing else to discuss about Hyde Park after that.</p>
<p>Some neighborhoods I dove into because of their past but presently these areas have become a lot safer and changed their whole look, neighborhoods like: <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/north-center/">North Center</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/lincoln-park/">Lincoln Park</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/lincoln-square/">Lincoln Square</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/lakeview/">Lake View</a>, the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/loop/">Loop</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/irving-park/">Irving Park</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Near North Side</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/garfield-ridge/">Garfield Ridge</a> and the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-south-side/">Near South Side</a> have experienced huge makeovers in the 21<sup>st</sup> century that make them almost unrecognizable to those that walked those streets in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. these renovations also ended up pushing out most gang activity in these regions.&nbsp; Some other neighborhoods had stronger gang activity and violence in the 20<sup>th</sup> century but ever since the 21<sup>st</sup> century urban renewal, rising property values, gentrification and crack downs by police and residents, have greatly reduced violence and gang activity in these neighborhoods like: <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/belmont-cragin/">Belmont-Cragin</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/logan-square/">Logan Square</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/armour-square/">Armour Square</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/albany-park/">Albany Park</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/uptown/">Uptown</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/rogers-park">Rogers Park</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/bridgeport/">Bridgeport</a>, West Town, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/douglas/">Douglas</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/kenwood/">Kenwood</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/hermosa">Hermosa</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/archer-heights/">Archer Heights</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/mckinley-park">McKinley Park</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/lower-west-side/">Lower West Side</a> (<a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/lower-west-side/">Pilsen</a>), <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/brighton-park/">Brighton Park</a> and the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">Near West Side</a> have seen massive improvements over time but still have quite a ways to go, however, these area have become significantly safer.</p>
<p>The rest of the other 31 neighborhoods still struggle with heavy violence and gang wars as the bodies stack up and crime is high.&nbsp; The 56 neighborhoods that have been explored above, all play a key role in the early formation of street gangs in Chicago and have molded the top organizations that we see active on the streets today that have even spread as far as other countries.</p>

		 

		

		

		

	
<p>We all know someone that is in a Chicago based street gang that we know comes from a comfortable home in a livable and/or safer neighborhood and we wonder why they are in a gang despite having a decent life; the answer to that question could be answered by sociologists and psychologists with answers along the lines of needing to fit in, peer pressure etc… but the organization that individual is a part of did not start in a well off neighborhood and did not come from the middle class sections of the city or <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/the-american-dream/">suburbs.</a>&nbsp;These organizations came from the darkest and ugliest side of Chicago history that came from poverty, racism and survival.&nbsp; Many sections of these organizations still suffer from these factors but many are just gang banging for the heck of it, as that is commonly seen in the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/the-american-dream/">suburbs;</a>&nbsp;especially when you see gang banging in communities like <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/the-american-dream/">Naperville</a>, Palatine or even <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/the-american-dream/">Oak Brook</a>.</p>
<p>Racism was the first and largest factor that created street gangs and organized crime in this city because being discriminated against leads an individual to not receive the opportunities for advancement in life such as: equal housing, equal employment and equal education.&nbsp; We cannot argue against the fact that African Americans have had it the worst throughout history as far as discrimination is concerned and this was started as soon as African Americans were sold by their chiefs and brought to this country on slave boats, even supposed “free men” in the old days were pushed to live in the most decrepit and most undesirable living situations to the point where many felt slavery was a better alternative.</p>
<p>This city was first settled (by a non-Native American) by a man with dark skin and from the African ancestral country of Haiti before any other non-Native American wanted to live on these lands that are now Chicago.&nbsp; Despite the fact that Du Sable was first and he was black it did not matter; once this military fort was converted into a town and then a city in the 1830s the African Americans that came to help build this city were forced to live in a confined area in the present day <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">United Center</a> section of the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">Near West Side</a>, neighborhood away from the white settlers. Whites were allowed to settle in the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/loop/">Loop</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Near North Side</a> and the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">West Loop</a> section of the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">Near West Side</a>, and in actuality, the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">United Center</a> part was not even annexed into the city in the 1830s; therefore, blacks were not even allowed in Chicago in the first decade of the city’s existence.</p>
<p>Another hated group were the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> in early history, which is hard to fathom for modern societies’ understanding because they have white skin. In reality there were signs in many cities that read <strong>“NO BLACKS AND NO IRISH”</strong> and this was put in front of store fronts and also in front of manufacturing businesses that were hiring that also paid a decent wage.&nbsp; The <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> were allowed to live among their fellow white man; however, they were forced to take the crappiest and most dilapidated housing, they also were only allowed to take the lowest income and the worst positions nobody wanted. This discrimination led to the first ghetto in Chicago known as “<a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Little Hell</a>” that was located in the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Near North Side</a> neighborhood in the southwest quadrant in the areas of <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Little Hell</a> (now <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/housing-project/cabrini-green">Cabrini Green</a> area), <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Smokey Hallow</a> (Now the western part of <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">River North</a>), and <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Goose Island</a>.&nbsp; This was the first slum, the first crime ridden area, the first site of poverty and socioeconomic issues.&nbsp; This area was also the birth place of street gangs and the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> and <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Italian Mafia</a>, it all started here in this mostly <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> slum. When <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Italians</a> first came to this city in the 1880s most of them were pushed into this slum while the rest had to settle in rural Hyde Park Township or Lake Township outside the city limits and fend for themselves. Those that arrived in the city limits got shoved into <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Little Hell</a> with the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> and were forced to live a life of anguish earning low wages, living in deteriorated housing, living among garbage and filth, living with no running water or plumbing just like the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a>.&nbsp; Even the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> and <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Italians</a> had their own restrictions in <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Little Hell</a> as they did not want blacks living there; however, the rest of the city did not want blacks either unless they lived near the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-south-side/">Vice District</a> (and the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-south-side/">Levee</a>), <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/loop/">Gamblers Row</a> and <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/loop/">Whiskey Row</a> in the southern part of the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/loop/">Loop</a> or on in the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-south-side/">Near South Side</a> shabbier buildings, when those buildings became crowded, blacks were allowed to move into <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-north-side/">Little Hell</a>.</p>

		 

		

		

		

	
<p>No matter where African Americans chose to settle, it was the same story of poverty, slums and living among criminals and hooligans in run down apartments or dilapidated cottages.&nbsp; Despite living among so many criminals the black man did not take up a life of crime because he knew that stealing that loaf of bread would cause him to be hung while the white man would get a small jail stint, so the vast majority of early African Americans did not run with street gangs or partake in or create organized crime with the exception of <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">John “Mushmouth” Johnson</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-west-side/">Little Hell</a>, the <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/near-south-side/">South Loop</a> and also in the <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/new-city/">Back of The Yards</a> people lived in such awful conditions and desperately wanted to escape this life; however, restraints based upon ethnicity and race did not allow upward mobility which made many resort to a life of crime because they were <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Italian</a>, because they were <a href="https://www.chicagoganghistory.com/mob-influence-modern-gang/">Irish</a> and later because they were black.</p>
<p>Until the 1890s African Americans were forced to live in the slums of once great buildings built during early settlement leftover from whites that had moved up in the world. In the 1890s blacks now wanted to move to <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/grand-boulevard/">Grand Boulevard</a> and <a href="http://www.chicagoganghistory.com/neighborhood/douglas/">Douglas</a> and as they settled in these better areas the white community reacted in protest and even violence. Another reaction from the whites was to move out of the neighborhood for the simple reason that they did not want black neighbors despite the fact that black people posed no threat and were mostly law abiding citizens; much of it had to do with pride, they felt if they had black neighbors then they were living among poverty, it was all about image apparently.&nbsp; Proper and easier assimilation of blacks into these two neighborhoods was perhaps extremely vital in Chicago history because if this would have worked out without white flight and disinvestment happening in these …</p></div></div>

        <p>I don't remember the day but I was talking with a friend of mine about the benefit vs drawback of a exact match domain vs a brand domain.</p><p>I guess first I should explain what an exact match domain is, simply put, it would be the .com of what ever search the user might be doing in a search engine, such as google, bing, yandex, long or short, say "cars" the exact match would be cars.com, or "used cars" the exact match would be usedcars.com</p><p>Now a brand domain, would be something like Yout or IBM.&nbsp; Now of course these words mean nothing.&nbsp; So they can be anything.</p><p>The discussion was that there was a company back in the day that had started out with an exact match domain in a specific sector.&nbsp; Say cupakes.com and from there they went on and bought donuts.com, as they developed each out as one or both grew then acquiring a third, and so on.</p><p>They then got a point where they had decided they should instead make a brand, instead of managing each of the sites individually.&nbsp; So they launched a unified amazon type site, and redirected all their sites to the respective location on their brand site.</p><p>Of course their brand site went on to either go public or sold off for a large amount .&nbsp; Either way that would be determined a success.&nbsp; This of course showed that if you just start out as a brand in the beginning and execute well you can do everything.</p><p>So I guess it's more of semantics and my love for exact match domains given that I still think an exact match domain is the best way to enter any niche, and perhaps maybe not the best, but the most ever green if done well.&nbsp; </p><p>Now of course if you start expanding into other niches, or that was your original plan, I still think the scenario in which I described it would of still been beneficial to have launched an individual brand site and put a sort of "powered by" and maintained each of them running once you have enough exact matches or are doing well enough in one niche that you dominate it so well that you move onto the next, that it would be foolish to not, at least dominate twice the amount of the niche.&nbsp; I think more specifically because each niche has it quirks as well so by unifying you end up neglecting those.<br></p>

        <p>
        by  on <i itemprop="datePublished">2021-01-10</i></p>
        <p><span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>This story goes back several years, to when I was working at Hipmunk on the
Backend Platform Team. Among the many varied responsibilities of this team<sup id="fnref:0"><a href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>,
we were responsible for maintaining our integrations with our partners via their
APIs. Most of these partner APIs returned data as nested dictionaries, encoded
as <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a>. You may be able to imagine that
some of these APIs were less reliable than others, and so we had adapted with a
bag of tricks to deal with malformed and outright bad data. The story I'm about
to tell you describes when I got carried away trying to solve one specific
problem, the consequences it had, and the lessons I've learned from it.</p>

<h3>The nature of the problem</h3>

<p>First, lets abstract away the specifics of our API integration. In essence, we
would make some kind of standard, authenticated request to our partner, and the response
would be in the form of a JSON encoding of some nested dictionary tree structure. It would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
    "status": "success",
    "result": {
        "mandatory_key": "some attribute",
	"optional_key": "some attribute",
	"nested_object_1": {
            "key_1": "value 1",
	    "optional_nested_object_2a": {
                "key_1": "value 1"
		"possible_display_key": "display me if present",
            },
	    "nested_object_2b": {
		"possible_display_key": "display me as a fallback",
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Pay attention to <code>possible_display_key</code>, which appears twice in this response.
This is a stripped-back example of what the problem was, both in the number of
missing fields, and the depth of nesting. <code>optional_nested_object_2a</code> may or may
not be present in the response returned by the partner, depending on whether
their data covered that use case. For a fictional example, the entire hotel
image subtree might be missing from the results for a specific hotel if the
partner we queried had no images for that hotel.</p>

<p>Our code that tried to pull out these values was written with the end uses in
mind. So these missing subtrees made for clunky code, like the following:</p>

<pre><code>def extract_display_field(response):
    nested_object_1 = response['result']['nested_object_1']
    if 'optional_nested_object_2a' in nested_object_1 and 'possible_display_key' in nested_object_1['optional_nested_object_2a']:
        return nested_object_1['optional_nested_object_2a']['possible_display_key']
    if 'nested_object_2b' in nested_object_1 and 'possible_display_key' in nested_object_1['nested_object_2b']:
        return nested_object_1['nested_object_2']['possible_display_key']
    return 'some default'

</code></pre>

<p>Of course, I need you to put in some effort to imagine what it actually looked
like, since those nestings could be 3-6 layers deep of potentially missing
structures<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup>. Our parser code was trying to express that we wanted to do something
with the element at a certain path, if it existed. Because entire subtrees might
be missing, however, we needed to be careful about how we traversed the
structure, so that we didn't throw a <code>KeyError</code> if we accidentally stepped off
the tree.</p>

<p>Over time, we settled on an idiom that used the default parameter of
<code>dict.get()</code>, and it looked like the following:</p>

<pre><code>def extract_display_field(response):
    return (
        response['result']['nested_object_1'].get(
            'optional_nested_object_2a', {}).get('possible_display_key')
        or response['result']['nested_object_1'].get(
            'nested_object_2b', {}).get('possible_display_key')
	or 'some default
    )
</code></pre>

<p>Because of the depth, we'd need to chain those <code>.get</code>s so they'd look like:</p>

<pre><code>return response.get('foo', {}).get('bar', {}'
       ).get('baz', {}).get('quux', {}) or 'default'
</code></pre>

<h4>Why not just catch the KeyError?</h4>

<p>Why not rely on <code>KeyError</code> to detect when a value was missing? It's a common adage in Python that it's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#:~:text=Easier%20to%20ask">Easier to Ask Forgiveness Than Permission</a>, and so most idiomatic Python would use:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    val = response['foo']['bar']['baz']
except KeyError:
    val = "default"
</code></pre>

<p>Well, the reason was just one of convenience. <code>try</code> and <code>except</code> define clauses,
which cannot be part of expressions in the language. What we wanted was to be
able to write concise expressions like:</p>

<pre><code>response['foo']['bar']['baz'] or response['foo']['bar']['baz2']
</code></pre>

<p>without needing to pad out the number of lines.</p>

<h4>Why pick out fields rather than unmarshalling objects</h4>

<p>Another question that you might have is why not parse the entire API response
structure into objects, and then use methods of those objects to find what we
want, rather than querying dict trees? The answer there is cost. We had scores
of these API integrations to maintain, and our partners all had different domain
models for their objects.</p>

<p>For example, some APIs would represent the Lat/Long coordinates of an Airport as
part of the Airport object. Others might have a Location object within the
Airport, which then had the coordinates in there. The purpose of our integration
code was to pick out the coordinates, and put them into the common structured
object model we had for all such requests. Maintaining another set of objects to
represent each partner's structure would bloat the code for no additional
purpose.</p>

<h3>Enter LazyRecursiveDefaultDict</h3>

<p>This was where I had my bright idea. I wasn't the first person to come up with
the idea of a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19189274/nested-defaultdict-of-defaultdict/27809959">recursive
defaultdict</a>.</p>

<p>However, applying it to the problem of parsing these APIs seemed so <em>clever</em>,
that I was genuinely pleased with myself for having thought of it. That must
have been why I was so eager to implement it, despite the concerns my reviewers
raised about the excess complexity.</p>

<p>The code itself was very small. First let's have the code, and then I'll go
through the points I want to you notice. Remember, this is a cautionary tale, so
please don't add this in any production context. Also, I don't have access to
the original code anymore, so I threw this code together for this blog article.</p>

<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict

class LazyRecursiveDefaultDict(defaultdict):
    """Do not use in production."""

    def __init__(self, tree=None):
        if tree is None:
            tree = {}

        super(LazyRecursiveDefaultDict, self).__init__(
            LazyRecursiveDefaultDict, tree)

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        retval = super(LazyRecursiveDefaultDict, self).__getitem__(key)
        if isinstance(retval, dict):
            return LazyRecursiveDefaultDict(retval)
        return retval
</code></pre>

<p>A LazyRecursiveDefaultDict is a subclass of defaultdict. Defaultdict is a type
of collection available in the Python standard library. It behaves like
a dictionary, with the added ability to specify a default value for missing
keys. Judicious use of defaultdict simplifies a lot of code.</p>

<p>This code uses a recursive definition at <code>__init__</code> to set the default
constructed dictionary to be an empty LazyRecursiveDefaultDict. This way, any
number of nested, missed accesses would just return an empty LazyRecursiveDefaultDict</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; response["foo"]["bar"]["wrong"][
...     "somewhere"]["these"]["keys"]["are"]["missing"]
defaultdict(&lt;class '__main__.LazyRecursiveDefaultDict'&gt;, {})
</code></pre>

<p>The reason this is Lazy, is so that it doesn't have to process the entire tree
of dictionaries, converting them all, at construction time. By overriding
<code>__getitem__</code>, I was able to make sure that whenever the item being returned was
a dictionary, the appropriate construction code would come into play.</p>

<h3>Rollout, adoption, eventual fall</h3>

<p>I initially wrote this while implementing an API integration, whose rollout was
successful. I reported about LazyRecursiveDefaultDict to my teammates, and
recommended that we start adopting it more widely. And then, after I'd
publicly let everyone know that this tool was available for everyone's use,
the problems started!</p>

<p>Some of our existing parsers relied on the fact that nested accesses would
throw KeyErrors if not met. They had been written over many years of edge
cases, planned and unplanned mutations to external APIs, and changes to our
systems, and so there was a lot of surface area to cover. I had thought that all
we needed to do was to convert the response tree to <code>LazyRecursiveDefaultDict</code>,
to start reaping the benefits. Instead, we found that this exposed all sorts of
subtle errors started showing up in testing.</p>

<p>In addition, we found that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Debugging became harder, now that there was another recursive data structure
to reason about</p></li>

<li><p>There was a lot of needless copying during every dictionary access</p></li>

<li><p>LazyRecursiveDefaultDict didn't convert the objects returned from APIs if they were an element of a list</p></li>

<li><p>LazyRecursiveDefaultDicts were escaping their contexts, since parsers might
send them for logging or error reporting, and they had the potential to cause
subtle problems there too.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>None of these problems were unsolvable. However, solving those problems would
require writing more code, making this class even more complex. That forced me
to think about how much I was willing to invest in this as a solution, and
whether it was the right tool for the job.</p>

<h3>Restoration, and Replacement</h3>

<p>As soon as I realized that <code>LazyRecursiveDefaultDict</code> was not the panacea we
were looking for, I made sure to ticket work to remove it. In the end, a simple
solution was much better, a function that looked something like:</p>

<pre><code>def get_from_tree(
    tree: dict,
    path: typing.List[typing.Union[str, int]],
    default=None):
    """Implementation left as an exercise for the reader.

    Hint: use a for loop to traverse the path, picking
    your way down the tree. If you get a KeyError
    (or an IndexError!), return the default value instead.
    """

# Call it this way:
get_from_tree(response, ["foo", "bar", "baz", "quux"], "default")
</code></pre>

<p>The function was much easier to understand, which lowered the barrier to
adoption by the members of our team. …</p></span></p></div></div>

    <meta itemprop="description" content="A fast concurrent persistent key-value store and log, in C# and C++. Latest release v1.7.4">
    
    

    <section itemprop="text">
      <p>Managing large application state easily, resiliently, and with high performance is one of the hardest
problems in the cloud today. The FASTER project offers two artifacts to help tackle this problem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>FASTER Log</strong> is a high-performance concurrent persistent recoverable log, iterator, and random 
reader library in C#. It supports very frequent commit operations at low latency, and can quickly saturate 
disk bandwidth. It supports both sync and async interfaces, handles disk errors, and supports checksums. Learn 
more about using the FASTER Log in C# <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterlog-basics/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>FASTER KV</strong> is a concurrent key-value store + cache (available in C# and C++) that is designed for point 
lookups and heavy updates. FASTER supports data larger than memory, by leveraging fast external 
storage (local or cloud). It also supports consistent recovery using a new checkpointing technique that lets 
applications trade-off performance for commit latency. Learn more about the FASTER KV in C# 
<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-basics/">here</a>. For the FASTER C++ port, check <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-cpp/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<ol>
  <li>Latch-free cache-optimized index, in FASTER KV.</li>
  <li>A fast persistent recoverable append-only log based on fine-grained epoch protection for concurrency, 
in FASTER Log.</li>
  <li>Unique “hybrid record log” design in FASTER KV, that combines the above log with in-place updates, to 
shape the memory working set and retain performance.</li>
  <li>Architecture as a component that can be embedded in multi-threaded cloud apps.</li>
  <li>Asynchronous non-blocking recovery model based on group commit.</li>
  <li>A rich extensible storage device abstraction called <code>IDevice</code>, with implementations for local
storage, cloud storage, tiered storage, and sharded storage.</li>
</ol>

<p>For standard benchmarks where the working set fits in main memory, we found FASTER KV to achieve
significantly higher throughput than current systems, and match or exceed the performance of pure 
in-memory data structures while offering more functionality. See our <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/td-research-papers/">research papers</a>
for more details. We also have a detailed analysis of C# FASTER KV performance in a wiki page 
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/wiki/Performance-of-FASTER-in-C%23">here</a>. The performance of the 
C# and C++ versions of FASTER is very similar. FASTER Log is also extremely fast, capable of saturating modern
NVMe SSDs using less than a core of CPU, and scaling well in a multi-threaded setting.</p>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We now support variable-length keys and values in FasterKV C# via <code>Memory&lt;byte&gt;</code> and more generally <code>Memory&lt;T&gt; where T : unmanaged</code> as key/value/input types. We also added
a new type called <code>SpanByte</code> to represent variable-length keys and values. See the sample <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/tree/master/cs/samples/StoreVarLenTypes">here</a> for details on these capabilities. This is in addition to the existing object-log support for class types.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support C# async in FASTER KV (and FASTER Log). See the guides for <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-basics/">FasterKV</a> and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterlog-basics/">FasterLog</a>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Understanding and managing storage in Linux is essential. There are several key concepts and commands for working with block storage.</p> <p><span>If you are an absolute beginner in configuring storage on Linux, then this article is for you.</span></p><p>Here we will discuss:</p><ul><li>Block storage device naming and the <code>/dev</code> directory</li><li>Disk partitioning</li><li>Creating and mounting filesystems</li><li>Logical Volume Manager (LVM)</li></ul><ol></ol><h2><span id="Prerequisites"></span>Prerequisites<span></span></h2><ul><li>A server running Linux preferably CentOS 7 or higher</li><li>At least 2 free storage devices</li></ul><h2><span id="Introduction"></span>Introduction<span></span></h2><p>Every physical server or virtual machine has some directly attached block devices. These can be HDD, SSD, or USB Flash drives.</p><p>Whenever a new block device is inserted into the system, the available capacity is not immediately accessible. In other words, files and directories cannot be directly created on the device.</p><p>Some basic configuration is required to make the storage space available. It includes creating partitions, creating filesystems, and mounting.</p><p>Before we start discussing the commands relative to these operations, let’s talk about the <code>/dev</code> directory and block device naming.</p><h2><span id="Block_storage_device_naming"></span>Block storage device naming<span></span></h2><p>Linux handles storage devices as files. These files are stored under the <code>/dev</code> directory. It’s critical to understand this concept because most storage commands take files from this directory as their arguments. Many system programs also use these files as the interface for Input/Output or I/O operations with the block devices.</p><p>Whenever a new block device is inserted or detected, the system automatically creates a new corresponding file under the directory <code>/dev</code>.</p><p>The name of this file depends on several things. Most importantly, it depends on the device bus type and the order in which the device was inserted relative to the other devices.</p><p>For example, if the bus type is SCSI or SATA, the first half of the file name is <code>sd</code>. The other half is a letter assigned in alphabetical order depending on the order in which the device was detected.</p><p>The first, second, and third SCSI devices on a system are named <code>sda</code>, <code>sdb</code>, and <code>sdc</code>, respectively.</p><p>Devices with other bus types are subject to slightly different naming rules. For NVMe, which is a modern bus type, the first part of the device name is <code>nvme</code>. There is also a bus number added in the middle. The final part is a letter and a number, which indicate the order of detection. For example: <code>nvme0n1</code> or <code>nvme0n2</code>.</p><p>We can list the <code>/dev</code> directory content to get an overview of all the block devices present on the system.</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">ls /dev</pre><p><img width="880" height="162" src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40.png" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40-300x55.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40-768x141.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40-300x55.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-40-768x141.png 768w"></p><p>There are many files, including <code>sda</code>, <code>sdb</code>, <code>sda1</code>, <code>sda2</code>, <code>nvme0n1</code>, and <code>nvme0n2</code>.</p><p>Note that <code>/dev </code>also includes other files that are not related to storage devices.</p><p><code>sda</code> and <code>sdb</code> are block devices. However, <code>sda1</code> and <code>sda2</code> don’t represent actual block devices. They represent partitions, which are discussed next.</p><h2><span id="Partitioning"></span>Partitioning<span></span></h2><h3><span id="What_is_partitioning"></span>What is partitioning<span></span></h3><p>Partitioning is the operation of dividing the block device into logical block devices called partitions. It is the first operation to do before we can use the disk.</p><p>To list all disks and partitions present on the system, use the command:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">lsblk</pre><p><img width="880" height="286" src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41.png" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41-300x98.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41-768x250.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41-300x98.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-41-768x250.png 768w"></p><p><code>lsblk</code> shows a clear tree structure of disks and their partitions. Also, the “type” column of the output indicates whether the line represents a disk, partition, or LVM. (LVM type is an advanced storage scheme that is discussed at the end)</p><p>There are mainly two partitioning schemes: the Master Boot Record (MBR) and the GUID Partition Table (GPT). MBR is a legacy partitioning scheme, but it is still used. It is limited to a maximum disk size of 2 TiB. GPT partitioning is preferred because it breaks the limit of the 2 TiB disks and introduces other enhancements.</p><h3><span id="How_to_create_a_partition"></span>How to create a partition<span></span></h3><p>The<code> fdisk</code> command is used to create MBR partitions, while the <code>gdisk</code> command is used to create GPT partitions. Both are interactive commands and are very similar.</p><p>These commands create a partition table on the first few sectors of a disk. (With GPT, the partition table is also backed up at the last few disk sectors).</p><p>This table contains all the information about the partitions. For example, it includes the sector addresses where every partition begins and ends. (A sector is the minimum read/write block size used by disks, it’s usually 512 Bytes).</p><p>Let’s see an example.

A partition without a file system can be seen as just a long array of sectors.<code> </code>The filesystem is a logical abstraction layer that enables the creation of a hierarchy of files and directories.</p><p>There are many types of filesystems. The most widely used in Linux are ext4 and xfs. xfs is the default file system on modern Red Hat and CentOS distributions, while Ubuntu uses ext4.</p><h3><span id="Creating_a_Filesystem"></span>Creating a Filesystem<span></span></h3><p>Let’s continue with our example. We will create an xfs file system on the <code>sdb1</code> partition that we have already created. The command to make a filesystem is <code>mkfs</code>. It uses the -t argument to specify the filesystem type.</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">mkfs -t xfs /dev/sdb1</pre><p><img width="979" height="261" src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47.png" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47.png 979w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47-300x80.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47-768x205.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47.png 979w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47-300x80.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-47-768x205.png 768w"></p><h3><span id="Mounting_a_Filesystem"></span>Mounting a Filesystem<span></span></h3><p>After creating the filesystem, we are one more step away from utilizing the partition storage space. That step is mounting.</p><p>Mounting a filesystem is the operation of linking the filesystem created on top of a partition to the system’s file hierarchy. It includes choosing a directory on the file hierarchy to host the filesystem built on the partition. This directory is called a mount point.</p><p>Let’s create a new mount point called “data” and mount the <code>sdb1</code> filesystem under <code>/data</code></p><p>To confirm the success of the mount operation, we can list all the mounted filesystems by using the command below:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">mkdir /data
mount /dev/sdb1 /data
df -h</pre><p><img width="880" height="365" src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48.png" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48-300x124.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48-768x319.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48-300x124.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-48-768x319.png 768w"></p><p>The last line indicates that the filesystem has been mounted under <code>/data</code> directory. Now it can be used to store files. All files created under <code>/data</code> directory are stored in the <code>sdb1</code> partition.</p><p>Note that the xfs file system by default occupies some of the available space as metadata, which explains the used 33MB.</p><p>However, a manually created mount with the mount command does not survive a reboot. In most cases, the mount should last after a reboot. The mount parameters must be written in the file <code>/etc/fstab </code>to mount a partition persistently.</p><p><code>/etc/fstab</code> by default contains all the persistent mounts required by the system. The root user can further add user required mounts. Let’s see the content of this file:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">cat /etc/fstab</pre><p><img width="880" height="281" src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49.png" data-src="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49.png" data-srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49-300x96.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49-768x245.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" srcset="https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49.png 880w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49-300x96.png 300w, https://y7c3f9y2.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/word-image-49-768x245.png 768w"></p><p>Each line in this file that doesn’t start with the hash character “#” corresponds to a mount, which is automatically created during the boot process. Each line contains 6 fields:</p><ol><li><code>Block device</code>: device file such as <code>/dev/sdb1</code>. Note that other device identifiers such as UUID also exist.</li><li><code>Mount point</code>.</li><li><code>Filesystem type</code>: xfs, ext4, vfat … etc.</li><li><code>Mount options</code>: these options are handed over to the mount command at boot. The value “defaults” is usually selected unless some different mount options are required.</li><li><code>Backup</code>: this field takes the value 1 to enable filesystem backup at boot or 0 to disable it. The backup is done by the <code>dump</code> utility. Most systems do not come with the dump program installed by default, so this field is usually set to 0.</li><li><code>Filesystem check</code>: this field takes the value 1 to enable filesystem check at boot or 0 to disable it.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		        
<p>On almost every product I’ve worked on, we’ve relied on a core group of active users to steer the development via great feedback and feature ideas. At Shapeways, <strong>most of our highly successful features came directly from our community.</strong> People who love your product are heavily invested in making it better. They will put in the time if you give them the space to do so and take their feedback seriously.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll share how teams have recruited, setup, and ran customer advisory councils (also called a customer advisory boards) that brought us a regular drip feed of high quality feedback. I’ll also share the mistakes we made along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>To get the most relevant feedback, pick users who represent your target audience.</li>
<li>PM should start the council and run it for a few months then hand it off once it’s generating high quality feedback.</li>
<li>I recommend group / synchronous (e.g. video calls) sessions so you can ask follow-up questions and other users can chime in with their thoughts.</li>
<li>You should actually listen to their feedback (and implement it). Otherwise they will stop participating.</li>
<li>Bonus points if you can give them early access to features so they feel special (and you get early signal).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why start an advisory council</h2>
<p>As your userbase grows, it becomes very challenging to understand what people actually think about your product. You’ll quickly get to a point where you are relying on data and expensive user research studies just to keep a pulse on what job people are hiring your product for and where it’s falling over. The beauty of an advisory council is that you don’t just get to hear from some of your best users, they’ll gather feedback on your behalf from other community members. It is by far the most effective way to start to get real stories from real users that are passionate about improving your product to meet their needs. I’m not suggesting that it’s the only signal you should care about, but it should be a tool in your toolbox alongside data and formal user studies.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how advisory counciles drove impact:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.etsy.com/seller-handbook/article/introducing-etsys-2016-seller-advisory/37704589529">Etsy launched their ‘Seller Advisory Board’ in 2016</a> with 15 sellers picked from a pool of 600 applicants and asked them one simple question: “What’s the most important thing to your buyers?” After some deliberation the group agreed: the speed of the website. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCBMxCIgNcw">Video Interview</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://community.ebay.com/t5/Professional-eBay-Sellers/PESA-members-in-eBay-s-Voices-program/gpm-p/7829699">Ebay had a ‘Voices’ program where they fly out power users for a multi-day summit</a> filled with one-hour feedback sessions. Voices members were steering eBay feedback as early as 2000. <a href="https://www.ecommercebytes.com/C/abblog/blog.pl?/pl/2009/8/1250740707.html">The voices program was closed in 2009</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to start an advisory council</h2>
<p><strong>Identifying your council</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to identify who from your audience should join your council. You should start by defining who your target / mvp audience is and then filtering within that group. If you want to serve pro surfers from Australia, filter your userbase to that group and then look at their activity. <strong>You want users who are active, vocal, and constructive and represent your target audience.</strong> I typically will look at forums or customer service conversations to hand pick the first group. If your product has an interactive format (e.g. a game or a social media app), you should be able to spot folks using your product publicly. You want to avoid users who are constantly negative (they will drown out the voices of those who want to help) and have needs that are drastically different than one you plan to fulfill (e.g. if you are building a consumer 3d printing company for dog tags, you should include cat owners but not enterprise auto manufacturers).</p>
<p><strong>Recruiting members</strong></p>
<p>Reach out to each member and send them a personal e-mail or note. You need to make it clear that you’re handpicking them (so they feel special), that you value their input (so they feel wanted), and that you plan to involve them in the development process (so they feel like a part of the team). It’s important not to set expectations (e.g. we will ship your feature) because there’s a good chance you won’t use their feedback in the timeframe they expect. If you have a specific time commitment in mind or rewards you can offer (see '<a href="#council-love-you">How to get your council to love you</a>' below), make them known upfront. I strongly recommend avoiding any NDA’s if possible. Yes, you’re letting them behind the curtain of the developent process, but you should be able to keep any extreme trade secrets out of the way and you WANT them to tell their friends about how awesome it was to be a part of this. This is a great way to grow via word of mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Contacting members</strong></p>
<p>Don’t use fancy tools like mailing lists or contact forms to communicate with your council. These make it feel very formal and like they’re just on another mailing list. You want them to feel like part of the team. Either stick to e-mail or use something simple like a Facebook group or Slack channel that facilitates group interaction. Make sure each email sounds personal and use an e-mail address that supports reply-to so they can send you open ended questions or feedback. You’d be surprised how many great ideas start as a random email reply to an event invite.</p>
<p><strong>Who should run the council?</strong></p>
<p>There are a ton of upfront decisions that need to be made to ensure that you get good feedback that is useful to the product team. Because of this, I strongly recommend that the PM sets up the council along with any early processes and facilitation. This will ensure that you personally get value from the group. Once the process is humming and you’re regularly getting great feedback, you can hand it off to  I also suggest inviting at least your designer(s) and any eng that are product-minded. It’s more powerful to hear the ideas/feedback directly from the source than for you to proxy their comments.</p>
<h2>How to run the advisory council</h2>
<p>Ok, you’ve chosen your council and they’ve agreed to help. Now what do you actually do together?</p>
<p><strong>Structure and cadence</strong></p>
<p>There are a few options for how you run your council. You can choose between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group vs. 1:1 setting</li>
<li>Synchronous vs. asynchronous</li>
<li>Scheduled vs. ad hoc</li>
<li>Video vs text</li>
<li>Structured vs unstructured</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/gather-great-feedback-from-power-users/lebowski.jpg">
<p><strong>I’ve found that getting as close to ‘a group of people sitting in the room shooting the shit’ as possible is key.</strong></p>
<p>I recommend a lightly structured synchronous group discussion over video. This allows you to facilitate in realtime and keep the vibe lighthearted (so it doesn’t feel like work) but still dig into meaty questions and hear multiple perspectives. To make this work, you’ll need to schedule time in advance and have a rough set of questions you want to cover as a starting point. You’ll also need to make sure that your team knows the ground rules: Can anyone ask questions? Are certain topics off limits? How do we talk about what’s in development right now?</p>
<p><strong>Facilitating the discussion</strong></p>
<p>When the discussion begins, people will look to you to lead it. Treat this like leading a meeting and assume that you need to drive the majority of the conversation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the meeting with a loose agenda (e.g. “We will share a few recent feature developments to get your thoughts, we’ll then open the floor for Q&amp;A, we’ll leave 10 mins for you to ask questions”)</li>
<li>Make it clear when you’re calling on specific people vs when you want anyone to speak</li>
<li>Develop a protocol like ‘hand raising’ but online and try to enforce it. Many community members are going to be introverted and will get drowned out by the few talkative ones. Give everyone space.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most important part here is the Q&amp;A. You should come armed with a set of questions way too long for you to ever get through. They should typically have open ended answers (like most user research questions) and be very explicit. Try not to hand wave like “If we built a feature that kinda let you sorta do X, would you use it?” Instead focus on specific questions related to their workflow, their problems, and how they use your product.</p>
<p>One of the best questions I’ve asked is “What step of your workflow takes the longest and why?” <strong>(because it led to specific bottlenecks in our app that we could optimize)</strong> and one of the worst questions I’ve asked is “What is the one feature you want more than anything?” <strong>(because you will get a bunch of random not-thoughtful responses).</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://firstround.com/review/the-power-of-interviewing-customers-the-right-way-from-twitters-ex-vp-product/">Michael Sippy, VP Product at Twitter, keeps his sessions laser focused on problems</a>: <em>“The point is that we’re supposed to be solving a problem for people, and understanding that problem on a really fundamental level,” says Sippey. “Only then can you create a product that actually resonates with the market, and a business that can scale beyond any one feature.”</em></p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to let the discussion wander, let multiple community members answer the same question, or let them discuss amongst themselves. One member will often be inspired by another and share really helpful insights, so make sure you encourage the group to interact.</p>
<p>If you're struggling with this test, I suggest reading the book '<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mom-Test-customers-business-everyone/dp/1492180742">The Mom Test</a>' which gives a step by step guide to asking questions which will get at the pain point/problems customers are facing.</p>
<p><strong>Handling ideas during downtime</strong></p>
<p>When your council isn’t meeting, your community members will still have ideas and feedback. I’ve found that creating an asynchronous forum (e.g. Slack, Facebook group, etc.) can be useful for sporadic ideas so they don’t get lost. Try not to create a contract like “we will respond to your slack in 24h!” but your team does need to respond. If your users feel like they’re throwing their ideas into the ether, they won’t continue to do so. I typically will respond to the async forum once per day and then refer back to it when I am writing questions for the next get-together.</p>
<p>Asynchronous groups are great for getting quick answers to specific quetions. <a href="https://firstround.com/review/start-up-on-the-right-foot-build-a-customer-advisory-board/">TalentBin used their council for small data-driven asks</a>: <em>“We wanted to ask, 'What are the average contract values you guys sell?' and get a quick response, so we chose 10 of the people who have come to all our dinners and who we felt …</em></p></div></div>

<p>If you work with databases you are probably familiar with B-Tree indexes. They are used to enforce unique and primary-key constraints, and are the default index type in most database engines. If you work with text, geography or other complex types in PostgreSQL, you may have dipped your toes into GIN or GIST indexes. If you manage a read intensive database (or just follow this blog), you may also be familiar with BRIN indexes.</p>
<p>There is another type of index you are probably not using, and may have never even heard of. It is wildly unpopular, and until a few PostgreSQL versions ago it was highly discouraged and borderline unusable, but under some circumstances it can out-perform even a B-Tree index.</p>
<p><strong>In this article we re-introduce the Hash index in PostgreSQL!</strong></p>

<h2 id="hash-index"><a href="#hash-index">Hash Index</a></h2>
<p>Just like the name suggests, Hash indexes in PostgreSQL use a form of the hash table data structure. Hash table is a common data structure in many programming languages. For example, a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping" rel="noopener">Dict</a> in Python, a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html" rel="noopener">HashMap</a> in Java or the new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" rel="noopener">Map</a> type in JavaScript.</p>
<p>To understand how you can benefit from Hash indexes, it's best to understand how they work.</p>
<h3 id="hash-function"><a href="#hash-function">Hash Function</a></h3>
<p>Hash indexes use a <em>hash function</em>. PostgreSQL's hash function maps any database value to a 32-bit integer, the <em>hash code</em> (about 4 billion possible hash codes). A good hash function can be computed quickly and "jumbles" the input uniformly across its entire range.</p>
<p>The hash codes are divided to a limited number of <em>buckets</em>. The buckets map the hash codes to the actual table rows.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A simple hash function for an integer type is modulo: divide a number by another number, and the remainder is the hash code. For example, to divide values across 3 buckets you can use the hash function <code>mod(3)</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>mod</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>bucket</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>generate_series</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>
<span> n  │ bucket</span>
<span>────┼────────</span>
<span>  1 │      1</span>
<span>  2 │      2</span>
<span>  3 │      0</span>
<span>  4 │      1</span>
<span>  5 │      2</span>
<span>  6 │      0</span>
<span>  7 │      1</span>
<span>  8 │      2</span>
<span>  9 │      0</span>
<span> 10 │      1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When a new value is added to the index, PostgreSQL applies the hash function to the value and puts the hash code and a pointer to the tuple in the appropriate bucket. In the example above using the hash function <code>mod(3)</code>, if you insert the value <code>5</code> the index entry will be added to bucket <code>2</code>, because <code>5 % 3 = 2</code>.</p>
<p>When you query a value using a Hash index, PostgreSQL does the opposite. It takes the value and applies the hash function to determine which bucket may hold matching tuples. Once the bucket is identified, PostgreSQL will fetch the tuples referenced in that bucket and match them against your query.</p>
<h3 id="hash-collision"><a href="#hash-collision">Hash Collision</a></h3>
<p>You may have noticed that multiple values can map to the same bucket; this is called a <em>collision</em>. For example, the hash function <code>mod(3)</code> returned the hash code <code>2</code> for the values <code>2</code>, <code>5</code> and <code>8</code>.</p>
<p>What PostgreSQL actually does, is to first use a hash function to produce an integer hash code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span>
    <span>hashtext</span><span>(</span><span>'text'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>hashchar</span><span>(</span><span>'c'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>hash_array</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>]),</span>
    <span>jsonb_hash</span><span>(</span><span>'{"me": "haki"}'</span><span>::</span><span>jsonb</span><span>),</span>
    <span>timestamp_hash</span><span>(</span><span>now</span><span>()</span><span>::</span><span>timestamp</span><span>);</span>

<span>─[ RECORD 1 ]──┬────────────</span>
<span>hashtext       │ -451854347</span>
<span>hashchar       │ 203891234</span>
<span>hash_array     │ -325393530</span>
<span>jsonb_hash     │ -1784498999</span>
<span>timestamp_hash │ 1082344883</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It then uses <code>mod(n_buckets)</code> to determine which bucket the tuple should be put in. This can cause multiple values to end up in the same bucket. This is why even after the bucket is identified, the database still needs to sift through the hash codes in the bucket and recheck the condition to filter only the matching tuples.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index overflow pages</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As rows are added to the index, it's possible for a bucket's primary page to fill up. In this case, additional rows are written to overflow pages. The overflow pages contain index entries that did not fit in the bucket's primary page.</p>
<h3 id="index-split"><a href="#index-split">Index Split</a></h3>
<p>At some point, the database can decide it needs to split a bucket into two buckets. PostgreSQL uses special hash functions that ensure values in a bucket can be split into exactly two buckets. When a bucket is split, additional storage is allocated to the index.</p>

<p>Luckily, PostgreSQL does all the heavy lifting for you, so you don't have to decide what hash function to use, or how many buckets there are.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the internals of Hash indexes in PostgreSQL, check out the <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/access/hash/README" rel="noopener">readme on "Hash Indexing"</a>.</p>

<p>Hash indexes were discouraged prior to PostgreSQL 10. If you read the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/indexes-types.html" rel="noopener">index type documentation for PostgreSQL 9.6</a> you'll find a nasty warning about Hash indexes. According to the warning, Hash indexes are not written to the WAL so they cannot be maintained in replicas, and they are not automatically available after a crash, so you need to manually rebuild them.</p>
<p>Starting at PostgreSQL 10 these limitations were resolved, and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/release-10.html#id-1.11.6.20.5.3.3" rel="noopener">Hash indexes are no longer discouraged</a>.</p>
<h3 id="creating-hash-indexes"><a href="#creating-hash-indexes">Creating Hash Indexes</a></h3>
<p>Now that you know how Hash indexes work in PostgreSQL, you are ready to see them in action. To illustrate, we'll create an imaginary URL shortening service.</p>
<p>A URL shortener service, such as "bit.ly" or the late "goo.gl", provides a short random URL that points to a longer URL. For example, you can have the short url <code>https://short.url/hb9837</code> point to the longer URL <code>https://hakibenita.com/automating-the-boring-stuff-in-django-using-the-check-framework</code>. We'll call the <code>hb9837</code> part of the short URL the <code>key</code>.</p>
<p>To implement your URL shortening service, create a table to store the mapping between the keys and the full URLs:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span> <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>
    <span>key</span> <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table includes an auto incrementing primary key <code>id</code>, a text field for <code>key</code>, and a <code>url</code> field containing the full URL.</p>
<p>Next, create a B-Tree and a Hash index on both fields:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_key_hash_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>hash</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>UNIQUE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_key_btree_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>btree</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_url_hash_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>hash</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_url_btree_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>btree</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You might have noticed that the B-Tree on <code>key</code> is a unique index, but the Hash index is not. This is because Hash indexes currently cannot be used to enforce unique constraints.</p>
<h3 id="hash-index-size"><a href="#hash-index-size">Hash Index Size</a></h3>
<p>The first thing you want to do is to compare the size of a Hash index to the size of a similar B-Tree index:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>DO</span> <span>$$</span>

    <span>END</span> <span>LOOP</span><span>;</span>
<span>END</span><span>;</span>
<span>$$</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To get a better sense of how both indexes behave, keep track of the size of the indexes as rows are inserted to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate 1,000,000 short urls one by one</li>
<li>Every 10,000 rows log the size of all four indexes</li>
<li>Use <code>uuid_generate_v4</code> from the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/uuid-ossp.html" rel="noopener">uuid-ossp</a> package to generate UUIDs as keys</li>
<li>Generate a long URL from a 6-digit domain so it's not unique, but almost unique</li>
</ul>
<p>Running the script on PostgreSQL 13 and plotting the results gives the following chart:</p>
<figure><img alt="Hash vs. B-Tree index size" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/01-postgresql-hash-index.png"><figcaption>Hash vs. B-Tree index size</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The chart provides several interesting observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Hash index is smaller than the B-Tree index</strong>: Almost all along the way, the Hash index on both fields is smaller than the size of the corresponding B-Tree index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index grows in increments</strong>: Unlike the B-Tree index that seems to grow linearlly as rows are inserted to the table, the Hash index grows in sudden increments. These sudden increments are caused when a split is triggered to allocate space for more buckets. When that space runs out, another split is triggered and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index size is not affected by the size of the indexed value</strong>: A Hash index stores the hash codes of the index field values. A B-Tree on the other hand, stores the actual value of the indexed field in its leaves, so the size of the indexed value affects the size of a B-Tree index, but not the size of a Hash index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index size is not affected by the selectivity of the indexed value</strong>: The selectivity of the URL field is different than that of the key field, which is almost unique, but the Hash index on both fields is the same size. A size of a B-Tree index on the other hand, can vary based on the selectivity of the data (see note below about "B-Tree deduplication").</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>B-Tree deduplication</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 13 introduced a new <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/btree-implementation.html#BTREE-DEDUPLICATION" rel="noopener">B-Tree deduplication</a> mechanism that reduces the size of a B-Tree indexes with many duplicate values. In the chart above, the size of the B-Tree index on the <code>url</code> field is smaller than the size of the index on the <code>key</code> field because it has fewer unique values.</p>
<figure><img alt="Hash vs. B-Tree index size on PostgreSQL 12" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/02-postgresql-hash-index.png"><figcaption>Hash vs. B-Tree index size on PostgreSQL 12</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you run the same script with deduplication disabled, or on PostgreSQL versions prior to 13, you'll see that the size of the index is the same (as long as values are the same size).</p>
</div>
<p>The script you ran before imitates a workload of an OLTP-like system, where single rows are constantly being added to the table. This is the size of the indexes after the script finished:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>\di+</span> <span>shorturl*</span>
<span>          Name           │ Type  │ Table    │Size</span>

<![CDATA[Hacking Bitcoin Wallets Through JSON Parser Bugs]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I didn’t steal any bitcoin. I’ve reported it to the appropriate company and they were shocked at how a bug this simple could have left their wallets empty.
Using different libraries to parse formats like JSON is a bad idea and can expose you to a type of attack that relies on different interpretations of the content by each parser. The microservice pattern introduces the ability to use amalgation of programming languages, but that typically also means differences in parsers.</p>


<p>There’s a lot of love for the microservice pattern and rightfully so. In essence, the microservice pattern tends to lead to greater seperation of privileges and access.
The code that decodes media objects such as videos and images runs in its own microservice, seperating it from the code that can access the database storing your VISA card credentials for example.</p>

<p>But the advocacy for the microservice pattern isn’t only coming from the security perspective.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The microservices architecture allowed Netflix to greatly speed up development and deployment of its platform and services. The company was able to build and test global services on a large scale without impacting the current system and they could quickly rollback if there were problems. The microservices architecture also allowed Netflix to create about 30+ independent engineering teams that could work on different release schedules which helped increase the agility and productivity of the development process. [0]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main driver for organisations to adopt the microservice pattern is to enable faster development and deployments because each team operates more independently.
Every team can pick their own stack (language, libraries, etc..) to use in order to optimize their particular workload.</p>


<p>I consider it to be a better pattern than the monolith if applied correctly.
But the step back is that it may breath new life into an age-old security bug: parser differences.</p>

<p>Here’s my advice for anyone out there building microservices:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The JSON format leaves gaps for interpretation so make sure that all parsers across all microservices are using a single way to interpret the content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you don’t quite catch what I’m trying to explain, here’s an example:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "method": "sendtoaddress",
    "method": "listtransactions",
    "params": [...]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how the <code>method</code> key is presented twice in this JSON payload, but which method of the two will it eventually execute?
This the gap for interpretation that parsers silently deal with. This rather silent assumption can be a great attack vector.</p>

<p>Can we abuse the difference in interpretation by parser X used in microservice 1, which feeds data to parser Y in microservice 2?</p>



<p>This is an actual bugreport that I’ve submitted to a business that operates cryptocurrency nodes that a customer can rent.
But one of their options allows exposing a limited interface of <code>bitcoind</code>, behind a custom firewall that blocks sensitive methods.</p>
<pre><code>USER   ----&gt; [ FIREWALL ]    ----&gt;    [ bitcoind ]
</code></pre>

<p>The firewall microservice maintained a whitelist of methods (<code>getblock</code>, etc..) which was supposed to reject attempts to execute senstitive or malicious commands.
If it passed the filter, it would then pass the <em>COMPLETE</em> payload to the <code>bitcoind</code> daemon, which would then execute and return the results.</p>

<p>Here’s an overview to two parsers at play:</p>
<ul>
  <li>firewall: LIFO (OpenResty from <strong>Lua</strong>)</li>
  <li>bitcoind: FIFO (Boost (?) json parser from <strong>C++</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s for example attempt to get the balance of the bitcoind node:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "method": "getbalance"
}
</code></pre>

<p>We are met with the following response:</p>
<pre><code>403 Forbidden
</code></pre>

<p>At this point I wondered whether we could bypass it, and naturally the first idea that I could come up with was setting it twice.</p>
<pre><code>{
    "method": "getblock",
    "method": "getbalance"
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>403 Forbidden
</code></pre>
<p>It failed, but luckily I attempted to switch them around, just to be sure.
This time we hit the jackpot!</p>

<pre><code>{
    "method": "getbalance",
    "method": "getblock"
}
</code></pre>
<p>It returns the getbalance information instead of the error!</p>
<pre><code>{
    "result": 5.35784803,
    "error": null,
    "id": null
}
</code></pre>

<p>The firewall is using a <code>LIFO</code> style parser, which returned <code>getblock</code> as the value of the key <code>method</code>. It accepted the request as valid and forwarded it to the <code>bitcoind</code> daemon which uses a <code>FIFO</code> style parser resulting in <code>getbalance</code> to be used as the value of the key <code>method</code></p>

<p>Nice.</p>

      <p>
        Web Monetization is an API that allows websites to request small
        payments from users facilitated by the browser and the user's Web
        Monetization provider.

        <p>
          This specification is a work in progress within the community on the
          best shape it should take. Please see the
          <a href="https://webmonetization.org/docs/explainer.html">explainer</a> for more info.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specification reflects the desired end-state of the Web Monetization
          APIs as currently anticipated and agreed to between the contributors.
          The specification is being prepared here, in this format, to collect the
          input of the Web community and prepare the work to ultimately follow the
          W3C standards track should it have the necessary support to do so.

    <section id="relation-to-other-protocols">
      <h2>Relation to other protocols</h2>
      <p>
        The W3C have published two payments related APIs for browsers, the
        [[[payment-Request]]] and the [[[Payment-Handler]]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason this API is not using the [[[payment-Request]]] directly is
        that Web Monetization is intended for continuous payments rather than
        discrete payments. It is also designed to <em>not</em> have any user
        interaction: It is intended to provide a direct alternative to
        advertisements, rather than an alternative to traditional e-commerce
        checkout methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        In future, some changes will be required to the [[[payment-Request]]]
        and the [[[Payment-Handler]]] to support Web Monetization. This API
        brings the necessary capabilities to user agents in a manner that can
        integrate with existing payments APIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        With advertisements, the user agent decides whether to display the ads
        and the user decides whether to engage with the ads. With Web
        Monetization, the user's provider decides whether to pay the site and,
        if so, how much to pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web Monetization makes use of
        <abbr title="Simple Payment Setup Protocol">SPSP</abbr> on top of
        <abbr title="Interledger Protocol">ILP</abbr>/[[[STREAM]]] to provide a
        high-level way to send money and data, while still providing tremendous
        flexibility.

              The <a>user agent</a> generates a fresh
              <strong>random</strong> UUID (version 4) and uses this as a
              Monetization ID. This MUST be regenerated upon dynamic changes to
              the meta tags and MUST be unique per page load in order to avoid
              user tracking.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <a>user agent</a> passes these payment details to the user's

            <li>
              The provider resolves the Payment Setup Endpoint and begins to
              pay. The provider MAY be acting from a different machine from the
              user. Cookies and session information MUST NOT be carried with any
              requests made to resolve the Payment Setup Endpoint, with the
              exception of the Monetization ID.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  With the <code>destination_account</code> and
                  <code>shared_secret</code> fetched from the SPSP query, a
                  [[[STREAM]]] connection is established. A single [[[STREAM]]]
                  is opened on this connection, and a positive SendMax is set.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The provider SHOULD set their SendMax high enough that it is
                  never reached, and make payment adjustments by limiting
                  throughput.
                </li>

            <li>
              Once the [[[STREAM]]] connection has fulfilled an ILP packet with
              a non-zero amount, the provider notifies the browser:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The <a>user agent</a> sets
                  <code>document.monetization.state</code> to
                  <code>started</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This MUST occur before the `start` event is fired.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This event is a {{ MonetizationStartEvent }}
                  containing the Payment Setup Endpoint and the Monetization ID
                  as properties.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The <a>user agent</a> also emits a {{ progress }} event from
                  <code>document.monetization</code>, corresponding to this
                  first packet.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Payment continues for the lifetime of a given meta tag (or
              semantically equivalent)
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The provider MAY decide to stop/start payment at any time,
                  e.g. if the user is idle, backgrounds the page, or instructs
                  the browser to do so.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the [[[STREAM]]] connection is severed, the provider will
                  redo the SPSP query to the same Payment Setup Endpoint as
                  before with the same Monetization ID. The <a>user agent</a>
                  MUST NOT re-process the `&lt;meta&gt;` Tags Set.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each time a packet with a non-zero amount is fulfilled, the
                  provider notifies the browser, and the browser emits a
                  {{ MonetizationProgressEvent }}
                  on
                  <code>document.monetization</code>. The event has details of
                  the packet.

                <li>
                  When a stream is closed the
                  <code>document.monetization.state</code> MUST be set back to

      <h3 id="payment-handler-flow">Payment Handler Flow</h3>
      <p>
        A provider can be implemented as a Payment Handler supporting the
        'webmonetization' payment method (The payment method specification for
        this payment method is still under development as it is dependant on
        changes to the Payment Handler API that support streaming payments).
        Communication between the browser and the provider would use this flow.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          After parsing the `&lt;meta&gt;` Tags Set, the browser creates a new
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentrequest-interface">PaymentRequest</a>
          object with the following
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#dom-paymentmethoddata">PaymentMethodData</a>
          argument.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <pre>        {
          "supportedMethods": "webmonetization",
          "data": {
            "paymentPointer": "&lt;payment pointer parsed from meta tag&gt;"
          }
        }
      </pre>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <a>user agent</a> calls <code>.show()</code> on this
          PaymentRequest, triggering the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-handler/">PaymentHandler</a>
          for <code>webmonetization</code>. This PaymentHandler is how the
          browser communicates to the provider.
          <ul>
            <li>
              The return value of <code>.show()</code> MUST return a Promise,
              and must also implement the {{ EventTarget }}
              interface. The provider will emit
              {{ MonetizationStartEvent }} and
              {{ MonetizationProgressEvent }} events from this Promise to
              communicate to the browser when payment occurs. The Promise MUST
              NOT resolve, because Web Monetization continues for the entire
              lifetime of a given meta tag. The Promise MAY reject if there is
              an error preventing the …</li></ul></li></ul></section></div>

                <section>
                    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Document management is a core requirement for all sorts of regulated institutions - finance, telecom, healthcare, government and others. These institutions need to manage and retain an ever growing number of documents and regulatory guidelines often require these documents to be stored for a very long term (7-10 years). <br></p><p>Take for example, KYC (Know Your Customer) documents. Anyone starting a relationship with a financial institution needs to provide KYC documents. These documents are then stored with the institution as long as the relationship exists and even beyond that for several years. <br></p><p>Traditional document management systems are simply no longer able to provide the scale, cost efficiency and reliability that such use cases require. This has triggered the move to modern, cloud native solutions. <br></p><p>In this document we go through various challenges with traditional document management solutions and then look at the next generation solutions that some of our customers have developed.</p><h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2><h3 id="closed-monolith">Closed Monolith</h3><p>Traditional document management systems are monolithic, closed systems. This means IT teams can not take advantage of new paradigms like segregation of concerns (i.e. microservices), API access, disaggregating storage and compute, among others. Adding features or scaling such systems simply means paying for new licenses. <br></p><p>Additionally, these systems are built as blackboxes with little to no extensionsibility. So, the IT teams have to work around these tools to achieve their intended workflow.</p><h3 id="limited-system-integration-capabilities">Limited System Integration Capabilities</h3><p>Traditional Document management systems are inherently closed, with little to no API integration to plug into external systems, or plugin other tools. This creates a vendor lock-in, higher the number of documents a system manages, the tougher it becomes to get rid of the system.<br></p><p>This is orthogonal to the modern approach of native API integrations with other systems to build powerful features by composition of tools and technologies..</p><h3 id="scalability">Scalability</h3><p>Typical document management systems use databases combined with file systems. Both databases and file systems are well known to have difficulties in handling large data volumes. The scalability challenges in the underlying database and file system, invariably show up as the number of documents grows. <br></p><h2 id="solution">Solution</h2><p>Documents are essentially unstructured blobs of varying formats and sizes, ideal for object storage platforms like MinIO. With seamless scalability, API integration with major modern data platforms to enable search, audit logs and other important features, MinIO fits right in. <br></p><p>Here we propose a highly scalable approach to build a modern, cloud-native document store.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cRg4-T5csoo6bC4Tu3wJgsPN8Q5gtYPInRokwDfZTQOOxLl3DCXtf6LA__Wzv-8ZMcCGjZAvJy_x367ASBi0QbEtd-BtiiqJ7xI3a7vW8c3NQOQFw5Vy72Jamzg9x2jKdsO8ueqm" alt=""></figure><p>Let’s take a closer look at the architecture, its components and their interaction:<br></p><ul><li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Modern JS based frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, or Svelte provide a great starting point for building the frontend for enterprise applications like this. Since all these frameworks are API driven, it is quite easy to integrate these with backend, special purpose applications like Identity and Access Management, DB, Object Storage among others. <br></li><li><strong><strong><strong>Text/Metadata Search: </strong></strong></strong>A<strong> </strong>key requirement for a document management system is to allow searching the whole document catalog for specific documents. This search may be based on document metadata (like owner-name, owner-id, document-type etc), or even based on contents of the document itself. Either way, any document metadata can be sent to text search tools like <a href="https://www.meilisearch.com/">MeiliSearch</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack">Elastic</a>. <p>Essentially, MinIO can be <a href="https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-bucket-notification-guide.html">configured to send out event notifications</a> (with object metadata) to the text search platform. This way, the search platform then has all the document metadata and a link to the actual document in MinIO. The frontend can then send the user query the text search platform and fetch the relevant document.</p><p>Apart from simple text search, the object data and metadata from MinIO can be fed to Machine Learning pipelines as explained in <a href="https://blog.min.io/hyper-scale-machine-learning-with-minio-and-tensorflow/">this blog post</a>. This opens up opportunities to analyse and understand not only the metadata but also the actual documents, opening up business insights for the teams to leverage.</p></li><li><strong><strong><strong>Webhook: </strong></strong></strong>Customer documents are secure and private objects, it is very important for the compliance or audit teams to ensure that a detailed audit log of the document is maintained. <p>MinIO can be <a href="https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/docs/logging#audit-targets">integrated with various target systems</a> to send out audit logs. MinIO webhook integration allows seamless integration with any platform that supports webhooks, while removing dependency from message queue type systems. </p><p>Additionally, MinIO ensures that events missed while the remote webook target is offline are delivered later, as and when the target comes back online. Events pending for delivery are stored securely on MinIO, making sure that the audit log doesn’t miss any entry.</p></li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Object Storage:</strong> This is the backbone of the whole system. It provides scalable, persistent storage for documents (and their multiple versions), related metadata, user-access policies among other information. There are several unique advantages with a MinIO object storage vs. generic or legacy solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ILM based Tiering &amp; Archival: Lifecycle management feature allows automatically moving data from one storage tier to another (e.g. Warm/Hot to Archival) or even expire certain objects after they are no longer required.	This allows IT teams to ensure that only the frequently accessed documents are kept in the fast tier, while the other, infrequently accessed documents are moved to archival tier which potentially uses cost effective hardware allowing almost limitless storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active-Active replication: High availability and protection from data loss is critical for document management systems. MinIO Active-Active replication comes in handy here. Users can configure the MinIO cluster to replicate objects to a remote MinIO cluster. This means IT teams can leverage a 2 DC approach to ensure data is safe from a complete DC failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cohasset certified object locking &amp; object retention: MinIO object retention and locking capabilities are certified by Cohasset. This means IT teams can be sure that MinIO software is complaint to the the appropriate regulator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Document versions: MinIO object versioning allows seamless storage of multiple versions of a document. This  maps very well to real life situations where customers may need to provide new documents due to issues in older versions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2><div><p>Document management is not immune to the advancements in cloud technologies, microservices and API-driven development. Having said that, compliance, particularly regulatory compliance does cause innovation to lag. The trend we are seeing today, however, is that major financial institutions are moving toward a model where object storage serves as the foundational element in KYC architectures. </p><p>Modern object storage is scalable, resilient, performant and in the case of MinIO, certified for object locking and retention. </p><p>We think this modern architecture is the optimal approach for regulated institutions like finance, telecom, healthcare, government. </p><p>And this is why all ten of the largest banks in the US run MinIO and eight of the ten largest banks in Europe run MinIO. </p><p>To learn more, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:hello@min.io">hello@min.io</a> and we can go into more detail than we can publicly.</p></div>

  <p>Dear Professor,</p>

  <p>I’m quite confused about the mark that came out on moodle on May.29th. I recalled getting 90 100 100 respectively for those three separate tasks during the face to face assessment, but the final mark turns out to be only 70. I remembered that the uploaded code check is said to be only a precaution check and wouldn’t have much effect on the final mark.</p>

  <p>Besides, I’m also baffled about that ‘Suspect of copying’ comment. I can assure you that I wrote all the code on my own without any help from other people or any unauthorized reference to other people’s work. Java Programming module is my favorite among all second-year courses. A lot of my time and effort is dedicated to these assignments in order to make the code as perfect as possible, and I have enjoyed every second of it. Therefore, it really hurts when I’m being regarded as suspect of copying. I’m writing this email to humbly ask for more clarification on this feedback as well as the reason why such a low score is received.</p>

  <p>Yours Sincerely,</p>

  <p>Shengwei [redacted]</p>

  <p>Dear Shengwei,</p>

  <p>The mark was decided by your marker Tom [redacted] (cc’ed).
It is true that the lab examination mark was 90 but then your
marker decided to drop to 70 upon examining your code.</p>

  <p>The key reason your source files have as first line
“package com.nicolaspepe;” which certainly raises a few eyebrows
re possible copying.</p>

  <p>Hi George,</p>

  <p>I just had a look again and since there is no other student called Nicholas Pepe, and, since I have just now realised that Nicholas Pepe is a professional footballer for Arsenal, I am willing to believe that the package name is due to the student typing in a random name when configuring the IDE, and not a result of cheating. I’ll have another look at the code and let you know.</p>

  <p>Sorry about this!</p>

  <p>Best wishes,</p>

  <p>Hi Shengwei,</p>

  <p>I’ve just had another look at your assignment. The code was generally good, well commented and demonstrated an understanding of polymorphism. You should avoid using generic classes such as Object in method declarations (use ListNode instead), but otherwise the code is fine.</p>

  <p>The reason you were given a low mark is because of the line “package com.nicholaspepe”, which implied to me that the work was plagiarised from another student - generally package names contain the person or company who wrote the code (for instance, com.johnsmith, or com.ucl.ee). However if you can explain why you have called your package “com.nicholaspepe” then I will review the mark.</p>

  <p>Best wishes,</p>

  <p>Dear [Tom],</p>

  <p>Back in August 2019 when I started learning Java, I took an online Java tutorial, saying that you can name the package with your own name or the name of a corporation. As a fan of Arsenal Football Club (the one located in North London Islington), I was really pumped at that time with the club’s record-breaking signing “Nicolas Pepe”, an Ivorian coast winger from the French Top Division. So, I decided to improvise a little bit and name my first package on IntelliJ as “com.nicolaspepe”.</p>

  <p>Since all my Java projects in year 2 are created under this package, the package name appearing at the start of all assignments is thus “com.nicolaspepe”. You can have a check on my assignment 2 code and the package name is still Nicolas Pepe. I’ve enclosed some more information regarding this footballer, and I hope that it’s useful in convincing you of my innocence.</p>

  <p>Yours Sincerely,</p>
