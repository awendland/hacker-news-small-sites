                    <p><strong><u>SALE OF SOUL AGREEMENT</u></strong></p><p>This Sale of Soul Agreement (hereafter “<strong>Agreement</strong>”) is effective as of the date upon which the party selling their soul (hereafter “<strong>Seller</strong>”) signs the contract and returns it to the party receiving the soul (hereafter “<strong>Buyer</strong>”) in either electronic or physical format. This agreement is entered into freely by both parties set forth in the signature block below (“Buyer” and “Seller”) and both parties agree to honor and be bound by the terms of this agreement in any court, real, imagined, or otherwise, or as set before any judge or any being serving in a similarly recognizable capacity making judgment as to the validity of this contract, in any state of reality or nonreality, physical or metaphysical, for all eternity (past, present, and future) and also any states of being or nonbeing outside of our human conception of time.</p><p><strong>BUYER AND SELLER AGREE AS FOLLOWS:</strong></p><p><strong>SECTION I. DEFINITION OF “SOUL”</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;The “Soul” of the Seller for the purposes of this contract is understood to mean the spiritual, immortal, and immaterial essence of their self which exists independently and distinctly from their material being.</p><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; While both the Buyer and the Seller acknowledge that the true nature, scope, and existence of any Such soul, whether or not it exists, is unknown and unknowable to either of them, the ambiguity involved in no way limits or renders any portion of this agreement invalid and the total scope of the Soul shall be considered as subject to the agreement.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;The Seller’s religion or belief system lacking a concept of a “Soul” or metaphysical reality lacking the concept of a “Soul” as given shall not alter the stated intent of this contract, and the essence being transferred to the Buyer shall constitute whatever immaterial equivalent, if any, exists that is closest in nature to the given definition of the Seller’s spiritual, immortal, and immaterial essence.</p><p>D. &nbsp; &nbsp;In the event that a “Soul” is not actually immortal, this contract shall remain in effect through whatever duration of time or non-time that the soul exists in any manner, state, or way of being.</p><p>E. &nbsp; &nbsp; In the event that the Seller’s “Soul” does not exist as an independent entity outside of the whole “one-ness” of reality as commonly described in some belief systems, and in the event that this belief about the nature of reality reflects actual reality, this contract will remain in effect for whatever period of time or non-time and to whatever degree that the Seller’s immaterial essence is distinguishable in any form, manner, or state of being from the sum whole of immaterial or material existence.</p><p>F. &nbsp; &nbsp; The Buyer acknowledges and fully understands that the Seller may deny the existence of any such Soul as defined here in Section I or deny the possibility of transferring ownership of said Soul to another party according to their personal belief system. Buyer agrees to accept the risk of being unable to actually take possession of said Soul from the selling party due to either its nonexistence or non-transferability on the part of the Soul’s owner.</p><p><strong>SECTION II. SALE AND TRANSFER OF SOUL</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer and Seller intend this Agreement to be a contract of sale for the Seller’s Soul, as defined in Section I, wherein the Buyer shall provide the compensation outlined in Section III in exchange for ownership and use of the Seller’s Soul as described in Sections I and IV.</p><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; The transfer of ownership of this Soul shall occur at the moment this document is signed and returned to the Buyer by the Seller in any format, electronic or physical.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;If for any reason this Soul or a portion of this Soul shall be found to be non-transferable from Seller to Buyer, this shall in no way limit the other provisions of this agreement or the Buyer’s rights with respect to use and possession of the Soul. Seller agrees to transfer ownership of Soul to Buyer to whatever degree is possible, in part or in whole, and commits to the terms of usage, transfer, or possession of Soul as described in Section IV to whatever degree may be possible.</p><p>D. &nbsp; &nbsp;As compensation for this transfer of ownership of the Soul, Buyer agrees to compensate Seller an amount of no less than ten (10) United States Dollars, to be transferred according to the terms given in Section III, within 48 commonly recognized Earth-hours of the receipt of the signed agreement via any medium, physical or electronic.</p><p>E. &nbsp; &nbsp; This transfer of ownership of the Soul from Seller to Buyer provides the Buyer with full usage rights and ownership of the soul to do with as they see fit, including but not limited to the provisions given in Section IV of this document.</p><p>F. &nbsp; &nbsp; This transfer of ownership of the Soul from Seller to Buyer prevents the Seller from any personal or public use of or claim of ownership to the transferred Soul without the express permission, in writing, of the Buyer. Other than limiting their making claims of ownership to the Soul, this clause shall in no way limit the material actions of the Seller.</p><p>G. &nbsp; &nbsp;This transfer is permanent and irrevocable except as given in the terms of this contract. Buyer shall be the new owner of Seller’s Soul for all time and non-time and states of being, with all according rights and privileges of use as given in Section IV.</p><p>H. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer and Seller agree that actual possession, use, or storage of the Soul by the Buyer is not required for Buyer’s ownership, transfer, or future use of the Soul to be enforceable under these terms. Buyer may, at their discretion, leave the Soul in the location it currently exists or move it from its current location at any time and at their own discretion. Buyer may use or not use the soul as Buyer sees fit. Failure to take possession of or to use the Soul shall in no way invalidate the ownership, usage rights, subsequent transfer, or any other term of this contract with respect to the transferred Soul.</p><p><strong>SECTION III. COMPENSATION FOR TRANSFER</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer agrees to compensate Seller with an amount of no less than ten (10) United States Dollars for the transfer of the Soul within 48 commonly recognized Earth-hours of the receipt of the signed agreement via any medium, physical or electronic, as described in Section II-C, according to the conditions outlined in this Section (III).</p><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; The sending of these funds (hereafter “the payment”) shall occur via PayPal.com and shall be sent to an electronic mail address provided by the Seller.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;In the event that no address is provided by the Seller to render the payment, Buyer will send payment to the address used to transfer electronically signed contract documents or make a reasonable attempt to acquire such an address from the Seller via the same communication medium over which the signed documents are transferred. Failure to acquire a valid payment address from Seller within the 48-hour period shall not invalidate the contract or the Buyer’s ownership and usage of transferred Soul provided this is the primary reason for the Buyer’s inability to render compensation.</p><p>D. &nbsp; &nbsp;Seller acknowledges that small variations in actual value of currency may occur from moment to moment and that in sending a nominal amount of $10 USD via the PayPal payments system within 48 hours of receipt of the contract as described in Section III-A, they have satisfied their obligation to compensate the Seller under the terms of this agreement.</p><p>E. &nbsp; &nbsp; Seller agrees to pay any and all standard PayPal fee percentages that may arise in the course of transferring sent funds to their personal accounts.</p><p>F. &nbsp; &nbsp; Seller agrees that their failure to accept the funds shall in no way invalidate the agreement and that the contract will remain completely whole and enforceable regardless of their acceptance or non-acceptance of the payment.</p><p>G. &nbsp; &nbsp;In the event that the Buyer fails to send the compensation as described in this Section (III) within 48 hours of receipt of the contract signed by the Seller, the contract will be considered null and void and the ownership of the Soul shall revert to the Seller.</p><p>H. &nbsp; &nbsp;No action or use of the Soul may be undertaken by the Buyer within the 48-hour period beginning with the receipt of the contract signed by the Seller until and unless the Buyer has adequately rendered payment to Seller as described in this Section (III).</p><p><strong>SECTION IV. OWNERSHIP AND USE OF SOUL</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer and Seller agree that the owner of the Soul may possess, claim, keep, store, offer, transfer, or make use of it in whole or in part in any manner that they see fit to do so, conventional or otherwise, including (but not limited to) the purposes described in this Section (IV). Example uses of the Soul which would be permitted under these terms include (but are not limited to):</p><ul><li>Publicly claiming to be the owner of the Soul in question.</li><li>Transferring of said Soul, in whole or part, to any person or entity, for any reason.</li><li>Sacrificing or offering said Soul, in whole or in part, to any deity or spiritual entity.</li><li>Spending or using the soul, in whole or in part, for some purpose which causes it to diminish in value, quantity, or substance or be subsumed into a larger whole.</li><li>Transferring the burden, credit, or responsibility of any actions reflected in the State of a Soul from another Soul to this Soul or from this Soul to another Soul.</li><li>Long term storage, usage, or preservation of the Soul in a state which would prevent it from taking the course of development, evolution, or relocation it may otherwise take naturally or due to the actions or material status of the Seller.</li></ul><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; Seller agrees to fully relinquish any right of ownership or usage they have in the Soul and agrees that they will not attempt to use, keep, transfer, or sell the same Soul again even if it remains in their possession or immediate vicinity.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;Seller agrees not to interfere or attempt to interfere via metaphysical, magickal, or spiritual means with Buyer’s attempt to claim, transfer, or …</p></div></section></article></div></main></div></div>

<p>You might think the US would be world champion of household debt, yet the highest private indebtment has always been in the Nordic countries. Debt, however, takes different forms, writes <strong>Martino Comelli</strong>. In Scandinavia, inclusive welfare systems make debt into an investment. Elsewhere, gerontocratic welfare and consumer credit can become a burden</p>
<h2>Debt and welfare: a trade-off?</h2>
<p>The economic crisis of 2007–2008 put household debt in the spotlight. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008">A common narrative</a></strong> was that cheap credit fuelled a house price bubble in the US. The financial industry sold derivatives based on those debts and many European banks who bought those products went belly up, allowing the crisis to spread across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Debt, and in particular, household debt, has been regarded with suspicion ever since. Many scholars argue that the rise of household debt was caused by welfare retrenchment, suggesting a trade-off between welfare and debt. A lack of welfare was compensated by private leveraging. Other scholars pointed out that many governments were pushing for asset-based welfare – like buying housing as a form of private welfare – encouraged by steadily rising house prices in the years preceding the crash.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="776" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png" alt="" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png 683w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1-264x300.png 264w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"><figcaption>Figure 1: Quantity of household debt in OECD countries</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet empirical data suggests that the welfare-debt trade-off may be mistaken. Curiously, the highest indebtment ratio in the OECD was, and is, in northern European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. These are the countries with the most far-reaching welfare programmes, and known to be fiscally responsible. Clearly, the welfare-debt trade-off theory needs a rethink.</p>
<h2>Private debt, public virtues: on the age-orientation of welfare</h2>
<p>Is it, then, a complementary relationship? Generous welfare provides security, encouraging people to borrow more. But this interpretation does not fly either. Many European countries have generous welfare – France for example, has higher social spending than Denmark – but nowhere near the level of household debt of the Nordic countries.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02732173.2021.1875088">My research on the relations between welfare and household debt</a> </strong>offers a novel explanation of the welfare-debt conundrum. There is no trade-off between private debt and welfare, nor is there a complementary relation. What matters is where the welfare money is spent and how. It isn’t necessarily about the quantity of spending, but about its direction.</p>
<blockquote><p>While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need</p></blockquote>
<p>Most welfare spending is concentrated on older generations, particularly retired people. According to <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">Franco Modigliani</a>'s life-cycle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">hypothesis</a></strong>, debt is linked to one's stage in life. People take on debt when young because their income is low but their expenses (housing, children, leisure) high – and they pay this debt off as they age.</p>
<p>Countries that not only provide social help for the elderly, but counterbalance that with spending and services for the young and economically active, tend to have higher private debt (see Figure 2). In particular, countries that spend on education and active labour market policies, and those which offer better protection for people in precarious jobs, have the highest levels of private debt.</p>
<p>Household debt is an unintended consequence of assuring a smoother transition to adulthood. In conservative continental European countries, however, despite high welfare spending, welfare is concentrated mostly on the elderly and on people with stable jobs. This discourages younger generations from taking risks, including mortgage debt.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="980" height="714" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png" alt="Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png 980w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-300x219.png 300w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-768x560.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"><figcaption>Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Note: Figure 2 illustrates an inverse relationship between the elderly orientation of social spending (EBiSS, on the x axis), and the quantity of household debt as % of net disposable income (on the y axis). The EBiSS is a rate between social spending for the economically active (at the numerator) versus spending oriented toward the elderly (at the denominator). A higher value on the EBiSS index means that a greater share of social spending is going to the elderly.</p>
<h2>Consumer credit? The three worlds of debtfare capitalism</h2>
<p>Most of the debt in OECD countries is mortgage debt. While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need.</p>
<p>If we consider consumer credit, the welfare-debt theory makes sense again. While consumer credit is more the exception than the norm in Europe, and almost absent in the Nordic countries, it is common in Anglo-liberal countries (UK, US and Canada) where it is used by families as a substitute for poor welfare provision.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="895" height="531" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3.png" alt="Figure 3. Clusters measures" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3.png 895w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3-300x178.png 300w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3-768x456.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px"><figcaption>Figure 3. Clusters measures</figcaption></figure>
<p>Figure 3 shows three main patterns of private debt/welfare configurations; what we call debtfare:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Nordic / youth-oriented model, household debt is high, consumer credit is low, and the rate of young people Not in Education, Employment, or Training (NEET) is very low.</li>
<li>
<p>In conservative European countries such as Germany and Italy, there are a lot of NEETs, welfare is orientated toward the elderly, and there is little household debt or consumer credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Anglo-liberal countries such as the UK, US and Canada, consumer credit is high, and so is overall debt (though not as high as in the Nordic countries). The share of NEETs is remarkably high, and most welfare is oriented toward the elderly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Household financialisation, then, follows different paths and patterns. Both liberal and conservative welfare is gerontocratic, and they have a high level of NEETs, but while the former is oriented toward a market solution to inequality (more debt), the latter discourages any form of risk taking.</p>
<p>So, while paying attention to debt is important, it shouldn’t be the only lesson of the 2008 crisis. Further attention should be paid to the macro-sociological conditions that give debt different meanings: inclusive welfare can make debt into an investment, but gerontocratic welfare can make debt a burden.</p>

<p>Why simple rules of thumb often outperform complex models</p>

</div><div>

<p>This is the age of big data. We are constantly in quest of more numbers and more complex algorithms to crunch them. We seem to believe that this will solve most of the world’s problems - in economy, society and even our personal lives. As a corollary, rules of thumb and gut instincts are getting a short shrift. We think they often violate the principles of logic and lead us into making bad decisions. We might have had to depend on heuristics and our gut feelings in agricultural and manufacturing era. But this is digital age. We can optimise everything.</p>

<p>Can we?</p>

<p>Gerd Gigerenzer, a sixty nine year German psychologist who has been studying how humans make decisions for most of his career, doesn't think so. In the real world, rules of thumb not only work well, they also perform better than complex models, he says. We shouldn’t turn our noses up on heuristics, we should embrace them.</p>

<p>That view is increasingly gaining global attention. Partly because of the failure of complex models in predicting major events, such as the financial crisis in 2008, and the election of Donald Trump last year. Partly because Gigerenzer is backing what he says with some cutting edge research. His team at The Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (ABC) at Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin studies the role of heuristics in decision making, in a way that can be coded into a computer programme, tested, and used in the real world. In finance, Bank of England is using their insights to design simpler rules to avert banking crisis. In healthcare, medical organisations are working with them to teach risk literacy to doctors and patients so they can evaluate evidence better. Artificial intelligence developers are looking up at their work to see if they can make machines think better.</p>

<h3>An adaptive toolbox&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Gigerenzer was in India recently to conduct a seminar, called the Winter School on Bounded Rationality at TA Pai Management Institute, Manipal, where his audience were a skeptical bunch of research scholars from some of the top institutions in India and abroad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gigerenzer, a tall man sporting a white mustache and possessing the gait of a country gentleman, was in full flow - explaining, clarifying, defending his worldview using a mix of evidence from research, personal anecdotes and a deadpan display of academic confidence. When a finance professor with an obvious love for mathematical analysis said he didn’t agree with Gigerenzer’s views, he replied, “Well, I have three days to convince you”.</p>

<p>In short, Gigerenzer's arguments go like this. There is a big difference between risk and uncertainty. You are dealing with <em>risk</em> when you know all the alternatives, outcomes and their probabilities. You are dealing with <em>uncertainty</em> when you don’t know all the alternatives, outcomes or their probabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you are dealing with risk, complex mathematical models and fine tuning them for optimisation work. However, when you are dealing with uncertainty, they don’t work well, because the world is dynamic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What you then need is a set of simple rules of thumb that are robust and gut instincts sharpened by years of experience. You need <em>an adaptive toolbox</em>. To use the toolbox well, logical rationality - knowing rules such as transitivity and set theorem - won’t suffice. What’s needed is <em>ecological rationality</em>, that is knowing which heuristic works in which environment.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Innovating over a cup of coffee</h3>

<p>To study all of these, Gigerenzer has assembled a team of international and interdisciplinary team in ABC at&nbsp;Max Planck Institute. “I don’t believe in the borders of the regular disciplines”, Gigerenzer said. “They may be good for teaching but certainly not for innovation. My group has about 35 researchers and half of them, at any point, are from ten different disciplines - psychology, machine learning, computers, economics, engineering, philosophy, biology and so on. The point is to get all these minds together to solve one problem.”</p>

<p>That problem is: <em>How do humans and other animals make decisions under uncertainty, that is, when time and information are limited and the future is unknown? &nbsp;</em>They try to solve this problem by designing models of how people make decisions, and by&nbsp;conducting experiments, testing one model against another to see where rules of thumb (heuristics)&nbsp;perform better than others. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“Another important thing,” he continued, “is to make them feel like a family, because people from different disciplines typically avoid talking to one another. They claim no one would understand their language. At Max Planck I have put them all on one floor. We have tea and coffee everyday at 4 PM. No one is obligated to come, so they come. And they talk, they ask questions: “What does this concept mean?,” “Why don’t you do that instead of this”. And, so we make progress.”</p>

<p>“It is one of the most intellectually stimulating environments for research,” Özgür Simsek, a researcher in Gigerenzer’s team said. Simsek studied industrial engineering in Turkey, before moving to University of Massachusetts, Amherst to get a masters in operations research and a PhD in artificial intelligence and machine learning. After her doctorate, she was looking for something novel to work on, and found the research on bounded rationality at Max Planck to be interesting. “I thought the research on bounded rationality had perhaps something new to say about AI and machine learning, and perhaps we could bring some of these ideas into AI. At the same time, I thought my computational background, working in algorithms, analyzing algorithms, developing algorithms could be useful in understanding heuristics better,” Simsek said. It is eight years since she joined.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The path that Konstantinos Katsikopoulos took to land in Max Planck Institute was not too different. He studied in Athens, and then went on to get his PhD in operations research from MIT. He came to know about Gigerenzer’s work when he stumbled on a book title “Simple Heuristics that Make Us Smart.” The was intrigued by the words simple and smart.&nbsp;He already knew the limitations of complex optimising models. “When I studied mathematics, the most basic thing I learned is that any claims about optimality or optimising are conditional on the model. Your results are always the best according to a model of the world. And a model of the world is not reality. You can’t take the model per se as a benchmark of success in the world.” The idea of comparing complex optimisation models against simple heuristics appealed to him. He joined Max Planck as a postdoc fifteen years ago. Katsikopoulos recently shifted to the Business School of the University of Southampton, UK, and continues to be associated with Max Planck through Harding Center for Risk Literacy as an adjunct scientist. (Harding Center, a part of Max Planck&nbsp;trains physicians and patients to better understand medical evidence, and promotes risk literacy among school children. Gigerenzer is not a fan of the Nudge (using insights behavioural economics and psychology to change behaviour of people by subtle cues and changes in a setting). He believes teaching people how to assess risks is a more straightforward and effective way to get positive results).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another researcher, Shenghua Luan, was doing his PhD in psychology at University of Florida, after graduating from Peking University in China. At Florida, he attended a seminar in which Gigerenzer’s work was discussed. He started studying his papers and got hooked. After PhD, he spent some time at Max Planck as a postdoc, before moving to Singapore to teach at Singapore Management University. Soon, he was missing the exciting research at Max Planck so much, that he decided to go back. When he speaks about his work, his enthusiasm can spill over. “This is not some abstract stuff. This is what people do in real life,” he said.</p>

<h3>The skeptical statistician</h3>

<p>Gigerenzer’s own intellectual journey started when was wondering why he chose a career in academics over entertainment music years ago. &nbsp;“As a musician at that time, I was earning, may be, five or ten times more than what an assistant professor would earn. Now, I did not sit down and list all possible consequences of staying in music, all possible consequences of going to academia, weigh them and add them up, because that made no sense. I wouldn’t have been able to estimate all of them. I just took the decision. It was a qualitative decision. Thinking about it, got me interested in how people make decisions.”</p>

<p>Gigerenzer was contrasting his decision making process to a method that has been long popular among intellectuals of scientific temper. They believed one can arrive at an optimal decision by listing down all the likely advantages and disadvantages of various options. Charles Darwin tried that technique to decide on whether to marry or not. Benjamin Franklin strongly recommended this method - he called it Moral Algebra - to his nephew who was looking for his wife. “if you do not learn it, I apprehend you will never be married,” Franklin wrote to him. It has not vanished. We will find some version of this method being practiced by the bureaucracy in government and business even today. Gigerenzer saw that he didn’t use this method to make one of the most important decisions of his life. In fact, most of us don’t. Our decisions are mostly qualitative, not quantitative. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“When I started as a student i didn’t know very much about psychology,” Gigerenzer said. “Basically, I knew about Freud and a few other psychoanalysts. I quickly realised that I can explain almost everything with these concepts. I got disinterested. I didn’t want a theory that explains everything. Then I got interested in personality psychology. I remember there was a big book, 400-500 pages, on the subject and I knew it almost by heart. Some friends …</p></div></div></div>

<p>The animation first appeared in Developer Preview 4 and many thought it was a placeholder for something more polished. However, after awhile, many people seem to take a liking to it. Here’s a series of frames that shows it if you’re not familiar.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="128" height="640" src="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/poof.png" alt="" srcset="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/poof.png 128w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/poof-60x300.png 60w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/poof-54x270.png 54w" sizes="(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px"><figcaption>POOF!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The legendary poof animation came out of a discussion of the Human Interface team that wanted this action to have an animation to go with the very liquid Aqua interface.</p>



<p>One of the most talented engineers on the team took out a piece of paper. I wish I could say it was a napkin to make the story better.</p>



<p>On the piece of paper, he drew a series of frames similar to what is pictured above. A quick, five frame animation. The intention of the designer was that these drawings would stoke further discussion. That it would get cleaned up and refined later.</p>



<p>But that never happened. It shipped as is. And the rest is history.</p>

<p>It’s interesting how learning is sometimes like travel. At the end of the journey, you end up back where you started, only with a broadened perspective.</p>
<p>Trivial example: code comments. When I was new to programming I commented my code extensively. If I’m honest, it was to compensate for my difficulties in reading code. A consequence of this is it allowed me to be lazy in the code I wrote. I wouldn’t need to put much effort into making it clear and readable because there were always plain English comments to fall back on.</p>
<p>Then I joined a team that was militantly against comments, where every comment was an admission of failure to write readable code. I took this on-board and disciplined myself not to rely on comments. This forced me to spend more time on refactoring my code to make it as readable and “self-documenting” as possible. I still wouldn’t say I’m there yet, but I’m confident that my code is much more readable now than it was then.</p>
<p>However, in the last year or so, I’ve started adding comments again. Not too many, but here and there to add more context. It felt like blasphemy at first. Some of my comments are even somewhat redundant, but I’ve since learned that <a href="https://www.cnothelfer.com/redundant-encoding">encoding the same information in redundant ways</a> is an important principle for aiding our comprehension. For example, traffic lights use both colour and position to encode the same information.</p>
<p>Superficially it seems as though I’ve returned to where I started: I’m commenting code again. However, if I hadn’t disciplined myself to do without comments entirely for a while, I wouldn’t have been forced to learn how to write more readable code. Abstaining from code comments is a <a href="https://coderefinery.nz/2020/10/21/forcing-functions-in-software-development/">forcing function</a> for learning to write more readable code. At some point, you can re-integrate commenting as a useful tool rather than a crutch.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I’m confident that if I could travel back in time and tell past-me or any of my old teammates that, actually, comments can be a valuable tool to aid comprehension, I’m positive I would encounter strong resistance. This is just as it should be; I don’t think it can be any different. When you’re learning a new skill, it’s necessary to become somewhat closed off and follow a direction single-mindedly for a while, it’s part of the learning process. If you were too suggestible and deviated too easily, you would go around in small circles and never get anywhere.</p>
<p>You see the same pattern across the development community when a new technology or framework is introduced (I won’t name names. I’m sure you can think of some examples). In the early days, there is hype and zealotry. Then over time as more developers adopt the tech into production and real issues with it emerge, there is disillusionment and abandonment. Finally a more realistic, calibrated picture of the trade-offs of the technology emerge.</p>

<p>A stunning admission by the US government that it possesses UFO debris was recently made in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed over three years ago by this author. In a reply letter, the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has ended decades of speculation by verifying that UFO material has indeed been recovered. Now officially referred to as UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) rather than UFOs, some of this material was placed with a defense contractor for analysis and storage in "specialized facilities." Incredibly, part of the information released discusses material with shape recovery properties, much like the "memory metal" debris found fallen at the Roswell UFO crash in 1947.</p>



<p>And based on the documentation received, it appears that the retrieved debris exhibits other extraordinary capabilities. In addition to "remembering" their original form when bent or crushed, some of these futuristic materials have the potential to make things invisible, "compress" electromagnetic energy, and even slow down the speed of light. Although much of the reports' details are redacted, what can be gleaned is that these technologies represent a literal quantum leap beyond the properties of all existing material known to man.</p>



<p>Finally, the whereabouts of the UFO debris held by the contractor is unknown. Some months ago they laid off their employees and ceased operations. Former company officials, when reached, refuse comment.</p>



<h6>THE FOIA REQUEST</h6>



<p>The original 2017 FOIA request made to the DIA asks for the physical descriptions, properties and composition of UFO/UAP material held by the government and its contractor. The request is unambiguous in its meaning. It refers to UFO/UAP material and "physical debris recovered by personnel of the Department of Defense as residue, flotsam, shot-off material or crashed UAPs or unidentified flying objects." The FOIA request can be seen in full <a href="https://7f215854-ce29-4a12-9bb0-f4e7eb88d38a.filesusr.com/ugd/aa4aac_c53f66ccc2f745908c6b639c1042977e.pdf" target="_blank"><span><span><span>here:</span></span></span></a></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></p></div><div id="comp-kkurd3px" data-testid="richTextElement"><p>In their reply, the DIA amazingly agrees that it has documents responsive to my request on recovered UFO debris and its analysis, the program under which it was administered, AATIP (the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program), and that their defense contractor (Bigelow Aerospace in Las Vegas, Nevada) has stored the material. They also provide some reports related to the possible applications of the studied material.</p>



<p>The delays and excuses offered up during the years awaiting the FOIA response were many. They include that the records search involved another agency that needed to be consulted; that I had been emailing my former FOIA Officer though she'd left months ago and never received my follow-up communication; to a re-assignment of my case to the DIA's FOIA Chief, Steve Tumiski. After a lawsuit was threatened with the retention of counsel, the DIA somehow, after so very long, acted to respond.</p>



<h6>THE RELATION TO ROSWELL</h6>

</div><p>The information received includes several pages of what are called "advanced technology reports" on Nitinol - a shape recovery alloy. Nitinol has similar properties to the "memory metal" found fallen as debris at the Roswell, New Mexico UFO crash of 1947. The pages found within the FOIA reply on Nitinol explore its potential for integrating it into the human body for the improvement of health. Well over 40 witnesses to Roswell have mentioned a metal-like material that could "remember itself" when deformed or folded, returning to its original state seamlessly and instantly. In a series of investigative articles appearing in the UFO Explorations website article archive section, the case is credibly made that Nitinol represents our first</p><div id="comp-kkuwalzl" title=""><div data-testid="linkElement"><wix-image id="img_comp-kkuwalzl" data-image-info="{&quot;containerId&quot;:&quot;comp-kkuwalzl&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;,&quot;imageData&quot;:{&quot;width&quot;:719,&quot;height&quot;:406,&quot;uri&quot;:&quot;aa4aac_4110780180b542edadc482e561165b0f~mv2.png&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Roswell Disc, 719x406, enhanced with Pho&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;}}" data-bg-effect-name="" data-is-svg="false" data-is-svg-mask="false" data-image-zoomed="" data-has-ssr-src="true"><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/aa4aac_4110780180b542edadc482e561165b0f~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_169,h_96,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2/Roswell%20Disc%2C%20719x406%2C%20enhanced%20with%20Pho.png" alt="Roswell Disc, 719x406, enhanced with Pho"></wix-image></div></div><div id="comp-kkuwz42y" data-testid="richTextElement"><p>attempts to replicate a material of the craft's construction. The Roswell debris was flown to Wright Field in Ohio after the crash. Some months later, Wright granted a contract to Battelle Memorial Institute to begin phase diagrams (recipes) for mixing Nickel and ultra-high-purity Titanium, required to make memory metal. General Arthur Exon, Base Commander at Wright Patterson in the 1960s, who flew over the crash site in 1947, spoke to researcher Kevin Randle on tape. He stated that it was his understanding that some of the wreckage being tested was comprised in part of "specially processed" Titanium.</p>



<p>And in September of 1947, two months after the Roswell crash, General George Shulgen of Air Intelligence described "the materials of construction" of the flying saucers as potentially being made of <span>"composite or sandwich construction utilizing various combinations of metal and plastics."&nbsp;</span> Some of the Roswell crash debris was said to display metal-plastic like appearance and characteristics. The DIA-sponsored reports I received mention a highly-engineered material called "metamaterial" (see below) as comprised of <span>"composite media."</span> Metamaterial can be <span>layered with metal and plastics.</span></p>



<p>Throughout the received FOIA documents, mention is made of potential use of some of the materials in "advanced aerospace platforms." Reference is made to desired material characteristics such as being extremely lightweight and tough, like the characteristics of the debris found at the Roswell crash.</p>



<h6>OTHER MATERIAL</h6>



<p>Extensive reference is also made to the study and application of what the tests called <span>metamaterial</span>*, including that some of this material:</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Can be used to "slow down light" and even "bring light to a complete standstill"</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(Implying the ability to manipulate the speed of light (electromagnetic energy traveling at 186,000 miles per second)</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>May induce invisibility by manipulating refraction, reflectivity and increasing light absorption. The reports use terms like "optical isolation" and "transparency" and make reference to a "MetaMirror" technology</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(Implying the ability to make something unable to be seen, and/or picked up by radar, scanning or imaging)</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Has the interesting ability to "compress electromagnetic energy"</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(Such condensing can make information and energy storage smaller and their transfer faster by reducing volume)</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Exhibits a particular "tunable resonance" which was likely "determined during fabrication."</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(The phrase "tunable resonance" refers to a vibration of large amplitude from a small stimulus. Very recent research shows potential in the field of "energy harvesting" technologies, or pulling energy from the environment for low-power electronic devices)</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>There seem to be many exciting, but far in the future, technical applications to these materials that will change the way our lives are lived.</p>



<p><span>*Metamaterial</span>, a coined and relatively recent word, is believed to be any material engineered to have a property that is not found in naturally occurring materials. Some of these materials appear to be made from assemblies of multiple elements fashioned from composite materials such as metals and plastics. These composite media can be engineered to exhibit unique electromagnetic properties. Made up from subwavelength building blocks (most often based on metals), these metamaterials allow for extreme control over light energy and optical fields, enabling such effects such as negative refraction to be realized.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>Portions of the reports center on next-generation <span>Amorphous Metals</span> (also called "liquid metal" or "metallic glass") which are novel engineering alloys with disordered atomic-scale structure. Metal is crystalline in its solid state, which means it has a highly ordered arrangement of atoms. Amorphous metals though are crazily disordered - a metal-like material so unique that it is believed it may one day replace plastic and metal in many applications. The material is stronger and lighter than any existing metal, can be injection molded like plastic (no rivets, seams or joining, smooth like many reported UFOs) and will never corrode or rust. Imagine using a single razor blade for the rest of your life because it stays super sharp forever. A golf club so springy it can drive a ball farther than any pro ever has. An artificial hip implant that performs better than a real hip. A cell phone case that is completely indestructible.</p>



<p>The contract that Bigelow was granted was under the auspices of an official government UFO study (whose existence was revealed by <span>The New York Times</span> in 2017). The contract was for Bigelow to construct "specialized modified facilities" to hold the material for testing. The DoD/Pentagon UFO study effort was called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). It ran for some years (and under more than one name), and according to informed sources, remains in operation to this day. What is inside these "specially modified facilities" that requires such contracted technical services? What is the nature of this anomalous debris and what are its properties that it requires shielding?</p>

Suddenly, from a corner of your consciousness, a voice speaks, "Oi dummy! Test the performance! What if this makes the app slower?!"</p><p>You frown. You squint at the screen thinking of what to do. Then you shrug saying, "Ah well! I'll do it at the end," and type away adding feature after feature without a worry. <strong>No! Stop!</strong></p><p>Performance matters. Speed matters. <strong><em>Do it now!</em></strong> Do you really want to use an app that lags and stutters every time you click a button. EVEN IF it has a thousand features? Remember how you'd get frustrated each time Microsoft Office took 10 seconds to load? What about Adobe Photoshop? Firefox?&nbsp;</p><p>And oh how you'd jump in excitement every time an app on your super epic computer just&nbsp;<strong><em>snapped open</em></strong> in a blink. Oh I see you shaking your head saying, "But...but...that feature!"</p><p>Let's try something. Open your terminal/console and copy a file from your home/user directory to a folder inside a folder in your Documents.</p><p>Now do the same from your File Manager.</p><p>See the difference? How much faster it is from a terminal. Just one command and viola!</p><p>"But...but...but that's different!" I hear you say.</p><blockquote><p>Performance is fundamentally about how long it takes you to perform an action, <em><strong>any</strong></em> action.</p></blockquote><p>Oh but it isn't! Performance isn't only about loading speed. It's not only about rendering and latency and all that stuff. No. Performance is fundamentally about how long it takes you to perform an action, <em><strong>any</strong></em> action. An app could be super snappy but still take 5 seconds to perform an action from thought to result.</p><p>You see that is how performance is defined.&nbsp;How long will it take a user to go from <em>thinking of doing an action</em> to <em>actually seeing the result</em>? What if that logout button was buried ten layers deep? How about if copying a file required you to open 3 sub-menus? Do you think that's performant?</p><p>Now before you go and benchmark each and every line of your code, listen.&nbsp;<strong>Listen!</strong> Breathe. Yes, speed matters but if you miss your deadline it is&nbsp;<strong><em>your</em></strong> performance that needs to be improved. So be clever.</p><blockquote><p>Because sometimes...<em>less is more.</em></p></blockquote><p>Ship <em>fewer</em> features. Write <em>less</em> code. Make <em>less</em> views. Do <em>less</em> navigation. Add <em>less</em> animations. Interrupt the user <em>less</em>. All those will improve both&nbsp;<strong><em>your</em></strong> and&nbsp;<em><strong>your product's</strong></em> performance. Ship&nbsp;<em>faster. </em>Build <em>faster.</em> That's what matters because sometimes...<em>less is more.</em></p><h2>It's Not Only About Code</h2><p>See that person on his phone scrolling through this blog post thinking how he'll make the fastest X? How long do you imagine it'll take him to build such a thing? A couple of hours? Months? Days? Years? Weeks? Do you think&nbsp;<em>he&nbsp;</em>is&nbsp;<em>performant?</em></p><p>You raise your hands in the air frustrated. "WHAT! This guy has gone crazy! Why does it matter how long it takes to build something <em>fast</em>?"</p><p>&nbsp;Let me tell you something. If it takes you a month to get that line of code to execute in under a micro-second; you lost millions of microseconds. Time is the currency in this world. If something is slow <em>don't ship it</em> instead of spending a month trying to make it faster because you are trading <em>your </em>performance for <em>your product's.&nbsp;</em>If you ship late you have&nbsp;<em>less&nbsp;</em>time to do&nbsp;<em>more.</em></p><blockquote><p>Don't ship slow features fast nor fast features slow.</p></blockquote><p>What if you shipped that fast code in time? What if you didn't spend a month making it fast? What if&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>did it&nbsp;<em>faster?</em>&nbsp; Then it was worth it. You did it.</p><h2>What About That Cool Feature?</h2><p>So you skipped a feature because it was too slow what do you do now? It is an absolutely fantastic feature, something so fancy that it will blow your users' mind. I say, "Can you make it fast without hampering the release line?" No? Roll it over to the next release. No line of code is more important than <em>your&nbsp;</em>and <em>your product's&nbsp;</em>performance.</p><h2>Closing Thoughts</h2><p><em>Every millisecond matters...but not more than that deadline.</em></p></div></article></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Recently, the Raspberry Pi Foundation launched their new <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf">RP2040 SoC</a> on a $4 development board called <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/pico-datasheet.pdf">Pico</a>. As the foundation’s goal is primarily education, they’ve provided lots of high quality documentation, libraries, and examples for the new chip. Naturally, I’m going to ignore most of that and roll my own. Why? Because this is my idea of fun and I’m trapped inside during a pandemic.</p>
<p>If you’d like to build the examples and follow along, you’ll need <a href="https://www.adacore.com/download">GNAT Community 2020 ARM ELF</a> installed in your PATH. I’ve only tested this on x86_64 Debian, if you’re on another platform I can’t help you. You’ll also want an SWD debugger that works with the RP2040. I use openocd on a Raspberry Pi, I hear Segger J-Link support is coming soon. Technically you could use elf2uf2 and load binaries over USB, but that’s gonna get tedious for any nontrivial debugging.</p>
<p>The RP2040 has no internal flash. The boot ROM loads 256 bytes of code from an external SPI flash and executes it. This “second stage bootloader” is expected to configure the XIP (eXecute In Place) peripheral with clock and timing details specific to the flash chip in use, then jump to the start of the user code in the memory mapped to the flash.</p>
<p>I tried to rewrite the <code>boot2.S</code> bootloader from pico-sdk in Ada, but I couldn’t get it to fit inside 256 bytes. It might be possible, but not today. I ran gcc’s preprocessor on <code>boot2.S</code> to generate a single assembly file I could link. I copied the linker script and <code>crt0.S</code> from pico-sdk too.</p>
<p>The <code>zfp-cortex-m0p</code> Ada runtime does most of the boilerplate Cortex-M0+ setup and implements <code>Ada.Text_IO</code> with semihosting over the debug interface, so I wrote a hello world and copypasta’d a GPR project file to build it.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>with</span> <span>Ada</span><span>.</span><span>Text_IO</span><span>;</span> <span>use</span> <span>Ada</span><span>.</span><span>Text_IO</span><span>;</span>

<span>procedure</span> <span>Main</span> <span>is</span>
<span>begin</span>
   <span>Put_Line</span> <span>(</span><span>"Hello, RP2040!"</span><span>);</span>
<span>end</span> <span>Main</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>It took me a few hours to figure out the right incantation to get the linker to put the .boot2 section at the start of the flash chip along with crt0.S and the Ada runtime’s init code. The result is an ugly mess, which is why I’m omitting it here. If you want to see how to do things the quick and dirty way, <a href="https://github.com/JeremyGrosser/rp/tree/744e546999aba596701dcf89d4f5e39f056932e0">my initial attempt is on github</a>.</p>
<p>I soldered some headers for the Pico’s SWD port, wired it to a Raspberry Pi 4, and compiled the <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/openocd/tree/rp2040">raspberrypi branch of openocd</a>. As far as I can tell, nobody distributes a toolchain that can cross-compile Ada arm-eabi binaries on aarch64 and I don’t want to spend my time building binutils and gcc right now, so I setup an ssh tunnel from my x86_64 workstation to the Pi. I run arm-eabi-gdb locally and connect to openocd over the tunnel. Most of this will go in a .gdbinit script later.</p>
<p><img src="https://synack.me/img/raspberrypi-swd.png" alt="Raspberry Pi SWD wiring"></p>
<div><div><pre><code>ssh pi@192.168.1.202 -L3333:localhost:3333
openocd -f interface/raspberrypi-swd.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg

arm-eabi-gdb obj/main
target extended-remote localhost:3333
monitor arm semihosting enable
load
run
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Let’s write some code! For this example, I’m not going to do anything particularly complicated or idiomatic to Ada in order to keep things as simple as possible. This is going to be a very imperative program assigning values to registers and not much more.</p>
<p>ARM’s tooling for silicon vendors generates an SVD file, which is a pile of XML that lists all of the peripheral addresses and register offsets with vaguely human readable names. The svd2ada program translates this into Ada spec files with record types and representation clauses. Unfortunately, it crashed with the RP2040 SVD file. svd2ada expects a <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> to be specified on every register but the RP2040 SVD defines <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> at the peripheral level. The SVD format says this should then be inherited by the registers in the peripheral, but svd2ada doesn’t do that. I couldn’t figure out how to fix svd2ada so I wrote a quick Python script to modify the SVD file by copying the <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> field to every register within a peripheral. Now svd2ada works and generates a <code>.ads</code> file for each peripheral on the RP2040.</p>
<p>Normally the next step in bringing up a new chip would be to get all of the clocks configured, which is usually pretty boring code to write. At startup, the RP2040’s system clock runs from an internal ring oscillator with a not at all predictable or stable frequency between 1.8 and 12 MHz, which is good enough for some blinking. I skipped clock configuration and went straight for the GPIO.</p>
<p>There are four peripherals that need to be configured to toggle a pin: RESETS, PADS_BANK, IO_BANK, and SIO. RESETS, as you might expect, controls the reset state of the other peripherals. I pull the IO_BANK and PADS_BANK out of reset and wait for any initialization these peripherals might need to do in a busy loop.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET</span><span>.</span><span>io_bank0</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET</span><span>.</span><span>pads_bank0</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>while</span> <span>not</span> <span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET_DONE</span><span>.</span><span>io_bank0</span> <span>or</span> <span>else</span> <span>not</span> <span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET_DONE</span><span>.</span><span>pads_bank0</span> <span>loop</span>
  <span>null</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Next, PADS_BANK enables the output driver on GPIO25, which is connected to the LED on the Pico board.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  output disable off</span>
<span>PADS_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25</span><span>.</span><span>OD</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>--  input enable off</span>
<span>PADS_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25</span><span>.</span><span>IE</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>IO_BANK selects a peripheral to connect the pad to.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  function select</span>
<span>IO_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25_CTRL</span><span>.</span><span>FUNCSEL</span> <span>:=</span> <span>sio_25</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>The SIO (single-cycle IO) peripheral can toggle pins. I added a Pin_Mask constant in the declare block with bit 25 set. svd2ada generates nice subtype definitions for each register field so that I don’t need to know that GPIO_OUT is 30 bits wide. The immediate value here is just <code>Shift_Left (1, 25)</code>, but using Shift_Left here would require some type conversion that I want to avoid in this example.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>Pin_Mask</span> <span>:</span> <span>constant</span> <span>GPIO_OUT_GPIO_OUT_Field</span> <span>:=</span> <span>16#0200_0000#</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Enable the output in the SIO peripheral</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>-- output enable</span>
<span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OE_SET</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OE_SET</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Now we blink!</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_SET</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_SET</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_CLR</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_CLR</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Assuming those calls actually get compiled into single cycle writes, that’s gonna be blinking at half the system clock frequency, far faster than the human eye can see, but good enough for an oscilloscope. The SIO peripheral has an XOR register that allows us to make this code even shorter.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>This is where the narrative diverges from reality. After I got to this point, I spent a few days refactoring the code into a package with well defined types and interfaces that conform to the Ada HAL package. For the sake of this example, I’m going to gloss over some of those organizational details and pretend things are still mostly happening in a single Main procedure.</p>
<p>Next I need a delay in that loop to blink at a rate that’s perceptible to humans. I could call a bunch of <code>nop</code> instructions and waste cycles, but that’s just silly. The RP2040 has a very nice 64-bit timer peripheral that I completely ignored because the chip also has the standard ARM SysTick peripheral that I’m already familiar with. Exported symbols need to be defined at the package level, so I’ve put this code into a SysTick package. I’ve only reproduced the implementation bits here, just know that this is happening in a new file.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  Reload every 1ms</span>
<span>PPB_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>SYST_RVR</span><span>.</span><span>RELOAD</span> <span>:=</span> <span>SYST_RVR_RELOAD_Field</span> <span>(</span><span>12_000_000</span> <span>/</span> <span>1_000</span><span>);</span>

<span>PPB_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>SYST_CSR</span> <span>:=</span>
    <span>(</span><span>CLKSOURCE</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>True</span><span>,</span> <span>--  cpu clock</span>

     <span>others</span>    <span>=&gt;</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>I need an interrupt handler to increment a counter for every tick. crt0.S exports a weak <code>isr_systick</code> symbol that I can implement.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>Ticks</span> <span>:</span> <span>Natural</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>procedure</span> <span>SysTick_Handler</span>

         <span>External_Name</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"isr_systick"</span><span>;</span>

<span>procedure</span> <span>SysTick_Handler</span> <span>is</span>
<span>begin</span>
    <span>Ticks</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Ticks</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>SysTick_Handler</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>I’ll also add a wrapper around the <code>wfi</code> (wait for interrupt) assembly instruction in the same package</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>procedure</span> <span>Wait</span> <span>is</span>
<span>begin</span>
    <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>Machine_Code</span><span>.</span><span>Asm</span> <span>(</span><span>"wfi"</span><span>,</span> <span>Volatile</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>True</span><span>);</span>
<span>end</span> <span>Wait</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Back in the blink loop, I call the wait for interrupt instruction and check the value of Ticks.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>

<h2 id="intro"><strong>Intro</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Hello, and welcome to CoRecursive. I’m Adam Gordon Bell. I’m trying to find and share the personal experiences of building software. I’m not really a big gamer, but lately I fell down this rabbit hole into the world of Casey Muratori, and this project that he started on Twitch in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
The videos are me just programming. They’re not even good. I mean, I’ll be honest. I’d love to say that they’re amazing, and that I’m really great. But they’re not. They’re not. All they are is a regular programmer who does actual real programming work. Right? It just ended up taking on a life of its own.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Casey’s game programming videos, they started a movement. It’s a movement that in some ways feels like software development from the ’70s. But in other ways, it’s totally modern and maybe points towards the future of learning or entertainment. I’m not sure where to start with Casey’s story, but the basics of his approach, they date to this job he had in the late ’90s.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
In 1999, I took a job at RAD Game Tools. I was still a C++ programmer at the time, meaning I was still … If I was going to write a matrix multiplication, it would be like templatized on the size of the matrix. Right? Traditional C++ class hierarchy with inheritance kind of programming. Smart pointers, for example. One of the things that was cool about RAD Game Tools is it was me and there were two other programmers there. RAD Game Tools is legendary in that the amount of money they make per programmer is staggering.</p>

<p>They were making millions of dollars a year and they had three programmers or something, and not on weird web laundering of money where you basically you’re selling ads to be like … Literally selling software. This is libraries they’re selling. Right? The two programmers there at the time, beside me, when I joined Jeff Roberts, who has literally written the video codec for every game basically in existence almost in history. Every game. Name a game, the videos play back through something Jeff wrote, right? From basically the year ‘94 to today.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Whatever the latest game is you pick up, it’s videos are playing back through something Jeff wrote. The other programmer was John Miles, who’s the guy who wrote the engine for Ultimate 5 way back in the day. He wrote the Miles Sound System which was the sound system used in most dos games. It was extremely popular, still exist to this day, in fact, and it’s used by people for sound. I want to say he also wrote the render on Wing Commander III. Anyway, those two programmers who were there and they are old school C programmers.</p>

<p>Here I am looking at this and I’m like, “Well, these are way better programmers than me, and they don’t use any of this stuff, and I wonder why.” Right? Why is it that you get some programmers who are literally some of the best programmers I’ve ever seen and they don’t use any of this stuff? Why is that? Right? Not only that, but if you take Jeff, for example, it might be argued he’s a programmer who as far as the video game world is concerned. I mean, it’s staggering to think of how many games have his code in it. Right?</p>

<p>Because they all [inaudible 00:03:32] It’s just like looking at how impactful they are and what amazing stuff they were able to do, and it’s like why am I using all this stuff? Do I know something they don’t? Because that seems unlikely. Right? There’s a little bit of programmery I always know what I’m doing nonsense, and it’s like do you? I mean, why are these other people who are so good not need that thing? Right. Being honest with you, you have to be a little bit introspective and go, “What’s going on here?”</p>
<h2 id="being-critical-of-your-own-skills"><strong>Being Critical Of Your Own Skills</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Did these guys talk to you and say why are you using templates or-</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
No. It was just … I mean, I am always as critical of my own habits as I am of anybody else’s, right? If I am aggravated with some piece of software that someone else’s … I’ve had some famous rants about Visual Studio, for example, and how bad it’s gotten. That dialogue, I mean, you might be tempted to think that that is just me complaining about someone else [inaudible 00:04:36] software. No. That dialogue is happening in my head about my programs all the time. I always think they’re terrible, right?</p>

<p>I’m always going what could I have done to make this less terrible? It only comes out of that. It was me just looking and going like, “There’s probably something to learn here.” Incontrovertible, these guys are better programmers than I am. That’s true. One reason for that could be that I just suck and I’m never going to get any better, so it doesn’t matter. So just keep using C++ and whatever. Right? Another possibility is that I could learn to be as good as they are, and I’m just not taking it seriously enough. I’m not trying. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Yes I’m trying to program, but I’m not trying to get better. Right? What are things I can use to get better? Well, I can look at what they are doing and go, “What about what I am doing is different, and can I assess if any of those are the answer?” Because they might not be. It might be that they just happened to program in C and I happened to program at C++, and they happened to be good and I happen to suck. That’s a totally possible thing that could have happened there. But another thing could be that actually I could be good, I could be writing code as good as they are, but I need to learn what are the things that they know that I don’t?</p>

<p>What are the practices they have that I don’t have? Right? I always try to do that as much as I can. If I see something that looks like it’s working well, or that they’re getting something done well, I try to go, “How can I reassess what I’m doing to see whether there’s something of that that would make a difference for me?” Because I want to be better, I don’t want to be writing bad code. But it’s not always obvious how to improve.</p>
<h2 id="trying-just-plain-c-programming"><strong>Trying Just Plain C Programming</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Did you spend time watching them code?</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Not in so many words. I never walked into someone’s office and was like, “Teach me how to program.” But I tried to say what are the things I could do that would assess my own practices in light of the fact that I have some good examples just sitting here? Because typically watching a programmer program at that time would have been creepy. I’d be sitting and we’d be like, “Kilroy was here.” I’m peeking up over the chair. A little Casey head pops up. What I did was I was in charge of the character animation system, and I wrote the first version, it sucked. I was going to write the second version as, let me try. Because I started programming C, not C++, and I had become a C++ programmer.</p>

<p>I was like, “Let me try just going back to see,” because honestly I know how to do it because I used to program [inaudible 00:07:22]. Let me try going back to C and what I’m going to do is I’m only ever going to use one of these features in C++ if I actually can demonstrate to myself that it would create a benefit here. What I found was that literally the only two things that were at all useful were operator overloading and function overloading. Those are the only two. Everything else, I was like, “Yep. The code was better without it.” Unlike most programmers, I actually had the experience of literally taking the time to see, do these features actually improve the code or don’t they?</p>

<p>I could actually test it because I was fortunate to have the time and control over a project to actually see what happened. From there, I was just like, “You know what? I need to do that for everything. I need to actually start taking this seriously and stop just assuming that because someone else puts something in a language that it must be good.” When you change your thinking to I’m going to evaluate rather than I’m going to trust, what you start finding is that most things most people say are mostly wrong, and the reason for that is they have to be because a lot of them are overlapping.</p>

<p>Most of the time you see two different people suggesting two different ways to do something, obviously someone’s wrong or there isn’t a better way to do it, meaning it doesn’t matter which one you pick. Either somebody was wrong and one of them was the correct way, in which case there was one that you should have rejected, or it doesn’t matter which way you do this, in which case they were all wrong for suggesting that you needed to do it this way. I think ever since that point in my career, it’s been about 20 years since then, I’ve just always evaluated things as carefully as I could.</p>

<p>When I see a new thing suggested, I go, “What does this actually yield?” If I look at the difference between doing it this way and doing it in whatever way I would have done it before, and I go, “Does that result in less lines of code, less bugs, less time?” Blah, blah, blah. I go, “Can I make an argument along any of these lines?” What you’ll find out if you do this, honestly, is a lot of the stuff is just a waste of your time.</p>
<h2 id="the-do-it-yourself-development-aesthetic"><strong>The Do It Yourself Development Aesthetic</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Casey, didn’t just leave C++ behind, he also nurtured this sort of obscenely DIY development aesthetic that’s pretty uniquely his. He doesn’t use an IDE. Just Emacs <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. He doesn’t use make or a build script. He doesn’t use any libraries. He thinks other people should try this approach.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
I think everyone should have the experience of building something from the ground up. Most programmers, no matter what they work on, would benefit greatly from having written one thing from scratch, meaning start in a fairly bare language, such as C, don’t use the libraries, just write everything yourself from just basic things. Even better if you want to try assembly language, but assembly language has a bunch of things that you have to do, like register …</p></div></div>

            <p> This screener assesses stocks by the following two factors:
                </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Highest short interest</li>
            <li>Mentions on Reddit</li>
        </ul><p>
        An indicator of whether they may be the next "meme stock". Short interest represents the total number of shorted shares divided by the number of shares outstanding. It is a helpful indicator that gives people an idea of what the overall market feels about a particular stock by showing what short-sellers are doing.
Historically, hedge funds would often announce their short position on a stock.
Investors can take advantage of understanding short interest by being able to predict the next “short squeeze”; in other words, a situation in which the stock jumps sharply higher, forcing short sellers who had bet that its price would fall, to buy it in order to prevent even bigger losses.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Members of Congress said troops at the Capitol have been hospitalized, because their food is below substandard quality.</p><div>
                            <p>WASHINGTON — In their final days protecting the U.S. Capitol from a potential reprise of domestic terrorism, members of the Michigan National Guard reported metal shavings, feathers, and undercooked meat found in substandard meals, a potential readiness risk that has hospitalized troops.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Michigan members of the House of Representatives wrote a letter Tuesday to Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard, expressing their displeasure with the findings.&nbsp;</p>
                        
                    <p>"It is completely unacceptable that our men and women serving in Washington D.C are being hospitalized due to the food they are being provided," the letter said. "We request that either the current contract be voided and a new food provider be brought in or that the service members be provided with a per diem throughout their remaining time in Washington, D.C.”</p>
                    <p>According to a closed-door National Guard update given to members of Congress, 59 people had wide-ranging gastrointestinal issues because of food consumed at the Capitol. Some of the troops managed their conditions in their quarters, others required a hospital diagnosis.</p>

                                </div>
                    <p>As reports of undercooked and underprepared food increased Monday, Sen. Gary Peters and Rep. Daniel Kildee, Democrats of Michigan, called for the firing and replacement of the meal contractor, sending appeals directly to the National Guard Bureau at the Pentagon.</p>
                    <p>“It is simply unacceptable that these men and women are being fed chicken with the feathers still attached, and raw ground beef,” Peters wrote to Hokanson. “After several attempts to rectify the situation and little progress, I believe that the only appropriate course of action is for the immediate cancellation of the existing food contract, the disbursement of per diem for the remaining duration of the mission and to provide retroactive per diem.”</p>
                    <p>Roughly 1 in 5 of the National Guard troops within the Capitol perimeter are from Michigan. Their mandate expires March 12, when Defense Sec. Lloyd J. Austin III said all troops are expected to leave the Capitol grounds.</p>

<p><span>When discussing symmetric encryption algorithms - like the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) - you may have been considering using AES-128 or AES-256. The last three digits represent the length of the secret key – think of it like the number of teeth in a physical key. From a security perspective, a 256-bit secret key is obviously better, but does it really matter which of the two options you choose? This article walks through some of the main security considerations for AES-128 and AES-256.</span></p>
<h2><span>Brute Force Attack Protection</span></h2>
<p><span>A brute force key guessing attack is where an attacker tries each potential secret key until the right one is found. This attack is guaranteed to succeed (eventually) and (ideally) should be the fastest way to break an encryption algorithm.</span></p>
<p><span>When discussing brute force attack protection, understanding just what different key lengths mean is essential. With the impending arrival of quantum computing, it is also good to know how they will impact cryptographic security. Are the current forms of AES strong enough?</span></p>
<h2><span>The Difference in Key Length</span></h2>
<p><span>The main difference between 128 and 256-bit encryption algorithms is the length of the secret key that they use. The 128 and 256 in AES-128 and AES-256 means that the two algorithms use 128-bit and 256-bit keys respectively.</span></p>
<p><span>The longer the secret key, the harder it is for an attacker to guess via brute force attack. However, AES-256 is not just twice as strong as AES-128.</span></p>
<p><span>With 128 and 256-bit secret keys, AES-128 and AES-256 have 2<sup>128</sup> and 2<sup>256</sup> potential secret keys respectively. With binary keys, each bit added to the key length doubles the key space. This means that AES-256 has 2^128 or 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 times as many keys as AES-128.</span></p>
<p><span>As a result, a brute force attack against an AES-256 key is much harder than against an AES-128 key. However, even a 128-bit key is secure against attack by modern technology. At its peak, the Bitcoin network - arguably the largest modern use of computational power for cryptography - <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/hash-rate?scale=1&amp;timespan=all">performed approximately</a></span> 150*10^18≈2^67 operations per second. Assuming that these operations are of equal difficulty to a brute force attack, it would take the Bitcoin network over 70,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years to crack a single AES-128 key.</p>
<h2><span>Resistance to Quantum Computing</span></h2>
<p><span>The threat of quantum computing to cryptography has been well-publicized. Quantum computers work very differently than classical ones, and quantum algorithms can make attacks against cryptography much more efficient.</span></p>
<p><span>In the case of asymmetric encryption algorithms (like RSA), quantum computing completely breaks them. However, for symmetric algorithms like AES, Grover’s algorithm - the best known algorithm for attacking these encryption algorithms - only weakens them. Grover’s algorithm decreases the effective key length of a symmetric encryption algorithm by half, so AES-128 has an effective key space of 2^64 and AES-256 has an effective key space of 2^128.</span></p>
<p><span>However, while this seems significant, it doesn’t break either algorithm. With the right quantum computer, <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/25196/chapter/6#98"><span>AES-128 would take about 2.61*10^12 years to crack</span></a>, while AES-256 would take 2.29*10^32 years. For reference, the universe is currently <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/15/age-universe-13-8-billion-years-scientists-confirm/3287409001/"><span>about 1.38x10^10 years old</span></a>, so cracking AES-128 with a quantum computer would take about 200 times longer than the universe has existed.</span></p>
<p><span>This also makes the assumption that an attacker has the “right” quantum computer. Cracking AES-128 would take an estimated 2,953 logical qubits and AES-256 would require 6,681. In 2020, the <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/ibm-promises-1000-qubit-quantum-computer-milestone-2023"><span>largest quantum computer had 65 qubits</span></a> with a goal of hitting 1,000 by 2023.</span></p>
<h2><span>128 and 256-Bit Algorithms Under the Hood</span></h2>
<p><span>Brute force attacks against a secret key are the best potential attack against a secure algorithm but what if the algorithm is has a vulnerability?</span></p>
<p><span>AES is broken up into two distinct algorithms: the encryption algorithm (which does the actual encryption) and the key schedule (which converts the secret key into round keys). The security of each of these matters to the security of AES.</span></p>
<h2><span>The Encryption Algorithm</span></h2>
<p><span>AES-128 and AES-256 use an almost identical encryption algorithm. Each encryption algorithm takes a set of operations and applies them a certain number of times or “rounds”. The only difference between AES encryption algorithms is the number of rounds: AES-128 uses 10 and AES-256 uses 14.</span></p>
<p><span>This means that, if an attack against the AES algorithm was discovered, it would likely affect both AES-128 and AES-256. The only difference is if the attack only worked up to a certain number of rounds of AES (which some AES attacks do). If an attack worked for at least ten rounds but less than fourteen, then a clear winner exists between AES-128 and AES-256. However, no such attack is currently known for AES.</span></p>
<h2><span>The Key Schedule</span></h2>
<p><span>The key schedule is where AES-128 and AES-256 become very different. The AES-128 key schedule is designed to turn a 128-bit secret key into ten 128-bit round keys. The AES-256 key schedule transforms a 256-bit secret key into fourteen 128-bit rounds keys.</span></p>
<p><span>Of the two, the AES-128 key schedule is actually more secure. The AES-256 key schedule has known weaknesses that might make it possible to perform related key attacks against the algorithm.</span></p>
<p><span>A related key attack should never happen in real life. For it to occur, an attacker needs to: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span> </span><span>Convince the key owner to take their existing encryption key</span></li>
<li><span> Create three other keys based on this key using relationships known to the attacker</span></li>
<li><span> Encrypt <span>2<sup>99.5</sup> </span>&nbsp;(that’s eight followed by 29 zeros) blocks of data with these keys</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Even if this attack were feasible, it can be avoided simply by using good key generation practices. A truly random key should never be vulnerable to a related key attack because it has no related keys.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the fact that this attack is infeasible to perform, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/07/another_new_aes.html">some cryptographers advise</a> – when given a choice between AES-128 and AES-256 with no constraints – using AES-128 over AES-256. If you have a simpler algorithm with a stronger key schedule, why use the more complex one?</span></p>
<h2><span>Picking Between AES-128 and AES-256</span></h2>
<p><span>128-bit and 256-bit AES both have their pros and cons. AES-128 is faster and more efficient and less likely to have a full attack developed against it (due to a stronger key schedule). AES-256 is more resistant to brute force attacks and is only weak against related key attacks (which should never happen anyway).</span></p>
<p><span>Since both algorithms are secure against modern and anticipated future threats, the choice between them doesn’t really matter from a security perspective. Our best guidance is that </span>AES-128 provides more than adequate security while being faster and more resource-efficient but readers who want that extra security provided by greater key sizes and more rounds in the algorithm should choose AES-256.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Schnorr just released a new paper <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/232">Fast Factoring Integers by SVP Algorithms</a> with the words "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem." (spelling included) in the abstract.</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroys RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/schnorr.jpg"></p>
<p>What does this really mean? The paper is honestly quite dense to read and there's no conclusion in there.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Several people have pointed out that the "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem" is not present in the paper itself, that is until the paper was updated to include the sentence without the typo.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: There was some discussion about a potential fake, but several people in the industry are confirming that this is from Schnorr himself:</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroyes RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/Screen_Shot_2021-03-03_at_3.07_.21_PM_.png"></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Sweis is <a href="https://sweis.medium.com/did-schnorr-destroy-rsa-show-me-the-factors-dcb1bb980ab0">calling for a proof of concept</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the claims in Schnorr’s paper, it should be practical to set significant new factoring records. There is a convenient 862-bit RSA challenge that has not been factored yet. Posting its factors, as done for the CADO-NFS team’s records, would lend credence to Schnorr’s paper and encourage more review of the methodology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/ducasleo/status/1367367057055109125?s=11">Léo Ducas</a> has been trying to implement the claim, <a href="https://github.com/lducas/SchnorrGate">without success</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Geoffroy Couteau thinks the claim is wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>several top experts on SVP and CVP algorithms have looked at the paper and concluded that it is incorrect (I cannot provide names, since it was in the context of anonymous reviews).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Daniel Shiu <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/88582/does-schnorrs-2021-factoring-method-show-that-the-rsa-cryptosystem-is-not-secur/88601#88601">pointed out an error in the paper</a></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Pedro Fortuny Ayuso is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26332034">very skeptical of the claim</a>. Will he end up eating his shirt?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Schnorr is 78 years old. I am not gerontophobic (being 50 I am approaching that age) but: Atiyah claimed the Riemann Hypothesis, Hironaka has claimed full resolution of singularities in any characteristic... And I am speaking of Fields medalists.
So: you do really need peer-review for strong arguments.</p>

Its usage is split into two roles: one system is set up as the <strong>master</strong> and is responsible for controlling those systems that connect to it. One or more systems are then set up as <strong>minions</strong> that connect to the master and respond to any commands it issues.</p><p>Both master and minions are typically run as root on the systems they are installed on.</p><h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2><p>Whilst looking at the source code for SaltStack for one of the previously disclosed vulnerabilities at <a href="https://www.immersivelabs.com/">work</a>, I decided to run the source code through <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit">Bandit</a>, a security scanner for Python applications to see how many issues it would find.</p><p>I was expecting to see quite a few results, as it has a relatively large codebase and has existed for several years. However, as can be seen in the screenshot below Bandit showed even more issues than I was expecting including 117 high severity issues.</p><figure><img src="https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_214009.png" alt=""><figcaption>Bandit's report for SaltStack Salt</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, many of these issues are false positives or of little importance to us, and it can take significant time to parse through all the data. For a quick win, I decided to focus my time researching some potential command injections due to several instances of <code>subprocess.Popen</code> used in conjunction with <code>shell=True</code> in the codebase.</p><p>After looking at a few of these that turned out not to be in any way controllable I found one that could be controlled via some clever trickery using process names.</p><figure><img src="https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_213907.png" alt="" srcset="https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_213907.png 600w, https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_213907.png 1000w, https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_213907.png 1089w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>This is the vulnerability we're looking for</figcaption></figure><h2 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h2><p>The minion's <code>restartcheck</code> is vulnerable to command injection via a crafted process name when this process has open file descriptors associated with <code> (deleted)</code> at the end of a filename (note the leading space is required). This allows for a local privilege escalation to root from any user able to create files on the minion in a directory that is not explicitly forbidden.</p><h3 id="vulnerable-code">Vulnerable Code</h3><p>The vulnerable code is at <a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/6211b30a2d93366dcaaa4d66fdf2479eae1524bd/salt/modules/restartcheck.py#L615">line 615 in restartcheck.py</a> where <code>subprocess.Popen</code> is called with <code>shell=True</code> and a command that can be maniplulated by an attacker:</p><pre><code>cmd = cmd_pkg_query + package
paths = subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
</code></pre><p>Where <code>package</code> is formed from the process name and <code>cmd_pkg_query</code> is one of the following depending on the OS:</p><ul><li>Debian: <code>dpkg-query --listfiles</code></li><li>RedHat: <code>repoquery -l</code></li><li>NILinuxRT: <code>opkg files</code></li></ul><p>If we can insert a bash control character such as <code>;</code> <code>|</code> <code>&amp;&amp;</code> etc into the process name we can trigger the injection when this code is reached.</p><p>However, to reach this code, a process first needs to have a filehandler open to a file with a filename that ends in <code> (deleted)</code>, and this file needs to reside in a directory that is not explicitly forbidden.</p><p>The list of forbidden directories can be seen <a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/6211b30a2d93366dcaaa4d66fdf2479eae1524bd/salt/modules/restartcheck.py#L33">here</a>. This deny list immediately rules out some of the more obvious places we might try to use such as <code>/tmp</code> or <code>/dev/shm</code>, however, there are a few common ones that a low privileged user may have access to such as:</p><ul><li><code>/var/crash</code></li><li><code>/var/spool/samba</code></li><li><code>/var/www</code></li></ul><h3 id="process-names">Process names</h3><p>During this research, it turned out that process names can be a surprisingly tricky thing to modify reliably, and a process name listed by <code>ps</code> may not be the same returned by the Python psutil library.</p><p>In Linux, process names can contain any characters (apart from null). Any user can start processes on a system and the process itself can set the process name. They are a good target for command injection vulnerabilities as developers are unlikely to expect process names to contain special characters or injections.</p><p>It is possible to use <code>exec -a </code> to directly set a process name; however, this doesn't work in <code>busybox</code> or <code>sh</code> shells and doesn't appear to show the same name when using <code>psutil</code>. It's also possible to modify the process name by directly manipulating procfs however this also leads to inconsistent results.</p><p>So in the end, the simplest and most consistent way to set a process name is to rename the binary or script being run. As filenames in Linux cannot contain <code>/</code> this restricts the commands we can inject, however using base64 encoding it is trivial to bypass this restriction as shown below:</p><pre><code># If we wanted to copy the shadow file to /tmp we could run this 
cp /etc/shadow /tmp/shadow

# Convert it to a base64 string
echo cp /etc/shadow /tmp/shadow | base64 -w0

# The result of the conversion
Y3AgL2V0Yy9zaGFkb3cgL3RtcC9zaGFkb3cK

# The new command we need to run
echo Y3AgL2V0Yy9zaGFkb3cgL3RtcC9zaGFkb3cK|base64 -d|sh -i

<p><em>Editor’s Note: In December 2016, then-President Barack Obama signed an executive order that announced sanctions on Russian individuals and organizations in response to election interference efforts.</em></p>



<p><em>The list included several notorious hackers, as well as Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). Also on the list was a lesser-known organization that left many puzzled: ZOR Security. The company was founded by Alisa Shevchenko, who worked as a virus analytics expert for Kaspersky Labs for several years and was passionate about building a co-working space for hackers and computer geeks. She had also been </em><a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/ICSA-15-085-01A"><em>credited</em></a><em> by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for assisting Schneider Electric in finding vulnerabilities in their software.</em></p>



<p><em>According to the announcement, Shevchenko’s company was a supplier to the GRU, the group said to be behind the hack on the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations. Shevchenko, who also goes by Alisa Esage, said U.S. authorities were mistaken, and that she had already closed her company. She currently works as an independent researcher, and is the founder of the </em><a href="https://zerodayengineering.com/"><em>Zero-Day Engineering project</em></a><em>, which shares technical knowledge and training on software vulnerability research.</em></p>



<p><em>Shevchenko talked to Recorded Future cyber threat intelligence expert Dmitry Smilyanets last week about her experience in 2016, her favorite vulnerabilities, and what it’s like to be a hacker in Russia. The conversation below, conducted in English, has been lightly edited for clarity:</em></p>



<p><strong>Dmitry Smilyanets: What was your reaction when you found out the U.S. government imposed sanctions on your company, ZOR Security?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Alisa Esage:</strong> I tried to keep calm and prevent the major press from portraying me as a kind of dangerous evil bitch that masterminded the hack of the century. Meanwhile, I kept working on my projects.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www-therecord.recfut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-1024x804.png" alt="Alysa Esage" width="451" height="353" srcset="https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-1024x804.png 1024w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-300x236.png 300w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-768x603.png 768w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-1536x1206.png 1536w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px"><figcaption><em>Courtesy of Alisa Esage.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>DS: How did it change your life?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I guess it made me a specialist in thriving under U.S. sanctions.</p>



<p><strong>DS: You said authorities were mistaken—in what way?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I don’t care about this anymore. People have the right to make mistakes. And the U.S. government likes to sanction everyone to assert power where they don’t have it, so let them.</p>



<p><strong>DS: Do you still feel the pressure of sanctions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I definitely feel that something is happening, but I wouldn’t call it pressure. If somebody can’t work with me or benefit from my products because they fear the U.S. government, it’s their own problem.</p>



<p><strong>DS: How did you get into cybersecurity and hacking?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> It all started with my father, Andrey. He was a talented electronics engineer, one of the first in Russia who started to assemble personal computers as a hobby when they were not generally available, based on spare parts and articles published in foreign technical magazines. He taught me to solder when I was 5 years old, I think. So I started reading books about computers and programming in early school and taught myself to code in C++ and x86 assembly language as soon as I got a PC at age 15. While still in school I learned reverse-engineering, solved ‘crackme’ challenges, hacked PC games and coded ‘keygens’ for fun, and participated in the Russian and international underground hacking scene, mostly on the side of low-level software cracking. That was the beginning of it.</p>



<p><strong>DS: Do you think it’s getting easier or more difficult for people to follow in your path?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> It’s a bit of both. When I was getting started, there was very little information available on computer security specifically. The internet was slow, and only a handful of publications might help you, aside from some generic books on computer programming. I recall there was a website named… something about ethical hacking, presumably ran by a woman; the articles published on it inspired me and helped me to get started. Nowadays it’s totally different. The information is abundant. There are thousands of public sources on all topics in computer security, from tutorials for beginners to professional deep technical trainings on advanced topics (like the ones that I teach, offered by my company Zero Day Engineering). This is the easy side.</p>



<p>On the other hand, computer technologies are getting more and more complex, technological developments are accelerating, learning curves are steeper and as a result, it’s getting harder to achieve high levels of expertise in this. It takes more time—years and decades. Remember the old assumption, “hacker equals teenager,” and that a hacking career ought to wrap up before one’s 30th birthday? So untrue today. The majority of the best hackers I know are well into their 30s, and they are just getting started. This is what it takes to gain true mastery in advanced hacking of modern computer systems: a lifetime dedication.</p>



<blockquote><p>For women [hackers] specifically: don’t listen to anyone, and keep doing what you love.”</p><cite>— Alisa Esage</cite></blockquote>



<p>Either way, I think that reaching truly advanced levels on this path is more of a destiny than a choice. It takes a very peculiar mindset that seems to be based on genetic data, among other factors, plus special circumstances in life to keep doing the impossible every day. There are plenty of easier ways to thrive and succeed in modern human society than pitching your brain against yet another hardened system. You know that you’re in it when you can’t live without it. And when it happens—congratulations, there is no turning back.</p>



<p><strong>DS: How would you advise other young women to get into a career like yours? What are the pros and cons of being a hacker?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> Find something that excites you, pick a specific task, and solve it until completion. Reflect and repeat. Solving technical tasks and completing them is essential to progress on this path, while passive consumption of information would mostly litter your brain and disrupt your technical creativity. Dedicate yourself to practice, read mostly primary sources (such as technical specifications, classical books, and high-quality blogs from researchers whose work you admire). It’s the same advice for both women and men.</p>



<p>For women specifically: don’t listen to anyone, and keep doing what you love. Especially if you already know that deep technical work is your passion, then don’t let anyone side-track you into management, lecturing, report-writing, marketing, or whatever else supportive roles in the cyber industry. Men and women definitely face different challenges in this career path, though it does get better over time (though a lot much slower and to a lesser extent than it’s commonly suggested).</p>



<p>Pros and cons? It’s risky and fun, obviously.</p>



<p><strong>DS: What do you like most about your line of work? What about your least favorite parts?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I like the uncertainty, the adversarial environment, hunting for bug bounties, and solving hard challenges. I like that my work is valued extremely high, so that I can earn a high-end annual salary in three days with my brain alone, while sitting on the beach in pajamas. I dislike that I have to compete with many smart guys, who comprise a dominant majority in this space. Men and women were not made to compete with each other.</p>



<p><strong>DS: What is the coolest vulnerability you ever found?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> A DLL Hijacking remote code execution bug in Outlook Express in Windows XP. It was a long time ago when Windows XP was still in use on every personal computer, and not just on ATMs and POS terminals like nowadays. In my early career in vuln research, I developed a proprietary methodology to discover zero-day bugs of this class and found many issues including the one in OE. For many years after I found it, I used to check if it’s still unpatched and it was. Nowadays it’s probably a “forever-0day”, since XP is EoL. Long-lived and reliable exploits like that are always fascinating.</p>



<p>Nowadays DLL Hijacking issues (also known as Insecure Library Loading) are still very prominent. For instance, a bug of this type was recently patched in Zoom Client for Windows. It’s trivial to find and trivial to exploit. The fact that world-dominating software developers still allow such trivial programming mistakes indicates a severe lack of vulnerability awareness in the global software industry. It’s one of the reasons why my company is developing specialized vulnerability intelligence feeds that (aside from our trainings) should help to bridge this knowledge gap and make the Internet more secure for everyone.</p>



<p><strong>DS: In your opinion, what’s the easiest way to compromise an organization in 2021?</strong></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www-therecord.recfut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/YoK64_9z_400x400.jpg" alt="" width="364" height="364" srcset="https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/YoK64_9z_400x400.jpg 400w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/YoK64_9z_400x400-300x300.jpg 300w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/YoK64_9z_400x400-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px"><figcaption><em>Courtesy of Alisa Esage.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> There is no such way, generally. Organizations are not uniform in their levels of security. What’s truly important to realize is that there exists a spectrum of offensive cyber technologies that may be leveraged to compromise an organization, from trivial to advanced. Attackers would typically go for the weakest link in the system, that can be broken with the easiest tech in the spectrum. As opposed to it, my professional choice is to specialize in the most advanced extreme of it—zero-day vulnerabilities and exploits, especially in hardened systems—because once you can solve a hard problem, everything else in the spectrum is a piece of cake. Also, because it’s kind of unstoppable. You can train your employees to avoid clicking on phishing that brings ransomware, you can establish a proper corporate policy to block insiders that deliver supply chain implants and leak your business secrets, but you can’t avoid technology altogether. And technological systems have bugs, that may be leveraged for arbitrary code execution. And game over.</p>



<blockquote><p>I like that my work is valued extremely high, so that I can earn a high-end annual salary in three days with my brain alone, while sitting on the beach in pajamas.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Another key point to realize is that, regardless of a security compromise scenario, the root cause of it is always a …</p></article></div>

<p>Have you heard of <strong>Shiny Object Syndrome</strong>?</p>



<p>It’s the condition of being distracted by “shiny” new things.</p>



<p>Fad diets, the latest gadgets, <a href="https://ozchen.medium.com/new-years-resolution-syndrome-db9f52e72a07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endless New Year’s resolutions</a> and yes…<strong>new stocks</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Shiny Stock Syndrome</strong> is the financial version of Shiny Object Syndrome.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever bought a new stock without doing research or feel like you’ve missed on out an investment…then you might have Shiny Stock Syndrome.</p>



<p><em>What if you miss out on the next Amazon, Netflix or Tesla? You don’t wanna be a dunce, do ya???</em></p>



<p>In other words, it’s financial FOMO. </p>



<p><strong>Hi, my name is Oz and I’m a cryptoholic… </strong></p>



<p>During the cryptomania of 2017, I bought several obscure cryptocurrencies thinking they’d simply go up. I did very little research on some of these cryptocurrencies. Some of these, like <a href="https://coin.market/crypto/linda-coin">LINDA coin</a>, are basically defunct. </p>



<p>I lost money. Luckily, I didn’t lose my shirt by holding <a href="https://ozchen.com/cryptocurrency-not-lottery-ticket/">more worthwhile crypto</a>. </p>



<p>That’s how I experienced Shiny Object Syndrome first hand.</p>



<p>Thankfully, there is a solution to this pernicious mental condition. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-this-better-than-what-i-already-own">“Is this better than what I already own?”</h2>



<p>Shiny Stock Syndrome is an expression of the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_effect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">novelty effect</a></strong>. This is the bias towards preferring something just because it’s perceived as new. </p>



<p>After all, we like to read “news” …and not “olds.” (Hey, I gotta drop at least 1 dad joke in here.)</p>



<p>To counter the novelty effect, we can take advantage of another bias: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect">endowment effect</a>, which is the preference for something we already own. </p>



<p>Use the endowment effect to pay as much attention to stocks you already own, compared to hot new stocks. </p>



<p>This insight from a <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/06/5-questions-investors-should-ask-themselves-in-202/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Motley Fool podcast</a> really stuck with me:</p>



<blockquote><p>…for every new stock I add to my portfolio, I want to add to an existing business as well. If I truly don’t feel confident enough to add to any of my existing businesses in my portfolio, then maybe that says to me, “Hey, you should probably sell one of these businesses if you don’t really like it that much.”</p><cite>Emily Flippen, Motley Fool analyst</cite></blockquote>



<p>So I’m adding this to my list of heuristics for investing. </p>



<ul><li>If a new stock isn’t <em>more</em> compelling than current stocks, hold or buy more of what I already own</li><li>If my current stock becomes less compelling, then I should be willing to trade it for new stock</li></ul>



<p>Of course, you don’t have to sell a stock you already own. But this is a good thought exercise for <a href="https://ozchen.com/general-specific-framework/">practicing specificity</a>. That can look like…</p>



<ul><li>Listening to CEO interviews and following them on Twitter</li><li>Reading through a company’s financial statements </li><li>Subscribing to a company’s investor relations’ newsletter</li></ul>



<p id="h-stealing-toms-1-for-1-model">To leverage ownership bias for good, <strong>we should be as into our current investments as we are new ones.</strong></p>







<hr>



<p>TOMS Shoes pioneered the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90344987/toms-made-buy-one-give-one-famous-now-its-updating-the-model">One for One model</a> of giving 1 product away for every purchased shoe. </p>



<p><a href="https://ozchen.com/retail-investors-vs-professional-investors/">Individual investors</a> like you and I can <s>borrow</s> steal the One for One model to build conviction in our investments:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>“Any time I want to buy a new stock, I have to buy a stock that I already own. </p><p>For every new stock I add to my portfolio, I want to add to an existing business as well.”</p></div><cite>Emily Flippen, Motley Fool analyst</cite></blockquote>



<p>Yes, this means counteracting Shiny Stock Syndrome with….Stock Hold Syndrome 🤣</p>

CDC has been exchanging data with colleagues across the country and similar results are&nbsp;coming from&nbsp;Quebec, as well as from the U.K., Israel and other countries.</p>  <p>She also said&nbsp;the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has been looking at the issue and will be issuing a statement on the matter in the near future.</p>  <p>As of March 1, however, the advice&nbsp;NACI is providing on its website says&nbsp;that the interval between the first and second shots of the Moderna vaccine should be four weeks, the interval for Pfizer should be three weeks and the interval for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should be 12 weeks.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The head of Moderna's Canadian operations, Patricia Gauthier, told Kapelos Monday that the company's own trials, and the conditions under which the vaccine&nbsp;was approved by Health Canada, are tied to a four week interval.</p>  <p>"That being said, we're in times of pandemic and we can understand that there are difficult decisions to be made," Gauthier said. "This then becomes a government decision. We stand by the product monograph approved by Health Canada, but governments ... can make their own decisions."</p>  <p>Gauthier said she is not aware of any studies done or led by Moderna on what happens when the interval between the first and second doses is changed from four weeks to four months.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1614633157759_7259"><div><p>On January 6, 2021, an armed mob stormed the US Capitol to prevent the certification of what they claimed was a “fraudulent election.” Many Americans were shocked, but they needn’t have been. The January 6 insurrection was the culmination of months of online mis- and disinformation directed toward eroding American faith in the 2020 election.</p><p>US elections are decentralized: almost 10,000 state and local election offices are primarily responsible for the operation of elections. Dozens of federal agencies support this effort, including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within the Department of Homeland Security, the United States Election Assistance Commission (EAC), the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Defense. However, none of these federal agencies has a focus on, or authority regarding, election misinformation originating from domestic sources within the United States. This limited federal role reveals a critical gap for non-governmental entities to fill. Increasingly pervasive mis- and disinformation, both foreign and domestic, creates an urgent need for collaboration across government, civil society, media, and social media platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Election Integrity Partnership, comprising organizations that specialize in understanding those information dynamics, aimed to create a model for whole-of-society collaboration and facilitate cooperation among partners dedicated to a free and fair election. With the narrow aim of defending the 2020 election against voting-related mis- and disinformation, it bridged the gap between government and civil society, helped to strengthen platform standards for combating election-related misinformation, and shared its findings with its stakeholders, media, and the American public. This report details our process and findings, and provides recommendations for future actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Who We Are: EIP and Its Members</h2><p>The Election Integrity Partnership <a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/news/announcing-the-eip"><span>was formed to enable real-time information exchange</span></a> between election officials, government agencies, civil society organizations, social media platforms, the media, and the research community. It aimed to identify and analyze online mis- and disinformation, and to communicate important findings across stakeholders. It represented a novel collaboration between four of the nation’s leading institutions focused on researching mis- and disinformation in the social media landscape:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public (CIP)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Graphika&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab)&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>What We Did</h2><p>The EIP’s primary goals were to: (1) identify mis- and disinformation before it went viral and during viral outbreaks, (2) share clear and accurate counter-messaging, and (3) document the specific misinformation actors, transmission pathways, narrative evolutions, and information infrastructures that enabled these narratives to propagate. To identify the scope of our work, we built a <a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/policy-analysis/platform-policies"><span>framework</span></a> to compare the policies of 15 social media platforms across four categories:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><em>Procedural interference</em>: misinformation related to actual election procedures</p></li><li><p><em>Participation interference</em>: content that includes intimidation to personal safety or deterrence to participation in the election process</p></li><li><p><em>Fraud</em>: content that encourages people to misrepresent themselves to affect the electoral process or illegally cast or destroy ballots</p></li><li><p><em>Delegitimization of election results</em>: content aiming to delegitimize election results on the basis of false or misleading claims&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>The EIP used an innovative internal research structure that leveraged the capabilities of the partner organizations through a tiered analysis model based on “tickets” collected internally and from our external stakeholders. Of the tickets we processed, 72% were related to delegitimization of the election.&nbsp;</p><h2>Key Takeaways</h2><h4>Misleading and false claims and narratives coalesced into the metanarrative of a “stolen election,” which later propelled the January 6 insurrection.&nbsp;</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Right-leaning “blue-check” influencers transformed one-off stories, sometimes based on honest voter concerns or genuine misunderstandings, into cohesive narratives of systemic election fraud.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Warped stories frequently centered on mail-in voting and accusations of found, discarded, or destroyed ballots, particularly in swing states. Misleading framing of real-world incidents often took the form of falsely assigning intent, exaggerating impact, falsely framing the date, or altering locale.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The metanarrative of a “stolen election” coalesced into the #StopTheSteal movement, encompassing many of the previous narratives. The narrative appeared across platforms and quickly inspired online organizing and offline protests, leading ultimately to the January 6 rally at the White House and the insurrection at the Capitol.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Fact-checking of narratives had mixed results; non-falsifiable narratives presented a particular challenge. In some cases, social media platform fact-checks risked drawing further attention to the claims they sought to debunk.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h4>The production and spread of misinformation was multidirectional and participatory.&nbsp;</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Individuals participated in the creation and spread of narratives. Bottom-up false and misleading narratives started with individuals identifying real-world or one-off incidents and posting them to social media. Influencers and hyperpartisan media leveraged this grassroots content, assembling it into overarching narratives about fraud, and disseminating it across platforms to their large audiences. Mass media often picked up these stories after they had reached a critical mass of engagement.</p></li><li><p>Top-down mis- and disinformation moved in the opposite direction, with claims first made by prominent political operatives and influencers, often on mass media, which were then discussed and shared by people across social media properties.</p></li></ul><h4>Narrative spread was cross-platform: repeat spreaders leveraged the specific features of each platform for maximum amplification.&nbsp;</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The cross-platform nature of misinformation content and narrative spread limited the efficacy of any single platform’s response.</p></li><li><p>Smaller, niche, and hyperpartisan platforms, which were often less moderated or completely unmoderated, hosted and discussed content that had been moderated elsewhere. Parler in particular saw a remarkable increase in its active user base, as users rejected the “censorship” they perceived on other platforms.</p></li></ul><h4>The primary repeat spreaders of false and misleading narratives were verified, blue-check accounts belonging to partisan media outlets, social media influencers, and political figures, including President Trump and his family.</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>These repeat spreaders amplified the majority of the investigated incidents aggressively across multiple platforms.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Repeat spreaders often promoted and spread each others’ content. Once content from misleading narratives entered this network, it spread quickly across the overlapping audiences.</p></li></ul><h4>Many platforms expanded their election-related policies during the 2020 election cycle. However, application of moderation policies was inconsistent or unclear.</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Platforms took action against policy violations by suspending users or removing content, downranking or preventing content sharing, and applying informational labels. However, moderation efforts were applied inconsistently on and across platforms, and policy language and updates were often unclear.</p></li><li><p>Account suspensions and content removal or labeling sometimes contributed to conspiratorial narratives that platforms were “covering up the truth,” entangling platforms with the narratives they wished to eliminate.</p></li><li><p>Lack of transparency and access to platform APIs hindered external research into the effectiveness of platform policies and interventions.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>Key Recommendations</h2><h3>Federal Government</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Establish clear authorities and roles for identifying and countering election related mis- and disinformation. Build on the federal interagency movement toward recognizing elections as a national security priority and critical infrastructure.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Create clear standards for consistent disclosures of mis- and disinformation from foreign and domestic sources as a core function of facilitating free and fair elections, including via CISA’s Rumor Control and joint interagency statements.</p></li></ul><h3>Congress</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Pass existing bipartisan proposals for increased appropriations marked for federal and state election security.</p></li><li><p>Codify the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s bipartisan recommendations related to the depoliticization of election security and the behavior of public officials and candidates for federal office noted in Volumes <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume3.pdf"><span>3</span></a> and <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/report_volume5.pdf"><span>5</span></a> of the Committee’s report on foreign influence in 2016 elections.</p></li></ul><h3>State and Local Officials</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Establish trusted channels of communication with voters. This should include a .gov website and use of both traditional and social media.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Ensure that all votes cast are on auditable paper records and that efficient, effective, and transparent post-election audits are conducted after each election.</p></li></ul><h3>Platforms</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Provide proactive information regarding anticipated election misinformation.

The solution could be a floating underwater rescue robot, which is intended to support rescue staff in emergencies in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>A research team from the Fraunhofer Institute for Optronics, System Technologies and Image Exploitation IOSB in Ilmenau developed the underwater vehicle with the help of Halle’s water rescue service, Wasserrettungsdienstes Halle e.V.

<br></p><p>According to the German life-saving association, the Deutsche Lebens-Rettungsgesellschaft (DLRG), nearly 420 people drowned in Germany in 2019, with the majority losing their lives in fresh water lakes. However, fatal accidents also occurred in swimming pools. One reason for this is the countrywide lack of trained life-guards to watch over pools. A team of researchers from the Institute for Advanced Systems Technology (AST) of Fraunhofer IOSB is aiming to improve this situation, by developing an aquatic robot, the only one of its kind worldwide. This robot will assist lifeguards and lifesavers, and rescue swimmers in emergencies. The scientists have used their years of expertise in the area of underwater robotics to develop this autonomous system. They have already designed an autonomous underwater vehicle that has won numerous awards – DEDAVE.</p><figure data-orig-width="1600" data-orig-height="1200"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a732387377c6f4194941cd5c78c56bc0/6481af0272f478b9-d6/s1280x1920/9f73e363ee978061d0915dafa1040e2de26155ee.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1600" data-orig-height="1200" width="1280" height="960"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;During testing at the Hufeisensee lake, the dummy did not slip out of the securing mechanism as it was taken to the surface.

The project was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). Surveillance cameras mounted on the swimming pool’s ceiling register the movement patterns and position of the drowning person in the pool, and send the coordinates to the robot. It is safely stored away from prying eyes in a docking station on the swimming pool floor, which opens in an emergency. Once the vehicle has reached its destination, it locates the endangered person and carries them to the surface. A mechanism for fixing the rescuee in place prevents lifeless bodies from sliding down as they surface. This mechanism can also be mounted on other underwater vehicles.</p><h2><b>Successful open-water testing</b></h2><p>At swimming lakes, drones and zeppelin systems take on the task of the surveillance cameras. “These drones and advertising balloons can easily be fitted with cameras,” says Renkewitz. For rescues in swimming lakes where the visibility is restricted, the underwater vehicle must be equipped with acoustic sensors instead of optical ones. Sound wave echoes can be used to determine people’s positions and orientation so precisely that the robot can autonomously head for the target person and pick them up.</p><figure data-orig-width="1600" data-orig-height="1200"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d3f45227310c258d7b8d8e415d0b95ab/6481af0272f478b9-ce/s1280x1920/3cf1c980d7b65cec2c18ac3b4ce2186ec2f254fe.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1600" data-orig-height="1200" width="1280" height="960"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;The aquatic robot transports the dummy to shore via the shortest route.

An 80-kilogram dummy was deposited at a depth of three meters. The robot then picked it up, secured it in place, brought it to the surface within a second, and carried it via the shortest route – a distance of 40 meters – to shore, where the rescue team was already waiting. When the robot is informed of an emergency, a signal alerts the team immediately. “The full rescue operation lasted just over two minutes. Casualties must be resuscitated within five minutes to avoid long-term damages of the brain. We were able to stay within this critical time frame without any problems,” says Renkewitz.</p><h2><b>Future outlook</b></h2><p>Equipped with batteries, motor, cameras, and optical and navigational sensors, the current system is 90 centimeters long, 50 centimeters high, and 50 centimeters wide. The objective of Renkewitz’s team is to further reduce the size of the rescue system and build different versions for use in swimming pools and lakes. They aim to make it smaller, lighter, and more cost-effective than the current prototype, which is based on a pre-existing underwater vehicle. Instead, the future robot will have the streamlined design of a manta ray.</p><figure data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="843"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/dadbca97136603e8f46501046f78dbb9/6481af0272f478b9-69/s1280x1920/4427008b73e7821cdc4f9218ef3109810e950171.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="843" width="1280" height="719"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Prototype modeled on a ray - In the future, the robot will resemble the streamlined cartilaginous fish.

In modified versions, it can take on further tasks – such as offshore and dam wall inspections or being used to monitor the health of fish in fish farms. “Our underwater vehicles have a very broad range of applications. For example, they are also suitable for detecting and verifying archaeological artefacts at the bottom of lakes,” explain the researchers.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://href.li/?https://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2021/march-2021/an-autonomous-underwater-robot-saves-people-from-drowning.html">Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft</a></b></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/183243493212/drones-search-and-rescue">Autonomous drones can help search and rescue after disasters</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Schnorr just released a new paper <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/232">Fast Factoring Integers by SVP Algorithms</a> with the words "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem." (spelling included) in the abstract.</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroys RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/schnorr.jpg"></p>
<p>What does this really mean? The paper is honestly quite dense to read and there's no conclusion in there.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Several people have pointed out that the "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem" is not present in the paper itself, that is until the paper was updated to include the sentence without the typo.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: There was some discussion about a potential fake, but several people in the industry are confirming that this is from Schnorr himself:</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroyes RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/Screen_Shot_2021-03-03_at_3.07_.21_PM_.png"></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Sweis is <a href="https://sweis.medium.com/did-schnorr-destroy-rsa-show-me-the-factors-dcb1bb980ab0">calling for a proof of concept</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the claims in Schnorr’s paper, it should be practical to set significant new factoring records. There is a convenient 862-bit RSA challenge that has not been factored yet. Posting its factors, as done for the CADO-NFS team’s records, would lend credence to Schnorr’s paper and encourage more review of the methodology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/ducasleo/status/1367367057055109125?s=11">Léo Ducas</a> has been trying to implement the claim, <a href="https://github.com/lducas/SchnorrGate">without success</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Geoffroy Couteau thinks the claim is wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>several top experts on SVP and CVP algorithms have looked at the paper and concluded that it is incorrect (I cannot provide names, since it was in the context of anonymous reviews).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Daniel Shiu <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/88582/does-schnorrs-2021-factoring-method-show-that-the-rsa-cryptosystem-is-not-secur/88601#88601">pointed out an error in the paper</a></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Pedro Fortuny Ayuso is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26332034">very skeptical of the claim</a>. Will he end up eating his shirt?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Schnorr is 78 years old. I am not gerontophobic (being 50 I am approaching that age) but: Atiyah claimed the Riemann Hypothesis, Hironaka has claimed full resolution of singularities in any characteristic... And I am speaking of Fields medalists.
So: you do really need peer-review for strong arguments.</p>

<![CDATA[Import Maps Release and Module CDN Launch]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <div>
<p><em>March 2<sup>nd</sup> 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>Today Chrome 89 ships as stable with support for <a href="https://github.com/wicg/import-maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">package import maps</a> in browsers. Aligning with this support, a new <code>ga.jspm.io</code> CDN is being launched today as a native modules <a href="https://jspm.org/docs/cdn">import map CDN</a> along with an <a href="https://generator.jspm.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online import map generator</a> for creating import maps against the module CDN.</em></p>
<h2>Import Maps Explainer</h2>
<p>Import maps allow defining the locations of modules imported from JavaScript in the browser, effectively like you would expect in any other language (and as is already supported in Node.js):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=<span>"module"</span>&gt;
  <span>import</span> pkg <span>from</span> <span>'pkg'</span>;
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Before import maps, if you run the above in any browser you would get the following error:</p>
<p><code><span>'Uncaught TypeError: Failed to resolve module specifier <span>"pkg"</span>. Relative references must start with either <span>"/"</span>, <span>"./"</span>, or <span>"../"</span>.'</span></code></p>
<p>This is because unlike other web resources, the JS modules specification for HTML reserved the space of these non-relative references (called "bare specifiers") exactly to allow custom package imports via import maps.</p>
<p>To map this specifier with an import map, we add the new <code><span>"importmap"</span></code> script type to the web page:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=<span>"importmap"</span>&gt;
{
  <span>"imports"</span>: {
    <span>"pkg"</span>: <span>"./pkg/main.js"</span>
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>And as of today, the above workflow is supported natively in Chromium for the first time.</p>
<p>In addition to the <code><span>"imports"</span></code> field in the import map, there is also the <a href="https://github.com/wicg/import-maps#scoping-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code><span>"scopes"</span></code> field</a> which allows for scoping the import mapping (useful when there are naming / version conflicts). Import maps can even map entire resolved URLs which can be useful in mocking workflows.</p>
<h2>The JavaScript Module Caching Tradeoff</h2>
<p>Import maps may seem nice and all, but perhaps they don't actually seem like much of a big deal - do they really solve any production-time technical problems?</p>
<p>The answer is that they do actually solve quite a deep performance problem with JS modules in browsers!</p>
<p>Without import maps, there is a natural caching tradeoff that applies to shipping JS modules in production, something like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the web you usually want all URLs to be unique and cached with far-future expires (the fastest request being no request).</li>
<li>We usually achieve this with unique URL schemes by including hashes or a unique build identifier in URLs so that updates don't cause conflicts.</li>
<li>Since modules have to import eachother by name <code>app-a09s8df0.js</code> will end up containing <code><span>import</span> <span>'./dependency-s8df79sd.js'</span></code>, and as a result the top-level hash is dependent on the lower-level hashes. A change to a deep dependency changes the <code><span>import</span> <span>'./dependency-s8df79sd.js'</span></code> into a <code><span>import</span> <span>'./dependency-qw97g23s.js'</span></code>, which in turn changes the hash of <code>app-a09s8df0</code> itself because its contents have changed. That is, a deep dependency change invalidates all the parent modules. A small change causes a large invalidation.</li>
<li>So if we want to be able to have cache sharing of parent modules while invalidating dependencies, we may be better off having <code>app.js</code> load <code>dependency.js</code> and then just not using far-future expires.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is thus a complex tradeoff to be made between perfect caching that quickly invalidates with updates, and imperfect caching that might provide better cache sharing for updates.</p>
<p>In comparison to build techniques today the above might not sound so bad, but we shouldn't compare to what we do today - we should compare to the theoretical best case.</p>
<h2>Ideal Modular Caching</h2>
<p>The theoretical ideal for module caching would be for each module to be cached with far future expires, while only being invalidated when that module itself changes.</p>
<p>Import maps can provide us with exactly this property:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=<span>"importmap"</span>&gt;
{
  <span>"imports"</span>: {
    <span>"app"</span>: <span>"./dist/app-cvf98b7c.js"</span>
    <span>"dependency"</span>: <span>"./dist/dependency-s9df7987.js"</span>   
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=<span>"module"</span>&gt;<span>import</span> <span>'app'</span>&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>app.js</code> would contain:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>'dependency'</span>;</code></pre>
<p>We now have the ability to independently update either <code>app</code> or <code>dependency</code> using the import map, while having both modules cached with far-future expires.</p>
<p><strong>Import maps bring the possibility of perfect caching for incremental updates of applications on the web.</strong></p>
<p>It turns out that coupled with using dynamic <code><span>import</span>()</code> lazy loading for first-load optimization, JS modules can be a pretty good bet for production workflow performance.</p>
<h2>Module CDNs</h2>
<p>Module CDNs take the perfect caching concept and extend it based on the following principle - taking the JS package as both the unit of optimization and the unit of perfect caching.</p>
<p>For a given package and version of that package, we optimize the entire package unit as a whole and host it under a unique URL with the version number.</p>
<p>Import maps applied to this model then allow perfect caching at the level of per-package granularity. The benefit of this being that the optimized package files can be shared between any number of applications since packages are the granularity of usage. In this way it acts as a source of precompiled and optimized JS packages for the browser.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://jspm.org/docs/cdn">ga.jspm.io CDN</a> is being launched to serve this role, with import maps generated by the <a href="https://generator.jspm.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Online Import Map Generator</a>.</p>
<p>This effectively then provides something akin to the npm install workflow that can work natively for browsers, with the import map treated as a sort of lockfile. JSPM as a browser native package manager stems exactly from this principle.</p>
<h2>Support in Other Browsers</h2>
<p>While we wait the years it will take for import maps to be widely supported for browsers other than Chrome 89, there are two production-suitable approaches currently available:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ES Module Shims</a>: A fast Wasm-based polyfill that just replaces the specifiers with their full URLs while still using the native loader. It's good enough for production in most cases and is used by the JSPM generator web application itself.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SystemJS</a>: A complete variant of the <code>ga.jspm.io</code> CDN is available serving <a href="https://jspm.org/docs/cdn#systemjs-variant">SystemJS modules</a> at <code>ga.system.jspm.io</code>, available for SystemJS import maps when selecting the "SystemJS Import Map" option from the JSPM Generator. SystemJS provides a workflow where native module semantics can be replicated in all browsers using the SystemJS module fomat.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Try it Out</h2>
<p>I had a lot of fun building the JSPM Generator using this approach and not having to touch a CLI apart from running a local server in dev and leaving it alone - and I really hope this can make JS development more fun for you too.</p>
<p>Please feel free to ask questions or share feedback - this stuff only works in collaboration. And there is still a lot of work to do. If you're interested in getting involved in the project please get in touch too.</p>
<p>Follow the <a href="https://jspm.org/docs/workflows">workflows here</a> or try out the <a href="https://generator.jspm.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">import map generator</a> directly.</p>

      <p><a href="http://indie.vc/"><span>Indie.vc</span></a><span>, a firm focused on bringing startups to profitability, is shutting down.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After six years and nearly 40 startups, one of Silicon Valley’s most unconventional and beloved VC firms is calling it quits, according to a </span><a href="https://medium.com/@bryce/the-end-of-indie-6e1b92d90b09"><span>blog post</span></a><span> by founder Bryce Roberts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re proud of the work we’ve done as investors, brand builders, and movement makers,” Roberts wrote. “We love Indie!...That said, without the institutional support to scale the Indie Economy we envision, it’s time to take our learnings and refocus on other strategies within the portfolio to deploy our capital.”</span></p>
<p><span>Indie.vc became an overnight sensation in Silicon Valley after Roberts (who had been a VC himself for years) published a Tumblr post on what the firm was about back in 2015. Instead of writing founders a huge check for a seed round or a Series A, Indie would use a new investment structure, working with startups on their path to profitability. Roberts didn’t think the concept was so radical — he once told TechCrunch that profitability was more achievable than raising a Series A.</span></p>
<p><span>Indie was part of a wave of founder-friendly VC firms in that they were perceived as not relentlessly marching their investments towards land-grab markets or unicorn-scale growth as fast as possible. Rather, Roberts focused on businesses that were on a path to profitability, and could be helped to get there with an investment that allowed them to not worry so much about their next round. They wanted their investments to have some basis in reality — a product, a corporate structure, revenue — not just drawing board ideas that could either become home runs or strikeouts.</span></p>
<p><span>In this way the fund bucked the trend of most big VC firms on and off Sand Hill Road, where a few monster investments carry along a portfolio of dozens of other bets that may never pan out to a "venture scale" return.</span></p>
<p><span>Several startups to come out of Indie have remained profitable, Roberts wrote, with many generating seven figures in revenue year after year. Indie’s startup mortality rate is 10%, compared with 44% for the rest of venture capital.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, the firm couldn’t continue without more capital from LPs, as many as 80% of whom backed out of supporting Indie. Their reasons usually had something to do with Indie’s break from the VC norm. Roberts even posted an example of the kind of LP rejection Indie often received, which said, “We are out. The shift in strategy for the fund over time (for your good, intentional reasons) has moved further away from the kinds of companies we are looking to have exposure to.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After publishing the post, Roberts tweeted about the outpouring of support he received after Indie’s demise.</span></p>
<div><p><span>“You pour yourself into something so completely for so long and then it doesn’t work out how you’d hoped and have to lay bare your failure while bracing for the worst,” Roberts wrote in a tweet.&nbsp;</span></p></div>

<p><em>author: niplav, created: 2019-04-02, modified: 2020-06-01, language: english, status: in progress, importance: 3, confidence: likely</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Two people are abducted and placed on the opposite poles of a
  habitable planet. They want to find each other, but they have no
  way to communicate. The only things they know is their their own
  respective position on the planet and the position of the equator and
  the poles. Here, different methods for finding each other under similar
  conditions are explained and discussed, and a deterministic method
  for finding each other is introduced.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>The original problem is taken from <a href="https://niplav.github.io/doc/lost_immortals_munroe_2014.pdf" title="“Lost Immortals“ (Randall
Munroe 2014)">Munroe
2014</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If two immortal people were placed on opposite sides of an uninhabited
  Earthlike planet, how long would it take them to find each other?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>– <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Munroe">Randall Munroe</a>, <a href="https://niplav.github.io/doc/lost_immortals_munroe_2014.pdf">“Lost Immortals” in “What If?”, p. 183</a>, 2014</em></p>

<p>Here, I add several clarifications to the problem.</p>

<p>For the following ideas, it is not necessary that the planet is
earth-like, but it is assumed that the planet has a relatively flat
surface, lacking oceans, where the two people can leave footprints.</p>

<p>Each of the two people has the following abilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Know their own position on the planet</li>
<li>Walk at approximately the same speed</li>
<li>Reason about the other person</li>
<li>Leave footprints on the ground</li>
</ul>

<p>Both lack all other abilities, including (but not limited to) creating
new technology and communicating when they are out of sight (no fireworks,
launching spaceships etc.).</p>

<p>Both people are typical, but had no opportunity to communicate with
each other beforehand. They can reason about each others' strategy and
behavior, but have no intricate knowledge about each others decision
process (if they are artificial agents, they don't know each others'
algorithm).</p>

<p>These two people want to find each other.</p>

<h2>Different Existing Solutions</h2>

<h3>Munroes Solutions</h3>

<p>Munroe proposes different solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Walk around at random: He states that they would find each other within 3000 years (though no explicit calculation is provided).</li>
<li>Agree beforehand to meet at a specific point on the planet (such as the highest mountain, one of the poles etc.).</li>
<li>Follow the coastlines of the continents. This is not applicable here, because it is assumed that there are no oceans.</li>
<li>Follow the coastlines of the continents, but after each circling, decide randomly whether to switch direction or resume the known path.</li>
<li>Walk at random, while leaving a trail of signs with increasing counter along the way, increasing ones speed when finding an unknown trail.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Proposed Solutions</h3>

<p>A very similar problem was discussed in a Mathematics Stack
Exchange post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose you and your friend end up on a big sphere. There are no visual
  cues on where on the sphere you both are, and the sphere is way bigger
  than you two. There are no means of communication. You can determine
  your relative position and direction by navigating the stars. You can
  move anywhere, and your friend too. <br>
  Upon inspecting the sphere, you see it is rock-solid, so you cannot
  create markings. To protect the environment, you are not allowed to
  leave other stuff, like a blood trace or breadcrumbs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>– <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/users/53495/robau">RobAu</a>, <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1214022/fastest-way-to-meet-without-communication-on-a-sphere/">“Fastest way to meet, without communication, on a sphere?”</a>, 2015</em></p>

<p>In this problem, marking are not possible, and players don't start at
the opposite sides of the planet (which makes a solution a lot harder).</p>

<h4>Moving at Random, but Changing Directions Rarely</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Move at random. [...]
  you could prefer to walk longer distances in a straight line as opposed
  to choosing a completely new direction after every centimeter of movement.</p>

<p>This solution does not need any prerequisites.</p>

<h4>Exhaustive Search, Moving in Spirals</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>So the first thing to do is to calculate the size of the sphere (by
  picking a direction and walking until you arrive back at the start point
  or some other, more efficient technique). At that point, you can work out
  an exhaustive search pattern and the duration to perform one (a spiral
  pattern is close to optimal but difficult for a human to perform). That
  duration becomes your frequency of decision making.
  Once per period, you flip a coin. Heads, you do an exhaustive
  search. Tails, you stay put. Each of the longer period (e.g. the less
  efficient search pattern), you have a 50/50 chance of doing the opposite
  of your partner and thus discovering each other in the course of the
  exhaustive search.</p>

<p>This is similar to the strategy of randomly switching positions, but
without opposite starting positions. It assumes one can adequately
calculate the circumference of the sphere, which is not a given, and it
assumes that the person can generate random bits.</p>

<h4>Randomizing Speed While Keeping Direction</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think a better strategy is to pick a direction (any will do), stick
  to it and randomise your speed. <br>
  If both parties do this their paths will cross twice each orbit (unless
  they are on the same orbit in which case they will meet sooner due to
  randomised speed) <br>
  if you go full random changing direction as well as velocity you aren't
  guaranteed to ever cross the path of the other. (although as t gets large
  it becomes increasingly likely that your paths will cross at least once.) <br>
  Speed randomisation is necessary to avoid never meeting because of resonance.</p>

<h4>Find a Schelling Point</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would posit that a better-than-random solution would include finding
  the most "interesting" such configuration (so first you have to map
  them all by traveling the sphere methodically) and heading there as a
  Schelling point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>– <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/users/54545/qwertronix">Qwertronix</a>, answer to <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1214322">“Fastest way to meet, without communication, on a sphere?”</a>, 2015</em></p>

<p>This solution is similar to most practical solutions to these kinds
of problems. It assumes that there <em>is</em> a most interesting star
configuration, the size of such a configuration, and a given metric
on how to determine the interesting-ness of such a configuration.
The metric is the least difficult of them: given a size of the region
of sky, the most interesting such region would be the one that is the
most compressible (or most regular). The size aspect of this possible
configuration is much more difficult: Where does such a configuration
end? One possible answer is: "At the horizon.", then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)">Schelling
point</a> would
be the point where the whole sky is most interesting.</p>

<h3>Randomly Switching Positions</h3>

<p>Another solution is possible due to the fact that both people start out
at the opposite sides of the planet. Each person determines randomly
whether they should travel to the opposite side of the planet or stay
at ones own side for the duration of such a travel. This drastically
decreases the time until meeting, since the chance of not having met after
n such iterations the chance of having met is <code>$1-\frac{1}{2^n}$</code>. Munroe
proposes coin flips to determine whether one changes position, but one
can imagine other such methods if coins are not available.</p>

<p>One could assign the choice of staying to the left body half and
the choice of going to the other side of the planet to the right
body half, and then choosing the strategy based on which part of the
body itches first. This would be useful since humans are notoriously
bad at consciously generating random bits (see <a href="https://niplav.github.io/doc/two_people_on_a_planet/humans_cannot_consciously_generate_random_numbers_sequences_figurska_et_al_2008.pdf" title="Humans cannot consciously generate random numbers sequences: Polemic study">Figurska et al.
2007</a>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, this method could be biased, since many humans have
points on their skin that are constantly itchy.</p>

<h2>A Better Solution</h2>

<p>A better solution is possible because both people start out at the
opposite sides of the planet, and know their own respective position on
the planet.</p>

<p>Taking their own position as one pole, they could infer an equator as
the set of points on the planet that is equally far away from each of
their positions. They would then both proceed to go to this equator
and start walking along it.</p>

<p><img src="https://niplav.github.io/img/two_people_on_a_planet/sphere.png" alt="Two agents move to the equator of a sphere" title="Two agents move to the equator of a sphere. They both start at opposing poles of the planet."></p>

<p>Then each person could follow the following algorithm: If they had
walked less than half of the circumference of the planet, and encountered
footsteps, they would reverse direction. If they had walked more than
half of the circumference of the planet, they would continue walking no
matter whether they would see other footsteps on the ground.</p>

<p>This would ensure that they would deterministically meet in <code>$\cal{O}(n)$</code>
(<code>$n$</code> being the circumference of the planet).</p>

<h2>Pseudocode</h2>

<p>This code does not deal with the possibility that the other agent doesn't
use the same method, or that they don't arrive at the equator at the
same time.</p>

<pre><code>circumference=4*walk_to_equator() /* circumference in steps */

set_marker() /* in case footsteps are not visible after some time */
equator_steps=0

while met_person()==false
    walk_step()
    equator_steps++
    if marker_visible==true and steps_on_equator&lt;circumference/2
        turn_around()
</code></pre>

<h2>Why it Works</h2>

<p>Here, it is assumed that they both reach the equator at the same time.</p>

<p>If both start walking towards each other, the algorithm succeeds:
Both can walk at most half of the length of the equator upon meeting
each other in the extreme case, namely, starting back to back and not
realizing it. In this case, the last part of the method is not applied,
because both will walk less than half of the length of the equator in
any case. In this case, finding each other takes at most <code>$\frac{3}{4}$</code>
of the time it takes to walk across the whole equator (including the
walk from the starting point to the equator).</p>

<p><img src="https://niplav.github.io/img/two_people_on_a_planet/towards.png" alt="The two agents start walking towards each other on the equator" title="Two agents start walking towards each other, their walking distance being less than half of the circumference of the sphere."></p>

<p>If they both start walking in the same direction, the method still
succeeds: one of the two people has a distance of less than half of the
length of the equator to the starting point of the other person.</p>

<p><img src="https://niplav.github.io/img/two_people_on_a_planet/parallel1.png" alt="Both agents start walking in the same direction" title="Two agents start walking in the same direction, meaning that they won't meet if one of them doesn't change direction."></p>

<p>Hello. It’s me, <em>Artist Formerly Known As Lead Maintainer of <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam">Foam</a></em>.</p>

<p>You may remember me from such hits as “feverishly astroturfing a community around an early-stage open source project and then disappearing into the thin air without any kind of acknowledgement that anything had ever happened.”</p>

<p>This is that acknowledgement, followed by some thoughts about the future of Foam.</p>

<p>I’ve organized this article in three parts, so that if you don’t have time to read the whole thing, you can jump to the part that interests you the most:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><a href="#present">Present</a></strong>, where we look at the current state of Foam.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="#past">Past</a></strong>, where I offer a personal account of my involvement, and subsequent non-involvement, in Foam, and hopefully learn something for the third act.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="#future">Future</a></strong>, where we discuss what could be ahead for Foam.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="present">Present</h2>

<p>Presently, I don’t presume to have any control over the Foam project.</p>

<p>In fact, I don’t presume to be able to speak for the project at all. In my absence, <a href="https://github.com/riccardoferretti">Riccardo Ferretti</a>, who was one of the first people to contribute to Foam, has stepped in as the project’s lead maintainer. Since October, he’s improved Foam massively by his own code contributions, while also coordinating the work of others. By this point, Riccardo has put as much work into the project as I have, and as such has very much earned the right to speak for it.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, Riccardo and I reconnected, and we’ve discovered our experiences maintaining Foam have been in many ways similar. In fact, in the previous paragraphs, when I’ve been using the first-person plural pronoun “we”, it hasn’t been just a rhetorical device. This piece was co-authored by Riccardo and I, and together, as the author and the maintainer of the project, we can proudly say:</p>

<p><strong>Maintaining Foam sucks.</strong></p>

<p>I initially created Foam with the goal of building the best networked note taking app. Right now it’s not even the best networked note taking extension installed in my VS Code. This might seem like a technical problem, but in our experience, the root cause is fundamentally organizational.</p>

<p><strong>The way we’ve ran the Foam project is not productive in the short term, and not sustainable in long term.</strong></p>

<p>We both want to make Foam better in the <a href="#future">future</a>, and we have some ideas on how to get there. But before we get to it, I want to take a self-indulgent detour to the past, and tell you how I came to walk away from Foam last September.</p>

<h2 id="past">Past</h2>

<p>Here’s a quick timeline of my personal involvement in Foam</p>

<ul>
  <li>On the 19th of June 2020, I made the first commit to what was going to become Foam.</li>
  <li>One week later, I <a href="https://twitter.com/jevakallio/status/1276098596111290370">launched publicly on Twitter</a>. By the end of that week, Foam held the #1 position on Hacker News, Product Hunt, <strong>and</strong> GitHub, which brought in a lot of attention to a project that was not set up to receive it.</li>
  <li>By early July I was working 16 hour days between Foam and my day job. I was also receiving daily calls from major venture capital firms who wanted to invest into turning Foam into the Next Big Thing in personal note-taking.</li>
  <li>By early August, I decided that I wanted to build Foam into a best-in-class product, but do it on my own terms. So I said <em>fuck you</em> to the man, quit my job, declined all investment offers, and planned to transition to working on Foam full-time on September 1st.</li>
  <li>On September 1st, I simply couldn’t get out of bed.</li>
</ul>

<p>So when people ask, why did you stop working on Foam, the answer is easy: <strong>I had no choice in the matter</strong>. Almost overnight I went from wanting to spend my every waking hour working on Foam, to not being able to pick up my laptop and look at another pull request or Discord message.</p>

<p>Except it didn’t really happen overnight. In retrospect, towards the end of the summer my manic working schedule had itself become a type of raging against the dying of the light. The surest recipe for burnout is getting stuck in a loop where you have to expend increasing amounts of effort for diminishing returns. Every day you feel like you have to work harder, because the day before you didn’t achieve what you set out to do.</p>

<p>Burnout is a devious disease, because it becomes the filter through which you see the world. With Foam, I was building a Second Brain to store my knowledge, but what I needed was a second brain to observe my first malfunctioning brain, and tell it that it needs help.</p>

<p>It’s almost embarrassing to admit to having burned out on open source. When you burn out in your corporate career, you can shake your fist at capitalism, and people can relate. But open source?</p>

<p><em>“You did <strong>what</strong> mate? You turned a fun hobby into a responsibility and spiralled into catatonic depression over a few GitHub stars? Good job!”</em></p>

<p>As a maintainer of a popular open source project, it’s hard not to feel the weight of the collective expectations of the users, contributors and spectators of your project on your shoulders.</p>

<p>This is not a complaint about “entitled users”: Whether or not any individual contributor actually asks for your time, attention or care, you feel indebted to give it to them all. Well, I don’t know about you. I did, anyway.</p>

<p>Which finally brings us to something resembling a point:</p>

<p>An open source project can become just as toxic and stressful as a corporate workplace, when it’s poorly managed. <strong>I ended up leaving Foam because I had created a fundamentally unsustainable environment and then tried to sustain it until I no longer could.</strong></p>

<h3 id="dynamics-of-open-source">Dynamics of Open Source</h3>

<p>In her excellent book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54140556-working-in-public">Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nayafia">Nadia Eghbal</a> categorizes open source projects into four categories: federations, stadiums, clubs, and toys.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>&nbsp;</th>
      <th>High User Growth</th>
      <th>Low User Growth</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>High Contributor Growth</strong></td>
      <td>Federations <em>e.g. Rust</em></td>
      <td>Clubs <em>e.g. Astropy</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Low Contributor Growth</strong></td>
      <td>Stadiums <em>e.g. Babel</em></td>
      <td>Toys <em>e.g. ssh-chat</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>What I wanted Foam to be was a <strong>Federation</strong>: A Populous, plentiful ecosystem, packed with diverse ideas loosely affiliated projects that would scale without central bottlenecks. Instead it became a <strong>Stadium</strong>, with a bunch of people running from the rafters onto the field trying to kick the ball to the direction they thought it should.</p>

<p>Where we ended up was the worst of both worlds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By our own principles, we decried central governance, and therefore gave up the ability to draw a box around of what Foam is and isn’t.</li>
  <li>Because we lacked a cohesion of ideas, we weren’t able to build infrastructure on top of which people could build their individual, decentralized projects while remaining interoperable.</li>
</ul>

<p>We were trying to build an infinitely large platform in the middle of a ever-shifting ocean of ideas</p>

<p>For this project to ever reach its stated goals, this will have to change.</p>

<h2 id="future">Future</h2>

<p>When I wrote Foam’s <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/principles">Principles</a>, the goal was to build a software platform that would make it easier for people to solve their own problems, while contributing to a shared commons that everyone can enjoy.</p>

<p>What I’ve since learned is that:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Freedom</strong> does not mean anyone is free to introduce ideas and features that significantly change the scope of the project and we should simply accept them, or try our best to fit them in our vision.</li>
  <li><strong>Openness</strong> does not mean we should accept low-quality contributions that increase the maintenance burden of the project, because in most cases, the contributor is not going to stick around to maintain it, and that burden will fall on us.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every successful software abstraction creates value by defining a set way of doing things, and provides tools to achieve them. In order to do this, they also define what is not possible within this abstraction.</p>

<p>Because we didn’t understand this early on, Foam quickly became a collection of loosely affiliated projects, ideas and approaches to note taking, sometimes incompatible with each other — far from the platform we envisioned.</p>

<p>To fix this, we have to draw some lines in the sand, so that we can make:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Foam, the product” better in the short term,</li>
  <li>“Foam, the project” more feasible to develop in the medium term, and</li>
  <li>“Foam, the community” more sustainable for its maintainers and users in the long term</li>
</ul>

<p>Riccardo and I have compared what we’ve learned, and we have decided to join forces to work on the following approaches.</p>

<h3 id="refocus">Refocus</h3>

<p>Going forward, we want to be more intentional about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What Foam really is (and isn’t)</li>
  <li>Who Foam is for (and who it isn’t for)</li>
  <li>Which use cases Foam caters for (and which it unapologetically does not)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At the end of this journey, <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam">foambubble/foam</a> will be a leaner, and more centralized project.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Some features will move to their own, officially-unsupported repositories, where anyone who deeply cares about them may adopt them.</li>
  <li>Others features, that belong to the bucket of what “Foam isn’t”, may be killed outright.</li>
  <li>We will kill the defunct <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/rfcs">RFC</a> process (it was never <em>really</em> there anyway).</li>
  <li>We will also update the project’s documentation and contribution guidelines to be clearer on what types of contributions will be welcome to Foam’s core.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not a closing of the gates. Quite the opposite. What we want to do is to build the infrastructure of the commons.</p>

<h3 id="infrastructure-of-the-commons">Infrastructure of The Commons</h3>

<p>The stated goal of Foam has not changed. <strong>What we want is to enable <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/">Foam</a> and its community of people to more effectively solve their own problems, explore a constellation of ideas, and contribute them back to a commons.</strong></p>

<p>That requires being more than glue. It requires becoming a solid platform, and in order to do this, we’ll:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bring core features in-house</strong>, to provide a strong networked note taking experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Open the Foam API</strong> so that third-party extensions can build on top of the Foam knowledge graph model.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the past, we’ve co-managed document linking and data visualization with other extensions, but for Foam to be able to build on top of its own platform, we need to reduce the amount of Lowest Common Denominator constraints set by supporting the projects and their nuances.</p>

<p>The next major evolution Foam will no longer require you to install other extensions for document linking and navigation. We aim to provide a more coherent …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-560368d843630fd9268b"><div><p>In my current role, I spend the bulk of my day interacting with CTOs who are hiring engineers and learning about their companies, engineering philosophies, and specific gaps in their team. I know a lot about the universe of potential jobs that exist for engineers at a per company, per role level, but ultimately almost nothing about if a particular individual should accept a particular job offer.&nbsp;</p><p>Every day, I talk to at least one engineer who’s deciding if a startup job offer is right for them. And every day I point them towards a decision-making framework they can use, inspired by the Commit team’s experience choosing roles, as well as by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gokulrajaram1/"><span>Gokul Rajaram</span></a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marius-de-beer-a9091b1/"><span>Marius de Beer</span></a>.</p><p>Gokul Rajaram is a software engineer, former startup CEO, has led product at Square and DoorDash, sits on the board of The Trade Desk, Pinterest and Coinbase, and an investor/advisor to dozens of companies, including Poshmark. He is also Commit’s go-to-resource for running great All Hands meetings. <a href="https://blog.commit.dev/articles/gokul-rajaram-talks-with-commit"><span>Gokul sat down with Commit in October</span></a> to share his thoughts on today’s challenges and opportunities for startups.</p><p>Marius de Beer is a mechanical and software engineer, with a decade of experience as an agile coach. He is also Commit’s go-to-resource for setting company values.</p><h2><strong>A Framework for deciding on a startup job offer</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. Is a startup the right choice for you?</strong></h3><p>There is a startup subculture that can make it feel like the obvious best option - Hacker News, TechCrunch, Twitter, etc cover startups with excitement and a sense of possibility that a public company doesn’t always receive. This atmosphere provides a valuable sense of meaning and camaraderie for startup employees, but it doesn’t mean that joining a startup is the absolute best decision.</p><p>Ask yourself, how important is stability in both your role and your company? Are you looking to optimize your cash compensation number? How much do you value work-life balance and boundaries? If those things are very important to you, you likely would prefer a more mature company (<a href="https://visible.vc/blog/startup-funding-stages/"><span>series C or later</span></a>). But if those are less important to you than growth, autonomy and creativity, then you aren’t likely to feel that you’re making a sacrifice by joining a startup.</p><p>You should think about compensation as more than just the base cash salary. The earlier stage company you join, the more your potential equity could be worth. You have to determine for yourself if you’re willing to sacrifice some base cash salary today for potential equity growth down the road. And regardless of how important compensation is to you, “you must ensure that the total compensation in a role lets you take care of yourself and your family.”&nbsp; - Marius de Beer</p><p>No startup is worth putting yourself into debt for.</p><h3><strong>2. Is the team not just VC-backable, but a group that you will thrive working with?</strong></h3><p>As an ex-VC, I felt a bit guilty realizing there were companies that I would invest in, but not work at. However, I realized that each of us have unique cultural attributes and personality traits, which companies similarly embody. I think it is table stakes to believe in management and their ability to lead and to like and respect the people with whom you will work alongside. But those factors alone don’t tell you if a company’s culture and values align with you, and will set you up to thrive.</p><p>We’ve built a list of attributes at Commit that we score engineers and companies against - you may find it helpful to see which attributes are core to your personality, and look for those attributes in the job descriptions and values of companies that you’re considering.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>You are motivated by autonomy and independence</p></li><li><p>You feel a deep responsibility for code quality</p></li><li><p>You are customer-obsessed</p></li><li><p>You are most concerned with</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Business context informing product decisions;</p></li><li><p>Stability and performance;</p></li><li><p>Solving hard technical problems; or</p></li><li><p>Beautiful design;&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>You do best in opinionated, debate-heavy cultures versus you do best in organizations with clear top-down decision making</p></li><li><p>You prefer to work asynchronously via written communication versus you prefer to work through conversation</p></li><li><p>You want to lead and grow teams versus you want time and space to do your best work as an individual contributor</p></li><li><p>You thrive during setbacks and moments of transition versus you prefer to be insulated from shocks</p></li><li><p>Work is a source of identity to you</p></li><li><p>You want to hone your craft versus you are energized by exposure to unfamiliar technical patterns, systems, or languages</p></li></ul><p>Regardless of these values, you should look for a team that is mission-oriented. A founder who embodies a mission has a deeply held conviction about why the company exists, what it aims to accomplish, and whom it helps. They emote this in their communication and - most importantly - they use the mission as a litmus test for tough decisions.</p><p>“When you talk to a CEO, you need to understand why they’re leading this type of company, and do they really believe in the mission themselves? Do they epitomize the mission? If you talked to Larry [Page], who was the CEO when I joined Google, you could see how deeply he believed in the mission. He was Mr. Search. He believed deeply in technology and investing in deep technology.” - <a href="https://blog.commit.dev/articles/gokul-rajaram-talks-with-commit"><span>Gokul Rajaram</span></a></p><h3><strong>3. Does this role advance your personal and career growth goals?</strong></h3><p>Your goals may be related to power, title, scope of work (ie. moving into a manager track or staying on the IC path), learning, creativity, and agency. Determine where you see yourself in 1, 3 and 5 years, and ask yourself if this role takes you closer to those goals or farther away.</p><p>Marius de Beer’s framework is to ask yourself:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>What do you want to accomplish and see on your EP/LinkedIn profile in 18 months’ time? Describe it in a short paragraph.</p></li><li><p>Now, imagine you put that statement at the centre of a mind map. List below the possible success factors to achieve that statement. In other words, how would you know if you were successful at achieving this goal? Prioritize this list.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>What are the necessary pre-conditions to achieve those items? Again, prioritize this list. Be clear with the people who offer you the new opportunity that these pre-conditions exist - otherwise you will not be successful.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>4. Are you excited to wake up every day and think about this problem space?</strong></h3><p>This applies even if you realized through question two that work is not a source of identity to you. Every day you will wake up to a new problem that must be solved. Do you like thinking about the problem? Is it satisfying when a breakthrough pops into your head in the shower or is it an intrusion? Will this company have an impact on an issue that is important to you? Are you interested in the product/service, or empathetic towards those who are interested in it?</p><p>Everyone will have a different philosophy on how important this problem space must be to them. Some will only want to work in an industry that is their most important issue. (Those people often start companies so you can expect this to be the most important problem space to the founders!)</p><p>“On the mission side, I realized that missions that resonate with me are the missions that are fairly universal and broad. At Google, the mission is around making information democratized and accessible. At Facebook it was around connecting the world. At Square it was around making commerce easy and helping small and medium-sized businesses and individuals—economically empowering them.” - <a href="https://blog.commit.dev/articles/gokul-rajaram-talks-with-commit"><span>Gokul Rajaram</span></a></p><h3><strong>5. Do you believe that the company will succeed?</strong></h3><p>Everyone has a different tolerance for how much the company must have succeeded to date, but you will want to have confidence that the company can succeed. There are simple signals like credibility with customers and notable partners, or performance against commonly accepted metrics.</p><p>“To judge if a company is on the right path, I really try to understand the business model and know what metrics to look for. Andreessen Horowitz has a good resource for different types of business models - <a href="https://a16z.com/2015/08/21/16-metrics/"><span>https://a16z.com/2015/08/21/16-metrics/</span></a>.” - Thomas Zhou, Graduated Engineering Partner.</p><p>“I’m a big fan of Amy Hoy’s techniques about uncovering customer pain and studying a market (going from pain to product).&nbsp; The business team should deeply understand the market you’re in, the pains your audience experiences, and what they care about/how they solve their problems. That should guide every product decision.” - Thiago Araujo, Graduated Engineering Partner.</p><p>If you’re evaluating a very early-stage startup, there may not be any metrics or business traction at all. This is when you can lean on the founders, why they found the problem worth solving, and what is motivating them to build this company (a good answer is ‘to solve the problem’, while a worrying answer is ‘for the glory of being a CEO’).</p><p>“My ideal scenario is finding founders who come from the space the company is trying to solve a problem for. They were the ones who ran into the problem in their day-to-day and found that it was worthwhile enough to quit their jobs and start a company to solve it.” - Hai Hoang, Graduated Engineering Partner</p><p>“The most successful startups have a founder with a unique and non-obvious insight on this market.” You’ll know within an hour of speaking with them - ‘Aha!’ that’s the non-obvious insight about the market!” - <a href="https://blog.commit.dev/articles/gokul-rajaram-talks-with-commit"><span>Gokul Rajaram</span></a></p><h3><strong>6. Marius de Beer’s Final Test. Do you say 'yes' or 'no'?</strong></h3><p>Imagine you walk into the office of your current boss to tell them you are leaving. You haven't signed the new offer at this point so there's no legal or ethical conflict. Their response is to say to you: “I’ll give you everything you’ve been offered and everything that you want out of that new job”. Do you say 'Yes' or 'No'?&nbsp;</p><p>Yes? You're not ready to leave.&nbsp;</p><p>No? It’s time to go make a difference somewhere else.</p><p><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahmarion/"><span><em>Sarah Marion</em></span></a><em> leads Founder Partnerships at Commit. She’s spent her career collaborating with early stage founders as they solve valuable problems.</em></p><p><strong>We hire Software Engineers to build their careers with promising early-stage startups. </strong></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>One summer I was staying in a hotel in the coastal North African town of Hammamet. My first evening there, and while I was in the lobby, I met a Saudi Arabian chemistry professor drinking a beer and surfing the web using an <a href="http://benwajdi.com/go/8thgenerationipad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPad</a>. We talked and it turned out we shared some interests. One of these was politics. As we progressed in our chitchat one question popped up into my mind—one that I’d been curious about and more curious hearing a Saudi’s opinion on the issue. So, in the middle of the conversation, I threw at him a question: “Don’t you think that one day Iran and Saudi Arabia would be strong allies, the way Israel and America are, collaborating with each other militarily and economically? I can’t stop thinking how the Middle East would look like if they do so, and more importantly, who’s best interest is served when Saudi Arabia and Iran always stay in conflict?”<br>&nbsp;The guy was surprised by the question thrown at him, and he simply ignored the possibility. “Why not, “I thought to myself. I still think about the possibility to this day. You may say that it’s not possible because of “history”. Well history is in the making as long as the world and mankind coexist. When The Suez Canal Company built the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suez Canal</a> in the late 19th century, history changed. The same thing happened when the US built <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Canal" target="_blank">The Panama Canal</a>. Both Canals altered geography and history—in that same order.</p>



<blockquote><p>Sustainable peace and security require good bilateral relations and regional cooperation between Tehran and Riyadh. Iran and Saudi Arabia have significant differences, but they share common interests in many critical issues, such as energy security, nuclear nonproliferation, and Middle East stability.</p><cite>Hossein Mousavian, author of <a href="http://benwajdi.com/go/bookhosseinmousavianiranandus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Iran and the United States: An Insider’s View on the Failed Past and the Road to Peace</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>As I am writing this in my daily journal, Biden, and after 5 weeks inside the White House, has just announced more American sanctions on Russia (Because of an attempted Alexei Navalny assassination by poisoning). He has just bombed Iranian targets in Syria (while trying to negotiate with Iran). He is also putting more and more pressure on Saudi Arabia after The US Intelligence came to the conclusion—one that was intentionally communicated to the public—that Mohammed Bin Salman (aka MBS) was the one pulling the strings, orchestrating the Jamal Kashuqgi’s murder in Turkey, an event that neither journalists nor the people of Istanbul will ever forget.</p>



<p>Nothing is impossible in politics. But, it seems the possibility of Iran and Saudi Arabia becoming regional allies, getting together, and going over all the conflicts of the past, is unlikely to happen in the near future—though I think it is still possible, under the right circumstances.</p>

          <p>Sorry for not replying, Rob, I was super busy with fixing things. This is purely a technical problem, not a financial one, which is kind of how I got into the situation. So far, I was always able to fix things just by renting more servers, but that is now no longer effective and AcoustID needs bigger changes.</p>
<p>The service is now partially restored, but heavily rate-limited at least for the next week or so, until I manage to separate some parts of the backend.</p>

        <p>I’ve increased the rate limits, as things seem more stable now, but I’m seeing nowhere near the amount of traffic I was seeing before the incident, so something must be still wrong. If the service is not working for you, please let me know and I’ll try to find out why it’s not working.</p>

	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		<p>With the exception of exchanges, scammers, YouTube channels and news sites full of filler and ads, and whales like Michael Saylor, it would seem hardly anyone is making money with cryptocurrency. Despite Bitcoin going from $10k to $40k in less than two months, one is still hard-pressed to find many success stories or evidence of ordinary people getting rich buying and holding or trading crypto. A few days ago I scanned the popular Reddit subs r/bitcoin and /r/cryptocurrency for posts of people who had made sizable sums of money with crypto, and I only found two: someone who had bought a $10,000 Omega watch with their crypto gains, and someone else who made $63,000. Sure, this is better than nothing , but not exactly life-changing amounts of money, especially given how well Bitcoin has done over the past year. By contract, on /r/wallstreetbets there are pages up pages of people making hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars seemingly effortlessly with stock options and with buy and hold. Sure, some on /r/wallstreetbets lose a fortune too, but even in spite of large losses, it would seem that there is far more wealth to be made with stock trading compared to cryptocurrency. It is not even close. I had to dig through dozens of pages to find even just a handful of people who had made a sizable amount of money with crypto, whereas on /r/wallstreetbets it’s the opposite.</p>
<p>Where are the millionaires? Surely there must be some. This is not to say that no one has gotten rich with crypto. There are people who bought Bitcoin from 2010-2013 and are sitting on large fortunes. But one would think that there would be dozens of posts every week from newly-minted crpyto millionaires bragging about their gains. One explanation is that bragging this incurs the risk of having your funds stolen, but it is not like you can break into someone’s cold storage wallet from a Reddit account. I imagine that anyone with a fortune would know how to share a screenshot or make a post without compromising their crypto.</p>
<p>So why has crypto been such a loser despite the bull market over the past 2 years, especially compared to stocks? Why aren’t people making money with crypto, but stock trading millionaires are a dime a dozen? There are several reasons:</p>
<p>1. Crypto has too much volatility and hence poor risk-adjusted returns compared to stocks. Whereas many stocks and indexes tend to exhibit a gentle rising slope over the duration of the post-2009 bull market, punctuated by a deep but brief dip due to Covid, crypto tends to zig and zag unpredictably. This is bad for many reasons: too much volatility makes it harder, psychologically, to stay in the market without panic selling at a loss or taking profits too soon. Although bitcoin may have higher absolute returns compared to the Nasdaq , the volatility is considerably higher. This also makes it harder to apply leverage strategies, further minimizing returns. If the Nasdaq has 25% annual returns but 10% draw-downs vs. 50% returns for Bitcoin but 30% drawdowns, you can use 4-1 leverage on the Nasdaq and make 100% in a year with a 40% maximum draw-down, but even applying 2-1 leverage on Bitcoin will give you 100% return but a 60% maximum draw-down. Clearly, stocks provide better risk-adjusted returns with leverage.</p>
<p>Leveraged stock strategies such as buying and holding 3x ETFs such as FNGU,TQQQ, and TECL, have outperformed Bitcoin since 2018. In early 2018, when Bitcoin was at $12k or so, I recommended FNGU as an alternative to Bitcoin (as a sort of high-risk but high return investment). Three years later, FNGU is up over 500% vs. 350% for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>2. No options market with crypto. Stock options allow small returns of the underlying index or stock to be magnified, but options trading is still very limited with crypto. It is possible, but it does not work nearly as well as stock option trading.</p>
<p>3. Too hard and cumbersome to deposit and withdrawal large sums of and crypto and or fiat. Even after 911, given all of the Patriot Act restrictions, I found it very easy to deposit money in a brokerage account and begin trading. All I had to do was wire money to the broker and within 3 days I was able to trade. With crypto, often you need ID cards and proof of funds due to various arbitrary compliance and anti-money laundering restrictions and regulations. Prior to 2017, it was easy to transfer funds and crypto in and out of exchanges, but criminals inevitably abused and exploited the good will of exchanges. That is usually what happens with these sort of things: all it takes is a few bad actors to permanently ruin it for everyone else. Two decades later, we still have to take off our shoes at the airport because someone had the brilliant idea of smuggling a bomb in their shoe.</p>
<p>4. Too small of position sizes. On /r/wallstreetbets it is not uncommon to see traders in their 20s or 30s make bets of ten thousand dollars or more on a single option trade. Yet for some reason with crypto everyone is skinflint and risk averse. It’s like “I deposited $50 into my Coinbase” is the norm. You’re not going to get rich with such as small investment even if Bitcoin goes up 100x. It is the same age group and demographic buying stock as buying crypto, so it’s not like the crypto traders should have less money.</p>
<p>5. Gains do not hold. GME stock started at $3 in 2020 and a year later is still above $100. Stocks tend to ‘trend’ which means that past price movement predicts future direction. If a stock has risen 70 out of the past 100 days, likely it will keep rising, at least for the foreseeable future. This is known as momentum, and there is evidence that in spite of the efficient market hypothesis, that it exists. With crypto, sometimes an altcoin will get pumped 100% in a day and then the next day give up most of its gains, and then a week later be back to where it started. It is hard to make money off that because there is no follow-through or trend to ride higher. It s not like Gsamestock, which kept going up for many months, or, like Tesla, which went from $70 to $900 over 2 years.</p>
<p>6. As discussed <a href="https://greyenlightenment.com/bitcoin-is-not-a-good-investment/">earlier</a>, crypto is more like a commodity than a stock. Whereas stocks tend to generate shareholder value in the form of retained earnings, dividends, or buybacks, crypto does not generate earnings that can be passed on to investors. Also, crypto has more inflation than stocks, as some inflation (between 2-5%) is built into crypto protocols, whereas with stocks the supply tends to shrink over time due to buybacks. Historically, for these reasons, commodities tend to have far worse returns than stocks.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		


<p>You've installed Linux (e.g. Debian or Ubuntu) into an UEFI bhyve guest on FreeBSD, only to be greeted with a message about PXE boot after restarting from the installer:</p>

<p>BdsDxe: failed to load Boot0001 "UEFI BHYVE SATA DISK BHYVE-48FF-992B-D5E0" from PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x4,0x0)/Sata(0x0,0xFFFF,0x0): Not Found<br>&gt;&gt;Start PXE over IPv4.</p>

<p>This article will describe what happened, and show you how to fix this and similar issues. I'll assume that you've started the virtual machine using the bhyve command and are familiar with its various options (see <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bhyve&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;arch=default&amp;format=html"><code>man 8 bhyve</code></a>).</p>

<p>In the message above, the UEFI firmware could not find an EFI bootloader, so it is attempting to perform a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment">network boot</a>. To skip this and simplify debugging, restart the bhyve virtual machine without a network adapter. You'll be greeted by the UEFI shell:</p>

<a href="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/bhyve-efi-shell.png"><img src="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/bhyve-efi-shell.png" alt="bhyve UEFI shell: UEFI Interactive Shell EDK II mapping table"></a>

<p>Our goal is to find the EFI bootloader file that the firmware could not locate.</p>

<p>Helpfully, the EFI shell lists all of the storage devices and partitions that it could find. There will usually be at least two partitions on the Linux virtual machine's hard drive: the first, a small partition holding EFI firmware, the second, the Linux system. In this case, the EFI partition is <code>FS0</code> (listed as "<code>HD1(1,GPT,</code>…" i.e. the first GPT partition of the first drive) the main Linux partition is <code>BLK2</code> (listed as "<code>HD1(2,GPT,</code>…" i.e. the second GPT partition of the first drive). <code>BLK0</code> is the drive itself (not considering the partition table) and <code>BLK3</code> here is the swap partition.</p>

<p>We can navigate into a filesystem by typing its name, followed by a colon. From there, familiar commands like <code>ls</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>mv</code>, and <code>rm</code> will be available. Let's see what was installed to the EFI partition:</p>
<p>
<span>Shell&gt;</span><span>FS0:</span><br>
<span>FS0:\&gt;</span><span>ls</span><br>
<span>Directory of: </span><span>FS0:\</span><br>
<span>03/02/2021&nbsp;&nbsp;16:54 &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,096&nbsp;&nbsp;EFI<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 File(s)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 bytes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Dir(s)</span><br>
<span>FS0:\&gt;</span><span>cd EFI</span><br>
<span>FS0:\EFI\&gt;</span><span>ls</span><br>
<span>Directory of: </span><span>FS0:\EFI\</span><br>
<span>03/02/2021&nbsp;&nbsp;16:54 &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,096&nbsp;&nbsp;.<br>
03/02/2021&nbsp;&nbsp;16:54 &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;..<br>
03/02/2021&nbsp;&nbsp;16:54 &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,096&nbsp;&nbsp;debian<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 File(s)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 bytes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Dir(s)</span><br>
</p>

<p>Aha! The UEFI firmware expects to find the bootloader in <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/f1567720b13a578ffa54716119f826df622babcd/MdePkg/Include/Uefi/UefiSpec.h#L2209"><code>EFI/boot</code></a>, not in <code>EFI/debian</code>. Typically, bootloader paths would be set as UEFI variables, but <code>bhyve</code> is unable to store these between reboots.</p>

<p>The easiest way to start the Linux guest from here is to execute the EFI bootloader inside the <code>debian</code> folder:</p>

<p>
<span>FS:\EFI\&gt;</span><span>cd debian</span><br>
<span>FS:\EFI\debian\&gt;</span><span>grubx64.efi</span><br>
</p>

<p>Boot should now continue normally.</p>

<p>How can you avoid having to manually run the bootloader from the EFI shell? Here are three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reinstall <code>grub</code> under the prefix that the UEFI firmware expects. From within the Linux guest, <a href="https://github.com/rhboot/grub2/blob/master/util/grub-install.c#L295">you can run</a> <code>grub-install --bootloader-id=boot</code> to install to <code>EFI/boot</code> instead of <code>EFI/debian</code>. You'll probably have to rename <code>grubx64.efi</code> to <code>bootx64.efi</code> as well (often, the EFI partition will be mounted by default at <code>/boot/EFI</code>).</li>
  <li>Don't use UEFI boot, rather, use <code>grub2-bhyve</code> to boot using MBR / legacy boot.</li>
  <li>Use software like <a href="https://github.com/churchers/vm-bhyve">vm-bhyve</a> to handle the details for you.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-11964"><!-- .entry-header --><div> <p><em>Estimated read time (minus contemplative pauses): <span><span></span> <span> 47</span> <span></span></span> min.</em></p><h2>Introduction: Zero Existence</h2><p>In a fun episode on one of my favorite podcasts, <em>Elucidations</em> (<a href="https://elucidations.now.sh/posts/episode-42-agustin-rayo-discusses-the-construction-of-logical-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Episode 42, 12/12/12</a>), philosopher Agustín Rayo argues that the number zero exists independently of human thought and behavior.</p><p>I like his argument. And it’s simple enough, I think, to get the gist of it across in a blog post.</p><p>To do that, I’ll draw from his 2014 paper, “<a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/96869">Nominalism, Trivialism, Logicism</a>” (the argument also appears, with more detail, in his 2013 book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Ag3F8O">The Construction of Logical Space</a></em>, which I haven’t read). I found the paper to be playful and challenging. His writing is clear and his enthusiasm for these difficult topics is contagious; no surprise after hearing him on <em>Elucidations</em>.</p><p>This is not to say that I’ve been converted by Rayo’s argument, which can be extended to account for all natural numbers. I remain a <em>mathematical nominalist</em>—that is, someone who does not believe in the independent existence of numbers (or any other mathematical objects). This is in contrast to a&nbsp;<em>platonist</em>, who does believe in the independent existence of numbers (and perhaps other mathematical objects).</p><p>Actually, Rayo’s argument suggests what he calls a “subtle” platonism. But before getting into that, I’d like to say a little more about the nominalist–platonist divide—or, more precisely, about where I stand with respect to it.</p><p>It’s common, by the way, to see the word “Platonism” capitalized. I follow the standard of not capitalizing in this context, as contemporary mathematical platonism is usually significantly removed from Plato’s theory of eternal forms—e.g., Plato’s forms have causal powers, while the mathematical platonist’s abstract objects usually don’t.</p><p>That said, people use the terms in these discussions in sometimes very different ways. I’ll do my best to navigate the discursive terrain without becoming misled, bogged down, or lost in its many rabbit holes (though I’ll links some nice entryways into those rabbit holes).</p><h2>Nominalism versus Platonism about Mathematics (Or: Why I’m not a Platonist)</h2><p>In his paper, Rayo describes a common challenge posed to mathematical nominalists:</p><blockquote><p>Mathematical Nominalism is the view that there are no mathematical objets. A standard problem for nominalists is that it is not obvious that they can explain what the point of a mathematical assertion would be. For it is natural to think that mathematical sentences like ‘the number of the dinosaurs is zero’ or ‘1 + 1 = 2’ can only be true if mathematical objects exist. But if this is right, the nominalist is committed to the view that such sentences are untrue. And if the sentences are untrue, it not immediately obvious why they would be worth asserting.</p><p>A nominalist could try to address the problem by suggesting nominalistic <em>paraphrases</em> for mathematical sentences. She might claim, for example, that when one asserts ‘the number of the dinosaurs is zero’ one is best understood as making the (nominalistically kosher) claim that there are no dinosaurs, and that when one asserts ‘1 + 1 = 2’ one is best understood as making the (nominalistically kosher) claim that any individual and any other individual will, taken together, make two individuals.<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>More carefully: ∀x∀y(x≠ y → ∃!<sub>2</sub>z(z = x ∨ z = y)).</p></blockquote><p>[The symbolic notation can be read quasi-formally as “for all <em>x</em> and for all <em>y</em>, if <em>x</em> doesn’t equal <em>y</em>, then there exist exactly two <em>z</em>‘s such that <em>z</em> equals <em>x</em> or <em>z</em> equals <em>y.</em>“]</p><p>The paraphrasing solution is roughly what I’m committed to as a nominalist. Actually, “committed” is too strong. It’s simpler than it. It just seems obvious to me that some form of nominalism is true, and that some aspect of that will involve paraphrasing.</p><p>That is, it’s easiest for me to accept an origin of numbers that involves something like “put as many apples in my bag as I have children” becoming shortened to, say, “put two apples in my bag.” And from there “two apples” becomes “two whatever” and then “two” becomes reified into a concept in its own right that can be invoked or signified or referred to explicitly with symbols such as the numeral “2” and expressions like “a quarter of eight” and “1/4 times 8” and “the square root of four” and “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B4%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sqrt{4} " title="\sqrt{4} " srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7">” and “4<sup>1/2</sup>” and “the lowest prime number” and “the only even prime number” and “the lowest even non-negative integer” and “4 minus 2” and “5 minus 3” and so on forever.</p><p>There are infinitely many ways to represent the quantity two.</p><p>It’s plausible to me that, from something more or less along those lines, we developed over many centuries the beautiful system(s) of pure and applied mathematics we continue to develop today. So we now have the square root of two and of other prime numbers, negative numbers, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B-1%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sqrt{-1} " title="\sqrt{-1} " srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7">, different sizes of infinity, as many dimensions as you want, arguments about Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems, and wherein we are more or less able to satisfy a key desideratum of consistency within particular domains.</p><p>What do I mean by “particular domains”? Calculus students will lose points for not treating 0<sup>0</sup> as an indeterminate form (just like 0/0), even though mathematicians maintain that the answer is 1, “because mathematicians said so” (as it’s put in <a href="https://www.askamathematician.com/2010/12/q-what-does-00-zero-raised-to-the-zeroth-power-equal-why-do-mathematicians-and-high-school-teachers-disagree/">this <em>Ask a Mathematician/Ask a Physicist</em> post</a>; does this constitute a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/formalism-mathematics/#ForPos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carnapian formalist move</a>?). Depending on which calculator you input 0<sup>0</sup> into, you’ll get different answers. I put it into Google calculator and Desmos and got 1; Wolfram|Alpha yields “undefined” and lists it as an <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Indeterminate.html">indeterminate form</a>.</p><p>In that same calculus course, students must treat 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + … onto infinity as getting bigger and bigger without converging to a specific value. Common sense and mathematicians agree with this. But a physicist might tell you the sum of those numbers—or, at least, the proper value to put on the right side of the equal sign—is −1/12.</p><p>To see physicist Tony Padilla excited about this result—while assuring us that, “I know this looks like a bit of mathematical hocus-pocus sort of thing, but actually in truth it’s not… we know it’s not… because these kind of sums appear in physics all the time”—see this 2014 video from the popular Numberphile YouTube channel:</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-I6XTVZXww" width="300" height="168.75" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p><p>The video garnered pushback, such as from another popular YouTube channel, Matheloger:</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YuIIjLr6vUA" width="300" height="168.75" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p><p>And I recall seeing comments from math teachers saying things like “math is hard enough to teach without you telling our students wrong things.”</p><p>Padilla wrote a defense of his answer that I highly recommend anyone (fake-) outraged by the Numperphile video read, in which he compellingly, and I’d say passionately, maintains that −1/12 “is the <em>only</em> sensible value one can attach to this divergent sum. Infinity is not a sensible value. In my opinion, as a physicist, infinity has no place in physical observables, and therefore no place in Nature”: “<a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~ppzap4/response.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What do we get if we sum all the natural numbers?</a>”</p><p>Or for a sober, yet still aptly wide-eyed-at-the-weirdness-of-it-all, assessment of the situation, see Numperphile’s follow-up video called&nbsp; “Why −1/12 Is a Gold Nugget”:</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Oazb7IWzbA" width="300" height="168.75" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p><p>It features mathematician Edward Frenkel, who points out that the −1/12 result—which goes at least as far back as Leonhard Euler (born in 1707) and has a place in pure mathematics—arises in applications from an effort to make the sum meaningful or useful (very useful, in fact) for certain contexts. In other words, with sufficient mathematical rigor and self-awareness, the manipulations that enable us to jettison infinity while leaving behind a “golden nugget” of −1/12 are legitimate.</p><p>And yet, says Frenkel:</p><blockquote><p>I think, actually, we don’t really fully understand what’s happening here… it certainly is not the result of summation of these numbers; it is something else, but what is it? … it is the best kept secret maybe in physics, in quantum physics, that most of the calculations that physicists do today are like this. … I would say, it’s not exactly the sum… it blows up, it is infinite… does it mean that in some sense, there is a context in which this infinite sum is mysteriously −1/12? I’m not sure.</p></blockquote><p>Returning to the present point, it seems obvious to me that these developments and results and fascinating discussions can occur whether or not numbers exist independently of human activities. I’m unconvinced that the story requires the additional fact that there exists an eternal and immaterial mathematical realm against which our mathematical statements must hold up in order to be true; in order, for example, for −1/12 to be, in some sense, true. Same goes for 1 + 1 = 2.</p><p>I believe one and one really can make two <em>without</em> the existence of a realm of independently existing, immaterial, inert abstract objects we call “numbers.”</p><p>This is a naive intuition, I admit. And I’m not prepared to spend the next five to 20 years trying (and almost certainly failing) to bear it out to the satisfaction of everyone interested in this problem (myself included). So instead I’ll commit to a weaker claim. Namely, that my naive intuition has yet to be swayed by any platonist account I’ve seen. This includes Rayo’s, which I’m almost ready to get back to.</p><p>First, I think I need to say a little more about what sort of objects platonists take numbers to be. <span>A standard view, as I’ve already noted, is that they are abstract, causally inert objects that do not exist in the material world.</span></p><p>This raises many problems that I will only barely touch on here. A great place to start a deeper dive into those problems, along with the core problems nominalists face, is in the <em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy </em>(<em>SEP</em>) entries “<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abstract-objects/">Abstract Objects</a>” and “<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/">Platonism in the Philosophy of Mathematics</a>.” In that order. (And I’m sure to link more sources as I go along here.)</p><p>I will say that, despite knowing that many brilliant mathematically inclined people believe in a platonic realm of mathematical objects, I have not been swayed. This includes when the above-mentioned Frenkel writes in <a href="https://amzn.to/2Y3HqfL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Love and Math</em></a> (2014), a book I adore, that he believes in a “Platonic world of mathematics” that “exists independently of physical …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="pico"><p><em>Thank you for supporting The Generalist. This is a collaboration between The Generalist and </em><a href="https://latecheckout.substack.com/"><em>Late Checkout</em></a><em>. </em></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/6000d83070ff9e96671cf34d_Ellipse.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍<br></p><p>“You ever stop to realize how fragile all this is?”&nbsp;<br></p><p>George Carlin wears a black long-sleeved t-shirt, hunched over a microphone. In the minimalism of his outfit and the starkness of his bald pate, he almost resembles a tech executive delivering a keynote. But he’s too rumpled for that, too delightfully sour, as if a satyr stumbled through Steve Jobs’ wardrobe.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“It wouldn’t take much to throw us right back into barbaric times. All you’d have to do would be eliminate electricity.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>Carlin continues, embarking on one of his trademark <em>quite-frightening-very-funny tirades</em>, the flashes of incandescent, articulate fury that made him a genius. No electricity means no lights, he explains. No batteries. No fuel. No water. No computers. It means jail doors springing open, crime flooding the streets.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s a bleak, bitter joke and serves as a coherent expression of Carlin’s particular weltanschauung: life is a sleepwalk along a knife-edge. It also shades his view of electricity and what it represents. When harnessed, it’s a mollifying, enlightening force; the thin membrane between civilization and barbarism.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If Carlin is all rapid-fire verbosity in his 2005 set, he’s an expert of restraint in a complementary line:&nbsp;<br></p><p>“Electricity is just organized lightning.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>There are a hundred ways someone might describe a company like Reddit, but this is what we think of most. In its particular energy and vibrancy, its wild potential and ugly foibles, its kindness and cruelty, the social media platform occupies the liminal space of Carlin’s electricity. Just as it is close to some of our unseemliest instincts, so too is it a vehicle for creativity and connection. In short, Reddit is organized lightning. As the conductor of cultural currents, it may have more upside than any other social media company.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>In this piece, we’ll explore:&nbsp;</strong><br></p><ol role="list"><li>Reddit’s topsy-turvy history</li><li>Why it’s undervalued</li><li>Where the company is headed</li><li>The Galaxy Brain moves to take it to the next level<br></li></ol><h2>r/History</h2><p>Few companies have the narrative arc of Reddit. It’s a classic hero's tale with a call to adventure, challenges and setbacks, and a triumphant return.<br></p><h3><strong>The beginning</strong></h3><p>The same year that Carlin delivered his iconic set, University of Virginia roommates Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian took a drive. They headed for Boston, where computer scientist, writer, and entrepreneur Paul Graham was scheduled to give a talk.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Huffman, a computer science student himself, was the motivating force, but he would have Ohanian to thank for brokering a meeting with Graham. As the story goes, at the end of the talk, Ohanian asked if Graham would come out to a drink with them. Over a few beers, Graham encouraged the pair to apply to his new incubator in Cambridge: Y Combinator.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Like so many others, Ohanian and Huffman didn’t get in with their first idea. The pair pitched “My Mobile Menu,” a way to order food via text. While Graham didn’t like that MMM, he invited them to come back to Boston for a brainstorm. By the end of an hour, they’d hit on a new mission: build the “front page of the internet.” Reddit was born.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It didn’t take long for the founding duo to ship v1. Written in Graham’s beloved Lisp, the site served as a fairly straightforward link aggregator that allowed for upvoting and downvoting. The first 100 accounts on the site were created by either Ohanian or Huffman to give the appearance of activity. A snapshot from the site from that period (thank you WayBackMachine) illustrates just how much of the culture was baked in early on, featuring conspiracy theories, wonkish dev chat, strong opinions, and “spez,” Huffman’s username.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/60327dd2cf48e5169301c0da_4.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>‍<br><strong>Growing pains and the acquisition</strong></h3><p>Soon enough, Reddit added a third member. Aaron Schwartz, a coding prodigy also in YC’s cohort, merged his project, Infogami, with the company and hopped aboard. As Schwartz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011001237/https://aaronsw.jottit.com/howtoget">later told it</a>, his reprogramming of the site from Lisp to Python coincided with a meaningful uptick in traffic:&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>When I first started at Reddit, growth was slow. The site was put online very early — within weeks of starting work on it — but for the first three months it hardly got above three thousand visitors a day, which is about baseline for a useful RSS feed. Then, in a couple weeks of marathon coding sessions, we moved the site from Lisp to Python and I wrote an article about it for my blog. It got a lot of attention — Hell hath no fury like a Lisp fan scorned — and even today I still run into people at parties who, when I mention that I worked at Reddit, say "Oh, the site that switched from Lisp."<p>Around that time traffic really started taking off. In the next three months, our traffic doubled twice.</p></blockquote><p>Reddit was off to the races, though it wouldn’t follow the parabolic growth trajectory of other social media companies. Instead, the site grew rapidly but relatively steadily. Still, even after the company reached millions of visitors a month, generating revenue remained a challenge. Again, from Schwartz:&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>We still had no idea how to make money. We sold t-shirts on the site, but every time we made a little bit of money on those we spent it on ordering more t-shirts. We signed up with a major Web ad representative to sell ads on our site, but they never seemed to be able to sell any ads for us and we rarely made more than, literally, a couple of dollars a month. Another idea we had was licensing the "Reddit technology" to let other people build sites that worked like Reddit. But we couldn't find anyone who wanted to license it from us.<br></blockquote><p>That context explains why Reddit was tempted to sell just a year after founding, giving up ownership to Condé Nast for a reported $10 - $20 million. (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/alexis-ohanian-reflects-on-selling-reddit-for-10-million.html">The deal closed on Halloween</a>). Over the following years, that initial trio drifted away from the company: Huffman to found Hipmunk, Ohanian to a Kiva Fellowship, and Schwartz to pursue web activism. (As you may know, Schwartz would go on to commit suicide in 2013.)&nbsp;<br></p><p>Reddit continued to grow under corporate ownership, though it's hard not to feel a shadow hanging over that trajectory. What might have been had the company capitalized instead of selling? How might Huffman, Ohanian, and Schwartz have stewarded Reddit and developed the product with the right support?&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The comeback</strong></h3><p>Perhaps recognizing it was not the best guardian of a social media business, Condé Nast spun Reddit out in 2011, with parent company Advance Networks serving as a passive shareholder. Yishan Wong joined as CEO the following year, leaving in 2014 after the company refused to move its HQ closer to his home in Daly City. He was replaced by Ellen Pao on an interim basis with Ohanian returning as executive chairman. When Pao was ousted in 2015, driven out of her role by a user base incensed over the firing of a popular Reddit employee, Huffman stepped back into the CEO seat. The band was back together.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s hard to overstate just how central Reddit was to pop-culture over the decade that saw Ohanian and Huffman found the business, sell it, and return once more. In both good and bad moments, the valorous and vile, Reddit was there. It served as the de facto town square for events like “The Fappening,” the Sony Pictures hack, the Boston Bombing, GamerGate, and Pizzagate.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Since retaking the reins, Huffman has shown a desire to grow Reddit’s product and stamp out the site’s most toxic elements. The mobile experience was improved. The site was redesigned. Video was introduced. And, thousands of hate-filled subreddits were expunged.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Concerns that a more hands-on approach to moderation would curb the anarchic good-times vibe of the platform have been emphatically repudiated this year, with Reddit the ground-zero for the epic GameStop short squeeze.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Despite being one of the internet’s most popular websites, sixteen years after it was founded, Reddit feels like it's just getting started.</p><h2>r/Value</h2><p>Reddit is one of the most misunderstood and undervalued companies in the world.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A little over a week ago, Huffman announced the company had raised $250 million in new capital at a valuation of $6 billion. The round was led by Dubai-based firm Vy Capital, with follow-ons from a16z, Sequoia, and Tencent.&nbsp;<br></p><p>To which we have to say: <em>$6 billion? That’s it?&nbsp;</em>‍</p><p>In a world in which Clubhouse is worth $1 billion after a year of (impressive) traction, and Dispo is pegged at $100 million for an app still in beta, Reddit — cultural petri-dish, bastion of expression, distributed hedge-fund, meme-maker, group-therapist — is only worth $6 billion?<br></p><h3><strong>A thought experiment</strong></h3><p>Humor us. You’re given the chance to look at two social media companies. Your job is to pick the one that you think has the highest valuation. Here are a couple details.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Company 1</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>MAUs: 353 million</li><li>MAU growth YoY: 7%<br></li></ul><p><strong>Company 2&nbsp;</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>MAUs: 430 million</li><li>MAU growth YoY: 30%&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>Now, you’re right to be a bit grumpy with us. You don’t have much to go on, right? No revenue, no costs, no churn. How are you supposed to figure out which is most valuable without that information? But if any space is defined by user growth, above anything else, it’s social media.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So which do you choose?</p><p>Company 1 is Twitter, worth $58 billion. Company 2, with more MAUs and 4x the growth, is Reddit. From a growth an engagement perspective, Reddit compares favorably to many of social media's public behemoths with close to the same number of MAUs as Pinterest. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/603282383bcd2639d35b1abe_CleanShot%202021-02-21%20at%2010.53.45%402x.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Yet, the implied value of a Reddit user is criminally low:&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/60327d9d1e2df115f85a3d21_1.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍<br>Public and private market investors effectively value a Facebook DAU at 3.5x the price of a Reddit one, and a Facebook MAU at 19x of the Reddit equivalent.<br></p><h3><strong>Explanations and misconceptions</strong></h3><p>What is the rationale behind this aggressive discounting? We think it stems from outdated historical data and an anachronous view of the product.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Sure, historically, Reddit has done a poor job of bringing in revenue on a per-user basis. In 2019, Reddit was said to have an average revenue per user (ARPU) of $0.30, much less than Facebook at …</p></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>Today we have a moment that many of our readers will be waiting for. The AMD Threadripper Pro is now available at retail with additional platform vendors entering the space. As such, we wanted to quickly mark the occasion, and also offer an update to our earlier ASUS coverage.<span id="more-51172"></span></p>
<h2>AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro Lenovo Exclusivity Ends</h2>
<p>The AMD Threadripper Pro platform was announced in the summer of 2020. We covered this in our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-threadripper-pro-is-a-workstation-epyc-or-wepyc/">AMD Threadripper Pro is a Workstation EPYC or WEPYC</a> piece. At the time, the platform was exclusively sold by Lenovo and we know many of our readers purchased these systems at work.</p>
<p><iframe title="AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 3995WX Review the &quot;WEPYC&quot;" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVLDlrz09Os?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Recently, we published our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/lenovo-thinkstation-p620-review-first-amd-threadripper-pro-workstation/">Lenovo ThinkStation P620 Review</a> using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-ryzen-threadripper-pro-3995wx-review-a-bold-wepyc/">AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 3995WX</a>. It is a great platform, however, it is very focused on selling to organizations that have an existing Lenovo relationship. For those who do not have existing Lenovo relationships and access to corporate discounts, the P620 pricing was on the higher end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>In our earlier coverage, we noted how <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/supermicro-amd-ryzen-threadripper-pro-launch/">Supermicro</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/gigabyte-wrx80-su8-ipmi-amd-threadripper-pro-motherboard/">Gigabyte</a>, and <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/asus-pro-ws-wrx80e-sage-se-wifi-amd-threadripper-pro/">ASUS</a> are releasing platforms to help proliferate Threadripper Pro. As part of the retail availability launch today, we have a few ASUS updates.</p>

<p>The first big update is that we have the ASUS Pro WS WRX80E-SAGE SE WIFI in the lab. Expect a review in the coming weeks of this platform. What we can say, with complete certainty is that ASUS is offering a highly differentiated solution compared to what Lenovo has been shipping.</p>

<p>An example of one of the features we did not cover in our motherboard launch piece, but we have found during testing is that the system comes with a Hyper M.2 x16 Gen4 card. This allows four M.2 SSDs to be added to the system via a PCIe x16 slot. Combined with three onboard M.2 slots, that means one can put seven M.2 SSDs on this platform.</p>

<p>Expect the full review soon. Still, one of the challenges with reviewing a motherboard in this space is that many of the buyers are going to be corporations that have little interest in building their own workstations. Selling a motherboard meets the needs of some in the market, but others want to purchase complete systems. ASUS is partnering with Velocity Micro to offer a workstation based on the new chips and the ASUS motherboard. This is the Velocity Micro ProMagix HD150:</p>
<figure id="attachment_51175" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-51175"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-threadripper-pro-hits-retail-asus-update/velocity-micro-promagix-hd150-wrx80-tr-pro-system/" rel="attachment wp-att-51175"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Velocity-Micro-ProMagix-HD150-WRX80-TR-Pro-System.jpg" alt="Velocity Micro ProMagix HD150 WRX80 TR Pro System" width="800" height="544" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Velocity-Micro-ProMagix-HD150-WRX80-TR-Pro-System.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Velocity-Micro-ProMagix-HD150-WRX80-TR-Pro-System-400x272.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Velocity-Micro-ProMagix-HD150-WRX80-TR-Pro-System-696x473.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Velocity-Micro-ProMagix-HD150-WRX80-TR-Pro-System-618x420.jpg 618w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-51175">Velocity Micro ProMagix HD150 WRX80 TR Pro System</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Velocity Micro ProMagix HD150 uses a closed-loop liquid cooling solution instead of Lenovo’s air cooler. This can be important when one uses higher TDP CPUs such as the Threadripper Pro 3995WX.</p>
<p>This is an important development for our readers who need to purchase complete systems instead of motherboards at work. ASUS has a great motherboard, but selling it as a complete system makes it more accessible in this market. One of the other nice features is that the ProMagix HD150 starts at under $4,500 which is a lot lower than Lenovo has been selling the P620 for while it had little to no competition.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>Overall, we know this is a day many of our readers have been waiting for since the original announcement in July 2020. It is now possible to purchase non-Lenovo AMD Threadripper Pro CPUs, motherboards, and systems opening up the use cases for these systems.</p>

We have drones too.</figcaption></figure><p id="f23b">Columbus has been home to a large group of insurance businesses for decades. Just take a look across the Downtown Columbus skyline. There are at least five established insurance companies (annual revenues well over $500M each) who have their headquarters within a few miles of each other, including Nationwide, where I’m an investor as part of the venture capital team.</p><p id="7702">Columbus’ central business district is dotted with insurance companies. They’ve made a huge impact — not only on the city and its physical footprint but also the broader insurance industry. Though there is a focus on the auto sector with Ohio’s legacy in the automobile industry, today these are big and robust businesses ranging across property &amp; casualty as well as life and other lines of business.</p><p id="7e67">However, there is now an exciting new cohort of insurance businesses being built in Columbus. Called “insurtechs,” these companies operate in a wide variance of coverage types and sectors. But the one thing that ties them together is a digital-first or technology-infused approach to the insurance industry, which is a trend playing out both in Columbus and globally. In my role on Nationwide’s venture capital team, I’m fortunate to have a front-row seat to the action — both here and abroad.</p><p id="c663">There are multiple meaningfully venture-backed businesses in Columbus that are growing fast with disruptive business models, including Root (just filed their S-1!), Beam Dental, Matic (of which Nationwide is an investor), and Branch.</p><p id="b7db">These industry hubs may appear to happen by accident, but when we look deeper, there is often a common ingredient — talent. Industry clusters offer job opportunities and job mobility, making the sell for Columbus a little bit easier — especially when recruiting specialized out-of-town talent. The density of colleges and universities, especially a major one like Ohio State University, makes it easier to find early career talent when growing a team. It’s also unique that Columbus has technology investors like Nationwide and Drive Capital that are focusing on finding Insurtech startups as an investment theme. (<em>Note: Drive invested in both Root and Beam.)</em></p><p id="8b89">Nationwide competes with some of the companies above and partners with others. In any case, the density of talent from both entry-level who grow into roles and the executive talent brought in from other places has a net positive impact for Columbus. Regardless of COVID-19’s impact to remote or in-person working, I’m optimistic the Columbus Insurtech buzz is here to stay.</p><p id="c0f2">The momentum is clear. Columbus is not only one of the most active cities in the United States for insurance in general, but it’s also an emerging Insurtech hub. I’m excited to contribute with capacity on the venture capital side (take our dedicated <a href="https://www.nationwide.com/cps/nw-ventures.html" rel="noopener">$100 million venture capital fund at Nationwide</a> for example), but the real energy is with some of the most compelling businesses in the entire insurance technology sector being located right here in Columbus. While some of these companies are just getting started, it’s clear to see that the competitive advantage of being located so close to legacy insurance carriers is bringing the capabilities needed to build the next generation of great insurance businesses right here in Ohio’s capital.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Build with us!</figcaption></figure></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Companies Prepare for Waves of Data Breach Lawsuits]]>

<p>Data breaches are inevitable. And no amount of security protocols can provide absolute assurance that consumer information is protected. With increasing threats of identity theft, who should be responsible for the majority of data breach risk, the consumer or the business? California lawmakers argue that the majority of that burden on the business owner.</p>



<p>They incentivized stricter security measures by broadening the requirements needed to file a lawsuit in the case of a data breach. By lowering this bar, they have essentially shifted more liability to businesses. Prop 24’s amendments go into effect January 1st 2023, but has a look back period starting on January 1st 2022. Whether businesses should or should not bear the majority of risk, they will need to examine the parameters of these changes closely and update their data security to the most recent standards in order to prevent these lawsuits.</p>







<h2>Prop 24’s Changes in the CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act)</h2>



<p>The CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act) is an addendum to the historic <a href="https://toslawyer.com/what-are-the-requirements-for-ccpa-compliance/">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a> . It is a series of amendments that:</p>



<ol><li>Allow consumers to limit access to sensitive data</li><li>Stop businesses from keeping data beyond its use</li><li>Triple the fine for violating children’s privacy rights</li><li>Create a new agency with enforcement power</li></ol>



<p>And Lastly,</p>



<p><strong>Expand the definition of sensitive data to include email and password information in the list of items covered during a negligent data breach.</strong></p>



<p>Since it is difficult for consumers to track identity theft to a specific data breach, this particular amendment expands the CCPA right of action to consumers that can’t prove a financial loss. </p>



<p>This particular change has two profound implications. First, it makes it much harder to agree on damages if there is no financial loss. As a result, violations range between $100-$750 per record. Secondly, this incentivizes bad actors to exploit the system for profit. </p>



<p>Since many companies will not be able to keep up with increasing standards for security measures, they will need to update their SAAS agreement <a href="http://toslawyer.com/negotiating-a-saas-agreement-what-you-should-know/">indemnification clauses</a> to account for this type of dispute.</p>



<h2><strong>Consumer Actions under the CCPA and the CPRA</strong></h2>



<p>Consumer actions hinge on a company’s failure to protect their personal information from a breach. <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_24,_Consumer_Personal_Information_Law_and_Agency_Initiative_(2020)">CPRA (Prop 24) broadens what is considered personal information</a>.</p>



<p>The most critical amendments to the CCPA are just two or three letters. The CCPA previously required that information be either nonencrypted or nonredacted to qualify under the Act. Lawmakers used the word “or ” instead of “and ” when adding email and password to the list. This has significant implications on what qualifies the data and how companies failed to protect the breach.</p>



<p>If one were to read the qualification before the amendment, the only data that would qualify would be anything that could reveal someone’s identity or any personal data lacking encryption. Now email and password information neither need to be encrypted nor reveal someone’s identity to qualify. This amendment means that anonymous throwaway emails are included. This critical two-letter word significantly broadens the scope of liability in data breach lawsuits.</p>



<p>The second change to the law slightly limits the scope of liability by changing the “or” between “nonencrypted OR nonredacted” to “nonencrypted AND nonredacted.” This change means any data other than email and password needs to lack encryption and reveal personal data’s identity to qualify.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the data in a breach meets the two combined conditions or any personal information includes someone’s email and password, a breach would need to be the result of a company not implementing and maintaining reasonable security procedures and practices. While previous administrations have interpreted “reasonable” in one matter, there’s no guarantee that will hold in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>What Constitutes Reasonable Security Procedures and Practices against data breaches?</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="http://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/markus-spiske-uPXs5Vx5bIg-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" alt="data breach" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/markus-spiske-uPXs5Vx5bIg-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/markus-spiske-uPXs5Vx5bIg-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/markus-spiske-uPXs5Vx5bIg-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>







<p>The AG established the baseline by using <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list/">20 data security controls published by the Center for Internet Security</a>. Any agreement with a SaaS company should warrant compliance with these control as a minimum standard.</p>



<p>While these guidelines may not protect you, or your vendors, in the future, failing to meet&nbsp;the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/dbr/2016-data-breach-report.pdf">reasonable standards enumerated by the state’s AG in 2014 and 2016</a> would likely hurt any defense you might make in case of a violation.</p>



<h2><strong>Managing Privacy Standards In SAAS Agreements</strong></h2>



<p>Security is often a point of negotiation when striking a SAAS agreement with third party vendors. Businesses don’t want to accept the risk if a vendor’s security isn’t up to par. Yet, most SaaS agreements don’t go far enough to protect the business. For example, companies can neglect to include who is responsible for notifying customers of a breach. Identifying each party’s data security obligations is critical to establish who will be accountable in the case of a lawsuit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When there is a breach of consumer data, the effects can last for years. According to UISM and the Ponemon Institute’s research, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach">the average cost of a data breach in 2020 is $3.86 million</a>. This cost includes the time and direct costs from dealing with a breach, regulatory fines, potential lost opportunity costs from customer churn and negative publicity, and a data breach lawsuit.</p>



<h2><strong>Expect More Legal Challenges and Data Breach Lawsuits</strong></h2>



<p>Regardless of the steps that businesses take to protect themselves from security breaches, lawsuits, and regulatory fines, Prop 24 vastly increases the likelihood that additional data breach lawsuits will occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than 50 lawsuits had already been filed by July – just six months into the CCPA – covering data breaches, noncompliance with the CCPA, and violations of California’s Unfair Competition Law (UCL). Because of the potential monetary awards, most of these actions come in the form of class-action lawsuits.</p>



<p>The increase in class action suits came due to the CCPA’s requirement that offers statutory damages rather than providing actual damages. CPRA, or Prop 24, could increase the number of class action lawsuits.</p>



<h2><strong>Increasing security isn’t enough</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="http://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/scott-graham-5fNmWej4tAA-unsplash@025x.jpg" alt="strategy" width="920" height="616" srcset="https://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/scott-graham-5fNmWej4tAA-unsplash@025x.jpg 920w, https://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/scott-graham-5fNmWej4tAA-unsplash@025x-300x201.jpg 300w, https://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/scott-graham-5fNmWej4tAA-unsplash@025x-768x514.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px"></figure></div>



<p>Since encryption may not be enough to protect this information from a breach, companies need to update indemnification clauses for these types of scenarios. The new amendments provide a wide range from <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ccpa-qotd-what-are-the-penalties-for-91822/">$100 to $7,500 per record</a> in applicable damages. Establishing an agreed-upon damage amount in the indemnification clause will help protect against costly class-action suits. A full understanding of the rapidly evolving security standards and legal precedence is critical to making these updates to your SAAS agreements.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>So sometimes i visit <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">yc hackernews</a>. Maybe just because they still have this anachronistic css which nowadays looks like the script blocker has interfered. There is this <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">API link</a> at the bottom and the first thing i tried was the <code>Max Item ID</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/maxitem.json"</span><span>).</span><span>json</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>This is actually large enough to be a little challenging. So i <a href="https://github.com/defgsus/blog/tree/master/src/hackernews">downloaded them all</a> using 
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">asyncio</a> and <a href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/">aiohttp</a> with a rate of about 100 messages per second and exported them into <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html">elasticsearch</a>. The whole process took about 3 days.</p>

<p>They started in late 2006 and most of the stuff that we have become completely used to was not even existing then.</p>

<h3 id="protocol">protocol</h3>



<p><strong>96.6%</strong> of all posted urls are HTTP<strong>S</strong> nowadays. And currently about 30,000 URLs are posted each month as can be seen in the next figure.</p>

<p>It’s just interesting how <em>smooth</em> the above graph is. HTTPS was specified in 2000, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s encrypt</a> started in 2016, 
Google <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html">deprecated</a> HTTP in 2018 and a lot more milestones will have happened in between but the figure shows none of it. Only a continuous steady climb.</p>



<p>One can still find a thousand HTTP links per month ;-)</p>

<p>Here is a top ten of Jan/Feb 2021:</p>

<div><div><pre><code> 37x diego-pacheco.blogspot.com
 30x m.nautil.us
 17x bit.ly
 12x www.bbc.com
 11x nautil.us
 11x web.archive.org
 11x www.paulgraham.com
 10x eepurl.com
 10x www.tr0lly.com
  9x blogs.quovantis.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are actually people posting stuff like <code>http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20210103-englands-sleepy-scientology-town</code>. Is this by purpose or have they disabled the automatic redirect to https and don’t know it? At least in the case of the bbc page, there actually is no redirect when visiting the link (March 2021).. Maybe if one posts a lot of links like this and then hangs around at public wifi spots, hoping someone clicks the links and visits a logged-in payed site via HTTP..</p>

<p>What are actually the first HTTPS pages posted on hackernews?</p>

<h3 id="domains">domains</h3>

<p>Here’s another historic indicator, and not quite as smooth as the HTTP/S graph above. The percentage of URLs starting with <code>www.</code> or ending with <code>.io</code> or <code>.org</code>.
(You can click or double-click on the variables on the right to show/hide them individually.)</p>



<h3 id="query-parameters">query parameters</h3>

<p>Hackernews is a marketing target (Well, just my guess, if you disagree please 
<a href="https://github.com/defgsus/blog/issues/new">create an issue</a> so we can try to proof/disproof numerically) and the following figure shows the percentage of URLs containing 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters">UTM tracking parameters</a>. It basically means someone is using google analytics to count the number of visitors that come on her page by following a specific link, like a post on hackernews.</p>

<p>The popular query parameters <code>p</code> and <code>id</code> are included for comparison. They are generally not used for campaign tracking. (Again, you can click the variables on the right to view/hide them to get a better overview.)</p>



<p>Regarding the marketing allegation above, i must admit that it’s <em>only</em> 12 tracking code URLs per day on average. But why is it limited in time like this?</p>

<p>We can split by the query <strong>values</strong> of the UTM parameters. Below are roughly all major UTM trackers. Note that, e.g. <code>hackernews</code> most of the time means: Someone not affiliated with hackernews posted a link there, putting something like <code>?utm_source=hackernews</code> in the URL to count how many people click the posted link.</p>

<p>(What this also implies is that google attaches hackernews to their profile of you, but hey, it’s free!)</p>



<p>So increasingly different actors are posting their tracking stuff but in March 2018 they all stop? Is it that hackernews does remove them automatically in most cases?</p>

<p>Let’s compare this with the URLs posted in comments. The percentage of utm tracking links versus utm-free links in the post’s text are plotted below. It’s not much really, a 10th of the url-field numbers. And it’s completely undisturbed by the March 2018 cut-off.</p>



<p>(These numbers are not as accurate as the url-field numbers above. The utm-urls are filtered with this <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html">lucene-style query</a> <code>text: href AND utm AND (source OR campaign)</code> on a text field tokenized by the default <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-stop-analyzer.html">stop analyzer</a>. So there might be a few false positives in there.)</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26316715">A stupid post</a>, but genuinely out of a hacker’s <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html">curiosity</a>, confirms the suspicion that Hackernews is actually removing those parameters now.</p>

<p>And how come these</p>



<p>utm-tagged URLs since April 2018? Are they privileged people? Or have they just another parameter in front as tested <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26319485">in this post</a>?</p>

<p>Well, most of them have, but not these ones:</p>

<p>Things like, <em>medium.com started in 2012 and is now the most popular link target</em> do not catch my attention too much. In case of objection, grab the <a href="https://github.com/defgsus/blog/blob/master/src/hackernews/download.py">download script</a> and explore yourselves.</p>

On September 2019 <a href="https://www.humanmars.net/2019/09/candidate-sites-for-spacex-starship.html" target="_blank" title="Candidate sites for SpaceX Starship Mars landings revealed"><b>it was revealed</b></a> SpaceX has selected several <a href="https://www.humanmars.net/p/starship.html" target="_blank" title="Summary about the SpaceX's Starship Super Heavy in development"><b>Starship</b></a> candidate landing sites on Mars. The candidate sites were located in Southern Arcadia Planitia East of Erebus Montes and one in Phlegra Montes.</p><p>

Since then <b>SpaceX has conducted several workshops with the Mars science community to evaluate and narrow the list of candidate landing sites</b>. All the sites must fit several criteria:
  
</p><ol>
  <li>close to significant <a href="https://www.humanmars.net/2019/04/map-of-shallow-subsurface-water.html" target="_blank" title="Map of shallow subsurface water distribution on Mars">deposits of water/ice</a>, a required resource for in situ propellant production and a consumable to support habitation;</li>
  <li>elevation below -2 km (with respect to the MOLA geoid) that can support the delivery of large payloads, with -3 km preferred;</li>
  <li>latitude must be &lt;40° for solar power and thermal management, and closer to the equator is desirable;</li>
  <li>multiple separate landing locations spaced within a few km of each other, to support the multiple missions needed to grow an outpost;</li>
  <li>slopes should be &lt;5° over a 10 m length scale and the chance of impacting a rock greater than 0.5 m high (1 m diameter) should be &lt;5%;</li>
  <li>landing site must be radar reflective to enable measurement of the distance to the surface, and it must be load bearing to support the spacecraft at touchdown.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Recently an abstract with the <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2021/pdf/2420.pdf" target="_blank" title="'SpaceX Starship landing sites on Mars' by M.Golombek et al"><b>conclusions</b></a> has been published (the results of the study will be presented in two weeks, at the <i>52nd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference</i>), pointing out <b><span>4 prime</span> and <span>3 secondary</span> potential Starship landing sites selected for further study and located in Phlegra Montes, Erebus Montes and Southern Arcadia Planitia</b>:</p><div>
  
<ul>
  <li><span>PM-1</span> has the lowest latitude and elevation of the Phlegra Montes sites, a clear association with LDAs (local ice deposits expressed as lobate debris aprons), well developed polygons (one of the indicators of ice-related morphologies), and has the highest SWIM (Subsurface Water Ice Mapping) score for geomorphic indicators of ice;</li>
  <li><span>AP-1</span> (Arcadia Planitia) appears to be one of the safest sites and has a moderate combined SWIM score for ice;</li>
  <li><span>AP-9</span> has the thickest ice from radar returns (of the Arcadia Planitia sites) and geomorphology indicating shallow ice. It has the highest combined SWIM score for ice, but appears slightly rocky and rough;</li>
  <li><span>EM-16</span> has a clear association with an LDA with nearby brain terrain and the strongest radar return for shallow ice and the highest combined SWIM score of the Erebus Montes sites;</li>
  <li><span>AP-8</span> (Arcadia Planitia) appears to be one of the safest sites and has the highest neutron and combined SWIM scores for ice;</li>
  <li><span>EM-15</span> (Erebus Montes) is associated with a prominent but less extensive LDA, has well developed polygons, nearby brain terrain and appears smooth;</li>
  <li><span>PM-7</span> is adjacent to lineated valley fill (attributed to glacial flow) and appears to be the safest of the Phlegra sites.</li>
  </ul>

                                <div><p>(Bloomberg) -- Chinaâ€™s top financial regulator said all fintech platforms that offer banking services must comply with the same capital requirements as those imposed on traditional lenders to curb risks.</p><p>The regulator has set different deadlines for different financial services with the longest grace period of no more than two years, Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission and party secretary of the central bank, said at a briefing on Tuesday, without elaborating.</p><p>China has introduced a slew of rules for online lenders since late last year, telegraphing an abrupt loss of appetite among regulators for free-wheeling fintech innovations. The derailment of Ant Group Co.â€™s $35 billion share sale and mounting scrutiny of its operations have since upended one of Chinaâ€™s biggest business success stories. The authorities have also cracked down on technology juggernauts in everything from e-commerce to credit-scoring and payments.</p><p>The capital requirements are expected to hit Ant the most by crippling growth at its two microlending arms. Antâ€™s Jiebei and Huabei units had facilitated 1.7 trillion yuan ($263 billion) in consumer loans to 500 million people as of June 30, with only about 2% being kept on the parentâ€™s balance sheet. Concerns that it will need to raise capital to plug the shortfall and seek national licenses have prompted analysts at Morningstar Inc. to slash estimates on Antâ€™s valuation by half from $280 billion before its scrapped listing.</p><p>Meanwhile, Guo said China continues to support fintech innovation such as providing credit to small businesses, though they must do so according to law and regulations.</p><p>Â©2021 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Was there a moment where things “clicked” that solidified your decision to stay on the IC track? If so, how do you reflect on this moment looking back?</p></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><div><p>For a long time I wasn’t fully conscious about the decision. I was driven by passion and interest. But eventually, trying other career tracks like management, software engineering, etc. helped me realize I was happier as a designer, over time, than when in other roles.</p><p>It also helped meeting and talking with other people who had successfully stayed on an IC track or managed to find a way to keep building and creating, like Nicholas Felton, Guido Van Rossum, Jony Ive, Lee Byron, Koen Bok and many others. This really helped me feel comfortable and come to terms with my own draw toward making rather than coordinating.</p><p>Really, I think coordination vs creation is what it comes down to for me. They are two very different categories of concerns and you really have to feel connected to it in order to be willing to learn, evolve and enjoy your work.</p><p>As a designer my concerns are with planning, puzzling and learning. When I tried working in a software-engineering capacity, the concerns were similar, but with other materials and a very different way of learning.</p><p>With management it’s almost like a completely different universe where little to none of the skills of a designer are useful. It’s more about politics and juggling particular needs of individuals on your team. I admire people who are good at this and I really think it’s one of the hardest things you can do in life.</p><p>To me, choosing to be a designer means my concerns are focused around the following four categories:</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> What is the opportunity or issue that needs to change? What’s the history?</p><p><strong>Constraints:</strong> What do we know already? Where do we start exploring and unearthing more? This is a big part of design in my opinion: exploring constraints, learning and growing, then navigating constraints. Also, what materials do we work with and what are our options and trade-offs?</p><p><strong>People:</strong> Who are we doing this for, and what do they care about?</p><p><strong>Craft:</strong> less about a project, and more about a designer’s own ability to be effective, efficient and able to communicate their ideas.</p></div></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>What advice would you give to a senior designer who is trying to decide between the IC track and management track?</p></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><div><p>Recognize that you’d be “going back to school” to learn a whole new skill-set. It’s a bit like a restaurant chef who starts a juice company — they are still in the food industry but their day-to-day is very different. What, and who, they spend time with has almost no overlap and the skills needed to be a great chef are likely quite different than what you need to successfully start and run a juice company.</p><p>Let me offer you something else by asking you a question:</p><p><strong>What type of person do you want to spend most of your time with?</strong></p><p>As a manager it will be coworkers, as a designer it will be the customers of whatever you are designing. Both are important aspects of the path to mastery, but it can be useful sometimes to try looking at something from a different perspective.</p><p>For me, the thought of spending hours a week, every week, for years speaking with customers of, for example, Figma or early Spotify, is exciting! It’s something that makes my brain tingle! You really have to introspect and listen to yourself to find your own answer to this question though.</p></div></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>What trade-offs or risks, if any, should designers know about before continuing down the IC path?</p></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><div><p>It will likely always be a challenge to feel like you are learning and “progressing.” This will be totally fine as long as you’re willing to work on building mental tools and constructs to help yourself.</p><p>Tribes, friend circles, neighborhoods, countries, or professional organizations will have varying degrees of meaning attached to roles, titles and money. For example, in the USA a management title is important to many people because of history and culture; being the Foreman at a factory meant you were exceptionally skilled. This obviously doesn’t hold true in all cases, but understanding what political and social meaning your choice has will be important. Really, recognizing what group of people would make you feel most happy, most fulfilled.</p><p>As a career IC you will have to be <em>really</em> good at what you are doing in order to increase monetary compensation. If you are reading this, chances are you are already interested in, or already on, the path to mastery as a career IC designer. And that likely means you want to be the best you can be at your job. That’s great. Don’t worry about it too much though.</p><p>Speaking of compensation, depending on the company and region on Earth, management might or might not be considered a harder task and already command a higher level of monetary compensation than a designer. This varies quite a bit in my experience. Some companies, especially traditional or old ones, tend to give managers a higher salary than ICs simply by tradition and belief.</p><p>In some cultures, like in Japanese industry, there are even compensation models assuming that management is part of<!-- --> <em>anyone’s</em> career path (e.g. compensation as the sum area of a square where x is experience and y the number of people you manage).</p><p>If you are going to work or live in a place that is like this, it might be much harder to pursue an IC career.</p></div></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>For designers committed to staying on the IC track beyond the senior level, what are the most important skills they should learn outside of the hard craft skills?</p></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><div><p>The more experience you have, the more implicit authority you will have. It can be tough to understand that when you propose a silly idea over lunch when you have 5 years of experience has a very different impact than when you have 15 years of experience — someone might actually listen to you and go make it!</p><p>Really, this is a great thing, a sort of influential power you gain. It needs love, care and maintenance though — always work on getting better, learning from your mistakes and improving on your experience. There’s nothing more dangerous for an organization than a person with terrible ideas whom everyone admires professionally.</p><p>Powers you will have as an experienced IC:</p><p><strong>Experience with many things.</strong> What you are tackling today you might have experience with from the past. Use and share this experience in an informative way, not in a directing way! The past is different from the now, and the circumstances, people, and technology are definitely not the same. Avoid using your past experience as definitive facts or imposition as constraints.</p><p><strong>Sense of quality:</strong> You will likely have a better intuition for quality than professionally-younger designers.</p><p><strong>Intuition around cost.</strong> Design is not art, even though it can accidentally be seen as art later on. All design challenges have some form of budget: time, money, etc. With your experience, you’ve used your amazing human brain to form connections that gives you intuition...a form of premonition. You can sense that “this option will probably be much more costly than that option.”</p><p>This is great stuff and in some way what makes a good designer efficient: the ability to estimate and approximate the path to good decisions and solutions. Work on making use of this intuition, dare to “trust your gut.” Work on communicating these hunches to your coworkers in a way that is never condescending or dismissive but rather assistive.</p><p>For example, if you feel that the information density is too high, that there is too much information being displayed, you might start a conversation about how important approachability is to the thing you are building. In contrast, what you probably shouldn’t do, is to assert implicit authority — perhaps unconsciously — by saying “this won’t work, it’s way too dense.”</p><p>By leveling up to the subject or category of your intuition’s concern, you can help your coworkers see what you see: that the design may be a bit overwhelming. When people come to a concrete conclusion like that on their own, they are much better equipped to do a good job at addressing it. Sometimes it also turns out that your intuition is misdirected and a short conversation can help you realize that.</p></div></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>What are the mile markers for you to know that you are still growing as a designer and progressing in your career?</p></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><div><p>I try to make things in ways which are new to me. When I do this, I have to spend time studying to learn, and that is really the focus of most of my hobby projects. When I come back to the thing I was making, and apply what I learned, I can feel that I made some progress. Sometimes this bears no fruit; sometimes it is not interesting or I fail to learn and that’s okay.</p><p>Another one: when professional people I look up to show their interest and support in my ideas. For example, I’ve dabbled in typography since the early 2000s but never been great at it until a few years ago when I decided to really focus on learning and getting good at making typefaces.</p><p>It took a year or so of pretty hard work before some designers in the typography industry reached out, recognized my progress, and in every single case helped me get even better and helped me see my own work in different ways. To me this really <em>feels</em> like improving and is important to me.</p><p>Finally, respect from leaders of organizations. When someone at a company with direct personal influence over its success or failure asks me for advice, I know that I’ve been able to build trust and do a good job as a designer. You, reader, probably agree with me that design as a tool and method is something fit for many problems, not just graphic problems or user interfaces. As a career IC designer, a goal of mine is to offer design (“design thinking” if you will) as a tool fit for many problems. When this is recognized and actually applied successfully, you’ve accomplished something that might only be possible as an advanced IC designer.</p></div></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>How important are titles for individual contributors when it comes to impact or decision making? Is there a meaningful difference …</p></div></div></div>

<strong>Team:</strong> <code>cat /dev/random | grep "to be or not to be"</code><br>
<strong>Who:</strong> Jan-Willem Buurlage, Ragnar Groot Koerkamp, Timon Knigge,  Abe Wits<br>
<strong>Score:</strong> 10282641<br>
<strong>Rank:</strong> 16</p>

<p>Since we did quite well, here is a write-up of our participation in Hashcode 2021.</p>

<h2 id="prep">Prep</h2>

<p>All four of us had previously participated in Hashcode, but this was the first
time in the current composition.  Since we estimated our chances of getting
through to the finals to be more than nothing, we decided to practice some
previous Hashcode problems.  Not all test sessions were equally successful, but
we did manage to get a good division of work: while I start by immediately writing
the IO <code>Input</code> and <code>Output</code> classes, and the <code>Output::score()</code> function,
the others always start with reading the statement, analysing the testcases,
and writing at least one greedy solution. This already is a big step up
from previous years/teams, where usually everybody would write the IO
themselves.</p>

<p>Next to this, we also set up a template repository (to be open-sourced
eventually) containing stub <code>io.h</code> and
<code>main.cpp</code> files. This way, all we have to do is store, read, and write the
<code>Input</code> and <code>Output</code>, while the API is already fixed so that others can start
writing their parts without waiting for me to be done with the basics.</p>

<p>Another great help is a custom <code>run.py</code> script that compiles a solution and runs it on all
testcases, stores <em>all</em> solution files, and keeps track of maximum scores per
testcase so far. To ease online submission,  it symlinks these best scores to a
separate directory, where it also writes the zipped code.
After post contest optimizations, the output looks like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ run.py ragnar/greedy.cpp
                                            best    this run    old best       delta
Score for  a                        :       2002        2002        2002           0
Score for  b                        :    4568339     4564400     4568339       -3939
Score for  c                        :    1312204     1289135     1312204      -23069
Score for  d                        :    2493047     2335840     2493047     -157207
Score for  e                        :     718417      673445      718417      -44972
Score for  f                        :    1419782      415082     1419782    -1004700
========================================
Total score:                            10513791     9279904    10513791
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We also have a small Python script to help with analysing the testcases,
containing some functions to quickly print a summary of a list of numbers so
it’s easy to quickly get a feeling for e.g. the range of in-degrees in this
problem.</p>

<h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>

<p>With an early break from work, a quick outside walk, plenty of coffee, food,
and snacks stashed, the git template copied, and some final jumping jacks done,
we were ready for the start!</p>

<p>This sections covers all the mistakes we made - the interesting stuff comes
after.</p>

<h3 id="first-hour">First hour</h3>
<div><div><pre><code>&gt; [00:01] Timon Knigge: problem commit
&gt; [00:02] Ragnar Groot Koerkamp: add input
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Help! The site didn’t load for most of us, so committing the pdf and input (as
we do anyway) turned out to be the faster option.
(Note: Times are relative to the contest start.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; [00:11] Ragnar Groot Koerkamp: input
&gt; [00:24] Ragnar Groot Koerkamp: output
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>While the others started reading the long
<a href="https://hashcodejudge.withgoogle.com/#/rounds/5879728443490304/">statement</a>, I
wrote the reading of the input and writing of the output. (I won’t explain the
problem here, you probably already read it anyway.) Input was relatively
simple, but required a rewrite to directly map street names back to integers.
That probably took most of those 11 minutes:</p>

<details>
  <summary>Input data</summary>

  <div><div><pre><code><span>// Note: code samples have been slightly cleaned by removing unrelated code and</span>
<span>// debug output, but is otherwise exactly as written during the contest.</span>

<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>

</details>

<p>Output took slightly longer, mostly because this requires both writing and reading, so we can improve existing solutions using local search.
One nice thing here is that the problem statement has a sample input and output,
so now we can do a sanity check and read and write the output, and check whether it remains the same.</p>

<details>
  <summary>Output data</summary>

  <div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Green</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>ll</span> <span>street</span><span>,</span> <span>duration</span><span>;</span>

<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>

</details>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; [01:14] Ragnar Groot Koerkamp: scoring
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Next up was adding the scoring function, which took considerable time.
This problem had relatively complicated simulation with lots of bookkeeping and
different ids, which made it slow to implement this correctly. I opted for a
simple yet slow approach as initial implementation:
For each time step, iterate over all streets and check
whether the traffic light is green using <code>std::map::lower_bound</code>. Each street
would have a queue of cars waiting there. This can be
improved in multiple ways, but I figured having an implementation fast was more
important than having a fast implementation.</p>

<p>In the end I got the right score on the sample output, and without submissions
to test the scoring function, I was happy and continued to write a simple
solution myself.</p>

<h3 id="everybody-gets-1">Everybody gets 1</h3>
<div><div><pre><code>&gt; [01:37] Ragnar Groot Koerkamp: random solution
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The simplest idea I could come up with was the following:
for each intersection, give 1 second of green light to each incoming street.
We do not yet care about the order, so just order them as they
appear in the input.</p>

<p>Given all the work done before, coding this was very simple:</p>

<p>I ran this on all the testcases and made our first submission to the judge
system for a total of 7,885,741 points. A decent score with a position somewhere
in the top 1000 IIRC, but nowhere close to top 100. We had spent a lot of time
on IO and scoring already so this is not too surprising for a very simple first
attempt.</p>

<p>This is the point where we learned the judge actually has some great
visualizations and info to help debugging. If only we’d known before!</p>

<p>Playing around a bit, I was able to increase the score on F by 300k by making a
light green for \(x\) seconds when a total of \(x\) cars entered via that street.
The intuition as for why this may be a good idea should be obvious.</p>

</code></pre></div>  </div>

</details>

<p>Fiddling a bit more, I was able to bump F another 500k as well by making it green for \(\sqrt x\) seconds.
At the time, this seemed sensible, \(\sqrt x\) being the geometric mean of \(1\) and
\(x\), but I didn’t really have a proper explanation.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way, the introduction of the <code>if(usage[sid] == 0) continue</code>,
i.e. only giving green lights to streets that are used at all, in combination
with the original 1 second duration, bumped the score
for D another 600k.</p>

<p>At this point, we were in the 9.4M-9.6M range. Very respectable, but not yet in
the top.</p>

&gt; [01:59] Jan-Willem Buurlage: Update
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Meanwhile, Jan-Willem was working on a greedy solution, and Abe and Timon were
trying to analyse the testcases, but having a somewhat hard time because the
it seemed like the testcases did not contain much structure that could lead to simple greedy algorithms.</p>

<p>Jan-Willem was trying the following simple greedy idea:
for each traffic light,
change the green light when the queue for a not yet used light becomes longer
than the queue for the current light. Like the scoring function, this required a
lot of debugging to get working.</p>

<p>After some time, it turned out two of the issue were actually in my scoring
function. The first I had already fixed: the green light function broke on
intersections without a schedule assigned.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; [01:58] Ragnar Groot Koerkamp: fix write
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Secondly, the outputs made by his greedy solution weren’t accepted by the judge system.
It turns out my hope that the online judge would ignore intersections with 0 assigned green
lights, but alas, that’s not the case. This required a small rewrite of the
<code>Output::write()</code> function, first counting the number of intersections with any
assignment at all, and only then looping over them to print the schedules.</p>

<p>The score log gets a bit messy here, but it seems that this solution managed
to bump A to the 2002 optimum, and it gained another 6k points on E.</p>

However, I have started noticing that many software development problems might be caused by people being too positive and passionate. Let me explain.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="d047">Isn’t it weird that so many young people are already feeling burnt out after a few years of work? I keep meeting people who need a break after just their first year or two. I’ve also experienced burnout myself (twice even). The first time, I had to take a six-month break. The second time, which was very recent, I needed a full year off before I could come back to programming.</p><p id="41b7">This year, I’ve spent a lot of time with people outside tech and noticed one thing: We don’t complain much about our work. We complain about bad bosses and bad projects, but not about coding itself. We take passion for granted. Surprised? Go through job offers. Passion is often one of the must-haves listed on them. We are expected to love our job, and even more, we are expected to make programming the center of our universes.</p><p id="31ae">But what about the people who do not love programming and still do their job all the same? Try to identify yourself as one of those among your colleagues or on Twitter, and you will immediately be dismissed as being a bad developer. However, is that really the case? People who do their job and try something different after working hours can be amazing programmers too. Not everyone needs to come home and work on side projects, create blog posts and YouTube videos about coding, and read programming books for fun.</p><p id="4a37">I have been one of those people trying to work through all my spare time. For many years, I felt guilty if I didn’t spend all my waking time chasing some imaginary productivity goal — and guess where that landed me?</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Woman burying her head into her arms" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC" width="5184" height="3456" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@nicotitto?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">nrd</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a>.</figcaption></figure></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="61c0">Another aspect that is heavily biased against negative feedback is following new trends originating from FAANG companies. Try to speak up against SOA or Docker. Try to propose using an older, more mature language and SSR. It’s similar to having a passion for work.

However, it’s hard not to get on board — or at least pretend to be on board.

DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) is often said in the same sentence as KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid), yet they are often mutually exclusive practices. “Simple” means no unnecessary abstractions, yet starting with DRY code leads exactly to premature abstractions.</p><p id="9470">I personally use <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/rule-of-three/" rel="noopener">the rule of 3X</a>:</p><blockquote><p id="3f47">“We have the delusion of reuse. Don’t feel bad. It’s an endemic disease among software developers. An occupational hazard, really.</p><p id="371b">…</p><p id="64fa">- It is three times as difficult to build reusable components as single-use components, and<br>- A reusable component should be tried out in three different applications before it will be sufficiently general to accept into a reuse library.” — <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/rule-of-three/" rel="noopener">Coding Horror</a></p></blockquote><p id="6a10">Obviously, I don’t treat it as a maxim. It’s more of a rule of thumb than good practice. But even here, we are getting to the same problem. People who dare suggest using singleton or any other hated anti-patterns are perceived as less than stellar developers.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="dc25">The expectation that <em>real</em> software developers, hackers, and geeks are defined by their vocation feels like being in some sort of RPG game. Your trade will forever define you, and once you choose this path, there is no way back.</p><p id="d74d">We, as developers, are expected to love programming. But why? The simple truth is that it is good for employers. How many horror stories have come out of game dev? Yet many young people dream about working in the gaming industry only to be replaced by another batch of young, naive people after a few years.</p><p id="b875">We need to normalize people not “loving” to code, and we need to normalize having a healthy work-life balance in tech. We need people to be more open about their opinions, even if they are against the moment’s hype.</p><p id="62c6">Don’t get me wrong, I really like being a software developer and I like programming. However, I am not sure if I love it being the center of my universe anymore.</p><p id="e18c">I want to try other things, and that is absolutely OK.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, February 23, 2021</em></p><p>I like writing quick little scripts to avoid having to remember how to do things. Most of the time I start in bash, thinking the task won't be too complicated... but then before I know it I'm having to reread the bash man pages to figure out how arrays work for the thousandth time.</p><p>So really, I'd rather write scripts in a language that offers some more safety and better data structures. We're trying to learn Haskell at work, so maybe that?</p><p>Let's see a hello world:</p><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>#</span><span>!/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>env runghc

</span><span>main </span><span>:: IO </span><span>()
main </span><span>=</span><span> putStrLn </span><span>"Hello, World!"
</span></code></pre><p>That seems pretty reasonable, and only takes like 300ms to compile and run. Not awful, but it's not as fast as a bash script, and it means I have to use Haskell's standard prelude instead of something safer like <a href="https://kowainik.github.io/projects/relude">relude</a> or <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/nri-prelude">nri-prelude</a>.</p><p>It's reasonable to solve this, though: I can just use <code>nix-shell</code> to get a <code>ghc</code> with packages.</p><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>#</span><span>!/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>env nix</span><span>-</span><span>shell
#</span><span>!</span><span>nix</span><span>-</span><span>shell </span><span>-</span><span>p </span><span>"(pkgs.haskellPackages.ghcWithPackages (ps: [ ps.text ]))"
</span><span>#</span><span>!</span><span>nix</span><span>-</span><span>shell </span><span>-</span><span>i runghc

{-# </span><span>LANGUAGE</span><span> OverloadedStrings #-}

</span><span>import </span><span>Data.Text.IO

</span><span>main </span><span>:: IO </span><span>()
main </span><span>= </span><span>Data</span><span>.</span><span>Text</span><span>.</span><span>IO</span><span>.</span><span>putStrLn </span><span>"Hello, World!"
</span></code></pre><p>Well, that works, but I've traded speed for flexibility: run time has grown to over 2 seconds! Eep!</p><p>I don't think I should have to make this trade, so I wrote <a href="https://github.com/BrianHicks/nix-script"><code>nix-script</code></a>. It transparently manages a compilation cache for these kinds of scripts, and lets you specify dependencies and build commands inside your source file!</p><p>That means the <code>nix-shell</code> example above can be rewritten like so:</p><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>#</span><span>!/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>env nix</span><span>-</span><span>script
#</span><span>!</span><span>buildInputs (pkgs</span><span>.</span><span>haskellPackages</span><span>.</span><span>ghcWithPackages (ps</span><span>:</span><span> [ ps</span><span>.</span><span>text ]))
#</span><span>!</span><span>build ghc </span><span>-</span><span>O </span><span>-</span><span>o </span><span>$</span><span>OUT_FILE </span><span>$</span><span>SCRIPT_FILE

</span><span>{-# </span><span>LANGUAGE</span><span> OverloadedStrings #-}

</span><span>import </span><span>Data.Text.IO

</span><span>main </span><span>:: IO </span><span>()
main </span><span>= </span><span>Data</span><span>.</span><span>Text</span><span>.</span><span>IO</span><span>.</span><span>putStrLn </span><span>"Hello, World!"
</span></code></pre><p>The first time you run that, it'll compile the script to a binary, then run it. That takes about two seconds on my machine. The second time, and going forward until you change the script, it detects that it already compiled to a binary, so it just runs the compiled version. That takes 30ms or so for me! Big improvement!</p><p>But it's really not that fun to have to figure out that <code>#!build</code> line every time, and I always forget how to call <code>pkgs.haskellPackages.ghcWithPackages</code> correctly... so there's also a wrapper script called <code>nix-script-haskell</code> that makes this nicer:</p><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>#</span><span>!/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>env nix</span><span>-</span><span>script</span><span>-</span><span>haskell
#</span><span>!</span><span>haskellPackages text

{-# </span><span>LANGUAGE</span><span> OverloadedStrings #-}

</span><span>import </span><span>Data.Text.IO

</span><span>main </span><span>:: IO </span><span>()
main </span><span>= </span><span>Data</span><span>.</span><span>Text</span><span>.</span><span>IO</span><span>.</span><span>putStrLn </span><span>"Hello, World!"
</span></code></pre><p>And, in addition to the speed boost, we can depend on any package in the Nix ecosystem! For example, here's how you'd add and call <code>jq</code>:</p><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>#</span><span>!/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>env nix</span><span>-</span><span>script</span><span>-</span><span>haskell
#</span><span>!</span><span>runtimeInputs jq

</span><span>import </span><span>System.Process

</span><span>main </span><span>:: IO </span><span>()
main </span><span>= </span><span>do
</span><span>  formatted </span><span>&lt;-
</span><span>    readProcess
      </span><span>"jq"
</span><span>      [</span><span>"--color-output"</span><span>, </span><span>"."</span><span>]
      </span><span>"{</span><span>\"</span><span>name</span><span>\"</span><span>: </span><span>\"</span><span>Atlas</span><span>\"</span><span>, </span><span>\"</span><span>species</span><span>\"</span><span>: </span><span>\"</span><span>kitty cat</span><span>\"</span><span>}"
</span><span>  putStr formatted
</span></code></pre><p>It's also pretty easy to create more wrapping interpreters, so we also ship one for bash. Even though it's not a compiled language, we can cache the nix environment with the exact dependencies the script needs!</p><p>You can get this at <a href="https://github.com/BrianHicks/nix-script">github.com/BrianHicks/nix-script</a>. There are installation instructions in the README, both for standalone use and use within a larger Nix project.</p><p>Enjoy, and let me know if—and how—you use this!</p></article></div>]]>

In my journey of working at several startups, and building my own projects, I've developed a an infrastructure engineering skillset.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2020, I was working on a new project and wanted to deploy an Elixir API in a containerized environment and realized that, by default, Elixir apps include a <code>prod.secrets.exs</code> which is used to configure an application in a production environment.</p><p>The standard approach would require us to build docker images on a per-environment basis, which would have to include said secrets within them — this was not an ideal scenario.</p><p>Slab, <a href="https://slab.com/">the knowledge base that democratizes knowledge</a>, discovered the limits of this production configuration. As their team grew, sharing and maintaining this approach became more difficult — as did the security concerns of having secrets in docker images.</p><p>As such, there was a need for a tool that could solve these problems and enable the deployment of docker images to any environment without having hardcoded secrets, as well as solving for config &amp; dev/prod parity in the <a href="https://12factor.net/">twelve factor app methodology</a>.</p><p>Hush demonstrated that it elegantly solved the problem and simplified their environment.</p><h2>Example</h2><p>Hush implements Elixir's <code>Config.Provider</code> behavior, giving you a familiar and supported way to configure Elixir applications.</p><p>In this example we can see a production configuration using three providers; AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secrets Manager, and System Environment.</p><pre><p><span></span><span>alias</span><span> </span><span>Hush</span><span>.</span><span>Provider</span><span>.</span><span>{</span><span>AwsSecretsManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>GcpSecretManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>SystemEnvironment</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>config </span><span>:app</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Web</span><span>.</span><span>Endpoint</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>http:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>port:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:hush</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>SystemEnvironment</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"PORT"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>cast:</span><span> </span><span>:integer</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>config </span><span>:app</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>.</span><span>Repo</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>password:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:hush</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>GcpSecretManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"CLOUDSQL_PASSWORD"</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>config </span><span>:app</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>.</span><span>RedshiftRepo</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>password:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:hush</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>AwsSecretsManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"REDSHIFT_PASSWORD"</span><span>}</span></p></pre><h2>Features</h2><p>Hush ships, today, with the following features:</p><ul><li>Extensible providers.

                    <p>Since our founding six years ago, it has been a core tenet at Codecov to provide the best code coverage analytics to developers and organizations.</p>
<p>To give our developers a better grasp of the code coverage landscape, we have compiled our most significant learnings from 2020 in our new annual <strong>State of Open Source Code Coverage</strong>. Here is what we found.</p>
<hr>
<h2>General Codecov Usage</h2>
<p>Codecov is dedicated to being free forever for open-source projects. We saw an incredible level of usage on our platform to analyze code coverage on your repositories.</p>




<h2>Code Coverage Usage by Language</h2>
<p>Codecov continues to be language agnostic, ensuring that developers across the board can get code coverage data. We present metrics around language usage by popularity and by the average code coverage for projects of a language.</p>




<h2>Codecov CI Usage</h2>
<p>Codecov continues to work with all CIs in the developer ecosystem. In 2020, however, we saw a meteoric rise in usage of GitHub Actions.</p>


<h2>Featured Open Source Repositories</h2>
<p>Our open-source community continues to be a cornerstone of our product development. We take a step back to showcase and congratulate some of our more popular repositories and their efforts to reach high code coverage.</p>


<h2>Codecov Benefits</h2>
<p>Our goal is to help developers merge their code with confidence. We continually work to see how adding code coverage can benefit projects.</p>

	<p>The OpenPush project aims to create a free and open source self-hosted replacement for Android Push Notifications usually sent through Google's proprietary Firebase Cloud Messaging platform. This started as a <a href="https://prototypefund.de/project/open-source-push-service-fuer-android-apps/">PrototypeFund project</a>. Development is still ongoing.</p>
	<h5>Concept</h5>
	<p><img width="100%" src="https://bubu1.eu/concept.png"></p><p>The green components (PushClient and PushServer) in this high-level overview are part of this project. The red components are different apps and their corresponding webservices using the push functionality.</p>
	<h5>Benefits</h5>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Free Software.</b> FCM is a proprietary service and the Firebase client libs are closed source. This makes projects including fcm libraries effectively non-free software which i.e. cannot be added to the FOSS <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a> appstore.</li>
		<li><b>Self-hosted.</b> When self-hosting a open source project, there's no dependency on an external service anymore.</li>
		<li><b>User is in control.</b> A smartphone user can chose a pushserver instance, possibly self-hosted or hosted by a trusted entity.  This instance's url is communicated to the webservice together with the app token to the push-notification producer. Push-notifications will only be sent to this server.</li>

    <p>We live in an industry that celebrates and demands success. From posts that proudly show metrics that are up and to the right, to App Store feature tweets - we love to see others hitting on their current ventures. And why not? It’s fun! I love it too and I’ve shared my own homeruns plenty of times.</p>

<p>But have you noticed that most of the “open startups” are the ones who’ve already found market validation or are on a hot streak? I admit - it’s a lot more fun to share when the getting is good as opposed to when you wake up to zero downloads.</p>

<p>Everyone has started from the bottom though, so today I’d like to take a second and showcase some of the worst things I’ve made from early on in my career that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Made no money</li>
  <li>Won over zero users and</li>
  <li>Whose only fans and reviews were from my immediate family (thanks for that 5 star review Mom!)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="christmas-lister">Christmas Lister</h3>
<p>Ah, Christmas Lister. I got the idea to make a Christmas List app on November 15th. It shipped sometime shortly after. This was my first memory of pulling an all nighter on a project.</p>

<p>Just check out that icon:</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2cd06749d6dd546ff5fe4d499a590da29747a2fa/854e5/assets/images/tts_xmaslister.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2cd06749d6dd546ff5fe4d499a590da29747a2fa/854e5/assets/images/tts_xmaslister.png" alt="Christmas Lister App Store Listing"></p>

<p>At the height of skeuomorphism, green developers such as myself wielded Photoshop with might and glory. As I browsed the websites with free .pdfs and stuffed them into my interface, my thirst for more leather bound table views was matched only by my desire for more Christmas Joy to be plastered throughout the app<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/36aa878a89197486883dd4d92a8ed913a1807d0e/4ae87/assets/images/tts_xmaslister1.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/36aa878a89197486883dd4d92a8ed913a1807d0e/4ae87/assets/images/tts_xmaslister1.png" alt="Christmas Lister App Store Listing"></p>

<p>And I remember this one as clear as day. I rushed to my iMac the day after release and saw the sales numbers:</p>

<p>1.</p>

<p>As in O-N-E! Later that day, I found out it was my manager’s daughter at the Steakhouse I was a server at:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My daughter made me buy your crappy app.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My old manager, circa early 2010s</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In retrospect, he was right on the nose.</p>

<section>
    <div>
        <p><span>let</span> concatenatedThoughts = <span>"""</span></p>
        <p>Fun fact, this was actually made inside a game engine. I still was just picking up coding at the time, and there was no support for any sort of array or general collection structure. That meant that each and every single slot to make a list with present ideas was hardcoded ahead of time (i.e. var list1present1, etc).</p>
        <p><span>"""</span></p>
    </div>
</section>

<p><strong>Main lessons learned:</strong> User interfaces require so much thought and less .pdfs, ask yourself why you’re doing what you’re doing and channel your excitement into <em>less</em> action and more thinking before you fire away.</p>

<h3 id="spend-stack-version-1">Spend Stack Version 1</h3>
<p>My first stab at good ol’ Spend Stack. Before it <a href="https://swiftjectivec.com/a-new-home-for-spend-stack/">became a success</a>, it was a jumbled mess of hidden gestures to navigate, bright and contrasty colors and a nonsensical onboarding flow that had you flying through cartoon clouds (I still was high on those .pdfs from Christmas Lister):</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/87c38e45772f71b60f1967a841e7413107288741/c3fb1/assets/images/tts_ss1.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/87c38e45772f71b60f1967a841e7413107288741/c3fb1/assets/images/tts_ss1.png" alt="Spend Stack V1 UI"></p>

<p>At this point, I started to trade out my love of free vector graphics for open source projects on Github. If it looked cool, I threw it into my podfile. Never mind if the app needed it, <em>this thing makes freakin’ blur views sooooooo trivial</em><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup>!</p>

<p>I love this app. It clearly demonstrated the burden and the benefit of having an inexperienced dev executing on an actually good idea. I mean that gracefully too. Once you’re past this phase, it’s easy to become a kvetch about rookie mistakes. We’re quick to forget that we made them too.</p>

<p>You don’t go from this:</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7c12415684a674377f2d2d824263dedc2ed81616/394a6/assets/images/tts_ss2.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7c12415684a674377f2d2d824263dedc2ed81616/394a6/assets/images/tts_ss2.png" alt="Spend Stack V1 Lists View"></p>

<p>To this over overnight:</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1455b1b07364b592ee3f8e88e5d7ba40b04b5292/f8077/assets/images/tts_ss3.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1455b1b07364b592ee3f8e88e5d7ba40b04b5292/f8077/assets/images/tts_ss3.png" alt="Spend Stack V2 Features"></p>

<p>There are <em>six years</em> between those images.</p>

<p><strong>Main lessons learned:</strong> A great idea for an app can still result in crappy app, take time to learn about design and holy moses don’t toss in an open source project just because it’s shiny.</p>

<h3 id="halo-timer">Halo Timer</h3>
<p>My best worst effort, by far. My hopes were riding high on this one - I had made some janky apps already, and this time  - I knew better!</p>

<p>To be fair, this one did have a watch extension, quick action short cuts and a user flow that was actually useable. Plus, that parallax effect with the UI on the visor was neat<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>:</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2d3ce684d2118a3b9598429cd913cd376de22663/06f7b/assets/images/tts_halovisor.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2d3ce684d2118a3b9598429cd913cd376de22663/06f7b/assets/images/tts_halovisor.png" alt="The Halo Timer Visor"></p>

<p>So what went wrong here? Let’s pop into multitasking right qui….oh, oh no!</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5cb17c79281b6348fafcb7314665fa4a7b756f50/19667/assets/images/tts_halomulti.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5cb17c79281b6348fafcb7314665fa4a7b756f50/19667/assets/images/tts_halomulti.png" alt="The Halo Timer Multitasking on iOS"></p>

<p>Our proclivity to adhere to Master Chief’s visor was both awesome and troublesome. Accessibility was near impossible, as was reframing the .pdf of the UI to other device sizes. Dynamic type just couldn’t hang.</p>

<p>But, what you can <em>see</em> here is that I was learning. Let’s not use any funky gestures to navigate, let’s make it easy to at least get around using a standard <code>UIKit</code> control people know like table views. Progress:</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/88c77148d28d19175f163a9156acd04e38de18ea/a3637/assets/images/tts_haloui.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/88c77148d28d19175f163a9156acd04e38de18ea/a3637/assets/images/tts_haloui.png" alt="Halo Timer UI"></p>

<p><strong>Main lessons learned:</strong> Just because you now <em>know</em> better doesn’t mean you’ll actually <em>make</em> something better - but if you’re here, you’re soooooooo close to getting it!</p>

<h3 id="sowhat">So…..what?</h3>
<p>So why share all of this, aside from the laughs? Is there some wise sage advice I’m inevitably about to drop?</p>

<p>I mean, I dunno? Here’s what I found when writing this:</p>

<p>These projects meant everything to me at the time. I look back at these crash-and-burns and I remember being absolutely brimming with <strong>passion</strong> and pure, unfettered <strong>excitement</strong> as they came together. I mean, these are the projects that made me! I stayed up late, googled non-stop and thought about them all the time.</p>

<p>There’s no way I’d be where I am today if I didn’t dump hours into them. We tend to knock ourselves after launch and think “You know what, that failed. That didn’t work.”</p>

<p>When you’re in it, it feels that way. May I suggest to you that we need to flip that line of thinking from:</p>

<p>“I failed”</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>“I made a freaking thing <em>from nothing</em>, I created this! It may not have worked, but I have 5,433 things to bring to my <em>next</em> thing, and I also know more about this space I tried to launch in.”</p>

<p>In short, you rocked it. Always remember that character is carved out rather than instantly created. Each of these misses can eventually add up to a win.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>When you make things that don’t end up working, and you keep shipping things that don’t sell you might put yourself in a dangerous spot without even realizing it. It becomes <em>fait accompli</em> that even before you spin up your next Xcode project, it’s just not gonna work. If that’s you - keep pushing! You’re close, and I promise you that.</p>

<p>I’m so thankful for the things I made that sucked, because without them I would not have made the things that didn’t.</p>

<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>

<p><span>P</span>ascale Elie saw her hometown fall apart from her house in Port-au-Prince. The massive earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010 left the capital city in ruins. Elie, an economist who was then working for an insurance company, watched as the financial system collapsed in the wake of the disaster. <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2010/06/Gates-Foundation-and-USAID-Announce-Innovative-Fund-to-Incentivize-Mobile-Money-Services-in-Haiti">Over a third of physical branches — long concentrated in the capital city —</a> fell apart overnight. Even though only 10% of residents were account holders, hours-long lines formed around the few remaining banks. The country’s fragile power grid failed and left millions of Haitians in the dark. Foreign aid struggled to plug the gap, as distributing cash through traditional means proved difficult and time-consuming — on average, <a href="https://www.betterthancash.org/news/is-cash-the-enemy-of-the-poor">locals waited 12 days</a> to access emergency aid in the midst of Haiti’s worst humanitarian crisis of the 21st century.</p>



<p>Elie eventually quit her job and threw herself into building a solution. She founded a fintech called HaitiPay which in turn launched Lajan Cash, a trailblazing mobile wallet and payments system that allows anyone with a cellphone to get paid, transfer money, purchase from mom-and-pop stores, or receive remittances from abroad. By dialing a short number, clients can send requests for transfers and payments from their phones, without having to rely on an internet connection. Since its early days, HaitiPay has guaranteed that all transactions were traceable and available between different financial institutions — a level of interoperability that remains an exception to the rule in the country. The service was one of the first in Haiti: an innovative company looking to disrupt a slow-moving and inefficient industry whose shortcomings were painfully obvious. “I said to myself, ‘That’s what I’m going to do for the rest of my life,’” Elie told <em>Rest of World</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the surface, her life-long mission was starting to look a lot like a Silicon Valley–scripted underdog fairy tale. Early on, when she envisaged the company, she jumped through all the ludicrous legal hoops required to create a startup in a heavily regulated market. Then, when she looked to attract customers, her company stood against contenders that had dominated the area for generations but stood as yet unaware of fintech’s potential. If things had panned out as the standard Silicon Valley–endorsed fairy tale claims, disruptive innovation and perseverance should have been enough for Elie to beat the traditional players of the local financial scene.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, a decade on, it isn’t pioneers like HaitiPay that dominate the fintech scene. Digital wallets and payments are now firmly established in the country’s mostly informal economy. Contrary to the underdog myth that pervades startup culture, the fintech market has been taken over by the establishment — oligarchic banks and telecommunications companies — thanks to archaic regulation and precarious access to funding.</p>



<p>In the aftermath of the quake, the <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2010/04/Statement-on-Emergency-Response-to-Haiti">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> rushed to Haiti with millions in emergency aid, three days after the catastrophe. Less than six months later, it had partnered with the U.S. Agency for International Development to offer <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2010/06/Gates-Foundation-and-USAID-Announce-Innovative-Fund-to-Incentivize-Mobile-Money-Services-in-Haiti">a $10 million grant</a> to mobile money solutions that could streamline fund distribution. An initial $4 million would be split between two companies that proposed the best solutions; the remainder would be given to the winners, if and when they hit at least 100,000 transactions in the country. Contestants had to deliver solutions that weren’t only innovative but could distribute funds to a large user base as fast as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The aid announcement highlighted the same idealized case study that Elie had identified months prior: M-Pesa — a Kenyan peer-to-peer payment and money transfer system with <a href="http://www.fsassessment.umd.edu/publications/effects-mpesa-kenya.html">over 9 million customers</a> — was deemed to be the most promising model on which to base Haiti’s nascent fintech sector. At the time, this African startup’s success stood in stark contrast to the hundreds of mobile banking initiatives that had been unable to grow their customer base beyond a handful of users. Soon M-Pesa had put East Africa in the spotlight as the region that, by 2011, concentrated <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/resources/state-of-the-industry-results-from-the-2011-global-mobile-money-adoption-survey/">80% of all mobile money operations worldwide</a>. What became known as the “M-Pesa model” seemed to be Haiti’s ticket out of financial ruin; cellphones appeared to be the perfect substitute to the country’s ailing physical infrastructure. Even better, nearly every Haitian knew how to use one, and most households had at least one device — which could cost <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/wireless/why-haitis-cellphone-networks-failed">as little as $20</a> by 2010, down from $300 in the early aughts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Gates Foundation and USAID set a high bar for access to the award: at least 100,000 transactions in the first six months. Unsurprisingly, the two final winners were companies with big preexisting customer bases, Jamaica-based Digicel and its main competitor, U.S.-founded Voilà. In conjunction, the two giants covered <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/wireless/why-haitis-cellphone-networks-failed">over 3 million cellphone subscribers</a> on the island and would later merge to create Haiti’s most powerful fintech, MonCash.</p>



<p>MonCash’s overwhelming arrival onto the scene revealed something about its model that global fintech-watchers across the board had failed to realize. Mobile money operations in emerging economies in East Africa or Haiti didn’t succeed only because their approach was particularly innovative. Their success rather depended on very unique local contexts and their ability to scale up. “M-Pesa was based on something that Kenyans were used to: sending airtime to each other as a form of currency, instead of using transfer services like Western Union,” Erin Taylor, an economic anthropologist who researched the early days of mobile money in Haiti, told <em>Rest of World</em>. But the M-Pesa model would only truly experience success when it received backing from important transnational corporations. Subsequent studies have found that its business model depended on widespread adoption to become “<a href="https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-rctom/submission/m-pesa-a-mobile-money-success-story-from-kenya/">commercially viable,</a>” which turned out to be easier for a telecommunications company with <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/What-makes-a-successful-mobile-money-implementation.pdf">nearly 80% of market share</a>. The secret to Africa’s most successful fintech lay, not in its disruptive innovation, but rather in its alliance with Safaricom — a local subsidiary associated with telecommunications giant Vodafone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With massive telecommunications behind them, both M-Pesa and MonCash were able to rely on established telecommunications networks to process transactions at virtually no cost for end users. Selling a mobile-based service to millions of customers was no problem to the tried-and-tested companies. With an established consumer base, players like MonCash could make their services as widespread as possible. Those already using Digicel’s services as an operator could easily join its digital wallet and carry out transactions with acquaintances — likely Digicel users as well. Deploying its considerable resources, Digicel positioned agents in Port-au-Prince and other Haitian cities and explained electronic money to customers, by distributing <a href="https://books.google.com.br/books?hl=pt-BR&amp;lr=&amp;id=ve01DwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=m-pesa+%22haiti%22&amp;ots=t_xq0zUTUk&amp;sig=Nv2DSJBcI57hLz25qwEyJGk0XCE&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=m-pesa%20%22haiti%22&amp;f=false">pamphlets and comics about it in local Kreyol</a>, soon meeting the transaction target set by the Gates Foundation and USAID.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model’s <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/capturing-the-promise-of-mobile-banking-in-emerging-markets">mass adoption</a> made the giant players bigger but left little room for underdogs, like HaitiPay. To Elie’s great dismay, it turned out that it wasn’t the “M-Pesa model” that promised success in the Haitian fintech scene: being first to market wasn’t enough, you had to be big. MonCash grew on the back of the Safaricom model, supported by the country’s main telecommunications giant. “People would ask if we were like Digicel,” Elie said to <em>Rest of World</em>. “But we were there before, you know?” The Digicel-MonCash fintech solution would go on to grow 15 times faster than Elie’s HaitiPay over the 2010s, reaching over 1.5 million Haitians to her 100,000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make matters worse, Elie wasn’t merely competing against big telecommunications companies. According to Haitian law, she wasn’t even allowed to take these giants on single-handedly. Any service that relied on electronic money had to operate under an establishment banking partner, so HaitiPay was forced to delay its launch, as it negotiated with its own competitors. She waited nearly two years to receive her stamp of approval from a partner, only to launch in an industry that had been taken over by telecommunications companies months prior. Making the best of a bad situation, Elie found a way to use her legally mandated partner to her advantage: when reaching out to potential customers, she would highlight the bank’s trusted and well-established brand, instead of presenting HaitiPay as a mere newbie.</p>



<p>Unfazed, she set up operations in a small office in Port-au-Prince, designing a tool that worked smoothly amid Haiti’s power outages and expensive internet. Though her system avoided dependence upon internet connectivity, HaitiPay still relied on a proper phone signal — provided, of course, by her telecommunications competitors, Digicel and NatCom. Companies reliant on mobile services, like hers, had to negotiate with the local duopoly to guarantee its operations ran smoothly. “You have to either marry one or the other,” Clifford Reginald Nau, who manages the tech incubator Alpha Haiti, told <em>Rest of World</em>. Elie married both, in order to guarantee that clients from both telecommunications companies could still choose her services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once Elie had painstakingly grown her clientele, HaitiPay would go on to benefit from the eventual crashing of the fintech wave in the Caribbean. The industry had become impossible to ignore, creating new <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/david-velez-nubank/">giants valued at $10 billion</a> and disrupting services from <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/okash-microlending-public-shaming/">microlending</a> to <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/now-serving-halal-apps/">digital banking</a>.

<p>Many frontend developers might see security as a non-functional concern, that is handled by the security department and that they instead should just focus on feature development. The reality is that learning about security actually <strong>forces you to gain knowledge</strong> about how the <strong>browser works</strong> thus it can <strong>make you a better Angular developer</strong> in general.</p>
<p>High-performing teams, in this day and age, are usually <a href="https://christianlydemann.com/the-three-building-blocks-of-elite-angular-teams/">autonomous DevOps teams</a> and use <a href="https://christianlydemann.com/implementing-continuous-delivery-through-five-steps/">continuous delivery</a> for faster feature delivery. This way of working is only possible if we, frontend developers, also take <strong>responsibility for the security</strong> as we build features.</p>

<p>This post aims to give you the know-how to&nbsp;<strong>build security into your feature development</strong>&nbsp;and become a better developer by gaining a higher understanding of the browser and security concepts that are relevant for Angular developers.</p>
<p>I will go through the&nbsp;<strong>OWASP top 10 security threats</strong>&nbsp;that relate to Angular development and explain how to mitigate each one in this post.</p>
<h2>What is OWASP top 10?</h2>
<p>The OWASP top ten is the top ten list of web security risks from the Open Web Application Security Project foundation. It consists of a group of security experts who release a top 10 list of relevant security risks every 3-4 years which many companies use to focus their security effort.</p>
<h2>OWASP 2013 to 2017</h2>
<p>The OWASP top ten has evolved through the years and has gotten rid of a couple of security risks, that are no longer relevant enough to make the top ten in the 2017 edition.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/owaspdocumen.png?zoom=2&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image result for owasp top 10 2020 vs 2017" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/owaspdocumen.png?zoom=2&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>Of these threats, the ones that relate to Angular development are:</p>
<ol><li><a href="#csrf">Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</a></li><li><a href="#sensitive-data-exposure">Sensitive Data Exposure</a></li><li><a href="#xxs">Cross-Site Scripting</a></li><li><a href="#using-components-with-known-vulnerabilities">Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities</a></li></ol>
<p>The other threats are mostly handled on the backend and are not covered in this post.</p>
<h2>Basic security concepts</h2>
<p>Let’s look at some basic security concepts to improve our understanding of how the browser works.</p>
<h3>Same-Origin Policy</h3>
<p>The same-origin policy (SOP) is a security concept <strong>that limits how one origin can interact with other origins</strong>.<br>An origin consists of a protocol, domain and port:</p>
<p><code>protocol://domain:port</code> eg. <code>https://google.com:443</code></p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="295" src="https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=1024%2C295&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=1024%2C295&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=300%2C86&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=768%2C221&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=600%2C173&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?w=1154&amp;ssl=1 1154w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=1024%2C295&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=300%2C86&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=768%2C221&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=600%2C173&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?w=1154&amp;ssl=1 1154w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=1024%2C295&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>In a same-origin policy, <strong>reads</strong> are typically <strong>prohibited </strong>across origins and <strong>writes</strong> are typically <strong>allowed</strong> across origins.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>What?</strong></td><td><strong>Mostly</strong> <strong>Allowed</strong>?</td><td><strong>Allowed</strong> <strong>Operations</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cross-Origin <strong>writes</strong></td><td><strong>Yes</strong></td><td>Links, redirects, form submissions</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cross-Origin <strong>reads</strong></td><td><strong>No</strong></td><td>None</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cross-Origin <strong>embedding</strong></td><td><strong>Yes</strong></td><td>Scripts, CSS, Images</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>SOP: What is allowed?</figcaption></figure>
<p>For <strong>writes</strong>, <strong>links</strong>, <strong>redirects</strong>, and <strong>form submissions </strong>are <strong>allowed</strong>. The general rule of thumb with SOP and cross-origin <strong>writes</strong> is; <span>everything that you can do with an <strong>HTML form</strong> is <strong>allowed</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><p>The general rule of thumb with SOP and cross-origin <strong>writes</strong> is; everything that you can do with an <strong>HTML form</strong> is <strong>allowed</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Reading</strong> from another origin is <span>not allowed per default</span> (more on CORS headers soon). Doing so will result in this error (you try to fetch from another origin):<br></p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/fdezromero.com/content/images/size/w2000/2019/02/cors-error.png?ssl=1" alt="Image result for cors error" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/fdezromero.com/content/images/size/w2000/2019/02/cors-error.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p><strong>Embedding</strong> is generally <strong>allowed</strong> when embedding scripts, CSS, and images thus are normally a common attack surface as well (as we will see later).</p>
<h3>Implicit and explicit authentication</h3>
<p><strong>Implicit authentication</strong> means the authentication is based on something the browser automatically (implicitly) sends on each request. This could be <strong>cookies</strong>, <strong>HTTP basic auth</strong>, and <strong>TLS client certificates</strong>.</p>
<p>The problem with this kind of authentication is, it is possible for an attacker, to do <strong>authenticated writes</strong> on behalf of a user if the servers are not explicitly protecting against this (eg. cross-site request forgery attacks, as we will soon see more about).</p>
<p><strong>Explicit authentication</strong> means manually (explicitly) sending the authentication token by the developer such as via an HTTP header. The most common way to do this is using <a href="https://christianlydemann.com/creating-an-openid-connect-system-with-angular-8-and-identityserver4-oidc-part-1/" data-type="post" data-id="106">OAuth bearer tokens</a> in the headers.</p>
<h3>Cross-origin resource sharing</h3>
<p>Cross-origin resource sharing is a mechanism, controlled by HTTP response headers on a server, for <strong>allowing origins to perform</strong> <strong>“non-HTML form compliant” requests</strong> to the server. On such a request, the browser will first do a <strong>preflight </strong>request, for loading the CORS headers and then do the actual request.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/729/1*JBbctZQfohc-YR6yUn_HMQ.png?ssl=1" alt="Image result for cors preflight" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/729/1*JBbctZQfohc-YR6yUn_HMQ.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>The browser <strong>automatically</strong> sends the <strong>preflight</strong> (OPTIONS), if this is a cross-origin non-form request, for reading the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header. The client will proceed with the actual request if the header is present and valid (needs to either contain the client’s origin or *).</p>
<p>Here’s an <strong>example</strong> <strong>preflight request</strong> and <strong>response</strong>:</p>

<p>A “non-HTML form compliant” request, is a request that <strong>contains custom headers</strong> and <code><strong>content-type</strong></code> other than the standard HTML form content types: </p>
<p><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>,&nbsp;<code>multipart/form-data</code>, or&nbsp;<code>text/plain</code></p>
<p>The best practice with cross-origin resource handling is to <strong>whitelist</strong> the origins, which are permitted to call the server instead of using wildcard *.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t</strong>: <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code></p>
<p><strong>Do</strong>: <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://somedomain.com</code></p>
<h2 id="csrf">Cross-Site Request Forgery</h2>
<p>CSRF attacks involve the attacker taking advantage of<strong> implicit authentication</strong> such as a <strong>session cookie</strong> to make you do an <strong>authenticated request to a site</strong>.<br>CSRF attacks are handled automatically by many frameworks and mechanisms such as CMS and OAuth2 so is no longer a big enough threat to make it in 2017 OWASP top ten but is still worth knowing how to mitigate against in Angular apps.</p>
<p>A typical CSRF attack involves an attacker hosting a site, which is <strong>doing requests to a target website</strong>, once we user visits the attacker site. This will work if the target site uses <strong>implicit authentication</strong> and the user is <strong>already authenticated</strong> on the target site (and there is no CSRF protection).</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vaadata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/CSRF_visio.jpg?ssl=1" alt="CSRF steps illustration" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vaadata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/CSRF_visio.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>Due to SOP this attack will only work when:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Write</strong> operation (can be GET or POST)</li><li><strong>Standard</strong> HTML <strong>form content types</strong>:<ul><li>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</li><li>multipart/form-data</li><li>text/plain</li></ul></li><li><strong>Implicit authentication</strong></li><li>Only <strong>standard headers</strong></li></ul>
<p>If the server contains <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code> we would only require implicit authentication to do a CSRF attack (did I tell you to not use wildcards with your CORS?) as non-standard headers and non-form content-type are what is causing a CORS preflight to be necessary.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>User visits attacker site, which performs a form request to <strong>bank.com</strong> in which the user is authenticated using a session cookie. The site can now trigger eg. a payment on behalf of the user’s account.</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>For the most part, CSRF is not a security threat anymore as <strong>most Angular apps use explicit authentication such as OAuth2</strong>.</p>
<p>If your app is using implicit authentication eg. using a cookie, then the simplest way to protect yourself against CSRF attacks is to:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Send a custom header</strong> on each request (client)</li><li><strong>Verify the custom header</strong> is present on each request (server)</li></ol>
<p>Because custom headers can’t be sent across domains without a CORS preflight this will protect you against CSRF if you are not using <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code>.</p>
<h4>1. <strong>Send a custom header</strong> on each request (client)</h4>
<p>Angular’s <code>HttpClient</code> <a href="https://angular.io/guide/http#security-xsrf-protection">automatically sends a X-XSRF-TOKEN</a> header on each request when performing a mutating request, such as POST.</p>
<h4>2. <strong>Verify a custom header</strong> is visible on each request (server)</h4>
<p>For Node Express servers, this is easily handled by the middleware <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/csurf.html">csurf</a> which will <strong>check for the CSRF header being present</strong> on each request.</p>
<h2 id="sensitive-data-exposure">Sensitive Data Exposure</h2>
<p>Sensitive data exposure is about having sensitive data read by an attacker, either while in transit, such as for a <strong>man-in-the-middle </strong>attack, or by tampering with the requested page eg. if the <strong>DNS is hacked</strong>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_lossless,ret_img,w_750/https://www.internetsecurity.tips/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-is-Sensitive-Data-Exposure.png?ssl=1" alt="sensitive data exposure" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_lossless,ret_img,w_750/https://www.internetsecurity.tips/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-is-Sensitive-Data-Exposure.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<h3>Man in the middle</h3>
<p>A <strong>man in the middle</strong> attack involves a <strong>mediating network device</strong>, that is able to read unencrypted data and tamper with the returned payload when a site is requested.</p>
<figure><img src="https://mikethetesternz.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mitm.jpeg?w=700" alt="Image result for sensitive data exposure" data-lazy-src="https://mikethetesternz.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mitm.jpeg?w=700&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>A man in the middle attack can occur even with HTTPS as we will see:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Requesting website</strong>, where <strong>first request</strong> per default is an <strong>http</strong> request</li><li><strong>Requests HTTP page</strong> on <strong>server</strong></li><li><strong>Server redirects</strong> to <strong>HTTPS</strong></li><li>Man in the middle <strong>requests HTTPS page</strong></li><li>The <strong>server responds</strong> with an HTTPS response</li><li>Interceptor <strong>rewrites HTTPS to HTTP</strong> and can <strong>inject</strong> <strong>malicious</strong> <strong>code</strong></li><li>The clients future requests are now <strong>HTTP</strong> can now be <strong>sniffed</strong> and <strong>tampered</strong> with by the <strong>man in the middle</strong></li></ol>

<p>The basic problem here is the <strong>first request is unencrypted</strong> and can thus be tampered with by the man in the middle.<br>There are two solutions to this; <strong>VPN</strong> and <strong>HSTS</strong> header.</p>
<p>VPN is not a security mechanism you can set up on your own site, so let’s focus on the <strong>HSTS header</strong>.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>The solution is to ensure that the <strong>first request is HTTPS</strong> by using <strong>HTTP Strict Transport Security</strong> <strong>headers</strong>.</p>
<p>To do this, you make your frontend server return a <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> header.</p>

<p>By setting the expire-time more than one year, and setting includeSubDomains and preload, the site will be part of the browsers preload list which is a <strong>hardcoded list in browsers</strong> ensuring the site will only be requested over HTTPS. You can check if your domain is in the preload list <a href="https://hstspreload.org/">here</a>. Otherwise, the clients will <strong>perform an HTTP</strong> <strong>request</strong> every time the <strong>HSTS header expires</strong>.</p>
<h3>Hacked CDN</h3>
<p>Hacked DNS involves the attacker getting control over a DNS server and is able to point domains to other servers eg. their own malicious website.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.imperva.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/02/DNS-Hijacking.png?ssl=1" alt="Image result for hacked dns" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.imperva.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/02/DNS-Hijacking.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>This malicious website might be, UI-wise, a clone of the original site but containing logic for eg. sniffing logins and credit cards.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>The solution to protecting your users against compromised DNS is to use the <strong>integrity</strong> attribute in the script tag, loading the DNS resource, which is a checksum mechanism to ensure the integrity of what the DNS serves:<br></p>

<p>Now you will get an error if the integrity is compromised in the CDN. This is supported by many DNS providers.</p>
<h2 id="xxs">Cross-Site Scripting</h2>
<p>Cross-site scripting is one of the most dangerous threats as it involves an <strong>attacker taking control over your app’s javascript</strong> by executing javascript from an input source in the app such as the <strong>data storage</strong> and <strong>URL</strong>.</p>

<p>Computer science teachers around the world are bestowing these superpowers upon the next generation of creators and builders. We built <a href="https://repl.it/teams-for-education">Replit Teams for Education</a> for them, and today we're officially taking Teams for Education out of beta. </p>

<p>Thank you teachers for beta testing Teams, for giving us invaluable product feedback, for helping one another out as part of a vibrant and diverse community of Replers, and for being a part of the history of computers.</p>
<p>William Gibson is famous for saying way back in 1992, that "the future is already here – it's just not evenly distributed." If we asked you a year ago, you may have said we were already living in the computer age, or even that we had been for decades. But then in early 2020 COVID-19 happened and everything went "remote" and we all took a collective leap even further into the future. Today it's more obvious than ever that for children (and adults!) to participate in the riches of the new economy, they need to be able to design, control, and program the machines that we all use all day, every day.</p>
<p>On this vision to build powerful &amp; approachable tools that expand access to computing superpowers, Replit raised a <a href="https://blog.repl.it/seriesa">$20 million Series A</a> at the start of 2020. We're using the funds both to make learning more engaging for teachers and students and also to make work more fun and creative for professional software developers. We believe that the same things that make programming easier for beginners will also unlock productivity for experts. And when students know that they aren't just in a sandboxed, toy environment, but instead can use real-world tools and collaborate in real-time with their peers, they'll learn better.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/multiplayerart.png" alt="replit multiplayer art"></p>
<p>We've been working towards this vision since Amjad and Haya started Replit in 2016. And the initial beta release of Teams for Education over the summer of 2020 was a major step forward in that direction. From the start, early adopters like Toni loved the real-time multiplayer collaboration with their students, seeing how Replit could transform their classrooms.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, March 1, 2021</em></p><p>When I was optimizing <a href="https://bytes.zone/posts/elm-csv-package-and-talk/">elm-csv</a>, I noticed that Elm's <code>String.startsWith</code> is implemented using JavaScript's <code>indexOf</code> method. It looks something like this:</p><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function </span><span>startsWith</span><span>(</span><span>haystack</span><span>, </span><span>needle</span><span>) {
  </span><span>return </span><span>haystack</span><span>.</span><span>indexOf</span><span>(</span><span>needle</span><span>) </span><span>=== </span><span>0
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>This strikes me as inefficient! Doesn't that mean that if <code>haystack</code> doesn't begin with <code>needle</code>, it'll still look through the whole string? That seems to waste a lot of cycles on work after we already know the result.</p><p>After thinking about it for a little bit, I imagined a faster way:</p><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function </span><span>startsWith</span><span>(</span><span>haystack</span><span>, </span><span>needle</span><span>) {
  </span><span>return </span><span>haystack</span><span>.</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>needle</span><span>.length) </span><span>=== </span><span>needle
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>But, I didn't know for sure if it would be faster, so I started measuring things. After a few benchmarks things were looking promising! I found that <code>String.prototype.slice</code> and <code>String.prototype.length</code> operate in more-or-less constant time, and that <code>===</code>, while not constant-time, is heavily optimized.</p><p><em>Hypothetically</em>, I thought, this means that a <code>slice</code>-based implementation of <code>startsWith</code> could run much quicker than scanning through the whole string with <code>indexOf</code>.</p><h2 id="chrome-uses-actual-magic-in-their-strings">Chrome Uses Actual Magic in Their Strings</h2><p>But just to make sure my intuition about <code>indexOf</code> being slow was correct, I decided to benchmark that as well. Specifically, I decided to benchmark how long browsers took to find a single character in a string that doesn't contain the character:</p><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>"abc"</span><span>.</span><span>repeat</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>).</span><span>indexOf</span><span>(</span><span>"d"</span><span>)
</span></code></pre><p>I expected that every time I multiplied <code>size</code> by 10, I should see roughly a 10x slowdown in operations per second. But then…</p><table><thead><tr><th>Browser</th><th>1 "abc"</th><th>10 "abc"s</th><th>100 "abc"s</th><th>1,000 "abc"s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chrome 88.0.4324.182</td><td>866,026,834</td><td>869,256,882</td><td>858,563,862</td><td>865,370,315</td></tr><tr><td>Firefox 85.0</td><td>43,557,275</td><td>44,947,174</td><td>41,059,919 (-8.65%)</td><td>16,831,928 (-59.01%)</td></tr><tr><td>Safari 14.0.1</td><td>49,240,581</td><td>34,661,639 (-29.61%)</td><td>7,162,615 (-79.01%)</td><td>877,449 (-87.75%)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Chrome has…&nbsp;NO REAL SLOWDOWN? WHAT? This data suggests that Chrome can find a substring in any length string in constant time. How is that even possible?</p><p>At this point, I felt pretty out of my depth, and decided I needed to ask my friend <a href="https://github.com/lukewestby">Luke Westby, Real-Life Computer Genius™</a>, what was going on. He knew right where to look and figured out that <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/dc712da548c7fb433caed56af9a021d964952728/src/strings/string-search.h#L194">Chrome has a special optimization for single-character search strings in <code>indexOf</code></a>. In other words, people have hand-tuned V8 over the years to go ridiculously fast in all sorts of situations, and this is one of them.</p><p>Well, OK, let's try finding some multi-character string instead. I used "nope", which doesn't trigger this optimization, but still fails to match "abc". Does that give us a result that matches my intuition?</p><table><thead><tr><th>Browser</th><th>1 "abc"</th><th>10 "abc"s</th><th>100 "abc"s</th><th>1,000 "abc"s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chrome 88.0.4324.182</td><td>885,211,831</td><td>863,845,523 (-2.41%)</td><td>849,821,335 (-1.62%)</td><td>837,391,727 (-1.46%)</td></tr><tr><td>Firefox 85.0</td><td>58,648,716</td><td>44,107,472 (-24.79%)</td><td>40,529,513 (-8.11%)</td><td>16,768,019 (-58.63%)</td></tr><tr><td>Safari 14.0.1</td><td>102,071,445</td><td>26,242,114 (-74.29%)</td><td>4,212,339 (-83.95%)</td><td>467,329 (-88.91%)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>That's <em>kinda</em> like what I expected, but Chrome is still incredibly fast at this! Well, OK, that's fine. Good for them. But at this point I got curious (and a little devious): how can I defeat Chrome's optimizations? What is the worst-case scenario that they can't possibly have handled already?</p><p>I tried to imagine the algorithm that you'd have to write to implement <code>indexOf</code> and came up with something like this:</p><ol><li>Look at the first character in <code>haystack</code>.</li><li>If it matches the first character in <code>needle</code>, look at the next pairs of characters in the two strings one by one.</li><li>If you get to the end of <code>needle</code> and they all match, you've found the index.</li><li>But if one pair doesn't match, you've got to start over at the next character in <code>haystack</code>.</li></ol><p>With that in mind, what's combination of <code>needle</code> and <code>haystack</code> would perform the worst? I think it's any pair of strings where <code>haystack</code> is all but the last character of <code>needle</code> repeated over and over. So, maybe a benchmark like this?</p><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>"abc"</span><span>.</span><span>repeat</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>).</span><span>indexOf</span><span>(</span><span>"abcd"</span><span>)
</span></code></pre><p>That can never succeed, but it'll make the browser do a lot of extra work reading the initially-matching "abc" over and over. Let's see the results:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Browser</th><th>1 "abc"</th><th>10 "abc"s</th><th>100 "abc"s</th><th>1,000 "abc"s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chrome 88.0.4324.182</td><td>877,221,230</td><td>863,929,216 (-1.52%)</td><td>688,398,676 (-20.32%)</td><td>125,023 (-99.98%)</td></tr><tr><td>Firefox 85.0</td><td>61,384,762</td><td>12,874,505 (-79.03%)</td><td>1,366,202 (-89.39%)</td><td>137,245 (-89.95%)</td></tr><tr><td>Safari 14.0.1</td><td>100,546,438</td><td>25,948,095 (-74.19%)</td><td>4,170,375 (-83.93%)</td><td>467,753 (-88.78%)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Finally, Chrome has similar performance to other browsers. I don't think this is representative of real workloads, but even so Chrome performs admirably. Hats off to the V8 team for this implementation, but honestly, it's good to know they're still mortal!</p><h2 id="comparing-the-implementations">Comparing the Implementations</h2><p>So now that we know more about the component pieces involved in this optimization (for example, knowing to avoid single-character test strings), we can check if <code>slice</code> actually gives us a real-world speedup. In setting this up, I decided to go for the middle of the road to try and benchmark the browsers under something that you can kind of squint at and think "yeah, that will probably happen reasonably often in real life." In this case, that meant setup looked like this:</p><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>haystack </span><span>= </span><span>"abc"</span><span>.</span><span>repeat</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)
</span><span>needle </span><span>= </span><span>"abc"
</span></code></pre><p>Then the <code>indexOf</code> and <code>slice</code> benchmarks looked like the code at the top of this post:</p><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>haystack</span><span>.</span><span>indexOf</span><span>(</span><span>needle</span><span>) </span><span>=== </span><span>0
</span></code></pre><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>haystack</span><span>.</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>needle</span><span>.length) </span><span>=== </span><span>needle
</span></code></pre><p>That gave me these results:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Browser</th><th>indexOf</th><th>slice</th><th>% Diff</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chrome 88.0.4324.192</td><td>871,312,454</td><td>870,810,291</td><td>-0.06%</td></tr><tr><td>Firefox 86.0</td><td>32,428,394</td><td>46,845,953</td><td>+44.46%</td></tr><tr><td>Safari 14.0.1</td><td>430,854,455</td><td>1,352,674,261</td><td>+213.95%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Note that Chrome and Firefox had released new versions between me testing <code>indexOf</code> and this test. I kept the old data here because it doesn't seem to have changed the performance, but I just want to be up front that the versions are different!</p><p>Anyway, that said: looks like a result within the margin of error for Chrome (around 0.4%), but a reasonable speedup for Firefox and a big win for Safari.</p><p>What does the failure case look like? (Same <code>haystack</code>, but <code>needle = "nope"</code>):</p><table><thead><tr><th>Browser</th><th>indexOf</th><th>slice</th><th>% Diff</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chrome 88.0.4324.192</td><td>874,951,212</td><td>854,116,367</td><td>-2.44%</td></tr><tr><td>Firefox 85.0</td><td>31,026,729</td><td>22,180,114</td><td>-28.51%</td></tr><tr><td>Safari 14.0.1</td><td>4,189,768</td><td>1,508,770,435</td><td>+35,910.83%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This time, Chrome has a slowdown greater than the measurement error, which surprised me! Same with Firefox, but to a larger degree. But the real story here is Safari, which can now do this operation over 1.5 billion times per second. <em>Billion!</em> What even!</p><h2 id="is-it-worth-it">Is It Worth It?</h2><p>So, with all that measurement done, is this optimization worth it? I'm actually not really sure. This is basically nothing in Chrome but means making some real performance tradeoffs in Firefox. And, even though it looks like a huge win in Safari, my claims can only be as strong as the underlying assumptions I'm making in choosing test data. So, just to be explicit about that:</p><ul><li>These benchmarks assume that <code>haystack</code> is a long-ish string (300 characters.) Many of the gains we see here are erased when the strings are short. Safari in particular, drops to only about a 100% gain in the failure case with a shorter string (I tested at 3, 30, 150 characters, all with similar results.)</li><li>The <code>needle</code> strings are neither a single character nor a worst-case scenario for <code>indexOf</code> performance.</li><li>Success and failure cases are equally likely. We can't make any assumption other than that at the runtime level, although we could make a good argument to switch this for individual applications. For example, we could choose to use <code>slice</code> in an application where we expected most checks on <code>startsWith</code> would succeed, since that's basically a wash in Chrome and much faster in Firefox and Safari.</li><li>We care about browsers based on global total share instead of splitting out into desktop or mobile. This is another area where you could make different decisions at the application level: if the users of your app skew more towards using Chrome or more towards Safari, this payoff for this optimization gets better or worse.</li></ul><p>Of course, if you can measure that your application <em>would</em> benefit from this optimization, go ahead and do it yourself! Calling <code>String.slice 0 (String.length haystack) === needle</code> has some overhead in Elm (due to equality having different semantics) but you may still able to get the majority of the benefits if your users are mostly using Safari or you're running iOS webkit views or something like that. Just make sure to actually measure it! Optimizations at this level can be helpful, but they're more often dwarfed by DOM stuff in the runtime.</p><p>As for me: at this point, I'm not going to make a PR to <code>elm/core</code> with this improvement, even I intended to when I set out. However, I found it interesting to look into these things, and I learned a lot about how strings are optimized in various browsers, so I'm gonna call it a win overall.</p></article></div>]]>

<br/>
March 2, 2021 | https://releaseapp.io/blog/why-kubernetes-is-so-hard | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://releaseapp.io/blog/why-kubernetes-is-so-hard">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Kubernetes (k8s) has been all the rage for the last few years because application orchestration has become a de facto table-stakes requirement for production workloads running containers. “Containerising” applications is <em>relatively</em> straightforward, and most DevOps engineers worth their salt can create a few Dockerfiles and build images in a pipeline that are ready to run. But where do you “run” your Docker containers? And which versions do you deploy? And how do all the containers talk to each other? This is where orchestration comes into play and where a few options are proposed by large vendors. There are two main options available at the time of this writing: Elastic Container Service (ECS) from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Kubernetes which is offered by all the Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS) providers, including even AWS.</p><p>The hope is that orchestration will allow companies to deliver their containerised applications to test and integration environments quickly and painlessly. The ideal scenario is that it “just works”, that is, you would snap your fingers and wait a few minutes before you see your application running in front of you. Ideally, you’d only need to specify the minimum information necessary to run your application: name, framework, dependencies, and so forth, preferably read out from existing configuration files you already have available. That’s the hope anyway.</p><p>Obviously, from the title, we are focusing on Kubernetes, mainly because it is available everywhere and mainly because the only <em>other</em> option is ECS which only proves the point of our thesis that Kubernetes is hard to use because AWS came up with their own solution that is <em>supposed to be</em> easier. But why is it so hard to use? How long would it reasonably take to get your application(s) running in K8s?? And why isn’t it easier?</p><h2 id="kubernetes-infrastructure-is-hard">Kubernetes Infrastructure Is Hard</h2><p>We always start with the infrastructure even though most companies wouldn’t build their own Kubernetes clusters themselves. If you were ever going to use a managed infrastructure service, K8s would be at the top of the list. I’m sure there are a few people who start up <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/" title="Minikube documentation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">minikube</a> on their laptops and say to themselves, “Wow, this is easy! I can do this myself!!” This reminds me of people who start up an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/current/get-started-elastic-stack.html" title="Elasticsearch getting started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Elasticsearch</a> container on their laptop and say, “Wow, we should implement this for our website!!” Fast forward to a production launch six months or a year later and the simple “We can do this ourselves” mantra turns into “I wish we didn’t have to do this anymore.”</p><p>If you were truly going to build your own Kubernetes cluster, you’d need to build all the control plane servers and services on your bare-metal or Virtual Machines (VMs) from an IaaS of choice, and then tie them all together with some fancy networking configuration to separate control-plane traffic from container traffic. You’d need to configure and run all of the control plane software and get them all talking to each other, running stably and monitored properly. Perversely, you’d be orchestrating the containers that orchestrate the application, but without a lot of orchestration! The fancy mirage that’s presented when you run minikube or Docker Desktop on Windows hides all the inception of running a container orchestration system using containers.</p><p>We haven’t even gotten to the complications of setting up ingresses (which are just nginx instances, usually) and load balancers that sit on top of or next to the control plane stack. A lot of the time, you’ll feel like you are creating a whole infrastructure just for your infrastructure to run (which isn’t unusual, but definitely doesn’t feel better than trying to orchestrate things yourself). We also haven’t gotten into the Role Based Authentication Controls and network policies that need to be set to support more than a single application or stack running in one cluster. The number of configuration points and server-side setups start to mount quickly and we haven’t even started orchestrating applications yet, which is the whole point of the orchestration system we’re supposed to be setting up.</p><p>And let’s suppose that you really do wade out into this deep North Atlantic Ocean of huge waves and death-inducing freezing waters, and build yourself a production-worthy ship that can orchestrate your containers into an actual application. You look back up at your calendar and it’s been six months or a year since you started, and you’re just now deploying a control plane that says, “Hello World!” You think you’re successful and you’re about to celebrate when you check the releases section on the website and now you have a new version of k8s to deploy!!!</p><p>I hear what you’re saying, “We’re <code>large company</code> and we have <code>lots of</code> DevOps engineers who are <code>top decile</code> of engineering talent in the whole world. We can handle all the heavy lifting. You’re just a whining, jealous baby.” I see you, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDm9iNkLyPI" title="Datadog on Kubernetes presentation video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Datadog</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqXVKneP0Hg" title="Ticketmaster presents the keynote at Kubecon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ticketmaster</a>. (By the way, your accusations of jealousy might be correct. At the end of my good friend Justin Dean’s keynote speech where he shows the slides with all the team members, my picture should have been up there — but I had left the team two years earlier.) For everyone else, we all just decide to not spend six months or a year trying to build our control plane and start up our IaaS provider’s managed service and cross our fingers and pray.</p><h2 id="k8s-yaml-aint-markup-language">K8s YAML Ain’t Markup Language</h2><p>If you’ve skipped ahead and just started up a managed k8s cluster, you’re still in for a long and tedious journey wading into a deep sea of confusing YAML. YAML is to text what James Joyce’s <em><a href="https://www.finwake.com/1024chapter1/fw01.htm" title="Read Finnegan's Wake by James Joyce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Finnegan’s Wake</a></em> is to English. If you close one eye, use only your left pinky and right thumb to follow some brail, put your feet into ballet’s fifth position, and then recite World War II codes under your breath, then you will easily see that YAML is quite a breeze to comprehend. Once you get the hang of it, it’s like riding a bicycle over a frozen lake on centimeter-thin ice with rabid wolves chasing you. It’s as easy as trying to crash the Ancient Aliens cocktail party held in Fort Knox on gold smuggling days.</p><p>Look, it’s not actually that hard, right? Let’s say a guy walks up to you on the street. He’s a k8s expert and he’s going to show you how easy the “hello world” web service deployment is. The conversation goes like this:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>Him: “kind: Deployment”</span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>You: “Oh, I see.

You can use v1 as of k8s 1.9.</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>It’s actually removed in 1.16, but I wonder how many people have never</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>updated.”</span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>Him: “Start over.”</span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>You: “Wat.”</span></p><p><span>14</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>Him: “kind: Deployment”</span></p><p><span>16</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>You: “Stop with the Kinds everywhere!”</span></p><p><span>18</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span>Him: “apiVersion: apps/v1”</span></p><p><span>20</span><span></span></p><p><span>21</span><span>You: “This again.”</span></p><p><span>22</span><span></span></p><p><span>23</span><span>Him: “spec:”</span></p><p><span>24</span><span></span></p><p><span>25</span><span>You: “Huh??”</span></p><p><span>26</span><span></span></p><p><span>27</span><span>Him: “selector:”</span></p><p><span>28</span><span></span></p><p><span>29</span><span>You: “No.”</span></p><p><span>30</span><span></span></p><p><span>31</span><span>Him: “matchLabels:”</span></p><p><span>32</span><span></span></p><p><span>33</span><span>You: “Wat.”</span></p><p><span>34</span><span></span></p><p><span>35</span><span>Him: “app: nginx”</span></p><p><span>36</span><span></span></p><p><span>37</span><span>You: “That’s nearly the first thing I’ve understood about this so far.”</span></p><p><span>38</span><span></span></p><p><span>39</span><span>Him: “spec:”</span></p><p><span>40</span><span></span></p><p><span>41</span><span>You: “Again?”</span></p><p><span>42</span><span></span></p><p><span>43</span><span>Him: “containers:”</span></p><p><span>44</span><span></span></p><p><span>45</span><span>You: “Okay, now we’re getting somewhere.”</span></p><p><span>46</span><span></span></p><p><span>47</span><span>Him: “image: nginx:1.14.2”</span></p><p><span>48</span><span></span></p><p><span>49</span><span>You: “Hmm.”</span></p><p><span>50</span><span></span></p><p><span>51</span><span>Him: “ports:”</span></p><p><span>52</span><span></span></p><p><span>53</span><span>You: “Aiiiiieeee.”</span></p><p><span>54</span><span></span></p><p><span>55</span><span>Him: “containerPort: 80”</span></p><p><span>56</span><span></span></p><p><span>57</span><span>You: “I’m going home.

Try reading two k8s yaml examples and then generate one yourself from scratch. Even better, every day try a <a href="http://codekata.com/" title="Practice a code kata daily" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">code kata</a> practice of writing working and deployable configurations to Kubernetes.</p><p>I DARE YOU.</p><h2 id="copy-paste-aint-code">Copy Paste Ain’t Code</h2><p>I’m still chuckling over the previous section. I have to chuckle because this is the daily pain of my day-to-day existence and facing that pain directly is like standing in front of a bus being driven by Keanu Reeves on the freeway. The only thing that keeps my nose going back to the grindstone is the realization that working with NodeJs would be worse. The problem is that the Kubernetes docs are pretty good. You copy-paste some hello world examples and the outputs look like they work. You start to get pretty good at using kubectl. You can see vague shapes and outlines in YAML. You’re starting to gain confidence that you might be able to do something useful.</p><p>“Let’s try to move our application into Kubernetes!” you yell into the air as you emerge dripping wet from your bathtub wrapped only in a towel, like <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-archimede/" title="Learn about the Archimedes fable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Archimedes</a> sprinting through the streets of Syracuse. “We’ll just copy-paste some sections from here and here and put them there and there, and we’ll have our app running in no time,” you breathlessly explain to your coworkers. “Does it work?!” they excitedly ask. “Not yet. I mean, no. I need to indent the section and remove one piece that is not used in this spec. Then I need to decide if we use a deployment or a daemonset, but it’s almost there. I swear!”</p><p>First of all, put on some clothes. I’m all for taking a bath while thinking about kubernetes YAML files, but you need to get dressed afterward. Also, if you drop your Macbook Air into the bath with you, the results can be electrifying. I know. Second, here’s a riddle for you: how many YAML files do you think you need to run and deploy your application? Good thing that some people have ten fingers and ten toes because that’s probably how many you’ll need. And they’re all related but not really. You can copy-paste sections around if you’re adventurous and gullible, but you have no idea if the sections are compatible. There are only four required fields, all of which are gibberish, and everything goes under <code>spec:</code> (including <code>spec:</code>). Most of the sections are duplicated but only slightly. They vary microscopically in ways that matter macroscopically.</p><p>Copying and pasting is a wonderful art, and I’ve personally worked my entire adult career that way. I gleefully admit my whole output in life is like a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteNote" title="Example of a Ransome Note trope from movies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ransom note</a> cut from stack overflow and documentation examples.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Taproot is a proposed upgrade to Bitcoin which will bring several new features and benefits to Bitcoin users. The Bitcoin community is hoping to activate Taproot in the near future, although its activation path is still unclear.</p>
<p>The Taproot upgrade is actually composed of three <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/b/bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip/">Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)</a> which define three distinct upgrades to the Bitcoin protocol: Schnorr Signatures, Taproot, and Tapscript. However, these three upgrades are known as the Taproot upgrade, and BIPs 340, 341, and 342 are often collectively referred to as BIP Taproot. Together, these upgrades introduce new, more efficient, flexible, and private ways of transferring bitcoin.</p>
<h2 id="schnorr-signatures">Schnorr Signatures</h2>
<p>BIP 340 introduces Schnorr signatures for use in Bitcoin. Schnorr signatures will bring several benefits to Bitcoin users, including superior privacy, lower fees, and more flexible multisig.</p>
<p>This BIP also specifies how Schnorr public keys and signatures are to be encoded for use in Bitcoin. Public keys used for Schnorr signatures are 32 bytes long, compared to ECDSA’s 33-byte public keys. Additionally, Schnorr signatures are 64 bytes long, compared to ECDSA signatures, which range from 70-72 bytes. These small space savings offer fee savings to Bitcoin users who adopt Taproot.</p>
<p>➤ <a href="https://river.com/learn/what-are-schnorr-signatures/">Learn more about Schnorr signatures.</a></p>

<h2 id="taproot">Taproot</h2>
<p>While BIP 340 defines the specification for generating and encoding Schnorr signatures and public keys, BIP 341 defines how Bitcoin’s protocol will integrate Schnorr signatures. Specifically, Bitcoin Script must be updated to also evaluate Schnorr signatures. Taproot also integrates <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/m/merkelized-alternative-script-tree-mast/">Merkelized Alternative Script Types (MAST)</a>, which allow users to lock outputs to multiple scripts.</p>
<div>

  

  
  <p><img src="https://river.com/learn/images/icons/lightbulb.svg" alt="Key Fact: Pay-to-Taproot outputs are version 1 SegWit outputs, and all Taproot transactions are SegWit transactions."></p><p>
    Pay-to-Taproot outputs are version 1 SegWit outputs, and all Taproot transactions are SegWit transactions.
  </p>
  
</div>
<h2 id="pay-to-taproot-p2tr">Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR)</h2>
<p>Taproot also introduces a new script type, a way of spending bitcoin. Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) allows users to pay to either a Schnorr public key <strong>or</strong> the <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/m/merkle-root/">Merkle root</a> of a variety of other scripts. Using this new script type, a user can create a UTXO which can be unlocked and spent by either the owner of the private key or anyone who can satisfy the requirements of any script within the Merkle tree.</p>
<h3 id="key-aggregation">Key Aggregation</h3>
<p>Schnorr’s key aggregation feature enables this flexible functionality. When bitcoin is sent to a P2TR output, it is locked to a single public key, called Q. However, this public key Q is actually an aggregation of a public key P and a public key formed from the Merkle root of many other script types. Any of the alternative scripts in the Merkle tree can be used to spend the output.</p>
<p><img src="https://river.com/learn/images/articles/taproot.png" alt="Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) allows users to send bitcoin to either a public key or multiple scripts of their choosing. This preserves privacy and space on the blockchain."></p>
<p>This design allows users to choose between complex, arbitrary scripts as well as simple pay-to-public-key functionality at the time of spending, rather than at the time of receiving. It also makes all Taproot outputs look similar. Because multisig outputs, single sig outputs, and other complex smart contracts all look the same on the blockchain, many chain analysis heuristics will become unusable, preserving privacy for all Taproot users.</p>
<h2 id="tapscript">Tapscript</h2>
<p>In order to implement P2TR transactions, BIP 342 adds and updates several <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/o/opcode/">opcodes</a>. These new scripts are used to verify Taproot spends and Schnorr signatures, and they are collectively known as Tapscript.</p>
<p>Tapscript was designed to maximize future flexibility of P2TR spending in order to allow for upgrades which are not yet foreseen.</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-taproot">The Benefits of Taproot</h2>
<p>The Taproot upgrade offers many benefits to Bitcoin users who adopt Taproot as well as those who do not. The introduction of Schnorr signatures offers significant benefits to privacy and security, but Taproot and Tapscript also bring advantages of their own.</p>
<p>➤ <a href="https://river.com/learn/what-are-schnorr-signatures/#the-advantages-of-schnorr-signatures">Learn more about the benefits of Schnorr signatures.</a></p>

<h3 id="space-savings">Space Savings</h3>
<p>Most Taproot (P2TR) outputs consume less space on the blockchain than normal <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/p/p2pkh/">P2PKH</a> or <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/p/p2wpkh/">P2WPKH</a> outputs. This is mostly due to the fact that P2TR outputs lock bitcoin directly to a public key, not the hash of the public key. This makes sending to Taproot outputs slightly more expensive, because public keys take up more space than public key hashes. However, spending Taproot outputs is significantly cheaper because the public key is included in the scriptPubKey, and thus does not need to be included in the <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/s/script-witness/">ScriptWitness</a>.</p>
<p>Taproot also defined the encoding scheme for Schnorr public keys and signatures, making them shorter than their ECDSA counterparts, providing additional fee savings.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-benefits">Privacy Benefits</h3>
<p>The privacy implications of Taproot are perhaps the most important part of the upgrade. By introducing Schnorr signatures and key aggregation, multisignature contracts no longer look different from single signature contracts, providing privacy to all Taproot users.</p>
<div>

  

  
  <p><img src="https://river.com/learn/images/icons/lightbulb.svg" alt="Key Fact: Since the Lightning Network relies on 2-of-2 multisig, Taproot makes it impossible to discern which transactions create Lightning channels."></p><p>
    Since the Lightning Network relies on 2-of-2 multisig, Taproot makes it impossible to discern which transactions create Lightning channels.
  </p>
  
</div>
<p>Taproot also introduces significant privacy benefits through the integration of MAST. As discussed above, Taproot allows bitcoin to be locked to many scripts at once. However, when spending bitcoin from a Taproot output, the spender need not reveal every possible script that could have unlocked the bitcoin; only the script which they actually used. In the majority of cases, Taproot users will likely use the pay-to-public-key option, allowing them to keep any backup options they might have planned private.</p>
<h3 id="security-upgrades">Security Upgrades</h3>
<p>On a technical, theoretical level, Schnorr signatures are considered more secure than ECDSA signatures because Schnorr signatures are provably secure using fewer assumptions. Like all elliptic curve cryptography schemes, both ECDSA and Schnorr rely on the assumption that the Discrete Logarithm Problem is hard. However, ECDSA relies on additional assumptions in order to guarantee its security. Nonetheless, there have been no examples of ECDSA being systematically compromised during Bitcoin’s existence.</p>
<p>Schnorr signatures also eliminate any signature <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/m/malleability/">malleability</a> that might have been present in ECDSA signatures. While transaction malleability was solved by the SegWit upgrade, malleability of signatures persisted as a feature of ECDSA.</p>
<h2 id="taproot-activation">Taproot Activation</h2>
<p>As of now, Taproot is still a proposed upgrade, and has not yet been activated on the Bitcoin network. When an upgrade to Bitcoin is proposed, it is first discussed by the developer community. Once the proposal is formalized, it is assigned a BIP number. After the code is written, reviewed, tested, and merged, Bitcoin node operators must decide how and when to activate the upgrade.</p>
<p>The Schnorr, Taproot, and Tapscript upgrades were given BIP 340, 341, and 342 in January of 2020, and have been under discussion and development since. In late 2020, the code implementation for all three upgrades was completed, tested, reviewed, and merged to Bitcoin Core.</p>
<p>As it currently stands, all of the necessary code exists to implement Taproot on an up-to-date Bitcoin node. Now, the community must decide on whether and how to activate Taproot and start enforcing the new consensus rules. There are several methods for activating upgrades to Bitcoin, so the community must first select a path and then execute it.</p>
<h3 id="bitcoin-activation-paths">Bitcoin Activation Paths</h3>
<p>BIP 8 and BIP 9 define two popular methods for activating upgrades. Both processes begin by surveying Bitcoin miners for support. If an overwhelming majority of miners signal their support through messages in the blocks they mine, the upgrade is activated. The difference between BIP 8 and BIP 9 arises if miner support is insufficient. In that case, BIP 9 specifies that the upgrade should not take place, while BIP 8 specifies that the upgrade should be activated after a delay period.</p>
<p>Variants of these two proposals have been put forward in the context of Taproot activation. However, the Bitcoin community has overwhelmingly supported Taproot, and very little criticism has been raised. Thus, the specific activation path is likely insignificant.</p>

With the rank of captain, he commanded&nbsp;the Animation Department of the Air Forces' First Motion Picture Unit.</p>  <p>There, he&nbsp;wrote propaganda and military training films including&nbsp;<em>Design for Death, </em>which won an Academy Award,<em>&nbsp;</em>and the animated&nbsp;<em>Private Snafu&nbsp;</em>series, which starred Mel Blanc.</p>  <p><span><span><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/It3Bgm59mT0" frameborder="no" title="YouTube content" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span></span></p>  <p>Seuss's political themes also stretched into his post-war children's books. Minear points out the clear references to Japan in&nbsp;<em>Horton Hears a Who,&nbsp;</em>which was published after Seuss&nbsp;visited Japan in 1953.</p>  <p>"[The passage] 'A person's a person no matter how small'" was "clearly a reference to Japan," he explained.</p>  <p>"And, there's a [vulture]&nbsp;named Vlad Vladikoff [who represents]&nbsp;the Russians, and&nbsp;their monkeys, presumably representing Red China."</p>  <p>He also mentions&nbsp;Yertle the Turtle,&nbsp;who initially "had a Hitler moustache," and the Sneetches from&nbsp;<em>The Sneetches and Other Stories</em>, who are a commentary on antisemitism due to the stars on some of their bellies.</p>  <p>Seuss included these themes in his books because he believed that children's literature was an extension of satire.</p>  <p>"Children's literature as I write it and as I see it is satire to a great extent – satirizing the mores and the habits of the world," <a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190301-the-surprisingly-radical-politics-of-dr-seuss">he said.</a></p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written and produced by Mouhamad Rachini.&nbsp;To hear more from Richard Minear,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcasts/current-affairs-information/day-6/" target="_blank">download our podcast</a>&nbsp;or click Listen above.</em></p>  <p><em>You can access all of Dr. Seuss's political cartoons by&nbsp;visiting <a href="https://library.ucsd.edu/speccoll/dswenttowar/index.html#intro">UC San Diego's Special Collections &amp; Archives website</a>.</em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It has been about 5500 years since the wheel, one of the most genuine engineering wonders, was invented. The paper is about 2200 years old. The electricity is about 140, transistors reflect 100 years. Only 60 years have passed since the years when software engineering in its own form was known as engineering. Computer scientist and engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)" target="_blank">Margaret Hamilton</a> used the term “Software Engineering” for the first time while building navigation systems for Apollo missions. First master’s degree program in computer engineering at Seattle University took place in 1979 and the ADA Programming Language first appeared in 1980. The Rochester Institute of Technology opened its first bachelor’s degree programme in software development in 1996. The IEEE version of <a href="https://cs.fit.edu/~kgallagher/Schtick/Serious/SWEBOKv3.pdf" target="_blank">“Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK)”</a> was published in the same year, 1996.</p><p>When compared to other engineering branches of human culture, computer engineering is a very young discipline. Yet, in history, no other engineering division has evolved so rapidly including the subjects it affected. Engineering devices like sonar, magnetic navigation, photoreceptors have benefited positively from this discipline. The predictability of the world of the other branches was what distinguished software engineering from other engineering branches. Software engineering continued to evolve as a discipline that has to be applied to a world where the laws of physics have changed weekly.</p><p>The only resource I had for the integration of a security dongle for a distribution business was the dongle manufacturer’s user manual at my desk and an email address to contact them when needed. It was a great experience for me to develop this application, because I would be able to transfer this knowledge that I have learned to my colleagues, or to share with other engineers that need it. And that information was of great importance. But now, the platforms like Google and StackOverflow etc simplified things with copy and paste which we do a lot. Now we don’t need to explicitly code algorithms that include calculus, trigonometry, and differential equations. We ought to be more relaxed, maybe. We couldn’t relax, though. Because the challenges faced by current software engineers have become more complicated and demands have risen for an average software engineer. They need to know the topics such as “Cross Platform”, “Asynchronous method”, “Security”, “DevOps”, “Distributed Systems”, “Asynchronous Process”, “Data Processing”, “Microservice Architectures”, “Domain Driven Development”, “Reactive Programming”, “Test Driven Development”, “Test/Data-intensive Development Environments”, “Containers”, “Orchestration Tools” and even more. Products can now be built to be open to millions, not as before, to a small number of consumers. An engineer who has no knowledge of TCP/IP literally writes a back-end service that runs on the Microservice Architecture on a DevOps-supported project without being aware of the cloud systems, is now a market-wide non-preferred engineer. They can save the day, but it won’t take long.</p><p>Years ago, I recall when using Kylix in an ERP development team for a company, I wrote an updater to get the final version of the executable file for the client from the internal network each time the application is started. It was so unusual and exceptional even for an engineer to be online all the time. The offline use of software and offline individuals are extraordinary and exceptional today.</p><p>Developing a new programming language, having knowledge about PL paradigms, writing a compiler or an interpreter were very idealist and romantic endeavours. The people who did these were the heroes of the academic world and they were the people of distinction. However, now, this situation can sometimes even be a weekend hobby of a young developer. There are dozens of new programming languages coming to the market every year, and some have set themselves up for learning a new programming language every year. Things are changing constantly, often unpredictably.</p><p>Each computer engineer has his/her own reason to choose this career. Some have made this decision according to the blowing wind, others have lost themselves in the magic of computers from a very young age, and some have believed they were just going to earn some money or status. There are also those who choose this career, either with the pressure or encouragement from their families, or temptation to choose the most difficult departments of college to join.</p><p>Nevertheless, if you have taken steps in this engineering discipline in some way, and you want to make yourself someone people always want to cooperate with, you have to be aware that it is critical to react quickly to uncertainty. And I strongly believe that you have to feel the pressure first in order to succeed.</p><p>In order to remain valuable in the industry for a long time, without compromising, it is important to aim at grasping certain engineering concepts. Here are some highlights that changed and not changed from these engineering notions which can make you important today:</p><h4 id="things-that-changed">Things that changed</h4><hr><h5 id="time-optimisation">Time Optimisation</h5><p>The paradigms are evolving so rapidly. Improving your ability to recognise what one needs to be specialised in is important. For example, recognising that knowledge of distributed VCS systems is now a must, and being competent and adequate about it, but determining if Git is the instrument that is supposed to be chosen “today”. I put “Time Optimisation” at the beginning of the list, because distinguishing important from unimportant and deciding how to spend your time are the most significant skills in the industry today. It’s a remarkable subject to be able to operate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank">Pareto Principle</a> effectively.</p><h5 id="deep-focus">Deep Focus</h5><p>It takes deep work and focus to be able to see a complicated system or a story in terms of simple parts or to make them simple. As technology progresses, anyone who does not develop this skill will probably be left behind. Staying in deep focus amongst distractions like mobile notifications, funny YouTube videos and WhatsApp messages, will be the one of the most distinguishing soft skills in the years to come.</p><h5 id="soft-skills">Soft Skills</h5><p>Although experience is even more relevant at times when access to information was difficult, now, at t=0, an engineer can reach any technological or architectural information easily. Just because some developers have stored this historical information (or a boutique knowledge) in a custom knowledge hierarchy, companies do not have to bear their bad personalities. Software engineers with zero social skills are going extinct. Engineers, who are cocky and whose communication skills are not developed, are not preferred by companies regardless of their technical level.</p><h5 id="knowledge-of-upcoming-technologies">Knowledge of upcoming technologies</h5><p>I’m talking about the people who try and put aside new technology/libraries/tools and move on. Trying <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/736475" target="_blank">Alpha Preview/CTP/Beta</a> and the latest technologies you see coming up, libraries, tools, devices and reading some articles/manuals makes you much more efficient, desirable, searched and valuable now compared to the old days.</p><h4 id="things-that-didnt-changed">Things that didn’t changed</h4><hr><h5 id="continuous-and-fast-learning">Continuous and Fast Learning</h5><p>Challenges are very volatile and something new can come up at any time, unpredictably. Learning about something often implies expense, so it’s better to move early in order to break through the learning curve. Remember: “The more you know, the more advantages and differences you get.” Don’t say “I’ll learn it when the time comes.” It is imperative to attend conferences, monitor hot topics in universities, to join the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/" target="_blank">IEEE</a> and/or <a href="https://www.acm.org/" target="_blank">ACM</a>, to become active and to expand the information network. It is necessary to review papers and be active in local organisations. There are engineers who instinctively do it right. But being able to express the theoretical context is also important.</p><p>In every software engineer’s reading list, these books should also be included:</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670" target="_blank">Code Complete</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary/dp/0135957052/" target="_blank">Pragmatic Programmer</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/" target="_blank">Clean Code</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-patterns-elements-reusable-object-oriented/dp/0201633612/" target="_blank">Design Patterns</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Refactoring-Improving-Existing-Addison-Wesley-Technology/dp/0134757599/" target="_blank">Refactoring</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-3rd/dp/0321934113" target="_blank">Peopleware</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959/" target="_blank">Mythical Man Month</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Computer-Science/dp/3030542556" target="_blank">Algorithm Design Manual</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Pearls-Joe-Bentley/dp/8177588583" target="_blank">Programming Pearls</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Electrical-Engineering/dp/0262510871/" target="_blank">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a></p><h5 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the scenes</h5><p>It is also a challenge to go to the root cause and behind the scenes to grasp languages, libraries and paradigms. You have to understand evolution and the history. For instance: Why does React.js have such popularity? To understand this, the individual must first understand the history and evolution of Javascript, how DOM works, and how DOM manipulation makes sense and why it is so common. The chronological cause and effect relationship helps to better understand the technology in question, as well as to understand whether to spend time in that technology or not. <strong>So, it is not important to use them, what is really important is to know what they are good for.</strong></p><h5 id="fundamental-principles-and-context">Fundamental Principles and Context</h5><p>It is critical to internalise the concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" target="_blank">SOLID</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern" target="_blank">Design Patterns</a>, General Principles (KISS, DRY, GP etc.), Modularisation Principles (Model Principle, Information Expert etc) and more (from <a href="https://github.com/HugoMatilla/The-Pragmatic-Programmer" target="_blank">Pragmatic Programmer Principles</a>). One has to be aware of data structures and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space%E2%80%93time_tradeoff" target="_blank">space and time trade-off</a>s. It is not only important to know the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-vs-array/" target="_blank">difference between Arrays and LinkedList</a>, but to explain the implementation of hash tables and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4980757/how-do-hashtables-deal-with-collisions" target="_blank">handle collisions</a>. One needs to be familiar with the entire <strong>programming stack</strong>, hardware (CPU + memory + cache + interrupts + microcode), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code" target="_blank">binary code</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler" target="_blank">compiler</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)" target="_blank">interpretation</a>, <a href="https://erkut.me/%7B:target=%22_blank%22%7D" target="_blank">garbage collection</a>, problems such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79923/what-and-where-are-the-stack-and-heap" target="_blank">heap - stack</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address" target="_blank">memory addressing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture)" target="_blank">multi-threading</a>, concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization_(computer_science)" target="_blank">synchronisation</a>. It also seems that knowledge of the network protocols, automated/functional/load and UI tests will remain critical and necessary to be a successful and wanted engineer for a long time in the industry.</p><h5 id="failure">Failure</h5><p>And learning how to cope with failure. (If you’ve never failed, you haven’t really tried.) Personally, however, I believe that not all mistakes can be equally forgiven. Lessons learned should be interpreted emotionally-free, and then …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><span>The</span> ever-increasing reliance on touch screens in cars is a controversial topic. With each new product release, the comment sections of articles and youtube videos are filled with negative remarks. Yet, carmakers are totally committed to the race of creating ever-bigger screens. If public opinion is so against touch interfaces in cars, why do car companies use them? I dove into this topic and confirmed my hypothesis: touch screens are not the problem per se, but car companies' design execution is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Touch screens in cars are not new. In fact, the first production car fitted with a touch screen was the 1986 Buick Riviera.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CRT touch display was not that bad, but it took some decades before touch screens were good enough to be widely adopted in cars. After Tesla launched the Model S with its 17" touch screen, carmakers have been eager to design increasingly bigger touch screens. Today, it is an exception if a car is not fitted with one. There are many reasons why this is happening. To dive into those, we first have to define the different types of interactions that occur while driving and how they evolved over time.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Classifying the Interactions</h2>
<p>Aside from the essential driving controls, like steering and braking, I split the interactions into three groups.
The first set is the primary interactions. They include all the functions that are directly related to driving and safety. Examples are monitoring the speed, turning on the indicators, and operating the windscreen wipers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The secondary interactions are actions that occur frequently but take little time to accomplish. These can be changing the music volume, changing cabin temperature, or turning on the airconditioning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tertiary interactions are the opposite of the secondary ones. They are infrequent but require a high cognitive load and take longer to accomplish. Examples are filling in a destination in the navigation system or changing personal settings in the car.</p>

<h2>The Evolution of the Interactions</h2>
<p>Over time, these sets of interactions have evolved in mostly the same way. The interior of the Volkswagen Golf is an excellent demonstrator. The first generation Volkswagen Golf has a simple interior. The primary actions are limited to two gauges, some buttons, and a stalk for the indicators. The same goes for the secondary settings, consisting of three sliders to control the temperature and some volume controls. The only tertiary interaction is to find and set a radio channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the years, you can clearly see the impact of innovation on the interactions. With each generation, more features are added to the interior.</p>

</video> 
<p>All three sets of interactions increase in quantity, even the primary ones. In the Golf, for example, instead of some basic gauges and controls, the latest generation's primary interactions now also include adaptive cruise control, speed limit warnings, and a range of other safety systems. Even something as simple as turning on the windscreen wipers or lights has increased in complexity with different modes, sensors, and settings.&nbsp;</p>

  </figure>
<p>Similarly, the secondary controls include countless different ways to set the right cabin temperature. There are buttons for heated seats and windows, airconditioning, individual climate control, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the real visible change is an exponential increase in tertiary interactions. Whereas in the first generation Golf, you can only choose a radio station, today there is an endless list of radio channels, streaming services, and podcast platforms. And that is just the media. Almost all cars come with navigation systems, phone connections, and internet-connected apps. All of these can be set up and configured to fit your personal taste. For example, you can choose the exact color of the interior lights, how heavy the steering should be, and which information should be shown in the cluster display.</p>
<p>Initially, all these interactions were controlled via indirect, physical controls. But over time, with each generation, the display grows in size, and the number of physical controls decreases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest generation Golf is another important step because even the secondary interactions are not moved to the touch interface. Most of the physical buttons that remain are the ones that are legally required.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2001, BMW launched iDrive, one of the first in-vehicle infotainment systems. It was designed around indirect interactions via a controller close to the gear lever. At the time, it was a good balance between available technology, cost, and usability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over time, just like most in-car infotainment systems, BMW adjusted iDrive for use with touch interaction as well. Why did they decide to include touch interaction in the later version?</p>
<h2>Usability</h2>
<p>A lot of it has to do with the increasing complexity of tertiary interactions. As the number of these interactions increases with each generation, indirect controls seem to perform worse than touch interaction, especially in two areas: task completion time and adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research has shown that tertiary tasks are performed significantly faster via touch interactions when compared to indirect controls <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. Even compared to other possible interaction techniques like gesture interaction and voice interaction, touch interaction performs equal, if not better <sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. </p>
<p>Naturally, task completion time is only one way to measure the success of an interaction model. Touch screens score differently when it comes to visual attention, lane deviation, reaction time, and others. Carmakers have to weigh the time it takes to complete the tasks versus the gravity of the distraction. In a lot of scenarios, touch interactions are the preferred method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second solid argument is the adoption rate of touch interfaces. Once drivers enter their cars, their focus is on driving and not on learning a new system. So one way to decrease driver distraction is to make the interaction as close to other familiar digital products as possible. As such, touch screens are preferred over indirect controls.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Aesthetics</h2>
<p>The next reason why car makers use touch screens has to do with decluttering. It is a term that is often heard in design departments. It means to reduce the visual overload or perceived complexity of the interior. Getting into a car and seeing a dashboard full of buttons gives a busy, overwhelming look. Instead, a calm-looking interior with few buttons has a positive impact on comfort and perceived quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, many customers relate a big touch screen to a technologically advanced car. As an interior designer, you don't want your car to be perceived as old-fashioned so fitting a giant screen shows your brand is futuristic.</p>
<h2>Cost</h2>
<p>Compared to a dashboard full of different buttons, knobs, and screens, a single touch screen is a much more straightforward part to design, spec, and maintain. Therefore, carmakers may prefer to fit a standardized touch screen instead of a range of custom buttons and knobs because of the development cost.&nbsp;
Another advantage is the possibility to modernize the interior of the car by updating the UI design. Digital design trends move much faster than interior design trends. Tesla has shown that updating the interface of the Model S helps to delay an expensive redesign or new model introduction because the car looks less outdated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Design-wise, the main arguments in favor of touch screens are task completion time and adoption. But there are plenty of ergonomic downsides.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Usability</h2>
<p>In mobile environments, like cars, the users' primary focus is on controlling the vehicle. So touch interfaces not only have to be usable and accessible, but they also have to ensure road safety. As discussed before, even though task completion time is the fastest with touch interaction, there are other driver distraction measures where touch interaction is not the preferred method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of those is visual attention. When interacting with a touch screen, drivers need to move their visual attention from the road to the screen to find the object they want to select. Furthermore, they have to coordinate their finger to that object without any tactile objects guiding it. With physical controls, much less visual attention is needed to perform the interaction, leading to less distraction <sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>.
What is the impact of this difference in visual attention between touch controls and indirect controls? Experiments have shown that reaction times are slower, and there is a higher variance in driving behavior like lane departure and maintaining speed <sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other disadvantages are the lack of haptic feedback when selecting an object and the display's placement, which is a trade-off between readability and reachability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is important to consider that there is no perfect solution for an interaction model of tertiary interactions that is easy to operate and not distracting. Carmakers should choose the 'least bad' solution in this case and design around its shortcomings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When weighing the positives with the drawbacks of touch screens, they are the right solution for tertiary interactions in most cases if they are optimized for task completion time <sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>. The problem, though, is that currently, few of the interfaces are. This has much to do with the design choices of car companies.</p>

  <p>This post is a PSA on the somewhat unintuitive way <code>Field.choices</code> works in Django.</p>

<p>Take this Django model definition:</p>

<p>If we open up a shell to manipulate them, we can easily create a <code>Book</code> with a given status choice:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>$</span> <span>python</span> <span>manage</span><span>.</span><span>py</span> <span>shell</span>  <span># with ipython installed

<p>The <code>choices</code> list constrains the value of <code>status</code> during <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/instances/#validating-objects">model validation</a> in Python:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]:</span> <span>book</span> <span>=</span> <span>Book</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

<p>This is great for <code>ModelForm</code>s and other cases using validation.
Users can’t select invalid choices and get messaging about what’s wrong.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s still easy for us, as developers, to write this invalid data to the database:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>6</span><span>]:</span> <span>book</span><span>.</span><span>save</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Woops!</strong></p>

<p>It’s also possible to update <em>all</em> our instances to an invalid status in one line:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>8</span><span>]:</span> <span>Book</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>=</span><span>'republished'</span><span>)</span>
<span>Out</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>]:</span> <span>1</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So, what gives?
Why does Django let us declare the set of <code>choices</code> we want the field to take, but then let us easily circumvent that?</p>

<p>Well, Django’s model validation is designed mostly for forms.
It trusts that other code paths in your application “know what they’re doing.”</p>

<p>If we want to prevent this, the most general solution is to get the database itself to reject bad data.
Not only will this make your Django code more robust, but any other applications using the database will use the constraints too.</p>

<p>We can add such constraints using <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/constraints/#checkconstraint"><code>CheckConstraint</code> class</a>, added in Django 2.2.
For our model, we need define and name a single filter <code>CheckConstraint</code>, in <code>Meta.constraints</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>Book</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>status</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>CharField</span><span>(</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>}</span><span> - </span><span>{</span><span>Status</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>status</span><span>).</span><span>label</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>

    <span>class</span> <span>Meta</span><span>:</span>
        <span>constraints</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
            <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>CheckConstraint</span><span>(</span>
                <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"%(app_label)s_%(class)s_status_valid"</span><span>,</span>

            <span>)</span>
        <span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code>Q</code> object represents a single expression we’d pass into <code>Model.objects.filter()</code>.
Constraints can have any amount of logic on the fields in the current model.
This includes all kinds of lookups, comparisons between fields, and database functions.</p>

<p>Running <code>makemigrations</code>, we get a migration that looks like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>django.db</span> <span>import</span> <span>migrations</span><span>,</span> <span>models</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Migration</span><span>(</span><span>migrations</span><span>.</span><span>Migration</span><span>):</span>

                <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"%(app_label)s_%(class)s_status_valid"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>),</span>
        <span>),</span>
    <span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If we try to apply this while the database contains invalid data, it will fail:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>python manage.py migrate
<span>Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: core

    return Database.Cursor.execute(self, query, params)
django.db.utils.IntegrityError: CHECK constraint failed: status_valid</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If we clean that data up manually and try again, it will pass:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>python manage.py migrate
<span>Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: core

<p>From that point on, the database won’t allow us to insert invalid rows, or update the valid rows to be invalid:</p>

<p>Great!</p>

<p>Currently Django doesn’t have a way of showing these <code>IntegrityError</code>s to users in model validation.
Nothing will catch and turn them into <code>ValidationError</code>s which can carry user-facing messages.
As per the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In general constraints are not checked during <code>full_clean()</code>, and do not raise <code>ValidationError</code>s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s an <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30581">open ticket #30581</a> to improve this.</p>

<p>In our case, since we are still using <code>choices</code>, this is okay.
Validation already won’t allow users to select invalid statuses.</p>

<p>For more complex constraints, we might want to duplicate the logic in Python with a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/validators/">custom validator</a>.</p>

<p>Check constraints are really neat.
Having the data constrained at the lowest level possible gives us the strongest guarantees of its quality.</p>

<p>I hope this post helps you consider using them,</p>

              <p>Dr. Laurent Michel is a FusionAuth community member and product owner at Softozor. He chatted with us over email about how he and his team are using FusionAuth to meet their auth needs.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><em>This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> Tell me a bit about your work as a developer, software architect and product owner as well as what softozor does.</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong>  Softozor is a very little company made up by me, my brother and a few friends. Currently, we work together in our free time. We are mostly physicists and mathematicians. My brother and I work in software development companies. Our friends are teachers. One of the goals of the Softozor company is to produce educational video games. In order to achieve that goal, we need money, which we are trying to earn with software development projects. Currently, we are developing an ecommerce platform helping craftsmen to sell their products and make them visible in the regions they are living in. A craftsman can be a farmer, a caterer, a baker, a butcher, etc.</p>

<p>I am the company’s official leader. I energize the roles of developer, architect, and product owner. I am the only one team member with the product owner role. The roles of developer and architect are taken by other members of the team. Every architectural decision is discussed in the team so that we get as much insight as possible into the possible problems that we might face during the development. This way we also spread the knowledge of everyone across the whole team.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I essentially develop in C++, C# (.Net / WPF), javascript (VueJs), and python (mainly to write acceptance tests).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ease of installation and the set of features were the most decisive motivations to use [FusionAuth].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> Is the craftsman site live? Can you share the URL?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong>  Yes, the <a href="https://www.ameising.ch/">craftsman site is live</a>, in a reduced form. In the near future, it will show our customers all the shops we are managing. Currently, no shop is shown yet but they will soon pop on the map that we see on the homepage. The platform is not a traditional e-shop. It manages multiple e-shops where each e-shop has multiple tenants. What you see today is just kind of our crowd-funding: we sell baskets of vegetables, fruits, bread, etc. Also, the project you see on that URL targets Switzerland.</p>

<p>The codebase we’ve come up with, however, will be used to produce other e-shopping solutions, not necessarily located in Switzerland.</p>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> How do you use FusionAuth? OAuth? User management? Social sign-on? Something else?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong> The development of our platform is proceeding slowly. We integrated FusionAuth last year to the platform’s admin panel. It is planned to be integrated to the e-shop as well, but that is not a priority. We use FusionAuth for user management. It produces JWTs for us which are then consumed by our hasura API. It is very important to us that FusionAuth provides permission management features. Also JWT lambdas are critical for us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The] documentation is outstanding…</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> How do you use the lambdas? Is it to inject custom permissions (admin, seller, buyer) or for some other use?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong>  In order to be able to issue requests to our hasura API, it is sometimes necessary to have a JWT. JWTs that are compatible with hasura need special data containing the user’s allowed roles and id, among other things. Here’s a sample populate function that we use in our system:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>populate</span><span>(</span><span>jwt</span><span>,</span> <span>user</span><span>,</span> <span>registration</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> 
  <span>jwt</span><span>[</span><span>'</span><span>https://hasura.io/jwt/claims</span><span>'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>'</span><span>x-hasura-allowed-roles</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>jwt</span><span>.</span><span>roles</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'</span><span>x-hasura-default-role</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>jwt</span><span>.</span><span>roles</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span>
    <span>'</span><span>x-hasura-user-id</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In our software, JWTs are used on the admin frontend, where the craftsmen can define their inventory, shop managers can monitor sellings, etc. On the shop itself, we are not using JWTs yet, because we aren’t supporting customer accounts yet, which would be the only use case where JWTs would be useful. Indeed, the whole shopping frontend is generated following the JAMStack philosophy. Therefore, the sensitive information is gathered from the hasura API with special rights on our CI/CD server and injected into the shop frontend whenever necessary. That leaves users of that frontend with (almost) no way to hack into our API.</p>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> What problems did we solve for you? And how were you solving them before FusionAuth?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong> You solve the permission management problem. You provide us with a reliable way to generate JWTs that are compatible with hasura. It’s the first time where we had to integrate an authorization and authentication system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Both [the .NET and python SDKs] saved us a lot of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> Why did you choose FusionAuth over the competition?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong> We evaluated a few options: keycloak, keratin/authn, and FusionAuth. The ease of installation and the set of features were the most decisive motivations to use your software. Its documentation is outstanding, and that also helped a lot in choosing FusionAuth.</p>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> How much time and money would you say FusionAuth has saved you?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong> It saved a lot of time. If we agree that time is money, then it saved us a lot of money too. We could’ve implemented a reduced set of the features provided by FusionAuth, but that would’ve taken a lot of time. We could’ve chosen another solution other than FusionAuth and implemented the missing features, but again that would’ve been a killer. I’d say it saved us something like one man-year of time.</p>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> How do you run FusionAuth (k8s, standalone tomcat server, behind a proxy, etc)?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong> We run FusionAuth on a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster. It is completely hidden behind our hasura api. We write hasura actions that interact with FusionAuth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’d say it saved us something like one man-year of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> Can you tell me a bit more about the hasura actions?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong>  Our system is based on the 3-factor app pattern: realtime graphql API, reliable eventing, and async serverless. That is out-of-the-box hasura behavior.</p>

<p>When relevant data is changed in our database, some events are triggered, which results in calling some serverless functions (e.g. in our system we use OpenFaaS). In addition to that, we can complete the GraphQL API automatically generated by hasura with additional queries / mutations, which are known as “hasura actions”. For example, the automatically generated API does not come out with a login mutation. Either you route the login request from your frontend to FusionAuth directly or you decide that you have a central API over which everything should go.</p>

<p>We chose the latter variant, as we find it both clearer and cleaner. In that case, we had to define a hasura login action. That amounts to telling hasura what the mutation looks like: what name, what input, what output, and then link that mutation with a serverless function. In that context, we are very happy to use the .Net SDK provided by FusionAuth! It has all the necessary REST client wrappers necessary for us to perform the operations we need on FusionAuth.</p>

<p>We are also very happy to use the python SDK in our acceptance tests. We use it to fill up the users database with the necessary credentials to then interact with our system under test.</p>

<p>Both SDKs saved us a lot of time.</p>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> Any general feedback/areas to improve?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong>  I think it would be great if FusionAuth could produce <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/paseto">Pasetos</a>. I know everyone on the web uses JWTs, but those are very easy to handle in an insecure way. They are insecure by default, whereas Pasetos are secure by default. <em>[Ed note: We have an open feature request for <a href="https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/773">paseto support</a>.]</em></p>

<p>For our use-cases with hasura, it would not bring anything right now (see <a href="https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/3205">this issue</a>) but I can imagine that they could be useful in the near future.</p>

                <h3>Git in 10 commands to do 99% of gitting and keeping out of trouble</h3>
                
            </p>

            <p>Git is hard, probably harder than it needs to be but I have been using it for about 5 years and have a workflow that works for me. I use git from a command line and have learnt how to use these ten commands. If I need to deal with a merge conflict, I use VS Code and the gitlens extension. If I need to do anything else then I probably copy out the files I want to keep, reset my local repo or delete it and clone a new repo then paste back the files I want to include in the change.</p>
<h2 id="starting-a-new-piece-of-work">Starting a new piece of work</h2>
<p>This requires creating a new branch. We want to checkout master, make sure it is up to date and then create a new branch:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout master
</code></pre>
<pre><code>git pull
</code></pre>
<pre><code>git checkout -b new_branch_name
</code></pre><p>Now, if the checkout or the pull fail then I will likely do a git stash to throw away any local changes:</p>
<pre><code>git stash --include-untracked
</code></pre><p>If I still can't pull from master it is probably because I have commits that I don't want on the remote master. I will probably clone a new version of the repo:</p>
<pre><code>rm -rf repo (or mv repo oldrepo)
</code></pre><p>then</p>
<pre><code>git clone git://url
</code></pre><p>then I will create the new branch:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b new_branch_name
</code></pre><h2 id="committing-work">Committing Work</h2>
<p>I have done my work and want to commit it, either to then push to the remote repo or to add more work later on.</p>
<pre><code>git add .
</code></pre><p>I very rarely want to only add a subset of files, if I do then I will put the full path to the file to add:</p>
<pre><code>git add ./folder/folder/folder/file.ext
</code></pre><p>Once I have added the files I will check what state I am in:</p>
<pre><code>git status
</code></pre><p>What I am looking for is a) I have remembered to checkout a branch and am not working on master and b) that I have got the files ready to commit that I expect.</p>
<p>If I forgot to create a branch, then I will stash everything, checkout the new branch then pop the changes into the new branch:</p>
<pre><code>git stash --include-untracked
git pull
git checkout -b new_branch_name
git stash pop
</code></pre><p>&nbsp;
I realise you could just do a <code>git checkout -b</code> but I like to keep it simple and keep my branch up to date.</p>
<p>If I have the correct files in my list of staged files then I will commit the files:</p>
<pre><code>git commit -m "message"
</code></pre><p>If there are files that I don't want to check it, maybe I fat fingered a change to a file I didn't want I will either fix it up manually or checkout the original version of the file:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -- ./folder/folder/folder/file.ext
</code></pre><p>and then I will commit the files I do want.</p>
<h2 id="sharing-my-changes">Sharing my changes</h2>
<p>When I am ready to push my changes to the remote repo, I do a git push:</p>
<pre><code>git push
</code></pre><p>This always fails the first time I run it but the output shows the command I do need to run. I copy and paste that output and push my changes.</p>
<h2 id="red-green">Red Green</h2>
<p>From here, if I need to make any changes I go and do that, add the files, commit that changes and push them until I am done. If there have been changes on master I don't have then I will bring them locally:</p>
<pre><code>git pull origin master
</code></pre><p>origin is the name of the remote, if you aren't sure what it is do:</p>
<pre><code>git remote --v
</code></pre><p>If you get a merge conflict then open the directory in VS Code. Make sure you have gitlens installed as an extension in VS Code and then use the file explorer to find the files that are a bluey colour. When you have found the files with a conflict, open them and browse to the sections with the conflicts and VS Code will let you either keep the incoming change (the changes already on master), keep your local changes (the changes you just made) or keep both. VS Code does a pretty good job of merging the files.</p>
<p>Once you have fixed the merges then go back to add, commit, push.</p>
<h2 id="finish">Finish</h2>
<p>Lastly checkout master and pull down the latest changes:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout master
</code></pre><p>Then check for any branches that can be deleted and get rid of them. <code>git branch</code> shows all the local branches:</p>
<pre><code>git branch
</code></pre><p>If you no longer need a branch then:</p>
<pre><code>git branch -D branch_name
</code></pre><p>and shazam, the branches gone. You are now back at master, ready to start the merry-go-round again.</p>
<p>If you read this, scoffed and went “oh you could have done it like x” well great, I am sure there are loads of efficiencies to make here but this works for me so I am happy with my git choices.</p>
<h3 id="more-help">More Help</h3>
<p>For help with specific scenarios: <a href="https://dangitgit.com/en">https://dangitgit.com/en</a></p>
<p>(and the ten commands to stop you having to count and proove me wrong):</p>
<ul>
<li>git pull</li>
<li>git checkout</li>
<li>git stash</li>
<li>git add</li>
<li>git commit</li>
<li>git branch</li>
<li>git push</li>
<li>git clone</li>
<li>git status</li>
<li>git remote</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>Thousands of years ago one of your ancient ancestors was enjoying the spoils of a recent hunting trip when suddenly a saber toothed tiger jumped out of the bush. &nbsp;Your cave man relative had a choice, fight off the tiger or drop the food and run. &nbsp;They ran….and they ran fast. &nbsp;The human brain is an amazing thing, it has evolved over the eons to help us survive. &nbsp;Most of those eons involved surviving physical threats where flight over fight was often the smart choice.</p>
<p>The financial “threats” we face in the 21st century are diametrically opposed to the physical threats of ancient times. &nbsp;Stock market crashes, unlike hungry saber toothed tigers, often present opportunities as opposed to imminent death. &nbsp;My very simple example here downplays the complex neurobiology of the human brain that drives us to make poor financial decisions, but the end result is the same:&nbsp; humans are hardwired to be poor investors.</p>

<h2>Brief Review of Financial Neurobiology</h2>
<p>In addition to “fight or flight”, there are a host of other <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2470/rflr.v3.n1.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented and studied cognitive psychological human tendencies</a> that impede our ability to be rational investors.&nbsp; Here is a high level list provided by the CFA Institute.</p>
<p>•Overconfidence and overoptimism—investors overestimate their ability and the accuracy of the information they have.</p>
<p>• Representativeness—investors assess situations based on superficial characteristics rather than underlying probabilities.</p>
<p>• Conservatism—forecasters cling to prior beliefs in the face of new information.</p>
<p>• Availability bias—investors overstate the probabilities of recently observed or experienced events because the memory is fresh.</p>
<p>• Frame dependence and anchoring—the form of presentation of information can affect the decision made.</p>
<p>• Mental accounting—individuals allocate wealth to separate mental compartments and ignore fungibility and correlation effects.</p>
<p>• Regret aversion—individuals make decisions in a way that allows them to avoid feeling emotional pain in the event of an adverse outcome.</p>
<h2>What is a Pea-brained Human to do?</h2>
<p>I am by no means an expert on all of the ways our brains fail us with our finances.&nbsp; My opinion is that some people are wired well for today’s financial world, these lucky ones are winners of Warren Buffett’s “Ovarian Lottery.”&nbsp; Unfortunately, I believe the vast majority of us are vulnerable to these behavioral traps.&nbsp; But there is hope.&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as species go we as humans are uniquely gifted with intelligence and logic, two tools that we at engineered portfolio believe you can use to combat your cave man brain and become a successful investor.&nbsp; Becoming a successful investor, like most things in life, requires thoughtful planning and hard work.&nbsp; The below suggestions work in tandem with one another, reinforcing each other, you need them all to have a proper mind set to tackle Mr. Market.&nbsp; For those of you who don’t know Mr. Market go read, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials/dp/0060555661/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507565929&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=intelligent+investor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Intelligent Investor</a>” by Benjamin Graham RIGHT NOW!</p>
<h3>Understand History</h3>
<p>When faced with a major market correction how do you feel?&nbsp; As the panic sets in what are the thoughts going through your brain?&nbsp; What should be going through your brain is that this is normal stock market behavior and you know this because you have studied the history of the stock market!&nbsp; To date, the stock market has always recovered from every down turn, every depression and every panic.&nbsp; Sometimes it rebounds quickly, sometimes it takes decades to come back.&nbsp; But it always has come back.&nbsp; If we are the unlucky generation to see our stock markets completely crumble and be worthless it probably means we are in the midst of some kind of zombie apocalypse so you have bigger things to worry about than your portfolio.&nbsp; In fact your cave man brain might actually be more useful to you in this scenario!</p>
<p>I am not saying blindly buy and hold stocks and white knuckle your way through the ups and downs.&nbsp; NO!&nbsp; But understanding the stock market history will help you both build, adjust and stick to your plan.</p>
<p>Here is some basic history but I strongly urge you to read as much about stock market history as possible to arm yourself with the data you need.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/1287761-how-often-does-s-and-p-500-have-10-percent-and-20-percent-negative-price-moves" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The stock market has 10% and 20% corrections VERY often</a>.
<ul>
<li>In the last 30 years 10% corrections have occurred an average of 2.27 times per year</li>
<li>In the last 30 years 20% corrections have occurred an average of 0.73 times per year</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stocks can be extremely over valued (optimism) or undervalued (pessimism) and prices tend to revert to a “mean”</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended Reading:</p>
<p>William J. Bernstein’s “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Four-Pillars-Investing-Building-Portfolio/dp/0071747052/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1519584544&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=four+pillars+of+investing">The Four Pillars of Investing</a>“.&nbsp; Pillar #2 is the history of investing.&nbsp; It is only about 20 pages, however I recommend reading the entire book.</p>
<p>Benjamin Graham’s ” The Intelligent Investor.”&nbsp; Chapter 3 covers a century of stock market history (up to 1972).&nbsp; I really enjoy <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials/dp/0060555661/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1519585168&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+intelligent+investor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Zweig’s offering</a> which has Mr. Graham’s original text alongside some more modern commentary.&nbsp; It really shows the durability of Graham’s teachings.</p>
<h3>Look FORWARD to a Market Crash…..WHAT?!</h3>
<p>I should add a note to that title, look forward to <strong>AND BE PREPARED FOR</strong> a market crash.&nbsp; This might seem a little crazy, but this is the mindset you should have, you want to flip fear on its head.&nbsp; If you are a current purchaser of stocks and if you believe that in the end, the price level of the market ends up where ever it is going to end up, it is generally better for you if stock prices are lower today.&nbsp; This plays into knowing your history.&nbsp; In order to buy into a falling market you have to have confidence that the market will rebound.&nbsp; Also, in order to buy into a market you need money!&nbsp; When you have un-invested cash and you are armed with historical knowledge you start to look forward to when you can deploy that cash….you can’t wait for the market to drop!</p>
<p>I have two pieces of advice here:</p>
<p>#1 – Always have at least 10% of your invest-able assets in non stock assets (bonds, cash, gold etc).&nbsp; Ideally you would have 10% cash ready to deploy in a downturn.&nbsp; You can’t take advantage of a downturn in stocks if you don’t have the resources.</p>
<p>#2 – WARNING:&nbsp; Some people will hate this advice.&nbsp; It is generally a good idea to always have 6 months expenses saved in cash.&nbsp; If you believe your job is safe I recommend putting up to 50% of your cash reserves into the market during a correction.&nbsp; I would recommend putting 20% in after a 10% correction, if the market continues to fall I would put another 30% in after a 20% correction.</p>
<h3>Automate Your Financial Life – Save!</h3>
<p>Whether it is paying bills or saving for retirement I highly recommend automating your financial life.&nbsp; At this point I spend less than 5 minutes a month paying bills or transferring money, it is all automated.&nbsp; Inertia, distraction, fear and sometimes just laziness can get in the way of making smart financial decisions.&nbsp; One of the smartest financial decisions you can make is to SAVE!&nbsp; Don’t tempt fate, automate your savings where you can.&nbsp; This is one of the big benefits of employer 401(k) plans, the money comes out of your paycheck without any work on your part.&nbsp; If you want to fund an IRA, set up an automatic monthly transfer from your checking account, it becomes mindless.&nbsp; I fund my taxable&nbsp;<a href="https://www.robinhood.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood</a> account with an automatic $100 transfer every week.&nbsp; If you don’t know what Robinhood is I strongly recommend you check it out as it plays into my next piece of advice, control what you can control.&nbsp; Fee’s are one of the biggest things you can control.</p>
<h3>Control What You Can Control – Fees</h3>
<p>I hate fees.&nbsp; This is a little off topic as far as behavioral finance is concerned, but I never want to miss an opportunity to say how much I hate fees!&nbsp; Any rational and logical person should want to reduce their financial fees as much as possible.&nbsp; You will reach your financial goals much sooner if you keep your fees low.&nbsp; Please have a read on the corrosive nature of investment fees in <a href="https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/03/11/the-corrosive-nature-of-investment-fees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another blog I wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Advice:&nbsp; For a taxable stock account check out <a href="https://www.robinhood.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood</a>, no costs to buy or sell!</p>
<p>Advice:&nbsp; When buying mutual funds or ETFs never pay more than 0.30%, ideally pay 0.10% or less.&nbsp; I find <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/list#/mutual-funds/asset-class/month-end-returns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanguard</a> consistently offers low cost funds.</p>
<p>Advice:&nbsp; If your 401(k) plan only has high fee options, get some fellow concerned co-workers together and petition your human resources department to make improvements.&nbsp; They are fiduciaries for you and should be very receptive to your concerns about high fees.</p>
<h3>Control What You Can Control – Asset Allocation</h3>
<p>Again, this plays into understanding history.&nbsp; Asset allocation is the “mix” of different types of investments you hold.&nbsp; If you are unfamiliar with asset allocation I suggest you check out this <a href="https://engineeredportfolio.com/2016/08/01/asset-allocation-and-the-efficient_frontier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a>.&nbsp; A proper asset allocation can help behaviorally on a number of fronts.&nbsp; First, a good asset allocation should minimize risk for a given level of return.&nbsp; The less risk you need to take the less likely you are to succumb to your cave man brain.&nbsp; Second, like understanding the market history, understanding the benefits of a good asset allocation will give you confidence and resolve through market turmoil.&nbsp; My partner Steve has done some amazing work on this website on really smart and unique asset allocation.&nbsp; Asset allocation is what an engineered portfolio is all about!</p>
<p>Advice:&nbsp; Read all of <a href="https://engineeredportfolio.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve’s blogs</a>.&nbsp; Check out the <a href="https://engineeredportfolio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engineered portfolios</a> that Steve built.</p>
<h3>Unique Advice – Check Your Accounts at Least Weekly, Ideally Daily</h3>
<p>This is financial blasphemy to many.&nbsp; The current thinking in the world is that since you have these behavioral weaknesses you should compensate for them by avoiding your finances.&nbsp; The thinking is that you will do something stupid if you look at them.&nbsp; I don’t disagree…..assuming that you look at them infrequently and if you only look at them when the financial world seems to be falling apart.&nbsp; This is exactly what happens.&nbsp; People are going through their lives:&nbsp; family, work, friends, vacations etc.&nbsp; They don’t really pay much attention to Wall Street or their investments.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden there is a major …</p></div></div>

Suddenly, from a corner of your consciousness, a voice speaks, "Oi dummy! Test the performance! What if this makes the app slower?!"</p><p>You frown. You squint at the screen thinking of what to do. Then you shrug saying, "Ah well! I'll do it at the end," and type away adding feature after feature without a worry. <strong>No! Stop!</strong></p><p>Performance matters. Speed matters. <strong><em>Do it now!</em></strong> Do you really want to use an app that lags and stutters every time you click a button. EVEN IF it has a thousand features? Remember how you'd get frustrated each time Microsoft Office took 10 seconds to load? What about Adobe Photoshop? Firefox?&nbsp;</p><p>And oh how you'd jump in excitement every time an app on your super epic computer just&nbsp;<strong><em>snapped open</em></strong> in a blink. Oh I see you shaking your head saying, "But...but...that feature!"</p><p>Let's try something. Open your terminal/console and copy a file from your home/user directory to a folder inside a folder in your Documents.</p><p>Now do the same from your File Manager.</p><p>See the difference? How much faster it is from a terminal. Just one command and viola!</p><p>"But...but...but that's different!" I hear you say.</p><blockquote><p>Performance is fundamentally about how long it takes you to perform an action, <em><strong>any</strong></em> action.</p></blockquote><p>Oh but it isn't! Performance isn't only about loading speed. It's not only about rendering and latency and all that stuff. No. Performance is fundamentally about how long it takes you to perform an action, <em><strong>any</strong></em> action. An app could be super snappy but still take 5 seconds to perform an action from thought to result.</p><p>You see that is how performance is defined.&nbsp;How long will it take a user to go from <em>thinking of doing an action</em> to <em>actually seeing the result</em>? What if that logout button was buried ten layers deep? How about if copying a file required you to open 3 sub-menus? Do you think that's performant?</p><p>Now before you go and benchmark each and every line of your code, listen.&nbsp;<strong>Listen!</strong> Breathe. Yes, speed matters but if you miss your deadline it is&nbsp;<strong><em>your</em></strong> performance that needs to be improved. So be clever.</p><blockquote><p>Because sometimes...<em>less is more.</em></p></blockquote><p>Ship <em>fewer</em> features. Write <em>less</em> code. Make <em>less</em> views. Do <em>less</em> navigation. Add <em>less</em> animations. Interrupt the user <em>less</em>. All those will improve both&nbsp;<strong><em>your</em></strong> and&nbsp;<em><strong>your product's</strong></em> performance. Ship&nbsp;<em>faster. </em>Build <em>faster.</em> That's what matters because sometimes...<em>less is more.</em></p><h2>It's Not Only About Code</h2><p>See that person on his phone scrolling through this blog post thinking how he'll make the fastest X? How long do you imagine it'll take him to build such a thing? A couple of hours? Months? Days? Years? Weeks? Do you think&nbsp;<em>he&nbsp;</em>is&nbsp;<em>performant?</em></p><p>You raise your hands in the air frustrated. "WHAT! This guy has gone crazy! Why does it matter how long it takes to build something <em>fast</em>?"</p><p>&nbsp;Let me tell you something. If it takes you a month to get that line of code to execute in under a micro-second; you lost millions of microseconds. Time is the currency in this world. If something is slow <em>don't ship it</em> instead of spending a month trying to make it faster because you are trading <em>your </em>performance for <em>your product's.&nbsp;</em>If you ship late you have&nbsp;<em>less&nbsp;</em>time to do&nbsp;<em>more.</em></p><blockquote><p>Don't ship slow features fast nor fast features slow.</p></blockquote><p>What if you shipped that fast code in time? What if you didn't spend a month making it fast? What if&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>did it&nbsp;<em>faster?</em>&nbsp; Then it was worth it. You did it.</p><h2>What About That Cool Feature?</h2><p>So you skipped a feature because it was too slow what do you do now? It is an absolutely fantastic feature, something so fancy that it will blow your users' mind. I say, "Can you make it fast without hampering the release line?" No? Roll it over to the next release. No line of code is more important than <em>your&nbsp;</em>and <em>your product's&nbsp;</em>performance.</p><h2>Closing Thoughts</h2><p><em>Every millisecond matters...but not more than that deadline.</em></p></div></article></div></div></div>]]>

The home is 1900 square feet and took only forty eight hours of print time, over an eight day period. The home was entirely printed and built onsite using less than $6000 in materials. Future print-time is expected to be cut in half on their next projects, due to ARCS enhancements implemented post construction.</p>
<p>ARCS is a patent pending technology that robotically builds foundations, exterior walls, interior walls, utility conduits and more. This digital driven system reduces labor to as little as 3 people, accounting for up to 41% of the total construction of a home. ARCS low-power consumption technology allows homes and buildings to be built using far less energy than needed in traditional construction methods, creating an environmentally friendly impact.</p>
<p>ARCS achieves faster build times by eliminating and consolidating over 20 manual labor intensive processes (siding, framing, sheathing, etc.). This revolutionary technology will be replacing and eliminating more expensive and inferior building materials, causing the printed structures to be stronger and safer. Utilizing concrete will reduce the cost by at least 30%, as well as making the structure more fire resistant than traditional methods. This home will have the strength to last into the next century.</p>
<p>SQ4D’s completion of the world’s largest 3D printed home is a game changer. “Changing the way the world is built” is more than just the company’s tagline; it is a reality.</p>

<p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergey-zyrianov-8a7ab34/">Sergey Zyrianov</a> - Tech Lead, 2021-02-28</p>
<p>A timer is a cornerstone of any software that communicates over the network. There are plenty of implementations
that provide a timer facility. Most of them are in memory and will lose scheduled timers should the application crash.
In this blog we discuss durable Kafka timers that do not depend on in memory state. By design
we shall assume 1 second resolution of these timers.</p>

<hr>

<p>Before taking on timers let’s cover some Kafka basics.</p>

<h2 id="kafka-concepts">Kafka concepts</h2>
<p>There are a few Kafka concepts in play to simulate timers - Kafka topic, Kafka stream, Kafka streams library.
Where <em>topic</em> is append only log of events, <em>stream</em> is a cache of N most recent events on the <em>topic</em>, 
and the <em>streams library</em> is a software library implementing the concept of the <em>stream</em>.</p>

<p>A kafka topic resides inside the Kafka servers, but Kafka streams library keeps track of a topic’s most recent
events on the application side - the stream. The stream is a key/value cache with random read access unlike
append only topic log. Key/value cache is not the only thing the library provides. It can also join
the streams. When an event and its key appear on a stream, the library looks up the same key in the other streams participating in the join. 
It is using key/value cache associated with each stream and gives the result to the application. 
The result will have the present event enriched with the matched past events from the joined streams.
Joining two streams will yield the timer callback. Let’s see how.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Since it is Kafka, timer expiration shall result in an event posted on a topic of user’s choice at the right time.
This event is delayed until due time by joining two streams: <em>oscillator</em> and <em>timer-request</em>. Callback 
event is pushed to <em>timer-request</em> topic with key equal to the expiration timestamp. Oscillator topic
is the clock dial counting seconds since UNIX epoch in real time. At some point it will get to the second
which is equal to the key on <em>timer-request</em> topic, and the join will come up with the callback event.</p>

<p>An excellent summary on “timer wheel” and other timer algorithms can be found in this linux kernel <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/156329/">thread</a>.
Our implementation of timers using Kafka resembles the “timer wheel” algorithm with a bucket on each second to keep callbacks.
<em>Oscillator</em> topic models rotating clock dial, <em>timer-request</em> is bucketing callbacks by the expiration timestamp, and join of these two
contains content of the expired bucket with all the callbacks in it.</p>

<p><img src="https://wgtwo.com/img/blog/kafka-timers/kt.png" alt=""></p>

<p>There are two Kafka applications running together to service these topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Oscillator</li>
  <li>Futures</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="oscillator">Oscillator</h3>

<p>With the resolution of 1 second oscillator keeps pushing <em>oscillator</em> topic:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>running</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>val</span> <span>nowSeconds</span> <span>=</span> <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>currentTimeMillis</span><span>()</span> <span>/</span> <span>1000L</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>timestampSeconds</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>nowSeconds</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>timestampSeconds</span><span>++</span>
        <span>KafkaProducers</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span>
            <span>"oscillator"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>timestampSeconds</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>(),</span>
            <span>"1"</span>
        <span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="futures">Futures</h3>

<p>When requesting a timer by pushing <em>timer-request</em> topic, the user provides a callback structure 
used to dispatch timer event:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>message Future {
    string callBackTopic = 1;
    string callBackKey = 2;
    bytes callBack = 3;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Joining two streams on the key equal to the UNIX second will give all expired timers, and
their callback coordinates.</p>

<p>First, setup a join with <em>WINDOW_SIZE</em> large enough to cover the longest timer duration</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>val</span> <span>oscillator</span> <span>=</span> <span>builder</span><span>.</span><span>stream</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>"oscillator"</span><span>)</span>

<h3 id="cancelling-a-timer">Cancelling a timer</h3>
<p>There is no way to cancel these timers as events can’t be easily removed from the Kafka stream.
Still, it is possible to ignore timer events by using a token in callback request, and a variable 
in timer receiver state. When scheduling a timer the receiver puts the same token in two places:</p>

<ul>
  <li>callback struct it publishes on the <em>timer-request</em> topic</li>
  <li>internal variable timerToken</li>
</ul>

<p>As timer fires receiver compares value in timerToken and in the callback event. Based on the result it
draws a conclusion if timer is to be ignored or not. All it has to do to cancel a timer is to reset
value in its timerToken variable.</p>

<p>Since normally Kafka does “at least once” delivery it is a good idea to reset the timerToken immediately 
after notification event.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-worry-about">What to worry about</h3>

<p>Kafka streams library is using local disk storage to keep the cache. The storage shall be large enough to host
all timer requests based on the product of <em>timer-request</em> topic retention, callback size and timer scheduling rate.
Thankfully Kafka is well-equipped to deal with this sort of troubles.</p>

<p>Oscillator must keep ticking otherwise timers will stop coming. Make sure to have
metrics/alarms in place to stay on top of Oscillator health. Deploy few of them for redundancy having in 
mind the extra load they will generate on timer users.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are many options to export application state to the data tier layer. Timers are often part of that
state. Above we showed how to apply Kafka primitives to achieve a goal of making application “stateless” even
if the state is using timers. It has its costs and benefits.</p>

<p>In recent years, feedback-based fuzzing (or coverage-guided fuzzing) has experienced an unmatched success story. For example, over 27,000 bugs have been found in Chrome and several open-source projects and Google stated that it finds around 80% of its bugs with modern fuzzing techniques. However, fuzzing is not only reserved for big tech companies: It is gradually finding its way into the wide world.</p>
<p><span>Fuzzing is used for security and stability testing of the codebase. The application under test is fed with a series of inputs, which are smartly mutated in the testing process. The testing tool gets feedback about the code covered during the execution of inputs. Unlike traditional or black-box fuzzing, feedback-based fuzzing explores the program state efficiently and discovers bugs hidden deep in the code. If you want to learn more in detail about the underlying technology, we recommend you to read our blog post <a href="https://blog.code-intelligence.com/the-magic-behind-feedback-based-fuzzing?hsLang=en"><span>The Magic Behind Feedback-based Fuzzing.</span></a>&nbsp;</span></p></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div id="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"> <blockquote><p>One luminary clock against the sky <br> Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.</p><p><cite>Robert Frost, <em>Acquainted with the Night</em> (1928)</cite></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Time is still the great mystery to us. It is no more than a&nbsp;concept; we don’t know if it even exists…</p><p><cite>Clifford D. Simak, <em>Shake­speare’s Planet</em> (1976)</cite></p></blockquote><p>Time is money, or so the saying goes. It follows that money is also time: a&nbsp;repre­sen­ta­tion of the collec­tive economic energy stored by humanity. However, the link between time and money is more intri­cate than it might seem at first. If money requires no time to create, it doesn’t work as money very well, or not for long. More profoundly, as we shall see, keeping track of things in the infor­ma­tional realm always implies keeping track of time.</p><p>As soon as money goes digital, we have to agree on a&nbsp;<em>defin­i­tion of time</em>, and herein lies the whole problem. You might think telling the time is as easy as glancing at whatever clock is nearby, and you would be right when it comes to everyday tasks. But when it comes to synchro­nizing the state of a&nbsp;global, adver­sarial, distrib­uted network, telling the time becomes an almost intractable problem. How do you tell the time if clocks can’t be trusted? How do you create the concept of a&nbsp;singular time if your system spans the galaxy? How do you measure time in a&nbsp;timeless realm? And what is time anyway?&nbsp;</p><p>To answer these questions, we will have to take a&nbsp;closer look at the concept of time itself and how Bitcoin makes up its own time: block time — more commonly known as <em>block height</em>. We will explore why the problem of timekeeping is intimately related to keeping records, why there is no absolute time in a&nbsp;decen­tral­ized system, and how Bitcoin uses causality and unpre­dictability to build its own sense of now.&nbsp;</p><p>Timekeeping devices have trans­formed civiliza­tions more than once. As Lewis Mumford pointed out in 1934: “The clock, not the steam-engine, is the key-machine of the modern indus­trial age.” Today, it is again a&nbsp;timekeeping device that is trans­forming our civiliza­tion: a&nbsp;clock, not computers, is the true key-machine of the modern infor­ma­tional age. And this clock is Bitcoin.</p><h2 id="keeping-track-of-things">Keeping Track of Things</h2><blockquote><p>Let the child learn to count things, thus getting the notion of number. These things are, for the purpose of counting, consid­ered alike, and they may be single objects or groups.</p><p><cite>David Eugene Smith, <em>The Teaching of Elemen­tary Mathe­matics</em> (1900)</cite></p></blockquote><p>Very broadly speaking, there are two ways to keep track of things: physical tokens and ledgers. You can either use real-world artifacts directly, e.g., give someone a&nbsp;sea shell, a&nbsp;coin, or some other tangible <em>thing</em>, or you can repli­cate the state of the world by writing down what happened on a&nbsp;piece of paper.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine you are a&nbsp;shepherd and want to make sure that your whole flock returned home. You can put a&nbsp;collar on each sheep, and as soon as a&nbsp;sheep returns home, you simply remove the collar and hang it up in your shed. If you have one hanger for every collar, you will know that every sheep returned safely as soon as all hangers are filled. Of course, you can also count them and keep a&nbsp;list. However, you will have to make sure to create a&nbsp;new list every time you start counting, and you will also have to make sure not to count a&nbsp;single sheep twice (or not at all).</p><p>Money is essen­tially a&nbsp;tool to keep track of who owes what to whom. Broadly speaking, every­thing we have used as money up to now falls into two categories: <em>physical</em> artifacts and <em>infor­ma­tional</em> lists. Or, to use more common parlance: tokens and ledgers.</p><figure> <img src="https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2021-01-14-bitcoin-is-time/ledger-token.jpg"></figure><p>It is impor­tant to realize the inherent differ­ence of these categories, so let me point it out explic­itly: The first method — a&nbsp;physical token — <em>directly</em> repre­sents the state of things. The second one — a&nbsp;ledger — <em>indirectly</em> reflects the state of things. Each comes with advan­tages and disad­van­tages. For example, tokens are physical and distrib­uted; ledgers are infor­ma­tional and central­ized. Tokens are inher­ently trust­less; ledgers are not.</p><p>In the digital realm — no matter how intensely marketing gurus try to convince you of the opposite — we can only use ledgers. It is an <em>infor­ma­tional</em> realm, not a&nbsp;physical one. Even if you call a&nbsp;certain kind of infor­ma­tion a “token,” it is still a&nbsp;malleable piece of infor­ma­tion, written down on a&nbsp;hard drive or some other medium that can hold infor­ma­tion, effec­tively rendering it an infor­ma­tional record.</p><p>The ledger-like nature of all digital infor­ma­tion is the root cause of the double-spend problem. Infor­ma­tion never repre­sents the state of the world <em>directly</em>. Further, the movement of infor­ma­tion implies copying. Infor­ma­tion exists in one place, and to “move” it, you have to copy it to another place and erase it at its origin. This problem doesn’t exist in the physical realm. In the physical realm, we can actually move things from A&nbsp;to B. The infor­ma­tional realm doesn’t have this property. If you want to “move” infor­ma­tion from list A&nbsp;to list B, you have to copy it from A&nbsp;to B. There is no other way.</p><p>Another way to think about it is in terms of unique­ness. Physical tokens are unique compos­ites of atoms whose assembly is not easily replic­able. Pure infor­ma­tion does not have this property. If you can read the infor­ma­tion, you can also copy it perfectly. Practi­cally speaking, it follows that physical tokens are unique, and digital tokens are not. I&nbsp;would even argue that “digital token” is a&nbsp;misnomer. A&nbsp;token might repre­sent secret infor­ma­tion, but it will never repre­sent unique, singular, uncopy­able infor­ma­tion.</p><p>This differ­ence in proper­ties shows that there really is no way to “hand over” infor­ma­tion. It is impos­sible to pass on a&nbsp;digital token like you would pass on a&nbsp;physical one since you can never be sure if the original owner destroyed the infor­ma­tion on his end. Digital tokens, like all infor­ma­tion, can only be spread, like an idea.</p><blockquote><p>… if you have an apple and I&nbsp;have an apple, and we swap apples — we each end up with only one apple. But if you and I&nbsp;have an idea and we swap ideas — we each end up with two ideas.</p><p><cite>Charles F. Brannan (1949)</cite></p></blockquote><p>Physical tokens — what we call physical bearer assets, or “cash” — are free from this dilemma. In the real world, if you hand me a&nbsp;coin, your coin is gone. There is no magical dupli­ca­tion of the coin, and the only way to give it to me is to physi­cally hand it over. The laws of physics do not allow you to double-spend it.</p><p>While double-spending does exist in the non-digital realm — George Parker, a&nbsp;con artist who famously “double-spent” the Brooklyn Bridge and other landmarks comes to mind — it requires elabo­rate decep­tion and gullible buyers. Not so in the digital realm.&nbsp;</p><p>In the digital realm, because we are always dealing with <em>infor­ma­tion,</em> double-spending is an <em>inherent</em> problem. As everyone who ever copied a&nbsp;file or used copy-and-paste knows, infor­ma­tion is something that you can copy <em>perfectly</em>, and it is not bound to the medium that hosts it. If you have a&nbsp;digital photo­graph, for example, you can copy it a&nbsp;million times, store some copies on a&nbsp;USB stick, and send it to thousands of different people. Perfect copies are possible because infor­ma­tion allows for flawless error correc­tion, which elimi­nates degra­da­tion. And to top things off, there is virtu­ally no cost to dupli­ca­tion and no way to tell what the original was.</p><p>Again: when it comes to infor­ma­tion, copying is all there is. There simply is no way to <em>move</em> digital infor­ma­tion from A&nbsp;to B. Infor­ma­tion is always <em>copied</em> from A&nbsp;to B, and if the copying process was successful, the original copy of A&nbsp;is deleted. This is why the double-spending problem is so tricky. Absent of a&nbsp;central authority, there is no way to move <em>anything</em> from A&nbsp;to B&nbsp;in a&nbsp;trust­less manner. You always have to trust that the original will be deleted. A&nbsp;natural side-effect is that, when it comes to digital infor­ma­tion, it is <em>impos­sible</em> to tell how many copies are in existence and where these copies might be.</p><p>Because of this, using digital “tokens” as money can not and will never work. Since tokens derive their relia­bility from being hard to repro­duce as a&nbsp;result of their unique physical construc­tion, this advan­tage disap­pears in the digital realm. In the digital realm, tokens cannot be trusted. As a&nbsp;result of the nature of infor­ma­tion’s intrinsic proper­ties, the only viable format for digital money is not a&nbsp;token but a&nbsp;ledger — which brings us to the problem of time.</p><h2 id="tokens-are-timeless-ledgers-are-not">Tokens Are Timeless, Ledgers Are Not</h2><blockquote><p>For the things seen are tempo­rary, but the things unseen are everlasting.</p><p><cite>Paul of Tarsus, <em>Corinthians</em> 4:18b</cite></p></blockquote><p>When it comes to physical tokens, the time of a&nbsp;trans­ac­tion does not matter. You either have the coins in your pocket, or you don’t; you can either spend them, or you can’t. The simple act of posses­sion is the only prereq­ui­site for spending. The laws of nature take care of the rest. In that sense, physical tokens are trust­less and timeless.</p><p>When it comes to ledgers, physical posses­sion falls to the wayside. Whoever is in control of the ledger needs to make sure that things are <em>in order</em>. What is other­wise given by physical laws, namely that you can’t spend money that you don’t have and you can’t spend money that you have already spent previ­ously, has to be enforced by man-made rules. It is these rules that govern the orderly opera­tion and mainte­nance of a&nbsp;ledger, not physical laws.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving from physical laws to man-made rules is the crux of the matter. Man-made rules can be bent and broken, physical laws not so much. For example, you can’t simply “make up” a&nbsp;physical gold coin. You have to dig it out of the ground. You can, however, absolutely make up a&nbsp;gold coin on paper. To do this, you simply add an entry to the ledger and give yourself a&nbsp;couple of coins. Or, in the case of central banks, simply add a&nbsp;couple trillion with a&nbsp;few computer keystrokes. (Fancy finan­cial people call this “Rehypoth­e­ca­tion,” “Fractional Reserve Banking,” or …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Networking is a requirement for most modern iOS apps.</p>
<p>Networked apps usually interface with a remote web service that provides data. And often, such a web service is a REST API that returns data in JSON format.</p>
<p>Writing the networking layer of an iOS app, though, is not a simple task. When making asynchronous network calls, you need to combine several features of Swift, SwiftUI, and the Foundation framework. Moreover, many parts of your app’s architecture need to interact, making the task more complicated than it might seem at first.</p>

<p>It’s easy to say: <i>“I need to get some data from a REST API</i>.” But such sentence hides a ton of complexity. Many developers simply put together pieces of networking code they find on Stack Overflow, o use a networking library.</p>
<p>But networking has a lot of hidden pitfalls.</p>
<p>I once worked on a project where strange bugs happened randomly. The app displayed a list of items, and the user could add more. But sometimes, when adding a new item, the app would reply with an alert saying that the object already existed on the server. Since that was a new item, it clearly was not possible. And the problem was even weirder. The alert would not only show once but multiple times.</p>
<p>After a more in-depth investigation, I discovered that the problem was caused by the networking stack of the app, which had the wrong architecture. Network calls and callbacks were handled through notifications, which I usually recommend to avoid. Since there were many listeners for the same notification, network calls for the same item were duplicated. The server then rejected the extra network calls, causing the multiple alerts to appear in the app.</p>
<p>Architecture is a topic I often cover in my articles because this is the vital foundation of every iOS app. Even if you use the iOS SDK correctly <b>if you structure your code in the wrong way you end with all sorts of problems in your app</b>.</p>

<p>Performing network requests in a real SwiftUI app</p>
</div>

<h2>The required steps to perform network requests to a REST API from an iOS app</h2>
<p>Performing network requests in an iOS app does not merely amount to adding some extra code. There are many moving parts you need to understand when connecting to a remote web service in iOS. In this article, we will look at each aspect, one by one.</p>
<p>In summary, these are the steps you need to go through to perform a network request in an iOS app:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Understand how the remote web service works</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nowadays, there are <a href="https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many public APIs</a> on the internet. Each one comes with its implementation and documentation. And, if you work for a company or a client, you might have to interface with a private one. Modern web services often, but not always, are based on the <i>REST architecture</i>.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Understand how the HTTP protocol works.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>REST APIs are based on the <i>HTTP protocol</i>, which is the communication protocol used by the world wide web. Understanding HTTP means knowing how <i>URLs </i>are structured, what actions you can express using <i>HTTP methods</i>, how you can express <i>parameters</i> in a request, and how to send or receive<i> </i>data.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Get a list of all the URLs to make the requests you need</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every REST API offers a series of URLs to fetch, create, update, and delete data on a server. These are unique to each API. Their structure depends on the choices made by the developers that created the API. If you are lucky,&nbsp;your API of choice&nbsp;<span>comes with proper documentation. Often though, especially when you interface with a private API, you have to talk to the server-side developers.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Learn how to use the URL loading system in the iOS SDK</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation">The Foundation framework</a> has a robust networking API that addresses all your networking needs, especially for the HTTP protocol. The workhorse of this API is the <i>URLSession</i> class. On the internet, you can also find alternative networking libraries, which I don’t recommend using.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Perform a network request to get the data you need in your app.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>By putting together the elements I listed above, you can write the code to perform a remote API call and get back some data. Data comes in different formats, like binary data (for media files), JSON, XML, Markdown, HTML, or others.</p>
<p>Before you can use such data in your app, you have to parse it and convert to your model types. Binary data is usually directly convertible into the appropriate media types you find in the iOS SDK. In the case of structured data like JSON, parsing is also quite straightforward. For more complex formats like XML, Markdown, and HTML you might have to write a custom parser.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Handle the asynchronous nature of network calls in Swift.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>If making network requests alone was not already hard enough, you have to add to it the fact that you need to run network requests <i>asynchronously</i>.</p>
<p>Network requests are inherently slow since it takes time for a server to respond and to transfer data over the network. That means that networking code needs to run in the background, or your app will become unresponsive for long periods. This has different implications in how you write your Swift code, how you handle callbacks, and how you manage memory.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Finally, use the retrieved data in your app</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also not as straightforward as it sounds. Network requests can fail for many reasons, so you need to handle errors and missing data. You also need to update the UI of your app and show to the user that data is being fetched over the network.</p>
<h2>REST APIs use URLs and the HTTP protocol to identify resources and transfer data</h2>
<p>You access any REST API through the internet. That means that the various resources offered by the API are identified by a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uniform resource locators or URLs</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL.png" alt="the parts composing a URL" width="1251" height="272" srcset="https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL.png 1251w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-300x65.png 300w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-768x167.png 768w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-1024x223.png 1024w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-624x136.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1251px) 100vw, 1251px" data-srcset="https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL.png 1251w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-300x65.png 300w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-768x167.png 768w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-1024x223.png 1024w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-624x136.png 624w" data-src="https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p>
<p>A URL has different components, but in the context of REST APIs, we are usually interested in just three:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The host</b>, which is typically a name (or sometimes an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP address</a>) that identifies the other endpoint (the <i>server</i>) we are going to connect to.</li>
<li><b>A path</b>, which identifies the resource we are looking for.</li>
<li><b>An optional query</b>, where we can add extra parameters to affect the data we get back (filtering, sorting, paging, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>URLs though, are just a part of what you need to understand to communicate with a REST API. The other part is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Representational State Transfer architecture or REST</a>.</p>
<p>REST is a type of architecture for web services. But as iOS developers, <b>we don’t care how the entire REST architecture works</b> on the side of the server. All we care about is what we see from an iOS app.</p>
<h2>Making REST API calls using HTTP requests</h2>
<p>REST works over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</a>, which was created to transmit web pages over the internet. Simply put, in HTTP, we send requests to a server, which sends back responses.</p>
<p>An <i>HTTP request</i> usually contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>a URL</b> identifying the resource we want;</li>
<li><b>an HTTP method</b> that states the action we want to perform;</li>
<li><b>optional parameters</b> for the server in the form of HTTP headers;</li>
<li><b>some optional data</b> we might want to send to the server.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most REST APIs use only a subset of HTTP methods to express which actions you can perform:</p>
<ul>
<li>
			<span id="crayon-6042253a9772f505696962"><span><span>GET</span></span></span>, to fetch a resource</li>
<li>
			<span id="crayon-6042253a97732861877271"><span><span>POST</span></span></span>, to create or update a resource</li>
<li>
			<span id="crayon-6042253a97735016482183"><span><span>DELETE</span></span></span>, to delete a resource</li>
</ul>
<p>Some APIs can also use the 
			<span id="crayon-6042253a97738772339766"><span><span>HEAD</span></span></span>, 
			<span id="crayon-6042253a9773a151583210"><span><span>PUT</span></span></span> or 
			<span id="crayon-6042253a9773d863039427"><span><span>PATCH</span></span></span> methods, although it depends on the skills of the API developer. How these work depends on the specific API you are using, so you always have to check the documentation to see if they are available and what they do.</p>
<p>When it comes to parameters, you might have noticed we have two options: either the query string in the URL or the HTTP headers.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>So which one should you use?</p>
<p>Details usually depend on the API, but, in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>The query string is for parameters related to the resource you are accessing.</li>
<li>The HTTP headers are for parameters related to the request itself, for example, authentication headers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, in the optional data section of a request, we put the data we want to send to the API when we are creating or modifying a resource. If you are simply fetching a resource, you don’t need to add any data to your request. In fact, the HTTP specification states that a server can reject a 
			<span id="crayon-6042253a97740140144076"><span><span>GET</span></span></span> request that contains data.</p>
<h2>Most REST APIs return structured JSON and binary data</h2>
<p>As I mentioned above, in HTTP, you make requests, and the server replies with responses. An HTTP response usually carries:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>a status code</b>, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is a number</a> that tells you if your call was ok or if there was some error;</li>
<li><b>some HTTP headers</b> specifying extra information about the response;</li>
<li><b>data</b>, if you requested some.</li>
</ul>

<p>While there are many formats a REST API can use, most APIs return data in the <a href="http://json.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Javascript Object Notation (JSON)</a> format. JSON is a data format made to be lightweight, easy for humans to read, and easy for machines to generate and parse.</p>
<p>Some web services, though, might use other formats. Common formats are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XML</a>, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Markdown</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a>. If you interact with a Windows server, you might receive data in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOAP</a> format, which requires you to write a custom parser, since it’s based on XML.</p>
<p>When communicating with remote APIs, we don’t only receive structured data. It is common to receive media files like images or videos, which are transmitted as pure binary data.</p>
<p>Beware though that binary data does not come along with the initial response, to keep the latter lightweight. What you get are URLs in the JSON data usually pointing to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content delivery network</a>. …</p></div></div>

However, it's one of the most confusing Hooks (at least in my experience). But if you spend some time to learn how it works, you'll see that it's actually a hidden gem 💎, a powerful tool in your arsenal.</p><p>I'll reveal this shiny gem <span>💎</span> for you in four steps:</p><ol><li>What is it used for?</li><li>The mental model</li><li>A couple of contrived examples (but they are really helpful for learning)</li><li>A couple of real-world examples</li></ol><p>This article assumes that you are familiar with React basics, as well as how to use the <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code> hooks.</p><h2><a id="what-is-useref-used-for" href="#what-is-useref-used-for"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>What is useRef used for?</a></h2><p>There are two use cases.</p><h3><a id="directly-access-dom-nodes" href="#directly-access-dom-nodes"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Directly access DOM nodes</a></h3><p>When combined with the <code>ref</code> attribute, we could use <code>useRef</code> to obtain the underlying DOM nodes to perform DOM operations imperatively. In fact, this is really an escape hatch. We should only do this sparsely for things that React doesn't provide a declarative API for, such as focus management. If we use it for everything (in theory we could), we'd lose the benefit of <a href="https://learnreact.design/posts/what-is-react#declarative-ui">React's declarative programming paradigm</a>.</p><h3><a id="persist-a-value-across-rerenders" href="#persist-a-value-across-rerenders"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Persist a value across rerenders</a></h3><p>This is what I'm going to focus on in this article.

And it clicked! If you are hearing the same clicking sound in your mind right now already, feel free to skip to <a href="https://learnreact.design/posts/react-useref-by-example#example-1-previous-value--state">the examples section</a>. Otherwise, if you are not familiar with JavaScript classes or class instance variables, read on. This section is for you.</p><h3><a id="the-rerendering-time-loop" href="#the-rerendering-time-loop"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>The "rerendering time loop"</a></h3><p>To understand how <code>useRef</code> works and why we need it, let's get started with a contrived (but useful) example. Can you build a counter without using the <code>useState</code> hook?</p><p>Let's give it a try:</p><p>This doesn't work, even though the value of <code>count</code> increases on click. Why? React is oblivious to the change of local variables and, therefore, doesn't know when to update the DOM. We'd need to rerender the component, namely request React to call the component function <code>Counter</code>, to let the change reflected on the screen.</p><p>You can verify this by uncommenting the line <code>console.log('render')</code> right after <code>let count = 0</code>. The component isn't rendered when the user clicks the button.</p><p>OK. Then what if we force the component to render when <code>count</code> updates?</p><p>This doesn't work either. The count displayed on the page stays zero. Even worse, the count value in the console stopped working too. It's always <code>0</code>!</p><p>BTW, <code>useForceRender</code> above is a custom hook:</p><p>Why? This is what I call <strong><em>rerendering time loop</em></strong>.</p><div><p><img alt="Time loop" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Every time when the component rerenders, it goes into a time loop. All the local variables in the function will be reset to their original values. That's why <code>count</code> is always <code>0</code>.</p><p>That's no surprise, right? They are local variables defined in the function. When the function reruns, the variables are supposed to behave like that!</p><p>As straighforward as this sounds, sometimes it's easy to forget (I do it all the time). So remember, since a React component is rerendered all the time, all the local variables will go into a time loop, over and over again.</p><div><p>Does this "rerendering time loop" metaphor make sense to you?</p></div><p>So, we need a solution that survives this "rerendering time loop". We want to preserve the value no matter how many times the component is rendered. If we update <code>count</code> to <code>42</code>, at the next render it should still be <code>42</code>, not the initial value <code>0</code>.</p><p>Let's try the first approach: what if we move the variable out of the component function? It will no longer be affected by the rerendering time loop, right?</p><p>That's correct! It works! Yay!</p><h3><a id="component-instances" href="#component-instances"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Component instances</a></h3><p>But wait a second, what if we want to have two counters?</p><div><div><div><div><div><p>Click both buttons a few times: </p></div></div></div></div></div><p>So our counters are still broken. Did you try it in the preview window? The two counters are tied together. Clicking one button changes the other counter too!</p><p>That's because both counters are tied to the same variable <code>count</code>. What we need instead is to have a <strong><em>separate</em></strong> variable for each <strong><em>instance</em></strong> of the counter.</p><p>So the requirements are:</p><ol><li>Persist a value across rerenders</li><li>Persist the value per component instance, throughout the full lifetime of that instance</li></ol><p>Introducing <code>useRef</code>!</p><p>But, but we are still using that <code>useForceRender</code> to update the DOM! If we comment out <code>forceRender()</code>, the counter stops working again! (try it)</p><p>What's the point of <code>useRef</code> if it relies on <code>useState</code> to work properly? Why don't we just use <code>useState</code>?</p><p>What's the point of <code>useRef</code> if it doesn't trigger a rerender when the value is updated?</p><p>In fact, being able to persist a value across rerenders <em>without</em> triggering another rerender is exactly why <code>useRef</code> is created. Sometimes we just don't want the component to rerender when the value is updated.</p><p>It's now time to look at a better example.</p><h2><a id="example-1-previous-value--state" href="#example-1-previous-value--state"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Example 1: previous value / state</a></h2><p>Let's modify the Counter component. Now we want to display the previous value of the counter whenever the button is clicked. We can do so using a combination of <code>useState</code>, <code>useEffect</code>, and of course <code>useRef</code>.</p><p>Look, when saving the previous state in <code>useEffect</code>, we definitely don't want the component to rerender. Otherwise, it'd go into an infinite loop. So, <code>useRef</code> to the rescue!</p><h2><a id="example-2-stop-watch-clear-interval" href="#example-2-stop-watch-clear-interval"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Example 2: stop watch (clear interval)</a></h2><p>Now let's look at a more useful example. How about a stop watch?</p><p>We can make the stop watch tick with a combination of <code>useState</code>, <code>useEffect</code> and <code>setInterval</code>:</p><p>But how do we pause the stop watch?</p><p>We can add another state <code>ticking</code> and clear the interval when <code>ticking</code> is <code>false</code>. Let's give it a try:</p><p>Did you see the problem? Where should we define that variable <code>interval</code>?</p><p>If we define <code>interval</code> in the outer scope, we'll taste the wrath of the rerendering time loop -- <code>interval</code> will always be <code>undefined</code>.</p><p>We don't want to put it in state either, since it's really not something we would want to display on the UI. It's interval stuff.</p><p>Again, <code>useRef</code> to the rescue:</p><p>You can check out a fully working <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/useref-cancelable-interval-uljky?file=/src/App.js">CodeSandbox here</a>.</p><h2><a id="example-3-press-and-hold-to-repeat" href="#example-3-press-and-hold-to-repeat"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Example 3: Press and hold to repeat</a></h2><p>Let's check out the real thing! Just a reminder, this is what we want to build (remember to click and hold):</p><p>We are going to focus on the press-and-hold behavior:</p><ol><li>When the mouse is down, wait a little bit;</li><li>If the mouse is still down after a threshold, say 500 milliseconds, start repeatedly increasing the like count at an interval until the mouse is up;</li></ol><p>How would we implement this behavior?</p><p>In order to detect the press-and-hold gesture, we can use <code>setTimeout</code>. When the mouse is down, kick off the timeout. When the mouse is up, clear the timeout.</p><p>How do we set and clear the timeout when the component is rendered and rerendered, i.e. when the state <code>mouseDown</code> changes?</p><p>You already know the answer from Example 2, right? <code>useRef</code>!</p><p>Next, how do we repeatedly increase the like count? <code>setInterval</code> is what we need. And of course we'll use another ref to keep track of the interval reference across rerenders.</p><p>Finally, we can extract all the logic into a custom Hook <code>usePressHoldRepeat</code>:</p><p>When using the <code>usePressHoldRepeat</code> hook, remember to use <code>useCallback</code> to prevent excess renders due to the fact the function might be recreated on each render (time loop).</p><p>Check out the full source code in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/likebutton-usepressholdrepeat-3b1qo">this CodeSandbox</a></p><p>Note: The animation in this example is implemented with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.framer.com/api/motion/">Framer Motion</a>.

	<p><span>Mon 01 March 2021</span></p><p>The <a href="https://mcla.ug/blog/risc-v-cpu-part-1.html">previous instalment</a> of this
series was "basically an explanation of what FPGAs are and a 'hello world'
nMigen example."<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> In this post, I will be detailing the design of my CPU as
it currently stands, and going over the various mistakes I made along the way.
As with the previous post, I am primarily aiming this at software engineers who
are new to hardware design – but I hope it will be interesting to anyone
interested in nMigen, RISC-V, or CPU design generally.</p>
<p>I hope the mistakes I made along the way will be a useful frame for considering
these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What about digital logic design is fundamentally different from software
  design?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about digital logic design is similar to software design?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the code for my CPU at the time of writing
<a href="https://github.com/lochsh/riscy-boi/tree/33229b5fdcee90cfdf776ccf925f560f0fa5ce82">here</a>
or an up to date version <a href="https://github.com/lochsh/riscy-boi">here</a>.</p>
<h2>An introduction to RISC-V</h2>
<p>RISC-V ("risk five") is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA).
"RISC" means "reduced instruction set computer", broadly meaning that the
ISA prioritises simple instructions. In contrast, CISC (complex instruction set
computer) ISAs are optimised to perform actions in as few instructions as
possible, hence their instructions are often more complex. ARM architectures
are RISC; x86-related architectures are CISC.</p>
<p>Usually in industry, ISAs are patented, so in order to implement the ISA you
need an (expensive) license from the vendor. Often, commercial ISAs are poorly
documented, with the motivation behind design details not always being
available even after such a license agreement.</p>
<p>From the RISC-V spec <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our goals in defining RISC-V include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A completely <em>open</em> ISA that is freely available to academia and industry</li>
<li>a <em>real</em> ISA suitable for direct native hardware implementation, not just
simulation or binary translation.</li>
<li>An ISA that avoids "over-architecting" for a particular microarchitecture
style, but which allows efficient implementation in any of these.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, a lot of commercial architectures are complex and burdened with
backwards-compatibility constraints. RISC-V offers a fresh start!</p>
<p>The ISA doesn't explain the details of how to design a CPU – it just
defines an abstract model of the CPU, mostly by defining what instructions the
CPU must support, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The encoding of the instructions (i.e. how to construct the machine code that
  the CPU will run)</li>
<li>The registers (the very fast, very small storage locations accessed directly
  by the CPU)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>How to actually create a CPU that realises these requirements is up to us \o/</p>
<h3>A quick note (feel free to skip if you don't have opinions about CPUs)</h3>
<p>I'm trying to design a single-stage CPU; that is, I'm trying to design a CPU
that retires one instruction per clock cycle with no pipelining.  Usually CPUs
have pipelining in place to maximise efficiency. I am hoping that avoiding this
will result in a simpler design more suitable to my learning. Perhaps it will
complicate other aspects of the design (like my program counter having 3
outputs), but I'm certainly finding it easier to hold the design in my
head when I only have to think about this clock cycle and the next. I will
likely discuss this in more detail in the next blog post where I implement the
load instructions. I have a plan for how to make these work in a single cycle,
but they do pose a particular challenge and I may change my design as a
consequence.</p>
<h2>Designing a CPU</h2>
<p>RISC-V defines various ISA modules; I will be implementing RV32I, the base
32-bit integer instruction set.</p>
<p>To design my CPU, I first looked at the JAL (jump and link) and the ADDI (add
immediate) instructions, and drew a block diagram of what hardware
would be needed to decode those instructions. I think the ADDI instruction is
easier to grasp if you're not used to thinking about how machine code is
encoded, so we'll start with that. If this all totally foreign to you, you
might enjoy my
<a href="https://mcla.ug/blog/how-to-flash-an-led.html">introduction to ARM assembly</a>.</p>
<h3>Decoding ADDI</h3>
<p><img alt="iri" src="https://mcla.ug/blog/images/integer-register-immediate.png" title="Diagram of instruction encoding for ADDI from RISC-V spec"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ADDI adds the sign-extended 12-bit immediate to register <em>rs1</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's break some of this down, imagining we're decoding such an instruction:</p>
<ul>
<li>An immediate is analogous to a literal value in source code; the value itself
  is encoded in the instruction, rather than e.g. retrieved from a register.</li>
<li>The <em>opcode</em> field is the same value for all the instructions listed here. </li>
<li>Once we've read the <em>opcode</em>, we know that bits 12-14 contain the <em>funct3</em>
  field (3 for 3 bits), which encodes whether this is an ADDI instruction (or
  SLTI, ANDI &amp;c.)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, somehow we will have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve the value stored in register <em>rs1</em><ul>
<li>Therefore, our register file needs an input for selecting this register
  to read, and an output for the data read from that register.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add that to the immediate value<ul>
<li>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) will be helpful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Store the result in register <em>rd</em><ul>
<li>Our register file also needs write select and write data inputs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sign-extension will be necessary too – this is just the process of
taking a number narrower than (in our case) 32 bits, and filling in the
remaining bits such that two's complement arithmetic will be performed
correctly. I won't include this in the diagram below.</p>
<p>Implicit in all this is that we'll need some way to retrieve the instruction
itself and pass it to the instruction decoder. The <em>program counter</em> is
what tells the instruction memory which address to retrieve an instruction
from.</p>
<p><img alt="addi" src="https://mcla.ug/blog/images/addi.png" title="Block diagram showing the necessary connections         between components to implement the ADDI instruction. The instruction         decoder tells the register file to read from rs1 and write to rd. The         data read from rs1 and the immediate are inputs to the ALU. The output         of the ALU is written to rd. The program counter tells the instruction         memory which address to retrieve and instruction from, and the         instruction memory provides that instruction to the instruction         decoder."></p>
<p>I'm using thick cyan lines for data flow and thin magenta lines for control
flow.</p>
<h3>JAL</h3>
<p>Now let's try doing the same for JAL.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The jump and link (JAL) instruction [...] immediate encodes a signed offset
in multiples of 2 bytes. The offset is sign-extended and added to the <code>pc</code> to
form the jump target address. [...] JAL stores the address of the instruction
following the jump (<code>pc</code> + 4) into register <em>rd</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot more going on here, particularly if you aren't familiar with
machine code. We noted above that the program counter sets which instruction
will be executed next. Usually the program counter simply increments to the
next address each cycle – that's how we continue to execute our program!
However, say our program calls a subroutine stored elsewhere in memory; we'd
need a way to <em>jump</em> to the subroutine address. Or, say we wanted an infinite
loop (ubiquitous in embedded software!); we'd need a way to <em>jump</em><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> back to
the address at the start of the loop. JAL allows for these situations.</p>
<p>The "link" part of JAL is the part where the next instruction is stored in the
destination register. This is convenient when the jump is used to execute a
subroutine: once the subroutine completes, we can jump back to that stored
instruction address.</p>
<p>Here's the encoding for JAL:</p>
<p><img alt="jal-enc" src="https://mcla.ug/blog/images/jal-enc.png" title="Diagram of instruction encoding for JAL from RISC-V spec"></p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The opcode uniquely defines the JAL instruction (no other instructions share
  this opcode)</li>
<li>We need to unshuffle the immediate to get the offset</li>
<li>The LSB<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> of the immediate is not encoded because it must be 0: only
  offsets in multiples of 2 bytes are supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>The unshuffling caused me some pain in my code, so it's amusing to me that it
won't be part of the block diagram below. But it's part of the internals of the
instruction decoder, not its interface, which is what we are determining with
these diagrams. The shuffled bits might seem nonsensical, but they're chosen to
maximise overlap with other instruction formats in RISC-V.</p>
<p><img alt="jal" src="https://mcla.ug/blog/images/jal.png" title="Block diagram showing the necessary connections         between components to implement the JAL instruction."></p>
<h3>Putting ADDI and JAL together</h3>
<p>The next challenge is to draw a block diagram that implements both ADDI and
JAL. The first obvious problem: the inputs to the ALU are different in both
cases, as is the wiring of the output. We need some kind of logic block that
can pick between them depending on some control signal: a multiplexer (mux).</p>
<p>We also need a way to tell the program counter whether the next instruction
address should come from a set address or from incrementing the current
address.</p>
<p>Here's what my design looks like at the moment (excluding a few things I have
because I know I'll need them later, like two read select/data signals on the
register file):</p>
<p><img alt="mux" src="https://mcla.ug/blog/images/mux.png" title="Block diagram showing the necessary connections         between components to implement the JAL and ADDI instructions."></p>
<h2>Implementing the design</h2>
<p>As covered in my previous blog post, I'm using
<a href="https://github.com/nmigen/nmigen">nMigen</a> to implement my design. As I'm
currently designing a single-stage CPU, more of my design is
combinatorial, rather than synchronous, because I don't require the additional
state that pipelining necessitates. This most likely means my design is
unable to run quickly, but that's not a concern of mine.</p>
<p>I don't think it's helpful to post all the source code of my implementation in
this blog, but I will include some code here to illustrate mistakes that I made
and what I learned from them.</p>
<h3>Mistake #1: thinking about my logic circuit sequentially</h3>
<p>I initially implemented my program counter incorrectly after I got really
confused about when synchronous updates would take effect. I initially only had
the <code>pc</code> and <code>pc_inc</code> outputs because I didn't really understand the difference
between <code>pc</code> and <code>pc_next</code>.  It's taken some getting used to thinking about the
whole logic circuit "happening at once"<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>, rather thinking sequentially like
I would when writing software.  This is what led to my confusion. Properly
conceptualising your circuit in this way is key, and a challenge if you're used
to writing software.</p>

<p>Hey everyone, <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/about/instructor/daniel-bourke" target="_blank" rel="follow">Daniel here</a>, I'm 50% of the instructors behind the <a href="https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-bootcamp-zero-to-mastery" target="_blank" rel="follow">Complete Machine Learning and Data Science: Zero to Mastery</a> course. I also write regularly about machine learning and on my own blog as well as make videos on the topic on YouTube.</p>
<p>Welcome to the 14th edition of Machine Learning Monthly. A 500ish (+/-1000ish, usually +) word post detailing some of the most interesting things on machine learning I've found in the last month. </p>
<p>Since there's a lot going on, the utmost care has been taken to keep things to the point.</p>

<h3>The Zero To Mastery TensorFlow for Deep Learning course has launched!</h3>
<p>During COVID lockdowns of 2020, I decided to brush up my TensorFlow skills by getting TensorFlow Developer Certified. <a href="https://youtu.be/ya5NwvKafDk" target="_blank" rel="follow">I made a video about how I did it</a> (in a month or so) and afterwards had a bunch of questions from others asking how they could too.</p>
<p>The video talked about different resources I used but I wanted to go a step further.</p>
<p>So to answer the question of “I want to learn TensorFlow, where do I start?” I created the <a href="https://dbourke.link/ZTMTFcourse" target="_blank" rel="follow">Zero to Mastery TensorFlow for Deep Learning course</a>.</p>
<p>It teaches 3 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The fundamentals of deep learning (a machine learning paradigm taking the world by storm)</li>
<li>The fundamentals of TensorFlow (a framework used to write deep learning algorithms, e.g. Neural Networks)</li>
<li>How to pass the TensorFlow Developer Certification (this is optional but requires 1 &amp; 2)</li>
</ol>
<p>The entire course is code-first. Which means I use code to explain different concepts and link external non-code first resources for those who want to learn more.</p>
<p>I’m so pumped for this release, it’s the biggest thing I’ve ever worked on! I’d love if you checked it out: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://zerotomastery.io/academy">Sign up on the Zero to Mastery Academy</a> to start taking the course now</li>
<li>Learn more about the topics and projects covered in the course <a href="https://dbourke.link/ZTMTFcourse" target="_blank" rel="follow">here</a></li>
<li>View <a href="https://www.github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/" target="_blank" rel="follow">all of the course materials on GitHub</a> (more to come)</li>

</ul>
<h3>A Machine Learning Deployment Tutorial for 20% Software Engineers for Stanford’s CS329s</h3>
<p>I started learning machine learning in 2017 using Stanford lectures and tutorials. So when Chip Huyen (featured below) asked if I’d like to create and deliver one myself, I said yes.</p>
<p>My goal was to break down the barrier for machine learning model deployment by highlighting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model deployment is like model building (except instead of stacking together layers, you stack together cloud services)</li>
<li>The holy grail of ML-powered applications: the data flywheel (introduced in <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/blog/machine-learning-monthly-january-2021/">January 2021’s ML monthly</a>)</li>
<li>What do you do when (not if) your model fails?</li>
</ul>
<p>To cover this, during the tutorial we deploy a TensorFlow image classification model (spoiler: one of the model’s we build in the TensorFlow for Deep Learning course!) to Google Cloud and use it to power Food Vision (a Streamlit app which classifies different photos of food). Watch below and head here to <a href="https://github.com/mrdbourke/cs329s-ml-deployment-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="follow">see the code &amp; slides</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>From the ML community 🙋‍♀️</strong></h2>
<h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08562" target="_blank" rel="follow">Using Deep Learning to Read Brainwaves</a></h3>
<p>Imagine being able to put on a helmet and instead of typing on a keyboard, all you do is think about what’d you like to type. And the sensors in the helmet pickup what you’re thinking and translate them to the screen. Well that’s what Muhtasham and team are working towards. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08562" target="_blank" rel="follow">Their latest paper</a> takes electroencephalogram (EEG) from a brain-computer interface (BCI) and passes them through a deep neural network to try and predict what key you’re thinking of pressing on a keyboard.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
<p>I take being able to type for granted now. I learned when I was young playing online video games. But what if you couldn’t type? What if you didn’t have the ability to use your limbs or speak? How would you communicate in the digital world? Here’s where BCI’s come in. Instead of you physically performing an action, a BCI reads the electric signals in your brain and translates them to the physical world. This is one of the avenues Neuralink is heading down.</p>
<p>Sensational work Muhtasham and team, for those interested in reading how these systems work, read A Neural Network for SSVEP-based Brain-Computer Interfaces.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/alvarobartt/serving-tensorflow-models" target="_blank" rel="follow">Álvaro's guide to TensorFlow Serving</a></h3>
<p>Last time with how to turn your PyTorch models into an API, this time how to turn your TensorFlow models into an API using TensorFlow Serving.</p>
<p>In the machine learning model deployment tutorial above I used Google’s AI Platform to deploy a trained TensorFlow model. AI Platform runs TensorFlow Serving under the hood. So if you want to see how you could set up your own TensorFlow model API (so you can send data to it and receive predictions back), check out <a href="https://github.com/alvarobartt/serving-tensorflow-models" target="_blank" rel="follow">Álvaro's TensorFlow Serving tutorial on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>An aside, I really love this format of sharing your work. Right within GitHub. A great way to demonstrate skill on a certain topic, code and word explanations interlaced together.</p>
<h2><strong>From the interwebs 🕸</strong></h2>
<h3>Chip Huyen’s outstanding machine learning blog (2 recent posts)</h3>
<p>I’m a big fan of Chip’s work. Last year we saw her post on the MLOps (all the parts of a machine learning system around the model) tooling landscape. Now there’s a version 2 and an essay on machine learning going real-time.</p>
<p><strong>Post 1:</strong> <strong><a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/12/30/mlops-v2.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">MLOps Tooling Landscape v2</a></strong></p>
<p>The takeaway from this post is that the ML tooling landscape is growing (and fast). </p>
<p>Why? </p>
<p>Well it seems many of the development roadblocks for ML systems have been worked out and now solutions for those common roadblocks are being built.</p>
<p>Such as Weights &amp; Biases for tracking your machine learning experiments or full-blown enterprise AI solutions like DataRobot.</p>
<p><strong>Post 2: <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/12/27/real-time-machine-learning.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">ML is going real-time</a></strong></p>
<p>In this post Chip breaks down ML going real-time into <strong>online predictions</strong> and <strong>online learning</strong> and emphasises the importance of speed in machine learning. </p>
<p>The simple analogy goes like this: if your app is slow, people won’t use it.</p>
<p>For <strong>online predictions</strong> (predictions made <em>while</em> someone is using your ML system), if they’re slow, people will get tired of them. For some systems, such as self-driving cars, fast online predictions are required. The classic trade off here is how much performance do you sacrifice for speed (e.g. smaller models are faster but don’t score as well).</p>
<p>For <strong>online learning</strong> (how quickly does your ML system update itself?), if you’re getting new data every hour but only updating your models every week, is your service performing as well as it should? This is a tough problem. Because traditionally ML is taught with static data (train, validation, test sets) but when you get to large scale, you’ve got data (called streaming data) coming in all the time so what exactly should you train and evaluate on? </p>
<p>Take the example of a recommendation system such as Netflix, if there’s a new series out and everyone is watching so you get recommended it but then you try it out and don’t like it. But because Netflix only update their system once a week, the new series stays on your homepage for a whole week (it doesn’t take into account you didn’t like it), is that a good experience? </p>
<p>How should one do online learning?</p>
<p>This is still being worked out. But Chip’s post talks more about the pain points and possible solutions.</p>
<h3>Use GitHub for your Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)</h3>
<p>If your code is on GitHub, why not use it to do all of your MLOps (model evaluation, model retraining, continuous integration, continuous deployment) as well?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mlops.githubapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="follow">GitHub for MLOps</a> page is a collection of blog posts, examples, talks and tools (e.g. GitHub Actions) showcasing how you can facilitate MLOps with GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
<p>Find yourself running a series of similar experiments over and over? </p>
<p>Automate, automate, automate.</p>
<p>Use GitHub to watch your codebase for updates and then every time you commit a change, run a series of experiments behind the scenes (such as testing your models and then posting the results in a GitHub issue for you).</p>
<h3>Upgrade your software engineering skills as a machine learning practitioner</h3>
<p>If you’re like me and learned to write Python code in Jupyter Notebooks, when you first heard someone say things like: “just put it into a Python script”, “run this bash command”, “put an API on top of your model and deploy it”, “wrap your app in a Docker container” and thought “wtf???”</p>
<p>LJ Mirander’s post on <em><a href="https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2020/11/15/data-science-swe/" target="_blank" rel="follow">How to improve software engineering skills as a (data science) researcher</a></em> uses the narrative of creating a machine learning service (an app which uses machine learning) and then explains each of the above and how they fit together.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
<p>If you want to get your machine learning models into the hands of others, software engineering skills like the ones LJ discusses are crucial. </p>
<h3>freeCodeCamp's (upcoming) Data Science &amp; Machine Learning curriculum</h3>
<p>Coming soon from one the best resources to learn to code online: a full-blown data science &amp; machine learning curriculum.</p>
<p>freeCodeCamp started out teaching web development for free in the browser. </p>
<p>Now they’re gearing up to do the same with data science and machine learning.</p>
<p>From foundational mathematics (linear algebra, matrix algebra, calculus) to EDA (exploratory data analysis), to supervised and unsupervised algorithms to tools like SQL, NumPy, SciPy, pandas, TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn, when its done, this’ll be an outstanding resource.</p>
<p>All for free!</p>
<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
<p>Educational resources are already abundant. There’s a shortage of willingness to learn. </p>
<p>But what helps grow that willingness to learn is world-class educators who inspire others to create their own path. And freeCodeCamp is full of world-class educators.</p>

<h2><strong>Let's dive in. Here's what you missed in February 2021 as a Python Developer…</strong></h2>
<h3>Python Dilemma  ⚖️</h3>
<p><a href="https://aroberge.blogspot.com/2021/02/pythons-tug-of-war-between-beginner.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">This was an interesting article</a>. Python has become the most popular language in the world because it is so beginner friendly. However, as more and more people use it, the need to include more advanced features grows as well. This is a challenge that all technical projects face as time passes and they grow.</p>
<h3>Weekend Project Idea 🎏</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.willmcgugan.com/blog/tech/post/building-rich-terminal-dashboards/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Rich</a> is a python tool that allows you to beautify CLIs. This weekend, spend some time making all of your CLIs beautiful so you look like you are doing important work at your home or coffee shop or when your boss walks behind you (you know, once people go back to offices of course).</p>
<h3>Constant Folding In Python 🧬</h3>
<p>Every programming language aims to be performant in its niche and achieving superior performance requires a lot of compiler level optimizations. One famous optimization technique is Constant Folding where during compile time the engine tries to recognize constant expressions, evaluate them, and replaces the expression with this newly evaluated value, making the runtime leaner. <a href="https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/constant-folding-python" target="_blank" rel="follow">Learn all about it in this tutorial</a>.</p>
<h3>Python Integers 🥇</h3>
<p>Integers require no introduction. They are so ubiquitous and seem so basic that you may doubt whether it's worth discussing how they are implemented at all. Yet, Python integers are interesting because they are not just 32-bit or 64-bit integers that CPUs work with natively. Python integers are arbitrary-precision integers, also known as bignums. No idea what any of that means? <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-8-how-python-integers-work/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Read all about integers here</a>.</p>
<h3>Pyston vs CPython ⚾️ 🥎</h3>
<p>Pyston 2.1 Is Blowing Past Python 3.8/3.9 Performance. With this past week's release of Pyston 2.1 as an alternative Python interpreter I was curious to see how the performance compared to that of upstream Python... <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Pyston-2.1-vs-Python-3.8-3.9" target="_blank" rel="follow">So here are some weekend benchmarks with a Ryzen 9 5900X system</a>.</p>
<h3>WTF Python 🤸‍♀️</h3>
<p>Python, being a beautifully designed high-level and interpreter-based programming language, provides us with many features for the programmer's comfort. But sometimes, the outcomes of a Python snippet may not seem obvious at first sight.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython" target="_blank" rel="follow">Here's a fun project</a> attempting to explain what exactly is happening under the hood for some counter-intuitive snippets and lesser-known features in Python.</p>
<h3>Google Sponsors Python 💰</h3>
<p>Google has become a visionary sponsor for the Python Software Foundation. <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/02/welcoming-google-as-visionary-sponsor.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">You do that by donating a lot of money</a>. Nice to see the support!</p>
<h3>Pattern Matching in Python 🎲</h3>
<p>The Python steering council has, after some discussion, <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/845480/" target="_blank" rel="follow">accepted</a> the controversial proposal to add a pattern-matching primitive to the language. The pattern matching process takes as input a pattern (following <code>case</code>) and a subject value (following <code>match</code>). <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Learn all about it here</a>.</p>
<h3>Python Strings Are Immutable 💡</h3>
<p>Each time you make a change to a string variable, you are actually producing a brand new string. Because of this, tutorials out there warn you to avoid string concatenation inside a loop and advise using join instead for performance reasons. Even the official documentation says so!</p>
<p>This is wrong. Sort of.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/pythonstringsaremutable.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">There is a common case for when strings in Python are actually mutable</a>.</p>
<p>Once you are confused by that one, <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-9-how-python-strings-work/" target="_blank" rel="follow">read this</a>.</p>
<h3>Data Analysis Trick  📈</h3>
<p>A great strategy to use when faced with a tricky data analysis problem is to reshape the dataset into a format that turns it into an easy problem. In this article we will look at an example involving a simple calculation and extensive reshaping. <a href="https://drawingfromdata.com/pandas/reshaping/Making-a-difficult-data-analysis-problem-trivial.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">Here is a walkthrough of how to do it</a>.</p>
<h3>Python Microservices With gRPC 🏭</h3>
<p>Microservices are a way to organize complex software systems. Instead of putting all your code into one app, you break your app into microservices that are deployed independently and communicate with each other. <a href="https://realpython.com/python-microservices-grpc/" target="_blank" rel="follow">This tutorial</a> teaches you how to get up and running with Python microservices using gRPC, one of the most popular frameworks.</p>
<h3>Do Benchmarks Matter? 🪤</h3>
<p><a href="https://suade.org/dev/12-requests-per-second-with-python/" target="_blank" rel="follow">I highly recommend this read</a>. The summary? If your python  service is receiving 100,000 requests a second, it's likely that the specific Python framework you use is not going to be the bottleneck. Especially if your API is stateless and you can scale it via Kubernetes or similar. At that point, a good database, with decent schema design and good architecture are going to matter far more. Having said that, if you do want more processing power, use PyPy... just don't worry about the web frameworks you use.</p>
<h3>Concurrency With Python 🚿</h3>
<p>An exploration of threads, processes, and coroutines in Python, with interesting examples that illuminate the differences between each. <a href="https://python.hamel.dev/concurrency/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Enjoy</a>!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>32nd issue! If you missed them, you can <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/blog/?tag=WDM#monthly">read the previous issues of our Web Developer Monthly newsletter here</a>.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>If it’s your first time here… (otherwise, skip this part)</strong></h2>
<p>Being a web developer is a fantastic career option. You have many job opportunities, you can work around the world, and you get to solve hard problems. </p>
<p>One hard thing, however, is staying up to date with the constantly evolving ecosystem. You want to be a top-performing web developer, coder, programmer, software developer, but you don’t have time to select from hundreds of articles, videos and podcasts each day.</p>
<p>This monthly newsletter is focused on keeping you up to date with the industry, keeping your skills sharp, without wasting your valuable time. I curate and share the most important articles, news, resources, podcasts and videos of the month. </p>
<p>Think <a href="https://tim.blog/about" target="_blank" rel="follow">Tim Ferriss</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank" rel="follow">the Pareto Principle</a> (80/20 rule) meeting the Software Development world. What’s the 20% that will get you 80% of the results?</p>

<h2><strong>Let's dive in. Here's what you missed in February 2021 as a Web Developer…</strong></h2>
<h3>Architecture.md 🦾</h3>
<p>An interesting idea around including this type of file in all of your projects. The idea? As the name suggest, this file should describe the high-level architecture of the project. Keep it short: every recurring contributor will have to read it. Additionally, the shorter it is, the less likely it will be invalidated by some future change. This is the main rule of thumb for ARCHITECTURE — specify only things which are unlikely to frequently change. Don’t try to keep it synchronized with code. Instead, revisit it a couple of times a year.</p>
<h3>Free Tools For Web Developers ✂️</h3>
<p>Some tools and assets to help you build your next project since we are best friends by now (<em>unless this is your first time reading my articles… in that case let’s take things slow</em>):</p>

<h3>JavaScript Memory Management 🧠</h3>
<p>Most of the time, you can probably get by fine not knowing anything about memory management as a JavaScript developer. After all, the JavaScript engine handles this for you. At one point or another, though, you'll encounter problems, like memory leaks, that you can only solve if you know how memory allocation works.</p>
<p><a href="https://felixgerschau.com/javascript-memory-management" target="_blank" rel="follow">In this article</a>, you will learn how memory allocation and garbage collection works and how you can avoid some common memory leaks.</p>

<li>Looks like even Amazon is all aboard the React train. They now have a new tutorial on their website: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-server-side-rendering-for-react-in-aws-lambda/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Building server-side rendering for React in AWS Lambda</a>. Don't worry, they haven't forgotten about Vue 3 either: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/amplify-javascript-releases-support-for-vue-3/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Amplify JavaScript releases support for Vue 3</a></li>

<h3>New Browser Has Entered The Chat 👾</h3>
<p><a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/beam/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Beam has raised $9.5m</a> to take on some of the biggest browser companies in the world like Microsoft, Google and Mozilla, by creating a new web browser. Looks like they will be using Chromium underneath the hood. <em>“It’s basically a cultural search engine.”</em></p>
<h3>No More Frontend 😿</h3>
<p><a href="https://soynomm.com/blog/i-dont-want-to-do-frontend-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="follow">An interesting opinion piece</a> of a frontend developer who has had enough and wants to focus on backend development. <em>"I suppose with the increase of complexity in what we want to achieve on the web the stack to achieve it with has had to also increase in complexity. For me, personally, it's too much. I want to have a personal life and not have to spend my nights reading up on some new flavour of .js in fear that if I don't I would soon be made irrelevant. I don't want to learn nor use a million different tools. I don't want to know a bit about everything and a lot about nothing."</em></p>
<h3>Interesting Question Of The Month 🕺</h3>
<p>This should be changed to QUESTIONS of the month, because there are 7. Can you answer <a href="https://dmitripavlutin.com/javascript-closures-interview-questions" target="_blank" rel="follow">these 7 JavaScript closures interview questions</a>? Share your results!</p>
<h3>Deno Fanboy 🦕</h3>
<p>My heavy bias towards Deno must be present in all newsletters, so here it is: <a href="https://evrone.com/ryan-dahl-interview" target="_blank" rel="follow">An interview with the creator of Deno: Ryan Dhal</a>. Enjoy!</p>
<h3>Google Proposes New Sandbox 🧨</h3>
<p>Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/2021-01-privacy-sandbox" target="_blank" rel="follow">is proposing a new idea</a> to keep advertising on the web but with a more privacy focus in mind. How? Interest-based advertising. They call it
Federated Learning of Cohorts <em>(uh la la, sounds fancy)</em>. It proposes a new way for businesses to reach people with relevant content and ads by clustering large groups of people with similar interests. This approach effectively hides individuals “in the crowd” and uses on-device processing to keep a person’s web history private on the browser. </p>
<h3>Functions As Callbacks 📞</h3>
<p>A simple message in this one - Don't use functions as callbacks unless they're designed for it. Jake always has great articles and this one <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2021/function-callback-risks/" target="_blank" rel="follow">does not disappoint</a>.</p>

I present to you what you should do this weekend: <a href="https://carltheperson.com/posts/10-things-linux" target="_blank" rel="follow">Getting better at Linux with 10 mini-projects</a></p>

<p><span>I</span>f you’re a woman in India, getting from A to B is a series of negotiations. Leaving the house for a trip to the market? First there’s figuring out how to get there. A taxi? No guarantee of a metered fare, and the driver might flat out refuse, depending on where you’re going. The metro? Faster than the bus, but there’s the long walk to the station, and sidewalks are a luxury in much of urban India. Then there’s harassment, an experience so widespread in public areas that over <a href="https://news.trust.org/item/20160523153959-37tlt/">80% of women</a> in Indian cities say they have faced it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When rideshare companies like Uber and Ola <a href="https://qz.com/india/1696728/ola-has-a-lead-over-uber-in-indias-ride-hailing-market/">entered India in the early 2010s</a>, these logistical negotiations changed. In the years since, rideshare apps have become a lifeline for women in urban areas, an alternative to risks they faced on public transport or in taxis. That’s not to say rideshares remove the risk altogether: in 2014, a 26-year-old Delhi woman was kidnapped and raped by her Uber driver, a case that led to a lawsuit against Uber for how they <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42291495">handled the victim’s medical records</a>. The app was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/world/asia/new-delhi-bans-uber-after-driver-is-accused-of-rape.html">banned in Delhi</a> for over a year but has since grown to dominate the market along with its local competitor Ola; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-india-ola-analysis/uber-seen-girding-for-battle-with-ola-in-india-ahead-of-ipo-idUSKBN1H424L">combined, the two companies hold 80% of the Indian taxi market</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ubiquity of rideshare cabs has had a lasting impact on the urban-dwelling women of India, with ripple effects reaching stay-at-home moms, workers, and college students. <em>Rest of World </em>spoke to six women who live in Kolkata, a city of 14 million, about how rideshares have changed the way they navigate their city.</p>

<h3>Menka Danda, 36</h3>



<h4><em>The beautician who needs her husband to book her rides</em></h4>



<p>As a beautician, my work takes me to all corners of Kolkata; I work through an app called Urban Company to provide at-home spa services. Often, it’ll be a new client whose house I’ve never been to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before Uber came along, I used to take the buses. They’re always so crowded. My supply bags are huge and heavy; I carry all of my equipment in them and have to lug them around from client to client. On the bus or metro, sometimes there are no seats. Carrying the bags gets so tiring; by the time I’d reach my clients, I’d be exhausted. And in the summers, the heat is unbearable. If I have more clients in a day, I’ll always take Uber. If I take the bus, it takes so long, I can only visit one to two clients. On Uber, I can do four in one day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The beauty service company trained me to use their app, but I’ve only studied till the sixth grade. Everything on the beauty app is in English, so I have difficulty reading the addresses for the clients I’m supposed to visit. Uber is the same way. I don’t know how to use the app on my own. My husband tags along with me on jobs, to help book the car on Uber and transfer addresses from the beauty service app. He used to be a private tutor for kids in our area, but since the lockdown, he hasn’t had much work. He’s like my assistant now. Because I’m not educated — even though I’m independent and the sole breadwinner in the family right now — I’m dependent on him.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>It would be so much easier if I could use the app on my own. If it were in Hindi, it’d be much better.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>When my husband can’t come with me, I ask the client, “Ma’am, I don’t know how to book rides on Uber, can you use the app on my mobile phone?” They can usually do it; you just have to ask.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It would be so much easier if I could use the app on my own. If it were in Hindi, it’d be much better. But really, I wish I could just open the app and say, “I’m here, OK, come pick me up!” I wish I could just say it instead of having to type it out.</p>

<h3><strong>Lynette Hilt</strong>, 55</h3>



<h4><em>The <strong>stay-at-home mom who says Uber has changed her social life</strong></em></h4>



<p>I was a huge party animal. I used to go to nightclubs or to people’s houses for dinner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From 1996 to 2003, I had a car and used to drive in Kolkata. Then I moved to Bangalore for two years and sold my car before the move. When I came back, I was dependent on friends for a ride. I used to turn down a lot of outings because of transportation, because it was so embarrassing to ask.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Respect is the most important thing to me. I was so particular about my reputation that I missed a lot of opportunities. Once, I got all dressed up to go out and stood on the road waiting for a taxi that didn’t come. Eventually, I had to give up and walk back home. It was so sad.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>As a single woman, I don’t have to depend on a man to pick me up or drop me home.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Uber has become a lifeline and a status symbol. I am very safe. Uber comes right to the door. If it’s late at night, I have my 23-year-old son book it so that he can track me. As a single woman, I don’t have to depend on a man to pick me up or drop me home. I use them to go everywhere: the airport, the movies, the doctor, school-reunion parties, Sunday brunch, and to take my parents to the hospital for checkups. If it’s a short distance to get to church, then I take a moto.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The drivers are very well-dressed and very decent. I have a knee problem, so when I get off the moto, I have to hold them for support. I need reconstruction surgery. By that time in the trip, we have become friends. I tell them half my life history. We talk about religion. I tell them I have a son their age, but I don’t tell them that I live alone. I don’t mind if they speed.</p>

<h3><strong>Chaahat Mandhyan</strong>, 25</h3>



<h4><em>The<strong> professional wealth manager who says the pandemic has made her dependent on men again</strong></em></h4>



<p>I took the bus only very occasionally because I feel claustrophobic. Uber Go in Kolkata is not economical. Uber Pool is, but you have to sit in it with a mindset that it’s going to take 30 to 40 minutes longer than it normally would. I’m always running late.</p>



<p>In Uber Go, I read about the markets in the papers on my way to work. On the Uber Moto, I listen to music. My favorite song is “We Didn’t Start the Fire” by Billy Joel. Five minutes before I reach work, I play this song, and I’m all pumped up. Before the pandemic, I would spend 6,000 bucks (about $82) a month on Uber.</p>

<p>The pandemic has increased my dependency on the male members of my community, like my building’s security guard. We bought a scooty so that my guard can drop me off and pick me up at the office. If I keep him waiting because I get delayed trying to finish work, then I get to hear him scream. I don’t know how to ride a scooty, and I’m really scared of sitting on it. My hands are constantly sweating. I just have to get over my fear of an accident. It’s more economical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One night in December 2019, I took an Uber Go, around 8:30 p.m. I was going to a friend’s party and wearing a dress that came below my knees. I was carrying a shawl. It was cold. I set the Uber to drop me off at a place where my friend would pick me up from there. But I was late, and my friend got pissed, and he took off. Then I changed the destination on my Uber to the location of the party, about 6 kilometers away.</p>

<p>The driver said he wouldn’t go. Then he grabbed my ankle and ran his hand over it. I went blank. I removed his hand, and I said, “What’re you doing?” He turned around to talk to me. I got damn pissed and got out of the cab. I filed a complaint with Uber, but nothing happened. I didn’t want to create a scene. I couldn’t find an Uber, and I didn’t want to take a normal cab to such a big party. Uber is a matter of status.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if my phone conks off, I know I can charge my phone in an Uber. I feel safer knowing that I can use the maps on the Uber driver’s phone. But if you’re sitting in a yellow cab and if your phone’s not working or if it’s conked off, there’s no way of tracking. Charging phones is a huge plus point.</p>

<h3><strong>Dorothy Nair</strong>, 44</h3>



<h4><em>The<strong> primary school teacher who is afraid of driving</strong></em></h4>



<p>My husband is in the army, so we’ve moved every two years. We’ve lived all over. We’ve seen Punjab; we’ve been towards Maharashtra; we were in Ahmednagar; we stayed in Pune, Kapurthala, Pathankot, Amritsar, and Babina. Now we’re in Kolkata. My husband’s post is in Ambala. While he was here, we were able to use the army transport; the vehicle was available on call. But when the husband is posted elsewhere, then you don’t have the vehicle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I used to drive many years ago, when my daughters were small, but now I’m scared of driving. Once, I got into an accident in a very crowded area. One of those public buses banged into the car. It was such a crowded place, nothing could be done, and we couldn’t stop. I was worried about my daughter; she was with me, and she was very little. Ever since, I’ve been too afraid. When we came to Kolkata, I joined a driving school, and my friend would come with me. Maybe I’ll drive again when we can get a fully automatic car, the one where all you have to do is press a button. When my husband sends both his daughters abroad, and there’s money left over, maybe we can get a Tesla!</p>

It will probably only take a few years since most of the components are here already. It's just putting them together into a nice service thats missing.</strong></blockquote><p>‍</p><h2>How did we do it?</h2><p>We started experimenting with CLIP and BigGAN through <a href="https://twitter.com/advadnoun">Ryan Murdocks </a>"Big Sleep". We were testing what kind of images we could get by asking it to draw a green robot rocket with big cute eyes. At first the results were not very promising, but then something clicked, by nudging it with multiple different instructions it would not get stuck at a certain spot. Creating an endless stream of robots. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fed49be52334588b156311c/603cc19e0e844204feec4f1a_Screenshot%202021-03-01%20at%2011.21.49.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2KH7VdJoUlw"></iframe></p></figure><p>Around 02:00 I realized that it probably would be able to understand what I was after! </p><p>‍</p><h4>Phase 1</h4><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2fYlQvbH7dM"></iframe></p></figure><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TB-rHfjsXrY"></iframe></p></figure><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZNdiuLiTHqs"></iframe></p></figure><p>A frenzy of generation attempts and various methods followed from all three of us. We added reference images for the model to look at and also wrote some instructions such as "a rocket-robot" and "a robot with two cute eyes". We realized this was a viable method to get inspiration for our logo.</p><p>‍</p><h4>What is creativity? What is design?</h4><p>I'd argue that compression is a big part of it. Take cubism. The real world exists, cubes exists. Compress them and a creative piece is born. If there is something Neural networks and transformers are good at, it is compression. So if creativity is partly compression we would see evidence of "creativity" in these experiments. Searching and mixing between styles and objects to reach a goal. </p><p>Lets have a look at Filips <em>meme</em>-moment. <strong>LEMON&nbsp;DWARF</strong>!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fed49be52334588b156311c/603d79666417d71ef34a02cf_IMG_3121.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fed49be52334588b156311c/603d798c81f70d59b82c8b9f_IMG_3122.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fed49be52334588b156311c/603d79b6a4585130a6c39613_IMG_3123.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fed49be52334588b156311c/603d79cefb777fb68d4bd739_IMG_3124.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BhaZJtf9xf0"></iframe></p></figure><p>Filip had multiple instructions. Such as "a robot with big eyes", an image of a robot, and another image of a dwarf. Then once in a while the instructions "A lemon" is added. So now its forced to change its normal struggle to output a mix of a robot and a dwarf. Now it has to add a lemon in to the mix. <strong>The result is a LEMON&nbsp;DWARF ROBOT!</strong></p><p>Even if this is not true "AI-creativity" the lines are definitely turning blurrier. The model drawing is not trained on dwarfs or robots. It's just mixing its ability to draw a cassette player, a car and a dog to create something different, in between those objects.</p><h3>Phase 2</h3><p>After generating over 200.000 various cute robots we wanted something different. I created a new method for the interaction between BigGAN and CLIP to get different results. We switched around the reference images and started experiment a bit, creating reference images ourselves.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zgarBSNbV0c"></iframe></p></figure><p>Heres we used the old instructions and reference images but added minimalism as instruction.

<p><a href="https://text.bargains/">Amulet</a> version 1<br>
2021-2-21</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>An amulet is a kind of poem that depends on language, code, and luck. To qualify, a poem must satisfy these criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its complete Unicode text is 64 bytes or less. [1]</li>
<li>The hexadecimal SHA-256 hash of the text includes four or more 8s in a row. [2]</li>
</ul>
<p>This kind of poem was designed to be recorded, collected, and traded as an NFT using <a href="http://zora.engineering/">the Zora protocol</a>, but it can happily exist anywhere; an amulet absolutely does not have to be recorded on a blockchain to be an amulet.</p>
<p>If it is recorded, an additional formal criterion applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>A carbon offset (1 metric ton or more) is purchased to compensate for the CO2 produced by the poem’s life on the blockchain, with proof of that purchase included in the poem’s metadata. (Here’s a <a href="https://text.bargains/amulet-metadata-sample.json">metadata template</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no other rules! An amulet can be written in any language and any style. It can be composed, generated, or “discovered” in any way.</p>
<p>The number of sequential 8s in the hash determines the rarity of the amulet:</p>
<ul>
<li>8888: common</li>
<li>88888: uncommon</li>
<li>888888: rare</li>
<li>8888888: epic</li>
<li>88888888: legendary</li>
<li>888888888: mythic</li>
<li>8888888888+: ???</li>
</ul>
<p>And, while this isn’t part of the formal definition, it’s important to say that an amulet of any rarity should be judged by its overall effect, with consideration for both its linguistic and typographic qualities. In particular, an amulet’s whitespace, punctuation, and diacritics should all be “load bearing”.</p>
<p>A poem doesn’t become interesting simply by satisfying the constraints of some obscure form; likewise, an amulet isn’t collectible simply because it’s rare.</p>
<p>But... it doesn’t hurt.</p>
<p>A few stray considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Special appreciation is reserved for the amulet that is, in any sense, “aware of its circumstances”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is tempting to stylize “amulet” as “amul8”; this, unfortunately, is too dorky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is significant luck involved in the production of amulets; you might consider them bouillon cubes of fortune, useful as ingredients in other recipes, digital and occult.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Footnotes:</p>
<p>[1] Unicode (UTF-8) characters often require more than one byte; most programming languages provide a function to determine the byte size of a string.</p>
<p>[2] For most programmers, the SHA-256 hash function will be familiar and close to hand. For other readers interested in seeing how it works, <a href="https://text.bargains/scratchpad">this scratchpad might be useful</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Hash_standard">SHA-256 hash function</a> is ubiquitous in cryptography. In Zora, for example, it’s used to verify the identity of a piece of media, like a fingerprint. That media could be an MP4 movie, a PNG image, or a poem in plain text; if you change one frame, one pixel, or one comma, you change the SHA-256 hash entirely.</p>
<p>The hash is a cold hexadecimal spew –</p>
<p>9a120001cc88888363fc67c45f2c52447ae64808d497ec9d699dba0d74d72aab</p>
<p>– and, like a fingerprint, it doesn’t tell you anything about the entity it identifies. That’s by design, but even so, it feels strange for a value so pivotal to be totally disconnected from the underlying content, especially when it is <em>this value</em> that’s being collected and traded in cryptographic marketplaces.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, the hash provides an immutable link between unique cryptographic object and free-floating digital media.</p>
<p>The amulet asks: what if we took that link seriously?</p>
<p>In a sense, the definition of the SHA-256 hash function created, at a stroke, all amulets of all rarities. Common to mythic, trashy to lovely, they have been hiding in the manifold combinations of language; we just didn’t know we ought to be looking for them. Until now!</p>
<p>How should we feel about this? I will invoke an amulet of uncommon rarity; you saw its SHA-256 hash above, five 8s in a row, lucky indeed:</p>

<p><img src="https://koaning.io/posts/maths-as-a-compiler/intro.png"></p>
<p>You might have heard of a mathematician named Gauss. He’s known for a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">contributions in mathematics</a> but my favorite contribution has a story. As <a href="https://www.nctm.org/Publications/Teaching-Children-Mathematics/Blog/The-Story-of-Gauss/">story goes</a> there was a maths teacher who wanted to read the newspaper while he was supposed to be teaching. So instead of teaching the teacher gave his pupils the assignment to add the numbers 1 through 100.</p>
<p><span>\[ 
s = 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 98 + 99 + 100 = ?
\]</span> Instead of blindly calculating away, which was what most of the other students did, the young Gauss looked at the problem and started wondering if there perhaps was a more clever way of looking at the problem. After skribbling down some ideas he noticed a pattern.</p>
<p><span>\[ 
\begin{array}{c *{6}{c@{\hspace{6pt} + \hspace{6pt}}} c}
  s &amp; =  &amp; 1   &amp; 2   &amp; 3   &amp; \ldots &amp; 98 &amp; 99 &amp; 100   \\
  s &amp; =   &amp; 100   &amp; 99 &amp; 98 &amp; \ldots &amp; 3   &amp; 2   &amp; 1  
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>Maybe we can calculate <span>\(s\)</span> in another way.</p>
<p><span>\[ 
\begin{array}{c *{6}{c@{\hspace{6pt} + \hspace{6pt}}} c}
    &amp; 1   &amp; 2   &amp; 3   &amp; \ldots &amp; 98 &amp; 99 &amp; 100   \\
  +  &amp; 100   &amp; 99 &amp; 98 &amp; \ldots &amp; 3   &amp; 2   &amp; 1 \\  
    \hline 
  = &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; \ldots &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; 101
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>It seems that if we sort cleverly the sum of these two identical series can also be expressed as a multiplication</p>
<p><span>\[ 
\underbrace{
\begin{array}{c *{6}{c@{\hspace{6pt} + \hspace{6pt}}} c}
   &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; \ldots &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; 
\end{array}
}_{100 \times 101 = 10100} 
\]</span></p>
<p>In other words;</p>
<p><span>\[ 
s = \frac{10100}{2} = 5050
\]</span></p>

<p>What’s very neat about this “rethinking” is that it can also be generalized. If we’re interested in taking the sum from <span>\(1 \ldots n\)</span> then we can repeat the same trick.</p>
<p><span>\[
\begin{array}{c *{6}{c@{\hspace{6pt} + \hspace{6pt}}} c}
    &amp; 1   &amp; 2   &amp; 3   &amp; \ldots &amp; n-2 &amp; n-1 &amp; n   \\
  + &amp; n   &amp; n-1 &amp; n-2 &amp; \ldots &amp; 3   &amp; 2   &amp; 1   \\
  \hline 
  = &amp; n+1 &amp; n+1 &amp; n+1 &amp; \ldots &amp; n+1 &amp; n+1 &amp; n+1
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>This will give us the general formula.</p>
<p><span>\[
1 + \ldots + n = \sum_{x=1}^n x= \frac{n\times(n+1)}{2}
\]</span></p>
<p>The brilliance of this is in recognizing that there are multiple ways of calculating the thing we’re interested in. Instead of doing a whole lof of addition, we can apply a mere multiplication and still get the same result.</p>
<p>This is a beautiful point, because it gives another angle to mathematics. There’s a “computer-science-voice” inside of me that’s looking at this and wondering if maybe … maths can be applied much more like a compiler than a calculator?</p>
<p>Think about it! This example shows that you might be able to rephrase an original problem into one that is much easier to calculate. We’re literally generating an alternative set of instructions. Just like the kid in the classroom, our program might also spend less time performing a multiplication compared to a long sequence of additions.</p>
<p>It’s a compiler that is potentially “better” too.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>
<p>You can actually run this as an experiment.</p>
<pre><code>
import numba as nb

def calc_sum(n):
    return sum(i for i in range(1, n + 1))

def calc_smart(n):
    return n * (n+1) / 2

@nb.njit
def calc_sum_compiled(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res += i
    return res

@nb.njit
def calc_smart_compiled(n):
    return n * (n+1) / 2</code></pre>

<p>Even <em>if</em> we use the JIT compiler from <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/reference/numpysupported.html">numba</a> then we still see that we can get a huge speedup by using maths as a compiler. The fastest results are achieved by using both the compiler and the maths but the example is sufficient to show that you’re able to improve a compiler by using maths.</p>

            <section>
                <p>On August 24th, 1967 Charles A Kiesling at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperry_Corporation">Sperry Rand</a> filed a patent for 'Blinking Cursor for CRT Display'. One of the earliest innovations in the history of graphical user interface design, Kiesling’s patent allowed programmers to quickly see where the next character will be input on their console screen.</p><p>We all take the flashing cursor for granted today, but in the 1960s this was one of a succession of innovations that brought programmers closers to their code. Thanks to the introduction of electronic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube">cathode ray tubes</a> (CRTs) just a few years earlier, programmers could now interact with their code directly through terminals connected to a console screen. Displaying character sets linked directly to a mainframe computer, the console not only increased a programmer’s productivity, it also offered the world a new perspective and relationship to computing that would go on to inspire future generations.</p><p>Kiesling lays out the problem to be solved with the blinking cursor in his <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3531796">original patent:</a></p><blockquote><em>The cursor in presently available systems has not satisfactorily performed the function for which it was intended. Whenever the cursor is positioned over a character that has already been painted on the screen, it becomes difficult to locate it. The more characters on the screen the more difficult it becomes to locate the cursor.</em></blockquote><p>Kiesling would stay at Sperry Rand until his retirement in 1993, where his designs and ideas helped lay the foundation for the modern computer world.</p><h2 id="computers-with-personality-a-love-of-consoles">Computers with Personality: A Love of Consoles</h2><p>Computing is so often a story of what’s coming next.

Console. </p><p>Like much of the very best technology and design, its easy to forget the lineage of iterations that got us here.

Before the console, programmers interfaced with mainframe computers via a standalone terminal. Early user terminals connected to computers were electromechanical teleprinters or teletypewriters (TeleTYpewriter, TTY) - effectively a typewriter to enter the data into a computing system. Limited to the input of data, these early terminals were often referred to as dumb terminals that pre-dated computer console screens.</p><h3 id="the-model-33">The Model 33</h3><div><p>The archetypal teletype was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33">Teletype Model 33</a> originally designed for the United States Navy, the Teletype Corporation introduced the Model 33 in 1963. The Model 33 was one of the first products to employ the newly standardized ASCII code.</p><p>Costing $700, the Model 33 was far more affordable than other options and with the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor">Video Display Unit</a> (VDU) consoles costing in excess of $10,000, its popularity extended well into the 1970s. By 1975 over 500,000 Model 32 and 33s were manufactured, going on to become one of the most popular terminals in history.</p></div><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.18.34.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.18.34.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.18.34.png 1000w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.18.34.png 1600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.18.34.png 1772w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Teletype Model 33 introduced Bill Gates to programming. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33#/media/File:Teletype-IMG_7287.jpg">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>The historical impact of the Model 33 was notable. The programming language BASIC was designed to be written and edited on a low-speed Teletype Model 33, with the slow speed of the Teletype Model 33 influencing the later user interface of minicomputer operating systems, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">UNIX</a>.</p><p>Fun fact: Bill Gates cites the Teletype Model 33 as his first computing experience. In 1973 Gates’ Lakeside Prep School Mothers Club used its garage sale proceeds to give students computer access. The club purchased a Model-33 teletype machine that connected over phone lines to a GE time sharing computer.</p><h3 id="glass-teletypes-and-the-console-vdus">Glass Teletypes and the Console: VDUs</h3><div><p>It wasn’t until the mid-1960s that the first glass teletypes entered the market, combing an input terminal with a Video Display Unit (VDU). The early consoles were relatively primitive, lacking a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>. They relied on individual logic gates and simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit#Large-scale_integration_(LSI)">LSI chips</a>, and were still connected to mainframe computers to do all the processing.</p><p>The shift to an ‘intelligent terminal’ was identifiable through the device’s ability to process inputs by the user with the terminal sending a block of data at time, rather than interrupting the main processing computer after every keystroke.</p></div><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.21.57.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.21.57.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.21.57.png 1000w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.21.57.png 1182w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Datapoint 3300 - One of the first general purpose video terminals. <a href="http://www.kuonlinedirectory.org/studygroups/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/The-Almost-Forgotten-Story-of-Computer-Terminal-Corporation_4_2_16_small.pdf">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Designed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datapoint">Computer Terminal Corporation</a>, the Datapoint 3300 was the first successful general purpose video terminal designed to compete with the Model 33 teletype.

It also set the benchmark for business video terminals with an 8 bit general purpose CPU, 24 x 80 green phosphor display, consumer friendly ergonomics and a futuristic design.</p><h3 id="ascii">ASCII</h3><div><p>As the use of terminals became more commonplace and new companies began to enter the market, so there was an increasing need for a standardization of character encoding. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> (abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange) was developed from telegraph code, with the first commercial use in a seven-bit teleprinter developed by Bell Data Systems. </p><p>Based on the English alphabet, ASCII originally encoded 128 specified characters into seven-bit integers. Ninety-five of the encoded characters are printable, including the digits 0 to 9, lowercase letters a to z, uppercase letters A to Z, and punctuation symbols. The remaining 33 non-printing control codes originated from Teletype machines, though most of these are now obsolete. Later in 1981, <a href="https://blog.console.dev/p/97d42dc1-d2c1-464e-ab20-d160e7b34e7f/www.ibm.com">IBM</a> developed an extension called ‘code page 437’. In this version, some obsolete characters were replaced for graphic characters and a further 128 characters ranging from 128 to 255 were added. </p><p>With 95 printable characters in the original ASCII from 1963, it also offered artistically minded programmers the tools to create beautiful imagery from just a fixed width prompt.</p></div><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-14.13.05-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-14.13.05-2.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-14.13.05-2.png 1000w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-14.13.05-2.png 1600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-14.13.05-2.png 1660w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Mad magazine's Alfred E.

The new protocol allowed similar sequences of input to be interpreted by the terminal as commands rather than text to be displayed on the console. </p><p>This standardization was popularized by the Digital VT100 in 1978, and thanks to the success, led to most new terminals and emulators that followed to support them. Over six million terminals in the VT series were sold based on the success of the VT100. Even today the majority of terminal emulators still interpret a portion of the original ANSI standard. </p><p>Designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">Digital Equipment Corporation</a> (DEC), DEC was one of the major players of the computer industry from the 1960s until the 1990s, when it struggled to compete in an increasingly competitive market driven by home computing.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.24.57.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.24.57.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.24.57.png 1000w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.24.57.png 1600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.24.57.png 1990w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>DEC VT100 terminal at the Living Computer Museum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100#/media/File:DEC_VT100_terminal.jpg">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="monochrome-monitors">Monochrome Monitors </h3><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/WiQSTgB-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/WiQSTgB-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/WiQSTgB-1.jpg 764w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Hollywood was quick to embrace the rise of the console screen, quickly introducing the console as a protagonist in some of the biggest films of the 1970s and 80s.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
				
<p>In Part 1, <a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/2021/01/17/hacking-super-monkey-ball-part-1-banana-bunch-values/" data-type="post" data-id="645">we used Dolphin’s debugger to find the location of Player 1’s score in RAM</a>. In this article, our goal is to hack the score calculation routine so that the bonus goals do not award so many points.</p>



<p>Levels in Super Monkey Ball can have up to three separate exits: the normal Blue exit, a Green exit, and a Red exit. If you manage to get to a Green or Red exit, the game will let you skip a number of upcoming levels (e.g. skip the next 3 levels). In addition, it multiplies the score for completing the level by the number of levels skipped (e.g. you gain 3 times as many points as you would have with the normal exit). This is a totally bonkers amount of points, especially for levels which you can complete in only a few seconds and so also get the time bonus multiplier. In the below screenshot, the normal Blue exit would have awarded 3,386 points. Instead the game awards <em>130,158</em> points because I completed the level with the Red exit! There is some fun in a risk/reward calculation, but not when it’s this lopsided!</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7.png"><img loading="lazy" width="390" height="188" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7.png 390w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7-300x145.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px"></a></figure>



<p>It really incentivizes you to skip levels, which means you play less of the game, which… sucks. If we eliminate the level skip bonus entirely, then it becomes a more interesting trade-off. You can either skip a few levels and so be less likely to lose lives but lose out on score, or you can choose to risk completing those levels and gain all the points from those levels you would have skipped. It’s a much more interesting mechanic than always choosing the Red exit to get that massive score dump.</p>



<p>So let’s start by finding the code that alters your score upon level completion. As in part 1, we set a memory watch breakpoint on Player 1’s score, then complete the level. As the score tally displays, Dolphin breaks and we have our score routine.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="635" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-1024x635.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-1024x635.png 1024w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-300x186.png 300w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-768x477.png 768w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1.png 1244w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>There’s a couple interesting things to notice in this screenshot. First, you can see the current instruction is storing the updated score into our player’s struct, which is what we expected/hoped to find. Just before that is where it adds the new points into the existing score. You can see in <code>r4</code> and <code>r5</code> are the new score value to be added and the player’s current score, respectively. So this really looks like the routine we wanted to find. Finally, notice the <code>LR</code> value, which is where we jumped from to get into this routine. Let’s head to that code and see what called this routine. More specifically, we want to know where the beginning of this routine is, since we’ve paused execution somewhere in the middle of it.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3.png"><img loading="lazy" width="512" height="102" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3.png 512w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3-300x60.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></figure>



<p>That tells us where the score calculation routine actually begins. Let’s go see what happens there at the start of this function.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2.png"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="469" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2.png 500w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2-300x281.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></figure>



<p>Well that… sure is some PowerPC code. I can read assembly if I have to, but that looks like a real chore to try to understand. Notice the start of the routine is something like 500 bytes away from where the actual store happens. I don’t want to try to understand that much assembly.</p>



<p>Well luckily, just a few years ago the NSA (yes, that NSA) made their internal software reverse-engineering (SRE) tool <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ghidra-sre.org/" target="_blank">Ghidra</a> public. Among many other things, it is capable of disassembling binaries into C source. I figured it probably was capable of handling PPC binaries (it is), but I wondered if anyone had specifically tried it with a GameCube binary. Turns out somebody had: I found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hmapl.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/ghidra-a-potentially-useful-reverse-engineering-tool/" target="_blank">a blog post</a> about using a Ghidra plugin for the GameCube’s PPC variant to decompile Harvest Moon. I also found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Cuyler36/Ghidra-GameCube-Loader" target="_blank">a Ghidra plugin specifically for loading GameCube binaries</a> dumped from ISOs. It’s pretty painless to install. Once that’s done, you can use Dolphin to dump the game’s executable to disk, to load into Ghidra. Extract the game’s system data using Dolphin, and it will dump some binaries into a directory.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4.png"><img loading="lazy" width="823" height="751" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4.png 823w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4-300x274.png 300w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4-768x701.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px"></a></figure>



<p>The one we’re interested in is main.dol, which is the game’s main executable. Loading that into Ghidra will prompt you to analyze the binary. On my machine, that only took about a minute to complete. Now I was ready to see if Ghidra could turn that PPC code into readable C code. So I jumped to the start of the score routine and…</p>

<p>It worked! Without any symbol names, the code is hard to read, but it’s legible enough. This was so exciting to see!! I’ve been wanting to hack this score code for at least a decade. And look at those if-statements! They’re comparing something against ‘<code>G</code>‘ and ‘<code>R</code>‘. Green and Red exits, perhaps? I couldn’t wait to figure out what this code was doing.</p>



<p>I’ve inserted the code in text format here, with some interesting lines highlighted for discussion below.</p>

<p>Even just looking at the raw code, you can see some interesting stuff. At [1] is our current PC, that <code>stw</code> instruction which we broke on back at the start of the article. You can see it’s adding the value of <code>uVar4</code> into the player’s score location. Scrolling up to [2], you see where <code>uVar4</code> is calculated, as the product of <code>iVar3</code> and <code>iVar6</code>. I bet one of those is the base score, and the other is the bonus multiplier. Going further up to [3], you’ll see <code>iVar3</code> does indeed seem to be derived from some global value. I bet that global is the current time, and these calculations are converting the internal time representation into points and maybe doing some rounding on the result. Looking around for more interesting stuff, the lines marked with [4] look a lot like bit flags. From the code flow, I bet that’s used for deciding which parts of the score calculation to display on screen when tallying the score.</p>



<p>So with some of those guesses, I used Ghidra to rename some of the local variables to be more descriptive. Here’s what I ended up with for everything that goes into calculating <code>uVar4</code> (I trimmed all the later stuff).</p>



<pre><code>  iVar2 = DAT_802f1f18;
  iVar4 = DAT_801eec4c;
  if ((param_1 &lt; 4) &amp;&amp; (1 &lt; param_1)) {
<strong><span>    score_multiplier = (int)DAT_801f3a7a; //[4]</span></strong>
    iVar5 = *(int *)(*(int *)(DAT_802f1f30 + 0xc) + 0x40);
    time_score = (DAT_801f3a74 * 100) / 0x3c + (DAT_801f3a74 * 100 &gt;&gt; 0x1f);
    time_score = time_score - (time_score &gt;&gt; 0x1f);
    out_flags = 0;
    exit_data = iVar5;

<h2 id="0-introduction">0. Introduction</h2>
<p>The x86 instruction set architecture is at the heart of CPUs that power our home computers and remote servers for over two decades. Being able to read and write code in low-level assembly language is a powerful skill to have. It enables you to write faster code, use machine features unavailable in C, and reverse-engineer compiled code.</p>
<p>But starting out can be a daunting task. The official documentation manuals from Intel are well over a thousand pages long. Twenty years of continual evolution with backward compatibility have produced a landscape with clashing design principles from different eras, deprecated features occupying space, layers upon layers of mode switches, and an exception to every pattern.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, I will help you gain a solid understanding of the x86 <abbr title="instruction set architecture">ISA</abbr> from basic principles. I will focus more on <em>building a clear mental model</em> of what’s happening, rather than giving every detail precisely (which would be long and boring to read). If you want to make use of this knowledge, you should simultaneously refer to another tutorial that shows you how to write and compile a simple function, and also have a list of CPU instructions open for referencing. My tutorial will start out in familiar territory and slowly add complexity in manageable steps – unlike other documentation that tend to lay out the information all at once.</p>
<p>The prerequisites to reading this tutorial are working with binary numbers, moderate experience programming in an imperative language (C/C++/Java/Python/etc.), and the concept of memory pointers (C/C++). You do not need to know how CPUs work internally or have prior exposure to assembly language.</p>

<p>When reading this tutorial, it’s helpful to write and test your own assembly language programs. This is most easily done on Linux (harder but possible on Windows). Here is a sample function in assembly language:</p>
<pre>.globl myfunc
myfunc:
    retl</pre>
<p>Save it in a file called my-asm.s, and compile it with the command: <tt>gcc -m32 -c -o my-asm.o my-asm.s</tt>. There is no way to run the code at the moment, because it would require either interfacing with a C program or writing boilerplate code for interacting with the <abbr title="operating system">OS</abbr> to handle the starting/printing/stopping/etc. At the very least, being able to compile code gives you a way to verify that your assembly programs are syntactically correct.</p>
<p>Note that my tutorial uses the AT&amp;T assembly language syntax instead of Intel syntax. The underlying concepts are still the same in both cases, but the notation is a bit different. It’s possible to mechanically translate from one syntax to the other, so there is no need for much concern.</p>

<h2 id="2-basic-execution-environment">2. Basic execution environment</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/cpu-model.svg"><img src="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/cpu-model.svg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>An x86 CPU has eight 32-bit general-purpose registers. For historical reasons, the registers are named {<code>eax</code>, <code>ecx</code>, <code>edx</code>, <code>ebx</code>, <code>esp</code>, <code>ebp</code>, <code>esi</code>, <code>edi</code>}. (Other CPU architectures would simply name them <code>r0</code>, <code>r1</code>, ..., <code>r7</code>.) Each register can hold any 32-bit integer value. The x86 architecture actually has over a hundred registers, but we will only cover specific ones when needed.</p>
<p>As a first approximation, a CPU executes a list of instructions sequentially, one by one, in the order listed in the source code. Later on, we will see how the code path can go non-linearly, covering concepts like if-then, loops, and function calls.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/register-aliasing.svg"><img src="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/register-aliasing.svg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>There are actually eight 16-bit and eight 8-bit registers that are subparts of the eight 32-bit general-purpose registers. These features come from the 16-bit era of x86 CPUs, but still have some occasional use in 32-bit mode. The 16-bit registers are named {<code>ax</code>, <code>cx</code>, <code>dx</code>, <code>bx</code>, <code>sp</code>, <code>bp</code>, <code>si</code>, <code>di</code>} and represent the bottom 16 bits of the corresponding 32-bit registers {<code>eax</code>, <code>ecx</code>, ..., <code>edi</code>} (the prefix “e” stands for “extended”). The 8-bit registers are named {<code>al</code>, <code>cl</code>, <code>dl</code>, <code>bl</code>, <code>ah</code>, <code>ch</code>, <code>dh</code>, <code>bh</code>} and represent the low and high 8 bits of the registers {<code>ax</code>, <code>cx</code>, <code>dx</code>, <code>bx</code>}. Whenever the value of a 16-bit or 8-bit register is modified, the upper bits belonging to the full 32-bit register will remain unchanged.</p>

<h2 id="3-basic-arithmetic-instructions">3. Basic arithmetic instructions</h2>
<p>The most basic x86 arithmetic instructions operate on two 32-bit registers. The first operand acts as a source, and the second operand acts as both a source and destination. For example: <code>addl %ecx, %eax</code> – in C notation, this means: <code>eax = eax + ecx;</code>, where <code>eax</code> and <code>ecx</code> have the type <code>uint32_t</code>. Many instructions fit this important schema – for example:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><code>xorl %esi, %ebp</code> means <code>ebp = ebp ^ esi;</code>.</p></li>
	<li><p><code>subl %edx, %ebx</code> means <code>ebx = ebx - edx;</code>.</p></li>
	<li><p><code>andl %esp, %eax</code> means <code>eax = eax &amp; esp;</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A few arithmetic instructions take only one register as an argument, for example:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><code>notl %eax</code> means <code>eax = ~eax;</code>.</p></li>
	<li><p><code>incl %ecx</code> means <code>ecx = ecx + 1;</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The bit shifting and rotation instructions take a 32-bit register for the value to be shifted, and the fixed 8-bit register <code>cl</code> for the shift count. For example: <code>shll %cl, %ebx</code> means <code>ebx = ebx &lt;&lt; cl;</code>.</p>
<p>Many arithmetic instructions can take an immediate value as the first operand. The immediate value is fixed (not variable), and is coded into the instruction itself. Immediate values are prefixed with <code>$</code>. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><code>movl $0xFF, %esi</code> means <code>esi = 0xFF;</code>.</p></li>
	<li><p><code>addl $-2, %edi</code> means <code>edi = edi + (-2);</code>.</p></li>
	<li><p><code>shrl $3, %edx</code> means <code>edx = edx &gt;&gt; 3;</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the <code>movl</code> instruction copies the value from the first argument to the second argument (it does not strictly “move”, but this is the customary name). In the case of registers, like <code>movl %eax, %ebx</code>, this means to copy the value of the <code>eax</code> register into <code>ebx</code> (which overwrites <code>ebx</code>’s previous value).</p>

<h3>An aside</h3>
<p>Now is a good time to talk about one principle in assembly programming: Not every desirable operation is directly expressible in one instruction. In typical programming languages that most people use, many constructs are composable and adaptable to different situations, and arithmetic can be nested. In assembly language however, you can only write what the instruction set allows. To illustrate with examples:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>You can’t add two immediate constants together, even though you can in C. In assembly you’d either compute the value at compile time, or express it as a sequence of instructions.</p></li>
	<li><p>You can add two 32-bit registers in one instruction, but you can’t add three 32-bit registers – you’d need to break it up into two instructions.</p></li>
	<li><p>You can’t add a 16-bit register to a 32-bit register. You’d need to write one instruction to perform a 16-to-32-bit widening conversion, and another instruction to perform the addition.</p></li>
	<li><p>When performing bit shifting, the shift count must be either a hard-coded immediate value or the register <code>cl</code>. It cannot be any other register. If the shift count was in another register, then the value needs to be copied to <code>cl</code> first.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The takeaway messages are that you shouldn’t try to guess or invent syntaxes that don’t exist (such as <code>addl %eax, %ebx, %ecx</code>); also that if you can’t find a desired instruction in the long list of supported instructions then you need to manually implement it as a sequence of instructions (and possibly allocate some temporary registers to store intermediate values).</p>

<h2 id="4-flags-register-and-comparisons">4. Flags register and comparisons</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/eflags-register.svg"><img src="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/eflags-register.svg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>There is a 32-bit register named <code>eflags</code> which is <em>implicitly</em> read or written in many instructions. In other words, its value plays a role in the instruction execution, but the register is not mentioned in the assembly code.</p>
<p>Arithmetic instructions such as <code>addl</code> usually update <code>eflags</code> based on the computed result. The instruction would set or clear flags like carry (CF), overflow (OF), sign (SF), parity (PF), zero (ZF), etc. Some instructions read the flags – for example <code>adcl</code> adds two numbers and uses the carry flag as a third operand: <code>adcl %ebx, %eax</code> means <code>eax = eax + ebx + cf;</code>. Some instructions set a register based on a flag – for example <code>setz %al</code> sets the 8-bit register <code>al</code> to 0 if ZF is clear or 1 if ZF is set. Some instructions directly affect a single flag bit, such as <code>cld</code> clearing the direction flag (DF).</p>
<p>Comparison instructions affect <code>eflags</code> without changing any general-purpose registers. For example, <code>cmpl %eax, %ebx</code> will compare the two registers’ value by subtracting them in an unnamed temporary place and set the flags according to the result, so that you can tell whether <code>eax &lt; ebx</code> or <code>eax == ebx</code> or <code>eax &gt; ebx</code> in either unsigned mode or signed mode. Similarly, <code>testl %eax, %ebx</code> computes <code>eax &amp; ebx</code> in a temporary place and sets the flags accordingly. Most of the time, the instruction after a comparison is a conditional jump (covered later).</p>
<p>So far, we know that some flag bits are related to arithmetic operations. Other flag bits are concerned with how the CPU behaves – such as whether to accept hardware interrupts, virtual 8086 mode, and other system management stuff that is mostly of concern to OS developers, not to application developers. For the most part, the <code>eflags</code> register is largely ignorable. The system flags are definitely ignorable, and the arithmetic flags can be forgotten except for comparisons and bigint arithmetic operations.</p>

<h2 id="5-memory-addressing-reading-writing">5. Memory addressing, reading, writing</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/ram-as-byte-array.svg"><img src="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/ram-as-byte-array.svg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>The CPU by itself does not make a very useful computer. Having only 8 data registers severely limits what computations you can do because you can’t store much information. To augment the CPU, we have <abbr title="random access memory">RAM</abbr> as a large system memory. Basically, RAM is an enormous array of bytes – for example, 128 <abbr title="mebibytes">MiB</abbr> of RAM is 134&nbsp;217&nbsp;728 bytes that you can store any values to.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/little-endian.svg"><img src="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/little-endian.svg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>When storing a value longer than a byte, the value is encoded in little endian. For example if a 32-bit register contained the value 0xDEADBEEF and this register needs to be stored in memory starting at address 10, then the byte value 0xEF goes into RAM address 10, 0xBE into address 11, 0xAD into address 12, and finally …</p></article></div>

            <p><a href="https://cert-manager.io/">cert-manager</a> has become the de facto solution for
managing X.509 certificates for applications running in Kubernetes. The project, <a href="https://www.jetstack.io/blog/cert-manager-cncf/">now part of the CNCF Sandbox</a>, was built with flexibility and extensibility in mind. It allows operators to use Certificates and Issuers as first-class citizens in the API, and for this to enable almost any use case in which an automated certificate is required.</p>
<p>As Kubernetes adoption grows, there is now increased interest in service mesh to securely connect workloads, as well as provide dynamic configuration of traffic routing and consistent observability. Services meshes typically use X.509 certificates for mutual TLS (mTLS), with the identity encoded using <a href="https://spiffe.io/">SPIFFE</a>.</p>
<p>With a range of supported certificate issuers, there has been interest from the community to see Istio integrated with cert-manager for it to provide signing capabilities for workloads. Working with the Security WG in the Istio community, as well as a number of our customers, the cert-manager team at Jetstack have built an integration that enables cert-manager to sign workload certificates in an Istio service mesh.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="rise-of-the-service-mesh">Rise of the service mesh</h2>
<p><a href="https://istio.io/">Istio</a> is a popular, fully-featured service mesh; it has a rich set of configurations for traffic
routing, policy control, and observability. Like most service meshes, the data plane is powered by <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">Envoy</a>, and each workload running in the mesh will have
one of these proxies that intercept all traffic, and make routing decisions
based upon the mesh configuration as a whole.</p>
<p>When it comes to managing certificates, service meshes typically ship with a limited number of Certificate
Authority (CA) choices, those being either self signed, perhaps
<a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">Vault</a>, and sometimes an integration with a
cloud provider solution. This imposes limitations on <em>how</em> and <em>where</em> your certificates get signed. These limitations can
be problematic for larger enterprises where there are requirements for using
particular CAs, auditing and visibility of these signed certificates, as well as
the headaches that come with changing the Certificate Authority already used in
production.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-cert-manager">Why use cert-manager?</h2>
<p>cert-manager is commonly used to secure ingresses, in conjunction with an Ingress controller (NGINX, for example) and a public CA such as Let’s Encrypt. You can use cert-manager with Istio today to secure ingress using the Istio Gateway (<a href="https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/integrations/certmanager/">guide</a>), but up until now it’s not been straightforward to use for issuance and renewal of <em>workload certificates</em>.</p>
<p>cert-manager was always built to be CA-agnostic and enable integration with both public <em>and</em> private CAs. The project and wider ecosystem has a wide choice of public and private CA providers available
for certificate signing. There are internal issuers core to the project, including HashiCorp Vault, and a fast-growing set of <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/external/">External Issuers</a> that should cover many bases, including cloud provider PKI services. It’s also simple enough to build on cert-manager and develop your own external issuer if you’ve a more bespoke requirement.</p>
<p>A further benefit of using cert-manager is its centralised API and consistent interface. This means that
swapping out an issuer, say to use a different CA provider, is fairly trivial. This operation only requires a change to the
<a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer/">Issuer</a> configuration and issuer
that the mesh is configured to use - the rest is all handled by cert-manager.</p>
<p>By using cert-manager as the single tool for managing certificates in the
cluster, operators are able to have complete visibility of the machine identities with a single pane of glass,
for auditing, policy and observability purposes (and if that sounds useful, check out our
<a href="https://www.jetstack.io/jetstack-secure/">Jetstack Secure</a> service - it’s free to get started).</p>
<h2 id="machine-identity-lifecycle-in-an-istio-service-mesh">Machine identity lifecycle in an Istio service mesh</h2>
<p>When a workload starts, along with its sidecar, it needs to identify itself to
the mesh control plane, and retrieve a signed certificate in order to begin
sending traffic over the network. A helper executable called the <code>istio-agent</code> is
responsible for retrieving this signed certificate, and delivering it to Envoy to use.
This involves sending a certificate signing request to the control
plane component of Istio (<code>istiod</code>), along with the pod’s Service Account token
to securely identity itself. Once <code>istiod</code> has validated the request, it will in
the default case, sign and send back a certificate trusted by the mesh that
Envoy can begin to serve and send traffic.</p>
<h3 id="how-weve-integrated-cert-manager">How we’ve integrated cert-manager</h3>
<p>The cert-manager integration with Istio involves running a separate
component to <code>istiod</code>. The <code>cert-manager-istio-agent</code> processes certificate requests from istio-agents in the mesh.The agent will verify the identity, using the incoming Service Account token and ensure the
certificate signing request matches that identity, kicking off a
<code>CertiticateRequest</code> flow with cert-manager. This involves cert-manager watching
for the <code>CertiticateRequest</code> created, and signing it using the Issuer installed
and referenced on the request. Once signed, the certificate is returned back to
the <code>istio-agent</code> to facilitate mTLS in the mesh.</p>

  <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6b47e30230d9fc89c785f8c98365e571c105d60a/351b2/blog/cert-manager-istio-integration/diagram.png" alt="cert-manager istio agent">
</figure>
<p>This agent is responsible for distributing the trust chain of the configured
Issuer, along with signing certificates for all workloads running in the
cluster.</p>
<p>Using the <code>istio-csr</code> project, you can integrate any of cert-manager’s Issuers and have this
provide certificate signing for workloads in the mesh. With more <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/external/">External
Issuers</a>, such as the
<a href="https://github.com/jetstack/google-cas-issuer">Google CAS Issuer</a>, being added
to the cert-manager ecosystem all the time, it allows certificates in all areas
of the cluster be signed from any number of centralised CAs that best suits
your needs, whilst ensuring the portability that the cert-manager API provides.</p>
<h4 id="not-using-istio">Not using Istio?</h4>
<p>In the CNCF, the <a href="https://linkerd.io/">Linkerd project</a> already provides <a href="https://linkerd.io/2/tasks/automatically-rotating-control-plane-tls-credentials/#cert-manager-as-an-on-cluster-ca">cert-manager integration</a>. Jetstack has also integrated Open Service Mesh (OSM), a new service mesh from Microsoft in the CNCF Sandbox - (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyddzt4oqLM&amp;list=PLeFOFE7BDgi0-VnLT8jPUWZF9m-zntrd_&amp;index=2&amp;utm_source=jetstack&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=community-day-videos">see this video</a> for a talk featuring a demo).</p>

Payload—a self-hosted Node, Express and React-based headless CMS, is now available.</h3></p></div><p>Hi—my name is James and I’m one of the founders of Payload CMS. After two years of development and thousands of commits, I am extremely excited to announce that Payload CMS is now available to the public. It’s our response to the surprisingly sparse JavaScript CMS market and we hope that its arrival improves the development workflow of engineers all over the world.</p><p>Payload has already been put through the test with an array of pilot projects that ranged from video game backend to full e-commerce store development, virtual event platform, and more. Through the projects we’ve released with Payload thus far, our own team’s efficiency has absolutely skyrocketed and we’re confident that it’s only going to get better from here.</p><h5>Now, we’re finally ready to open up to the community.</h5><p>We would greatly appreciate if you were to install Payload, give it a shot, and let us know what you think. Any type of feedback is welcome - be it about how we write our docs, about your experience using Payload in your projects, or anything else!</p><p id="we-needed-a-cms-that-didnt-exist"><h2>We needed a CMS that didn’t exist</h2></p><p>We built Payload because, over the years, my team and I have come to understand exactly what we need out of a CMS to build projects—big or small—for our clients:</p><p id="1-self-hosted"><h3>1. Self-hosted.</h3></p><p>What happens when your hosted CMS doesn’t offer you just that <em>one</em> thing that you need, so you need to end up opening a REST endpoint to build it? Guess it’s time to maintain your own server or Lambda function. Seems like a racket when you could have just used a self-hosted CMS in the first place and had a server set up already. We’ve been there too many times to let that keep happening.</p><p>Third-party hosted CMS might work for simple sites where you know you’ll be able to work within their confines for the lifetime of the app, or for strictly delivering content and not ever having to worry about receiving content, but when your needs become any more advanced, a self-hosted CMS that provides you with complete control is the way to go.</p><p>Security is also a concern with third-party hosted CMS solutions. <a href="https://trbl.design/">My digital design firm TRBL</a> works with many clients that are heavily security-focused and want to maintain complete control over their databases and infrastructure. Many of them deploy their CMS within their own private networks—only accessible via VPN or similar. For these clients, maintaining control over their own code is an absolute necessity, which removes many popular third-party hosted CMS from the equation.</p><p>Find out how to install Payload by <a href="https://payloadcms.com/docs/getting-started/installation">heading to our Docs</a>.</p><p id="2-customizable-react-admin-panel"><h3>2. Customizable React admin panel.</h3></p><p>We want a CMS’ admin panel to be minimal, understandable, and most of all, <strong>completely customizable</strong>. If we need to customize a field type, we should be able to swap in our own React field component to take the place of a default text input, for example. We definitely don’t want to jump through any hoops, either, like dealing with messy iFrames or separately developed field type packages.</p><p>If we want to add a view, we should be able to build a React component and add it as a view. If we want to be able to customize the CMS’ branding, and completely white-label the CMS, we should be able to.</p><div><p><img src="https://payloadcms.com/images/admin-laptop.png" alt="Payload headless CMS Admin UI built in React JS"></p><p>[Screenshot of the Payload Admin panel, editing a document from an Order collection]</p></div><p id="3-block-based-field-editor"><h3>3. Block-based field editor.</h3></p><p>My team and I design entire sites and apps with a component mentality—even down to how page layouts are assembled. Through UX design phases, we identify all the layout building “blocks” that are necessary to build and then we design our CMS to allow for content editors to self-craft their page layouts using the deliberately designed layout blocks that we’ve provided them with.  We then map each “block” in the CMS to React components that have props matching 1:1 to the fields within the CMS block. Boom, component-based layout building.</p><p>Like so many others, we started off years ago using WP and Advanced Custom Fields. ACF’s Flexible Content field type is great for layout building. But unfortunately, many other CMS have a complete lack of any layout-building workflow, and even when it’s supported, it lacks functionality or is a shoe-horned solution.</p><h5>Conditional Logic</h5><p>Another thing my team always took for granted in ACF that’s missing from other CMS completely is field-level conditional logic (show this field if another field has a value equal to <code>true</code> and similar). Our ideal CMS needs to have a built-in way to deliver dynamic interfaces that respond to input accordingly. Such a simple feature makes complex content management so much easier.</p><p id="4-javascript-top-to-bottom"><h3>4. JavaScript top to bottom.</h3></p><p>When’s the last time you worked on a web project without a <code>package.json</code>? Even if you work in PHP, you’re likely going to unavoidably need Node too. The idea of flattening our stack entirely into one language and not having to run a Docker container just to get a local LAMP environment going is a nice one indeed. We want to simplify our stack and keep it all JS. Better yet, TypeScript.</p><p id="5-reusable-secure-authentication"><h3>5. Reusable, secure authentication.</h3></p><p>One of the toughest parts about content management systems in-general is that they perform a lot of the lifting that a typical application framework would also need, but fall dramatically short of being able to call themselves an app framework through and through because of their lack of support for reusable authentication. For example, if you wanted to build a full SaaS product, you might need to create products, users, licenses, pages, and maybe even blog posts. Any run-of-the-mill CMS might get you close to being able to CRUD all of this stuff within its system, but what about user authentication? What about having control over users’ access? You’d be more often than not left to fend for yourself. Commonly you’d end up with either rolling your own system from scratch or building out a patchwork of separate systems (and separate admin UIs) to manage the product.</p><p>We need a CMS that comes with robust and reusable authentication right out of the box, so we can leverage the CMS for all our commonly needed authentication functionality. This way, we can keep all of our logic organized and build fully-featured apps right in our CMS that we’ve become accustomed to.</p><p>This way, if a client of ours comes to us asking for a simple app or a marketing site, but in the future, decides that they need to add full e-commerce support, we won’t end up with a messy disconnected set of admin UIs for them to manage their single product within. It can all be done in Payload.</p><h5>Payload's Authentication Operations</h5><p>In addition to just being able to log in and log out, Payload ships with everything a fully-featured app needs when it comes to authentication:</p><ul><li><strong>Self-registration</strong></li><li><strong>Login</strong></li><li><strong>Logout</strong></li><li><strong>Refresh token functionality</strong></li><li><strong>Forgot Password / Reset Password</strong></li><li><strong>Automatic locking of accounts on X number of failed password attempts</strong></li><li><strong>Email verification on new account creation</strong></li></ul><p>Payload supports as many authentication-ready collections as you need—meaning you could easily maintain a collection of Admins as well as a collection of Customers—each storing separate information and having separate access control to your documents.</p><h5>Payload's Access Control</h5><p>One of the best parts about Payload is its <a href="https://payloadcms.com/docs/access-control/overview">function-based Access Control</a>. Right in your configs, you define who can access what documents via extremely simple and straightforward Access Control functions.</p><p><strong>Here’s an example of an Orders collection with fine-tuned Access Control:</strong></p><pre><div><p><span>const</span><span> Orders </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  access</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>create</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>read</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> req</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> user </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>          owner</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> equals</span><span>:</span><span> user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>update</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> req</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> user </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>roles</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>'admin'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>delete</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div></pre><p id="6-uploads-with-local-storage"><h3>6. Uploads with local storage.</h3></p><p>Other existing CMS provide integrations to third-party file storage solutions, but those come with an additional cost, and one more third-party dependency to maintain. We want to be able to store our own file uploads, in our own contexts. If we want to ship them off to AWS S3 or similar after they’re uploaded locally—then so be it. They should be our files first though. And uploading should be simple to configure.</p><p id="7-code-based"><h3>7. Code-based.</h3></p><p>We used the ACF GUI for a while, but then realized we could be much more deliberate if we stored our ACF configs right in the PHP of our site. It was super nice to have written them, understood the code, and have them checked in directly to our repositories. Having our schemas so close to our code made referencing them significantly easier. Nowadays, we don’t find value from GUI schema designers and would rather just write them in code, pending the syntax is concise enough.</p><p id="8-maintain-your-own-express-server"><h3>8. Maintain your own Express server.</h3></p><p>We want a CMS with the right level of abstraction. That means giving us the functionality we know we won’t ever need to change, like auth and file upload, while also giving us the freedom to do what we need to do unhindered by a big lumbering framework whose docs are written for people that have Ph.Ds in Computer Science.  If we could keep our hands on our own Express server, then we could do whatever we need to do however we need to do it, outside of the CMS. Plus, if we could keep our own Express server, we could combine a CMS with a SSR framework like NextJS if we wanted to. One command, spin up Next and the CMS at once.</p><p><strong>Here’s an example for how Payload ties in to your existing Express server:</strong></p><pre><div><p><span>const</span><span> payload </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'payload'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> express </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'express'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> app </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>express</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>payload</span><span>.</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  secret</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  mongoURL</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'mongodb://localhost/payload'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  express</span><span>:</span><span> app</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>PORT</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`</span><span>Application listening on </span><span>${</span><span>3000</span><span>}</span><span>...</span><span>`</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div></pre><p id="9-localization-support"><h3>9.

Eventually, we may even become the go-to person on our team or in our organization, seen as the technical guru of our field.</p><p id="bd7c">At this level, we get a self-esteem boost, which is positive. But at times we may fall into the trap of getting an unnecessary ego. The wrong mindset creeps in, which can lead to the beginning of our downfall.</p><p id="8035">I’ve been through that journey. So I now consciously remind myself not to fall into one of those mindsets again. We’ll talk about three of them.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="fdb9">I once saw a tweet from a person who claimed his father (a programmer) offered to teach him how to code, and he rejected it. The author of the tweet is now a developer, describing himself as a self-taught programmer.</p><p id="e3c4">Programming isn’t a skill one can master completely by simply taking a course or getting a degree. A lot of sweat and time spent digging and learning is needed to build one’s competency.</p><p id="a45d">It’s not a field that can be effectively explored and fully discovered alone. We might not have a personal mentor and we may not have taken any formal courses, but that doesn’t change the fact that we still learn by reading from somewhere — whether that be a book, tutorial, blog, manual, or even Stack Overflow. All these things were written by someone.</p><p id="6607">In fact, the best way to learn programming is by working with a group of developers — through code reviews, pairings, constant discussion, and the exchange of ideas and the information learned. Attending conferences, guilds, dojos, etc. helps too.</p><p id="739c">Therefore, much of what we’ve learned and where we are today isn’t a result of our self-meditation on a mountain. Instead, it’s an accumulated assimilation of the knowledge and experience others have shared with us, either directly or indirectly.</p><p id="cc5a">We should always be grateful.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="0edf">Someone responded to one of my past blogs saying, “The young ones can’t concentrate. And their productivity is vastly lower than that of us oldsters. Their code quality is way lower.” I felt disgusted by this blanket statement targeting young programmers, even if I’m not the young one.</p><p id="c651">We learn, we grow, we age. With the advantage of time, we sometimes gain an upper hand in terms of both knowledge and experience in some area.</p><p id="10db">However, software development is an ever-changing field. One needs to continue learning to keep abreast of a skill. Over time, some of the past knowledge we acquired and spent time on is no longer relevant. When you consider what’s still relevant, the knowledge gap between older and younger programmers becomes smaller.</p><p id="15b7">At times, some area of knowledge younger programmers have might surpass us, the older folks (I consider myself an <em>older folk</em>, having worked for more than two decades). In software development, there’s been so much new knowledge to harvest in the last 10 years, and it’s not possible for us to extract it all.</p><p id="0b17">Never look down on the young ones. Respect each other, and always shamelessly ask and listen to their opinion. Be open. Avoid impostor syndrome. We might be surprised to learn a lot from those younger than us.</p><p id="28f9">The young ones are the future. They’ll shape the world one day. Teach them as much as you can, and also learn from them as much as you can. We’re not always right.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="e916">“What more is there to learn within programming? Everything new is just an old thing with a different look — or it’s just <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> or <code>for</code> loops covered by fancier names and structures externally.” I thought this back then after I’ve mastered C++ and object-oriented programming.</p><p id="0a2f">I despised Java as an inferior language to C++ and looked down on all scripts — VBScript, JavaScript, and let’s not forget HTML, which isn’t even a language to me. Python, what is it? No <code>{}</code> and, it’s optional to use <code>;</code>? Using indentation is a must??</p><p id="f535">The word<em> evolve </em>meant nothing to me, and after a decade, Python became the most used language.</p><p id="1213">I still have the utmost respect for those with competency in C programming, having the ability to work with pointers, having proper memory management, and writing code that compiles into the smallest and most efficient executable.</p><p id="e21a">However, that’s no longer what mainstream software development looks like. Web programming took the world by storm in the ‘90s and early 2000s. Since the launch of the iPhone, mobile development has become a significant player in software development. And now artificial intelligence could be the next wave, which the Python language plays a significant role in enabling.</p><p id="11c4">Fast forward to today: Now I’m getting my feet wet in mobile development, a rapidly changing field. I just realized how wrong I was back then in despising the newer yet seemingly inferior product (i.e., Java) over what I’d mastered (i.e., C++). Java has influenced many of the programming languages we have today, and its JVM is the backbone of many new languages (e.g., Scala and Kotlin).</p><p id="97ef">Never despise newer tech at a glance. It’s true most of them spawn from an existing tech and may look similar (or at times even inferior), but all of these small little changes could contribute to the next leap of change.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="7126">In the early years of my career, I worked hard and was promoted fast. My boss jokingly gave me a little advice, “Don’t get cocky.” I guess that about sums it all up.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

</p>

<p>Because of the big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach">SolarWinds hack</a> and the recent blog post describing a new <a href="https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610">Dependency Confusion attack</a>, there has been a lot of talk lately about supply chain attacks, the sneaky technique of compromising less secure elements in a supply chain to compromise more secure targets.</p>

<p>A popular target for supply chain attacks has always been the many package management systems for popular programming languages such as NPM for JavaScript, Rubygems for Ruby, and PyPI for Python. These systems have been plagued for years by malicious actors uploading malicious packages and waiting for victims to install them.</p>

<p>I haven’t heard much talk about how the situation looks for the Go ecosystem, and since Go is my new language of choice, I decided to do some investigation.</p>

<p>The novel <a href="https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610">Dependency Confusion attack</a> vector is luckily not something a Go developer has to worry about since the source is always explicitly specified when importing a package, so when Go fetches the external dependency, it can’t be confused about where to fetch it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>"github.com/stretchr/testify"</span>

<p>There is however still a possible attack vector via simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typosquatting">typosquatting</a> where the attacker exploits the fact that people often hit the wrong keys when typing on their keyboard. This could both be done on the host domain where the attacker registers a common typo of github.com, but even easier would be to simply register a new user on GitHub, or any other open package host, with a common typo of the package owner’s username.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I set out to build a tool that would help me uncover potential typosquat packages in the wild:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take a large list of Go package import paths (e.g. <code>github.com/stretchr/testify</code>)</li>
  <li>Permutate the username of every unique package owner to get a list of potential typosquats</li>
  <li>Check if any of the typosquat users exists on the platform</li>
  <li>If a potential typosquat user is found, retrieve all of their repositories</li>
  <li>Log any of the repositories that have a name equal to the original packages being checked</li>
</ol>

<p>This resulted in a new tool I call <code>pkgtwist</code> which is <a href="https://gitlab.com/michenriksen/pkgtwist">available on GitLab</a> (the name is inspired by the awesome <a href="https://github.com/elceef/dnstwist">dnstwist</a> tool)  if you are interested in doing your own evil Go package hunting.</p>

<h2 id="permutations">Permutations</h2>

<p>Probably the most important part of <code>pkgtwist</code> was the generation of good username permutations in order to have the best chance of detecting typosquats. A bit of research led me to <a href="https://github.com/zntrio/typogenerator">zntrio/typogenerater</a> which looked like the perfect package for generating potential username typos. The package implements a pretty long list of permutation strategies that I picked a few from so that pkgtwist only spends time on checking what I feel are the most likely typosquats:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Omission:</strong> removal of a single character (missing a keypress, <code>stretchr</code> =&gt; <code>strechr</code>)</li>
  <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> repetition of characters (pressing a key twice, <code>gobuffalo</code> =&gt; <code>gobuffallo</code>)</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitsquatting">Bitsquatting</a>:</strong> possible bit-flip errors (<code>stretchr</code> =&gt; <code>strftchr</code>)</li>
  <li><strong>Transposition:</strong> swapping of adjacent characters (pressing keys in the wrong order, <code>stretchr</code> =&gt; <code>strethcr</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that if pkgtwist is given the package <code>github.com/stretchr/testify</code> as input, it will check if any of the of following users exist on GitHub, and if they do, check if they have also have a repository called <code>testify</code>:</p>

<p><code>tretchr</code> <code>sretchr</code> <code>stetchr</code> <code>strtchr</code> <code>strechr</code> <code>strethr</code> <code>stretcr</code> <code>stretch</code> <code>sstretchr</code> <code>sttretchr</code> <code>strretchr</code> <code>streetchr</code> <code>strettchr</code> <code>stretcchr</code> <code>stretchhr</code> <code>stretchrr</code> <code>rtretchr</code> <code>qtretchr</code> <code>ptretchr</code> <code>wtretchr</code> <code>vtretchr</code> <code>utretchr</code> <code>ttretchr</code> <code>suretchr</code> <code>svretchr</code> <code>swretchr</code> <code>spretchr</code> <code>sqretchr</code> <code>srretchr</code> <code>ssretchr</code> <code>stsetchr</code> <code>stpetchr</code> <code>stqetchr</code> <code>stvetchr</code> <code>stwetchr</code> <code>sttetchr</code> <code>stuetchr</code> <code>strdtchr</code> <code>strgtchr</code> <code>strftchr</code> <code>stratchr</code> <code>strctchr</code> <code>strbtchr</code> <code>streuchr</code> <code>strevchr</code> <code>strewchr</code> <code>strepchr</code> <code>streqchr</code> <code>strerchr</code> <code>streschr</code> <code>stretbhr</code> <code>stretahr</code> <code>stretghr</code> <code>stretfhr</code> <code>stretehr</code> <code>stretdhr</code> <code>stretcir</code> <code>stretcjr</code> <code>stretckr</code> <code>stretclr</code> <code>stretcmr</code> <code>stretcnr</code> <code>stretcor</code> <code>stretchs</code> <code>stretchp</code> <code>stretchq</code> <code>stretchv</code> <code>stretchw</code> <code>stretcht</code> <code>stretchu</code> <code>tsretchr</code> <code>srtetchr</code> <code>stertchr</code> <code>strtechr</code> <code>strecthr</code> <code>strethcr</code> <code>stretcrh</code></p>

<h2 id="subjects">Subjects</h2>

<p>Next up was to find a list of packages to check. Initially, I thought about finding some sort of “Top X Go packages” list, but I couldn’t really find a good resource for that, so I ended up running pkgtwist against every github.com and gitlab.com hosted packages from the <a href="https://index.golang.org/index">Go Module Index</a> (731 packages in all).</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<div>
  <p><a href="https://michenriksen.com/assets/images/pkgtwist/pkgtwist_1.png"><img src="https://michenriksen.com/assets/images/pkgtwist/pkgtwist_1.png" alt=""></a></p><figcaption>pkgtwist running in verbose mode.</figcaption>
</div>

<p>After several hours of crunching through the 731 packages, pkgtwist finished with a list of 7 potential typosquat packages to investigate further. I honestly expected the list to be bigger, but I was of course happy to see that the Go ecosystem isn’t completely infested (yet) with malicious typosquat packages.</p>

<p>There were however a couple of typosquat packages that jumped out at me…</p>

<h3 id="githubcomsiruspenlogrus-️">github.com/siruspen/logrus ⚠️</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/">logrus</a> package by <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen">sirupsen</a> is a very popular logging package (17.3k stars on GitHub) that many Go projects use, which obviously makes it a target for a typosquat supply chain attack. So when I saw that the user <code>siruspen</code> (notice the letter swapping) had a similarly named repository, I quickly checked out what it was doing.</p>

<p>It turns out that the project is a fork of the original <code>logrus</code> repository, so doing a comparison to find the differences was pretty easy. At the time of writing, the only thing that is added to the potential typosquat repository, <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/compare/master...siruspen:master#diff-ff87b7c4777a35588053a509583d66c9f404ccbea9e1c71d2a5f224d7ad1323eR13-R16">is a small init function</a> with a single <code>Println</code> call:</p>

<div>
  <p><a href="https://michenriksen.com/assets/images/pkgtwist/siruspen_logrus.png"><img src="https://michenriksen.com/assets/images/pkgtwist/siruspen_logrus.png" alt=""></a></p><figcaption>Comparing siruspen/logrus with the original repository.</figcaption>
</div>

<p>While this is not malicious in any way it could very quickly be changed by the owner in the future, so I will definitely keep an eye on this repository. I would also recommend double-checking your projects if you use <code>logrus</code> to make sure you’re not using this package instead of the real one!</p>

<h3 id="githubcomutfavecli-️">github.com/utfave/cli ⚠️</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/urfave/cli">urfave/cli</a> is another popular Go package (15.4k stars on GitHub) for building CLI projects. So when I saw the user <code>utfave</code> also had a repository called <code>cli</code>, my alarm bells went off and I investigated further.</p>

<p>It turns out that the <a href="https://github.com/utfave/cli/commit/4af15496c49f613503d37d43b99df767f831bae1#diff-8d9ca23280f24fe6444d03ae46e7a15dd152170f32f57f978dfbdfd3cfe8ff55L26-R36">second-last commit</a> introduces a highly suspicious <code>init</code> function:</p>

<div>
  <p><a href="https://michenriksen.com/assets/images/pkgtwist/utfave_cli.png"><img src="https://michenriksen.com/assets/images/pkgtwist/utfave_cli.png" alt=""></a></p><figcaption>Ohai there, 122.51.124.140...</figcaption>
</div>

<p>It looks like the author <code>utfave</code> wants to know the hostname, operating system, and architecture of all the machines using their version of <code>urfave/cli</code>. The function extracts the system information and then calls out to the IP address <code>122.51.124.140</code> belonging to the Chinese company Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems via HTTP with the system information added as URL parameters.</p>

<p>While this code won’t give them any access to systems, it’s highly suspicious that they collect this information and the actor can quickly change this code to call back with a reverse shell if they identify a system to be valuable or interesting.</p>

<p>I reported this repository to GitHub and hope to see it taken down in the near future. Until then, I recommend double-checking your projects if you use the <code>urfave/cli</code> to make sure you’re not using the typosquatted version.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>While my little research project didn’t cover every single Go package out there, I feel it covered enough to give a rough picture of what the supply chain attack situation looks like for the Go ecosystem. The two repositories <code>siruspen/logrus</code> and <code>utfave/cli</code>, were the only ones out of the 7 flagged repos that really worried me, but I will keep a close eye on the rest as they could in theory become malicious at any time.</p>

<p>I think Go is in a better situation than other programming languages because the source of packages is always explicitly written every time they are used, but code editor automation could make typosquat attacks more likely to happen as the developer doesn’t write the import paths manually as often. As an example, if the popular <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go">Go extension</a> for <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> is installed, a developer will typically only type a package import on the first usage, and then the editor will automatically add the import in any other files as soon as the package name is used. If the developer mistypes the import path the first time, a malicious package could be introduced and live for a long time in a Go project before it’s discovered.</p>

<p>In this article, we set up <em>limiters</em> in order to equitably distribute the bandwidth of our Internet connection among all the users of our local network.</p>



<h2>What are <em>Limiters</em>?</h2>



<p>Generally speaking, limiters allow to define a maximum bandwidth for a purpose.<br>A limiter can be used to limit traffic to a specific IP address or subnet, to limit traffic for a specific type of service (e.g. e-mail, web, …) or to distribute traffic equitably among several users.</p>



<p>Typical uses of limiters are as follows:</p>



<ul><li>limit the Internet bandwidth of user X to 1 Mbps ;</li><li>distribute equitably 10 Mbps of bandwidth between all the users of the “LAN” network;</li><li>limit the bandwidth of the “OPT” network to a total of 5 Mbps;</li><li>limit the bandwidth of the FTP protocol to 2 Mbps.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Limiters allow to define a maximum bandwidth for a usage</strong>.<br>At the opposite, traffic shaping (like CBQ) allows to guarantee a minimum bandwidth.</p>



<h2>How limiters work?</h2>



<p>The implementation of the limiters is done in 2 steps:</p>



<ul><li>creating <strong>limiter</strong> itself: it’s a pipe with a maximum bandwidth which operates globally or by group of IP addresses;</li><li>creating assignment <strong>rules</strong>: which traffic will be limited by which pipe.</li></ul>



<p>Limiters are usually created in pairs: one limiter for incoming traffic (Download) and one limiter for outgoing traffic (Upload).</p>



<p>Limiters are organized hierarchically: a root limiter (also called a pipe), with a bandwidth and a latency, and on the other hand child limiters (called queues) with a weight (i.e. a priority).</p>



<h2>Use case: distribute Internet bandwidth equitably</h2>



<p>In this article we work with the following case study: we have an Internet connection with a download speed of 200 Mbps and an upload speed of 50 Mbps.<br>We want to share dynamically this bandwidth between all users.</p>



<p>If we have 2 users connected at the same time, they will each have 100 Mbps for download and 25 Mbps for upload at the maximum.<br>If we have 10 users connected at the same time, they will each have 20 Mbps for download and 5 Mbps for upload at the maximum.</p>



<p>pfSense will manage this equitable distribution automatically and dynamically as we go.</p>



<p>The network diagram is as follows:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="501" height="718" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/network-diagram-lan-wan-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/network-diagram-lan-wan-pfsense-provya.png 501w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/network-diagram-lan-wan-pfsense-provya-209x300.png 209w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px"><figcaption>Network diagram</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Let’s start the configuration!</p>



<h2>1. Create the upload <em>limiter</em></h2>



<p>We create 2 root limiters: one for upload and one for download.</p>



<p>Navigate to Firewall &gt; Traffic Shaper:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="156" height="238" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/menu-firewall-traffic-shaper-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Firewall &gt; Traffic Shaper</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>On the <strong>Limiters</strong> tab, click on the “+ New Limiter” button.</p>



<p>The items to be configured are the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enable</strong>: check this box to enable the pipe and its queues.</li><li><strong>Name</strong>: the name of the pipe (alphanumeric characters and underscore only). In our case, we call it “<strong>Upload</strong>“.</li><li><strong>Bandwidth</strong>: the bandwidth of the pipe. Note that we can define a bandwidth according to a schedule (“Schedule” option). In our case, we choose “50 Mbps”.</li><li><strong>Mask</strong>: this parameter allows to define how the limitation will be applied to the traffic. 3 choices are available:<ul><li><span>none</span>: the limitation will apply to all traffic as a single set. In our case, this is what we choose (we want the whole outgoing traffic to be limited to 50 Mbps).</li><li><span>Source addresses</span>: the limitation will apply per source IP address (or group of source IP addresses, depending on the mask). So, to perform a limitation by IP address of a network, we choose “Source addresses” and specify a /32 mask. This is the value we will choose when we will configure the queue of our Upload pipe.</li><li><span>Destination addresses</span>: the limitation will apply by destination IP address (or group of destination IP addresses, depending on the mask). This is the value we will choose when we will configure the queue of our Download pipe.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Description</strong>: description field, purely informative.</li><li><strong>Advanced Options</strong>: allows to set advanced parameters such as latency or packet loss rate. These parameters are useful to simulate bad Internet connections (or to make a bad joke to a colleague…). We won’t use it in our case, but the name of each field speaks for itself.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="979" height="963" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 979w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x295.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x755.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Upload pipe</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At this point we have a pipe that will allow us to limit our traffic to a maximum bandwidth of 50 Mbps.</p>



<p>The next step is to create a queue linked to this pipe and specify that this queue will be applicable per user.</p>



<p>At the bottom of the page of the limiter we just created, we click on the “+ Add new Queue” button.</p>



<p>The items to be configured are the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enable</strong>: check this box to enable the queue.</li><li><strong>Name</strong>: the name of the queue. In our case, we call it “<strong>LAN_Upload</strong>“.</li><li><strong>Mask</strong>: the mask to be applied. In our case, we choose “Source addresses”. We want to apply this limitation for each user, i.e. per source IP address, so we choose “32” as mask size.</li><li><strong>Description</strong>: description field, purely informative.</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: weight ranging from 1 (lowest priority) to 100 (highest priority). For a fair distribution of the bandwidth of the root limiter, this field can be left empty. If we want to give more bandwidth to some users than to others, then we have to play with this value. In our case, we leave the field empty (the distribution will be fair between users).</li><li><strong>Advanced Options</strong>: we leave these fields empty.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="979" height="802" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 979w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x246.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x629.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Upload queue</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Our limiters (pipe and queue) are ready for outgoing (upload) traffic.</p>



<p>We still have to do the same configuration for incoming (download) traffic.</p>



<h2>2. Create the download <em>limiter</em></h2>



<p>We click on the “+ New Limiter” button.</p>



<p>The pipe configuration is the same as for the upload pipe.<br>You just have to think about choosing the right bandwidth (in our case, 200 Mbps) and changing its name (in our case, we call it “Download”).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="977" height="910" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 977w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x279.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x715.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Download pipe</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As for the upload pipe, we create a queue: click on the button “+ Add new Queue”.</p>



<p>The configuration is almost the same as for the upload queue.<br>The difference is in the choice for the “Mask” option. Choose “Destination addresses”.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="979" height="798" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 979w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x245.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x626.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Download queue</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The limiters are created:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="146" height="123" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiters-list-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Limiters tree</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>3. Modify firewall rules</h2>



<p>The last step is to configure the firewall to associate traffic with limiters.</p>



<p>Navigate to Firewall &gt; Rules:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="160" height="241" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/menu-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Firewall &gt; Rules</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Choose the LAN tab and edit each filtering rule for Internet access.</p>



<p>On each rule, go to the advanced options (“Display Advanced” button):</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="405" height="244" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/advanced-options-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/advanced-options-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya.png 405w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/advanced-options-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Advanced Options</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At the bottom of the page, for the “In / Out pipe” option, choose “<strong>LAN_Upload</strong>” for the first drop-down list and “<strong>LAN_Download</strong>” for the second:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="791" height="126" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya.png 791w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya-300x48.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya-768x122.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px"><figcaption>[pfSense] In / Out pipe (limiters)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It is necessary to perform this manipulation on all the rules concerned.</p>



<p>The traffic limitation per user is in place!</p>



<h2>4. Check the service</h2>



<p>To check that the limiters are working properly, navigate to Diagnostics &gt; Limiter Info.<br>Each pipe and its queues is presented in text format with its parameters and values.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2021-03-01</span>. Modified on <span id="moddate">2021-03-02</span>.</p>
<p>Are you a JavaScript framework or library fan-boy? One of those frontend developers who cannot figure out how to build a website without completely smothering and drowning everything in JavaScript? Well, if you are, let me share a JavaScript nightmare with you!</p>

<p>These last couple of days I have been working for a company that contacted me because they where suffering from some "hacking" problems on their website. The company is run by two hardworking entrepreneurs, who know a lot about how to run a successful business, but close to nothing about computer related security.</p>

<p>These guys naturally trusted their entire IT infrastructure to a couple of external IT companies and they also used a couple of one-man freelance developers for different smaller tasks.</p>

<p>It is a real shame, but I must admit that I am not surprised at my findings. None of these IT companies or one-man freelance developers had the least knowledge about security. What they did is just about what everyone else is doing these days - blindly following hype and trends!</p>

<p><img src="http://unixsheikh.com/includes/images/blind-following.jpg" alt="Drawing of people blindly following other people"><br><strong>Monkey see, monkey do - blind following</strong></p>

<p>I'm going to skip ahead because the complexity of the problems are almost too difficult to describe, but let's just say that everything is a mess! From how the computers at the office are being used, to the implemented password policy, to lacking firewall implementations, to yes, just about everything is a problem. However, despite multiple possible attack vectors can you guess where the attackers actually have chosen to focus their payload?</p>

<p><b>JavaScript obfuscated malware</b>.</p>

<p>I would have expected that the websites would be infested with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_shell">web shells</a>, SPAM bots, cross site scripting, and all the other "good stuff", but no.</p>

<p>The company has more than one website, but all are of those kinds that are drowning in unneeded JavaScript from head to toe. Absolutely nothing works on these websites without all of this JavaScript crap - yet, absolutely nothing of what the JavaScript is doing is truly needed or even useful!</p>

<p>As I was going through the code, trying very hard to figure out what was going on in this JavaScript nightmare, I eventually had to give up. It would literally take weeks, if not months to de-obfuscate everything and figure out what was legitimate usage and what was malware.</p>

<p>And that's typical of todays web developers. I cannot count the number of sites I have seen that is filled with utterly useless JavaScript functionality.</p>

<p><strong>And I'm sick of it!</strong></p>

<p>If you're a frontend developer reading this, and you're a JavaScript fan-boy, <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/stop-pushing-javascript.html">Stop pushing JavaScript!</a></p>

<p>As a frontend developer you're responsible for your client and their customers. Your stupid JavaScript is a prime target for inserting obfuscated malware so you better make sure it is truly needed, and you better make sure that it is easy to validate!</p>

<p><strong>We don't need JavaScript for the majority of websites on the Internet! It's causing much more harm than good!</strong></p>

<p>For everyone who isn't a frontend developer: Make sure you run your browser in a secure jail, disable JavaScript in your browser or use something like <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> and boycott websites that has made their basic functionality dependent on JavaScript - you're seriously in risk of getting infected with malware just by visiting a website unless you take your precautions. And no, anti-virus software isn't going to help you!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>MasterPlan is an idea board and project manager.&nbsp; It has the ability to create objects&nbsp;like:</p>
<ul><li>To-do lists</li><li>Timers</li><li>Images, GIFs, and Sounds</li><li>Deadlines</li><li>and Maps...</li></ul>
<p>... on a freeform grid, allowing you to <strong>plan&nbsp;projects out</strong>. You can use MasterPlan&nbsp;your way, whether as a moodboard for&nbsp;art, or as a productivity planner for your next big&nbsp;video game.</p>
<p>You can tweak how it looks to your liking, with themes and different visual&nbsp;options.&nbsp;The goal is to make it easy to plan out ideas, and to give you flexibility while doing so.</p>
<p>MasterPlan is currently in early access, and is receiving regular, steady updates that improve the functionality and usability of the program. These updates are <strong>lifetime</strong> updates and&nbsp;will remain free of charge for those who purchase MasterPlan. The cost of MasterPlan may rise as it becomes more and more feature-complete, naturally.</p>
<p>Note that the&nbsp;free demo of MasterPlan showcases its full functionality, but lacks the ability to save projects.</p>
<h4>How is it?</h4>
<p>Good!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HOWEVER! MasterPlan is currently in its early access phase, and will receive&nbsp;updates regularly over time improving the stability of the program. I would recommend saving often and using it with a version control system to make it possible to roll back your plan in case of mistakes.</strong></p>
<p>Also note that only 64-bit builds are available currently; if there is a demand for 32-bit builds, please let me know and I'll see if I can get an easy way&nbsp;to build them.&nbsp;If you're feeling hacky or frugal, the complete source code for MasterPlan is available for perusal, building, and contribution on its GitHub repository&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/SolarLune/masterplan" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.<br></p>
<h3>Steam?</h3>
<p>MasterPlan is now available on&nbsp;Steam, as well. If you purchase MasterPlan here,&nbsp;you will also be&nbsp;entitled to a free Steam key, accessible from the project download page.</p>
<p>____</p>
<p><strong>Recommended system requirements</strong></p>
<ul><li>Recent 64-bit&nbsp;versions of Windows (&gt;= 7), Mac&nbsp;(&gt;= 10.14), or Linux&nbsp;(&gt;= Ubuntu 18.04)</li><li>OpenGL 3.3-capable graphics card</li><li>A&nbsp;sound card</li><li>For clipboard support on&nbsp;Linux, a clipboard tool needs to be installed (any of xsel, xclip, or wl-clipboard). For file manager support on Linux, a file manager needs to be installed (any of&nbsp;zenity, qarma, or matedialog)</li></ul></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[A not so classic Chip8 emulator]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I always found emulators amazing pieces of software. The first I used was a SNES one, that I use to play some classic games I never was able to get when I was a kid. I thought those <em>beasts</em> were <em>black magic</em>, something I will never be able to grasp.</p><h2>Motivations</h2><p>I basically wanted to improve my OpenGL (and C++) skills through a fun project.
I always wanted to make an emulator, and the Chip8 is a fairly easy one to
start with. So why not making the rendering 3D to be able to move “inside”
the game.</p><p>Here is a small video of what it looks like:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3pDNioWFzI">youtube</a></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JWF4xeW.gif" alt="video"></p><h2>About Chip8</h2><p>The Chip 8 is actually a virtual machine developed in the 70s by Joseph Weisbecker. So it was never a real console to begin with but we still can emulate it. There have been plenty of games written for it so we can run them later in our emulator.</p><p>This is probably the easiest emulator you can start with, since it has a very small number of opcodes and they are pretty simple to implement. You can find easily on the internet the specifications needed to be implemented. For instance on this <a href="http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM">website</a>.</p><p><img src="https://api.jeromem.dev/uploads/chip8_2_b4be3fe963.png" alt="chip8-2.png"></p><h2>C++ data modeling</h2><pre><code><span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>Cpu</span><span>
</span></span><span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span><span><span>    </span><span>uint16_t</span><span> opcode;
</span></span><span>    Memory &amp; memory;
</span><span><span>    </span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>array</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint8_t</span><span>, 16&gt; registers;

</span></span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>So as we can see that machine is very simple. We've got 4Kb memory to work with, 16 registers and then some variables where we are storing the current opcode, the current index and the value of the program counter (pc).  There is two timers that are clocked at 60Hz. Each one of them should be decremented 60 times per second. If the <code>timerSound</code> is above 0, we should play a sound.</p><p>If you are interested in knowing more about it, you should check this <a href="https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/">guide</a> which explains a lot more things than me.</p><h2>Rendering</h2><p>Usually the games are rendered in a <code>64 * 32</code> framebuffer. To make mine a bit different from the others I decided to treat each pixels as a <em>cube</em>. Each single pixel is treated as an entity to be drawn, this is definitively not the most efficient way of doing it, but for such a small number of pixels it went well with an average of 200 fps on a machine without a dedicated graphic card.</p><p><img src="https://api.jeromem.dev/uploads/chip8_1_a9afb7f689.png" alt="chip8-1.png"></p><p>The 3D engine is a simple basic <strong>OpenGL</strong> renderer with a few shaders for the shadows and lights and a very basic <em>free fly camera</em>. The most important part is to render those array of pixels into cubes and translating it into 3D using matrices.</p><pre><code><span><span>auto</span><span> view = camera.getViewMatrix();
</span></span><span><span></span><span>auto</span><span> projection = glm::perspective(camera.getZoom(), </span><span>2.0f</span><span>, </span><span>0.1f</span><span>, </span><span>500.0f</span><span>);
</span></span><span><span></span><span>auto</span><span> cameraPosition = camera.getPosition();

            <p>The if-statement is a very basic thing, not just in bash, but in all of programming.
I see them used quite a lot in shell scripts,
even though in many cases they can be replaced with something much more elegant.</p>
<p>In this rather short article, I'll show how control operators can be used
instead.
Many probably know about this, but don't realize how to use them nicely.
This will help you write cleaner shell scripts in the future.</p>
<p>Here is what a simple if-statements looks like in bash:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>if </span><span>[</span><span> expression </span><span>]
</span><span>then
    </span><span>command
</span><span>fi

</span><span># or
</span><span>if </span><span>[</span><span> expression </span><span>]; then </span><span>command</span><span>; fi
</span></code></pre>
<p>Ughh. Let's improve!</p>
<h2 id="control-operators">Control operators
    <a href="#control-operators" aria-label="Anchor link for: control-operators">
        #
    </a>

</h2>
<p>Bash provides <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Definitions.html#Definitions">control operators</a> to build sequences of
commands.
Some of these are conditional and allow logical branching based on the success
state of the last run command.</p>
<p>We will just focus on these two logical operators:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&amp;&amp;</code>: the AND operator, run the following command only if previous succeeded</li>
<li><code>||</code>: the OR operator, run the following command only if previous failed</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exit-codes">Exit codes
    <a href="#exit-codes" aria-label="Anchor link for: exit-codes">
        #
    </a>

</h2>
<p>You might wonder how bash considers whether a command succeeded.
This is where <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status">exit codes</a> come in.
When a program exits a numeric status code is returned.
A value of <code>0</code> means the program succeeded, any other value means it failed.</p>
<p>The exit code is normally hidden.
The status of the last run command is stored in the <code>?</code> variable.
You may inspect it by invoking:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>echo </span><span>$</span><span>?
</span></code></pre>
<p>E.g., listing with <code>ls</code> normally returns <code>0</code>, but this value differs if the
directory doesn't exist or if an error occurred.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>ls ~</span><span>/            </span><span># exit code: 0
</span><span>ls </span><span>~</span><span>/nonexistent </span><span># exit code: 2
</span></code></pre>
<p>This will function similarly to almost any program.</p>
<h2 id="chaining-commands">Chaining commands
    <a href="#chaining-commands" aria-label="Anchor link for: chaining-commands">
        #
    </a>

</h2>
<p>Let's go over some examples to show how these control operators can be used.</p>
<p>Imagine you want to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Source_command">source</a> the <code>~/.profile</code> file, but only if it
is readable:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>if </span><span>[ </span><span>-r </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile </span><span>]</span><span>; then
    </span><span>source </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile
</span><span>fi
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can simplify this using control operators:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[ </span><span>-r </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile </span><span>] </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>. </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile
</span></code></pre>
<p>Only if the readability check expression is truthful/succeeds, we want to source
the file, so we use the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator.</p>

<p>To require invoking user to be root, we can do the following:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[ </span><span>$</span><span>EUID </span><span>-ne</span><span> 0 </span><span>] </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>echo</span><span> You must be root </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>exit</span><span> 1
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>echo</code> command exists with <code>0</code>, so this propagates to <code>exit</code> if the
first expression is truthful.</p>

<p>If we'd like to print our profile file contents with a success message,
or an error message on reading failure, we can do the following:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>cat ~</span><span>/.profile </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>echo</span><span> This is your profile </span><span>|| </span><span>echo</span><span> Failed to read profile
</span></code></pre>
<p>You can make these command sequences as long as you want. Useful for
building install scripts that go through a series of steps. You could define
bash functions for each step and orchestrate the installation like this:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>init </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>configure </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>install </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>cleanup </span><span>|| </span><span>echo</span><span> Install failed
</span></code></pre>
<p>Or format it differently to make long sequences better readable:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>init </span><span>&amp;&amp;
  </span><span>configure </span><span>&amp;&amp;
  </span><span>install </span><span>&amp;&amp;
  </span><span>cleanup </span><span>||
  </span><span>echo</span><span> Install failed
</span></code></pre><h2 id="nice-to-know">Nice to know
    <a href="#nice-to-know" aria-label="Anchor link for: nice-to-know">
        #
    </a>

</h2>
<p>There are <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/159514/61092">many</a> more control operators,
including list terminators, pipe operators, and others.</p>
<p>The <code>[</code> (commonly used in if-statements) isn't just a shell feature.
It is a binary on Unix-like systems, usually located at <code>/usr/bin/[</code>,
so it can be used anywhere.
It returns the exit code <code>0</code> if the expression was truthful.</p>
<p>You can chain multiple <code>[ expr ] &amp;&amp; [ expr ]</code> expressions together, they are
commands after all.</p>
<p>Bash also has <code>[[</code>, which is
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/13542832/1000145">different</a> from <code>[</code>.</p>
<p>You can wrap multiple commands with <code>{ expr }</code> to run it as single expression in
your command chain. For example:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[ </span><span>$</span><span>EUID </span><span>-ne</span><span> 0 </span><span>] </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>{ </span><span>echo</span><span> You must be root</span><span>; </span><span>exit</span><span> 1 }
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> commands do nothing more than returning <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Bash features <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html#Shell-Parameter-Expansion">parameter expression</a>.
You can use <code>${EDITOR:=nvim}</code> to set the <code>EDITOR</code> variable to <code>nvim</code> only if
it is empty, so you won't even need conditionals.</p>
<p>Most other shells support similar operators. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a> uses <code>; and</code> and <code>; or</code>, but now <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4620">supports</a> <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> as well in modern versions.</p>
<p><code>$_</code> (or <code>Alt+.</code>) is your last used argument (noted by <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://lobste.rs/s/nao13f/elegant_bash_conditionals#c_brp038">@Diti</a>).
For example:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>test</span><span> -f </span><span>"</span><span>FILE</span><span>" </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>source </span><span>"$</span><span>_</span><span>" </span><span>|| </span><span>echo </span><span>"$</span><span>_</span><span> does not exist</span><span>" </span><span>&gt;&amp;</span><span>2
</span></code></pre>
<p>A function or script returns the exit code of the last expression. If your last
expression is a command chain as described in this article, you might have an
unexpected exit code. See
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/lw0ofg/elegant_bash_conditionals/gpf1lr0/">this</a>
comments.</p>

</h2>
<p>These command sequences with control operators are an elegant alternative for
simple if-statements. I think they look much better and are more expressive
looking at conditional logic.</p>
<p>But, don't overuse them. For bigger statements or advanced branching, you should
fall back to if-statements.</p>
<p>I hope this article motivates you to make your shell scripts a little more
elegant in the future by using these operators.</p>

Tom Muench, a city councillor in Richmond Hill, Ont., just north of Toronto, said newspapers are critical to&nbsp;the functioning of a healthy democracy, so it gives him pause that such a prominent newspaper chain may be financially beholden to an outside business to keep its doors open.</p>  <p>"I think it's fair to say that if a casino was to pop up in communities say six&nbsp;months ago, many local Torstar-owned papers&nbsp;would write a concerned local story," he told CBC News in an email.</p>  <p>He also wonders how those same newspapers would report on it, if any other sort of business were to open an online gambling operation on the side.</p>  <p>"If the federal government propped up the media with government tax dollars and now with casinos, how do we assure a strong independent news and media industry?"&nbsp;</p>  </span></p></div></div>]]>

<h2>It Can Happen to You</h2>
<p>A few days ago, a <a href="https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/">fascinating article</a>
about Grand Theft Auto Online
made the rounds of the tech news ecosystem.</p>
<p>I'd encourage you to read the whole thing, but in short,
GTA Online had <a href="https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/">accidentally quadratic</a>
performance when parsing a large JSON blob
(due to repeated calls to <code>strlen</code>);
fixing this improved loading time by almost 70%.</p>
<p>This sparked a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26296339">great deal</a> of discussion:
Was this C's fault?
Perhaps <a href="https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Blow/status/1366452792563359744">"web shit"</a>?
<a href="https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime/status/1366187333507293184">Capitalism and incentives</a>?</p>
<p>Still, folks in the comments section generally agreed:
<em>they</em> wouldn't write anything that silly.</p>
<p>(<em>do you feel the foreshadowing?</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>One of my side projects is a high-performance 3D viewer named <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/erizo">Erizo</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/blog/2021-03-01-happen/porsche.png" alt="Porsche"></p>
<p>Thanks to a lot of careful programming, it will open a 97 MB binary STL
file in about 165 milliseconds flat, on a <em>2013</em> Macbook Pro.
This is <strong>blinding</strong> fast.</p>
<p>In the interest of compatibility, I wrote a small parser for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)#ASCII_STL">ASCII STLs</a> as well.</p>
<p>ASCII STLs are a poorly-specified plain-text format that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>solid cube_corner
          facet normal 0.0 -1.0 0.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 0.0 1.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          facet normal 0.0 0.0 -1.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 1.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          ...
endsolid
</code></pre>
<p>I wrote an extremely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">robust</a>
parser, described in a comment as</p>
<pre><code>/*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
 *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
</code></pre>
<p>Loading ASCII STLs always seemed a little slow, but I assumed
that's what you get for using an inefficient textual format.</p>
<p>(<em>foreshadowing intensifies</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the course of a few days, several things happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>I revisited Erizo for the first time in a few years to fix a <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/erizo/commit/d4683f94a4aa0b674bdde0fa53fb6f92d6e1979c">focus issue on macOS</a></li>
<li>The GTA Online article was published</li>
<li>In a follow-up discussion, I learned that
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26302744">parsing could be quadratic due to repeated calls to <code>sscanf</code></a></li>
<li>I noticed that ASCII STL loading was <em>really quite</em> slow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the timestamped logs (in seconds), loading a 1.5 MB ASCII STL:</p>
<pre><code>[erizo] (0.000000) main.c:10      | Startup!
[erizo] (0.162895) window.c:91    | Created window

</code></pre>
<p>From startup to showing the window, it took over 1.8 seconds!</p>
<p>Looking at the ASCII parser with fresh eyes, the cause was glaringly obvious:</p>
<pre><code>    /*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
     *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
    const char VERTEX_STR[] = "vertex ";
    while (1) {
        data = strstr(data, VERTEX_STR);
        if (!data) {
            break;
        }

        /* Skip to the first character after 'vertex' */
        data += strlen(VERTEX_STR);

        for (unsigned i=0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {

            ABORT_IF(r == 0 || r == EOF, "Failed to parse float");
            if (buf_size == buf_count) {
                buf_size *= 2;
                buffer = (float*)realloc(buffer, buf_size * sizeof(float));
            }
            buffer[buf_count++] = f;

            SKIP_WHILE(!isspace);

<p>You may notice <code>sscanf</code>, happily sitting there, reading a single float off
the front of the data stream and <strong>checking the length of the whole string each time</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, I had made the exact same mistake as the programmers working on GTA Online:
I had an accidentally quadratic parser!</p>
<p>Replacing the <code>sscanf</code> call with <code>strtof</code> improved startup by nearly a factor of
10: from 1.8 seconds to 199 milliseconds.</p>

<hr>
<p>As someone that has been programming for many years,
this was a perfectly-timed reminder that there are <em>always</em> pitfalls out there.
The <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/c/fscanf">documentation for <code>sscanf</code></a>
does not include a time complexity,
so this is particularly tricky <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun">footgun</a>,
and I'm sure it's not the only one lurking in the darkness.</p>
<p>You may not get such a perfectly-timed reminder, but it's worth remembering –
next time you read a fascinating story about bad programming –
that it <em>can</em> happen to you!</p>
<p>(Obviously, the moral of the story is to not use <code>sscanf</code> to repeatedly
parse single tokens off the front of a string; I'm sure you'll do <em>fine</em>
if you can just avoid <strong>that</strong>)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was opening multiple shells for an unrelated project today and noticed how abysmal my shell load speed was. After the initial load it was relatively fast, but the actual shell start up was noticeably slow. I timed it with <code>time</code> and these were the results.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/origzsh.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/origzsh.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Original zsh profile" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/origzsh.png"></picture><p>You can time your own shell with:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>for </span>i <span>in</span> <span>$(</span><span>seq </span>1 10<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>do</span> /usr/bin/time <span>$SHELL</span> <span>-i</span> <span>-c</span> <span>exit</span><span>;</span> <span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Raw <code>bash</code>, as a comparison, was blazing fast - it averaged 0.03 seconds, with about 0.02 in user-land and 0.01 in kernel. This is with an empty <code>.bashrc</code> and other dotfiles, so it would prove to be a lower bound/goal.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/rawbash.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/rawbash.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Raw bash speeds" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/rawbash.png"></picture><p>I was averaging 3.14 seconds, with 1.64 in user-land and 1.5 in kernel-land.</p><p>My zsh set up was nearly 100x slower than raw bash. I wanted to investigate what was going on, and why it was so much slower.</p><h3 id="intro">Intro</h3><p>Before we begin, it might be helpful to understand how shells in general start up. Shells are just an executable like any other on your machine - their purpose is to just take user input and behave like an old terminal. They have predefined control sequences, but in general are fairly extensible. The following is from ZSH man pages:</p><blockquote><p>Commands are first read from /etc/zshenv; this cannot be overridden. … Commands are then read from $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv. If the shell is a login shell, commands are read from /etc/zprofile and then $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile. Then, if the shell is interactive, commands are read from /etc/zshrc and then $ZDOT-DIR/.zshrc. Finally, if the shell is a login shell, /etc/zlogin and $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin are read.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When a login shell exits, the files $ZDOTDIR/.zlogout and then /etc/zlogout are read.</p></blockquote><p>The following files are read:</p><div><div><pre><code>$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv
$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile
$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc
$ZDOTDIR/.zlogin
$ZDOTDIR/.zlogout
${TMPPREFIX}*   (default is /tmp/zsh*)
/etc/zshenv
/etc/zprofile
/etc/zshrc
/etc/zlogin
/etc/zlogout    (installation-specific - /etc is the default)
</code></pre></div></div><p>This gives a general flow of execution, and where zsh starts. My <code>.zshrc</code> leads to <code>source</code>ing a few other files, which just behaves as if the contents of those files was passed directly into the shell as standard input.</p><h3 id="profiling">Profiling</h3><p>We can start by profiling raw <code>zsh</code> - it’s even faster than raw bash.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/rawzsh.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/rawzsh.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Raw zsh speeds" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/rawzsh.png"></picture><p>The first step is to figure out exactly what’s taking so long - there are a variety of tools to measure performance, but the most useful will be <code>zsh</code>’s native debug tools.</p><p>This enables <code>xtrace</code>ing and <code>verbose</code> output. It’s not particularly great for time analysis, though - it does not include timestamps, so we have to eyeball the speed. It’s easy to catch a few immediate culprits - for instance, mine hung for at least a second on loading <code>nvm</code>. Anything that is a few orders of magnitude slower than the other commands will stick out like a sore thumb.</p><p>The second is an order-blind profiler - at the top of <code>.zshrc</code>, insert <code>zmodload zsh/zprof</code>. This will enable the built in profiling.</p><p>At the end of <code>.zshrc</code> insert <code>zprof</code>.</p><p>The output will look as follows:</p><div><div><pre><code>num  calls                time                       self            name

</code></pre></div></div><p>This will tell us exactly where <code>zsh</code> is spending most of it’s time.</p><h3 id="fixing-the-problem">Fixing the problem</h3><p>I started by playing around with high-level entry points. For instance, disabling <code>source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh</code> from my <code>~/.zshrc</code> cut my load time down by half, to roughly 1.7 seconds average. I then disabled <code>nvm</code> and my times plummeted. I had found the main two culprits of slow load times.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/zshNoOmzNoNvm.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/zshNoOmzNoNvm.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Zsh speeds with no Oh my zsh or nvm" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/zshNoOmzNoNvm.png"></picture><p>My new average had become only 40 milliseconds. I didn’t want to lose the functionality that oh-my-zsh provided, however, so I looked into improving it.</p><p>I started profiling specific subsections of oh-my-zsh like so:</p><div><div><pre><code><span># I use gdate from brew's core-utils because macOS date does not support nanoseconds</span>
<span>timer</span><span>=</span><span>$((</span><span>$(</span>gdate +%s%N<span>)</span><span>/</span><span>1000000</span><span>))</span> 

<span># Original .zshrc/config file</span>

<span>now</span><span>=</span><span>$((</span><span>$(</span>gdate +%s%N<span>)</span><span>/</span><span>1000000</span><span>))</span>
<span>elapsed</span><span>=</span><span>$((</span><span>$now</span><span>-</span><span>$timer</span><span>))</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>$elapsed</span><span>":"</span> <span>$plugin</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>I wrapped all the plugin loading and sourcing, and profiled each one.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/profiledfuncs.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/profiledfuncs.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Profile functions" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/profiledfuncs.png"></picture><p>The plugin <code>command-not-found</code> was the main slow down of <code>Oh-My-Zsh</code>. I went through and disabled the plugins I didn’t use much and got my shell load time down.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/postopt.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/postopt.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Post changes to startup" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/postopt.png"></picture><p>My new shell start time was about half a second. <code>Oh-My-Zsh</code> still took up the majority of it, but I believe it to be a valuable addition. I do wish it put a bit more of an emphasis on performance, however.</p><p>The last thing to do is to lazy load functions and services that I don’t need. I found a <a href="https://github.com/benvan/sandboxd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">great sandbox lazyloader here</a> that was useful for nvm/rvm. Any command invocation of nvm from terminal, script, or otherwise still succeeds, it just gets lazy loaded the first time it’s invoked.</p><h3 id="observations">Observations</h3><p>Oh-My-Zsh is great and provides a lot of functionality, but it comes at a fairly heavy cost. As you can see above, it’s overhead accounts for nearly 70% of my load time.</p><p>There is one other thing of note - <code>oh-my-zshzsh</code> provides a built in function, <code>vcs_info</code>, to provide information about the the version control status of the current working directory. However, this is quite slow! For the actual Zsh git repo, it takes about <em>200ms</em> to parse. In large projects with a heavy git history this will hang your prompt return time for seconds. This won’t necessarily impact shell start time, but it will impact the amount of time it takes to actually display the prompt when navigating within a VCS-belonging directory. This can be slightly fixed with <code>git config oh-my-zsh.hide-status 1</code> on problematic repos, but it would be nice if it did so automatically. Setting the option <code>DISABLE_UNTRACKED_FILES_DIRTY="true"</code> in your <code>.zshrc</code> can help as well, but comes with a loss of functionality.</p><p>Finally, a lot of time is spent in <code>compinit</code> and <code>compdef</code>. These are functions that create/define entries in the local completions cache (the <code>~/.zcompdump-machinename</code> file you might’ve noticed). There are a few hacks floating around GitHub, HackerNews, and various forums that try to remedy this (only check once a day, only check on new shell logins, etc), but none are particularly robust/without side effects.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>In the future I hope to actually recompile zsh with additional profiling techniques and debug information - keeping an internal timer and having a flag output current time for each command in a tree fashion would make building heat maps really easy.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/zsh_final.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/zsh_final.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Final zsh speeds" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/zsh_final.png"></picture><p>I ended with zsh taking about 0.42 seconds, or 420 milliseconds, to start up. Disabling Oh-My-Zsh gets the average down further to roughly 50ms. For now the extra 380 or so milliseconds are worth it, but I might be tempted to try another framework if I can’t get it any faster.</p><h3 id="final-note">Final Note</h3><p>While initial start time can (and should) be optimized, it pales in comparison to the importance of <em>prompt</em> return time.</p><p>In a typical workflow you’re returning to your prompt hundreds of times more than you’re actually starting new shell sessions. I’d like to profile prompt time much more, as I’ve noticed that even a 10% gain is noticeable (and much more important, as waiting any longer than half a second for a prompt will quickly become infuriating). As mentioned above, my largest culprit for prompt return time was <code>vcs_info</code> - I mostly work out of directories that have a git repo attached, and it’s very noticeable there.</p><h4 id="resources">Resources</h4><p>Here are a few resources I consulted while working on this post.</p><ul><li><a href="https://gist.github.com/ctechols/ca1035271ad134841284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://gist.github.com/ctechols/ca1035271ad134841284</a></li><li><a href="https://carlosbecker.com/posts/speeding-up-zsh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://carlosbecker.com/posts/speeding-up-zsh/</a></li><li><a href="https://wpsuperheroes.com/slow-osx-terminal-oh-my-zsh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wpsuperheroes.com/slow-osx-terminal-oh-my-zsh/</a></li><li><a href="https://bennycwong.github.io/post/speeding-up-oh-my-zsh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bennycwong.github.io/post/speeding-up-oh-my-zsh/</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/5327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/5327</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/6056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/6056</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.peiyingchi.com/2017/08/17/speed-up-oh-my-zsh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://blog.peiyingchi.com/2017/08/17/speed-up-oh-my-zsh/</a></li><li><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/236953/zsh-starts-incredibly-slowly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://superuser.com/questions/236953/zsh-starts-incredibly-slowly</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.patshead.com/2011/04/improve-your-oh-my-zsh-startup-time-maybe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://blog.patshead.com/2011/04/improve-your-oh-my-zsh-startup-time-maybe.html</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/benvan/sandboxd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/benvan/sandboxd</a></li></ul><p>Additionally, the specific dot files that I used above, in their original state, can be found <a href="https://github.com/jonluca/dotfiles/tree/551234df4d4527d6990ae3ea681bf015da8a0570" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p></div></div>]]>

<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2019-07-02</span>. Modified on <span id="moddate">2019-09-19</span>.</p>
<p>Frontend developers are pushing JavaScript as though the web could not function without it. The fact is that JavaScript is one of the top reasons for security breaches on the client computer and client mobile phones, it is a plague that turns privacy into a public exhibition, and it has paralyzed the industry in such a way that you can hardly find a website that doesn't display "the white screen of death" if JavaScript has been disabled in the browser.</p>
<p>I'm gonna say it straight out: Frontend developers are breaking the Internet! They have been stricken with some kind of mass psychosis in which even the least amount of independent thinking has become so hard that you think you're dealing with a zombie. It doesn't even qualify as a form of blind following, because nobody is leading. It rather looks like everyone is running around frenzied.</p>
<p>If you're pushing JavaScript as a dependency for your website to function, you'd better be serving some pretty amazing and special content, otherwise your website is just plain broken!</p>
<p>I have worked as both backend and frontend developer since 1998 and I have never once made a web application depend upon JavaScript. This goes for web shops, blog systems, large CMS installations, as well as Intranet administration utilities, and much more. In situations where I have been hired as a consultant to an existing team, the first thing I have done was to remove any dependency on JavaScript.</p>
<p>Not once has a client ever experienced a problem with his web application as a result, rather on the contrary. Removing JavaScript makes the application load much faster, removes multiple security related attack vectors, and greatly improves customer privacy concerns and usability.</p>
<p>If you know what you're doing you can simulate much of the improved UI experience that JavaScript can provide using only backend technology. The much improved performance, security, and privacy far exceed whatever loss of JavaScript capabilities you might experience.</p>
<p>The problem resides with websites that by nature doesn't require any form of JavaScript in order to serve the content they are serving. And the fact of the matter is that the majority of frontend developers aren't developing applications for niche markets with specific JavaScript requirements, rather they are developing regular websites, applications that in the end are just plain simple HTML. You do remember what plain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> is right?</p>
<p>Even most niche products that in nature perhaps do require some amount of JavaScript could often still be somewhat useful had they at least been build <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/opt_in">opt-in</a> rather than not function at all.</p>
<p>Also, have you ever seen how a blind person uses the Internet? If not you need to have this demonstrated! Especially if you're a frontend developer. You might think that blind people who use the Internet are a minority, but the fact of the matter is that it doesn't matter how many people with disabilities use the Internet, the Internet is for everybody, and when websites are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them. Currently most websites are developed without the least concern for accessibility which makes them difficult or impossible for some people to use and the way JavaScript is being used is a very big part of that problem.</p>
<p>Websites that create barriers for people with disabilities are generally just badly designed. Making websites accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society. And you, as a frontend developer, must understand that it is part of your responsibility to make sure that your web application contains as few barriers as possible. If you don't do that, then why are you doing frontend development in the first place?</p>
<p>Web development is not about how to make the work fast and easy for the "lazy" frontend developer who long since has forgotten how to manually do anything and as a result no longer knows or understands how to put a simple website together without the use of a barrier producing framework or technology.</p>
<p>The optimal solution will always be to make sure that basic functionality works without JavaScript.</p>
<p>Another point worth mentioning is that more and more people disable JavaScript uncompromisingly, using extensions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoScript">NoScript</a>, due to very valid security concerns. If a website isn't working without JavaScript it is loosing potential visitors and customers on a regular basis. If you only use a JavaScript based statistics system, such as Googles Analytics, then you won't even see the problem. You need to look into the statistics running on the backend such as the webserver logs to see how many visitors that visit your website without JavaScript enabled.</p>
<p>Security issues from third party JavaScript widgets and JavaScript libraries are vulnerable aspects of JavaScript that is actively exploited on a massive scale. Security issues in browsers, such as <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-18/#CVE-2019-11707">CVE-2019-11707</a> and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-19/">CVE-2019-11708</a>, are highly critical issues that are completely mitigated if JavaScript is disabled or removed completely. CVE-2019-11707 is a type confusion vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox that can result in an exploitable crash due to issues in Array.pop which can occur when manipulating JavaScript objects. CVE-2019-11708 is a sandbox escape vulnerability in Prompt:Open Inter-process communication (IPC) messages due to insufficient vetting of parameters. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a non-sandboxed parent process to open web content from a compromised child process using a specially crafted Prompt:Open IPC message between the child and parent process. Combining CVE-2019-11708 and CVE-2019-11707 can result <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution">in arbitrary code execution</a>.</p>
<p>JavaScript in the client is not a necessary evil. It is a tool that with great and meticulous care can improve the user experience to a certain degree in some unique situations, but if you are making your regular and non-unique web application depend upon JavaScript, then that is a clear sign that you are doing something very wrong.</p>
<p>Stop pushing JavaScript as a dependency just to make a regular and stupid website run!</p>

<p><time>March 1, 2021</time></p><p>TL;DR: People are unlikely to make swift changes to their core behaviors. By
detecting what they care about now, you will get an accurate estimation of
their near future behavior. That helps you answer the second question you need
to ask during an interview: «Can I work with you?»</p>

<p>The previous behaviors will likely continue to manifest themselves. That is one
of the natural qualities of us humans. Like Newtonian objects, we stay in
motion when we are in motion and lay at rest when we are already at rest. To
change that, we have to exert a massive force and consciously apply it. If we
do it for a long enough time, new behaviors set in and become habits. But
without that effort, we usually continue being who we are. Perfectionists will
continue chasing the ideal state and delaying project deliveries. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_coding">Cowboys</a>
will continue YOLOing untested solutions to production. In other words, the
matters people care about now are likely to govern their future behaviors.</p>

<p>That quality is both a challenge and a trait, depending on how you look at it.
If you want to change those behaviors in yourself, that is a challenge. If you
need to understand how a person would behave in a given context, that is a
valuable trait. And you can and should use this trait as a tool to learn more
about your candidates.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://autoiterative.com/blog/posts/what-to-ask-when-interviewing/">previous post</a>, we introduced a framework for hiring software
engineers.  It consists of three questions that you need to get sincere answers
to:
</p><ol>
<li>Can the candidate do the work?</li>
<li>Can I work with you?</li>
<li>Does the candidate want to work with me?</li>
</ol>

<p>The best way to answer the first question is to let them do some actual work.
To answer the second one, assess their current behaviors and map them to your
company culture. This post explains in detail how to perform such an
assessment.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-work-with-you">Can I work with you?</h2>

<p>To answer this question, all you need to do is compare a candidate behavior to
your company culture.</p>

<p>Let us illustrate what we mean with a concrete case. At AutoIterative, we have
already pulled all the hard work of defining what our culture is. For example,
one of our core values at AutoIterative is «to do science instead of
cargo-culting.» That means that we always want to understand why we do
what we do. Whether ideas are ours or not, we are comfortable questioning and
challenging them. So how do we determine where the candidate stands in that
regard? Could we ask straight whether they are confident with challenging their
ideas? Sure, but that will not give us a rigorous assessment. Chances are, the
answer would be: «yes, of course, I am!» We do not want to measure
wishful thinking or imagination. The better question would be to ask a
candidate about the last time they had their ideas challenged. From their
answers, we can derive a more reliable estimation of their behavior.</p>

<p>Let us show how a typical conversation could unroll (along with our notes
explaining why do we ask what we ask):</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Tell me about a recent
case when someone challenged an idea that you introduced?

<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: Once, I pushed for the idea
of adding monitoring to our service. It was roughly a year ago, and I got a lot
of pushback from my team.

</blockquote>

<p>Notes: The answer hints that the candidate cares about monitoring and metrics.
It is also helpful for analysis: it tells us how long ago that happened, it is
relevant, and it presents a situation. It is worth investigating in-depth, so
we decide to continue exploring it.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Interesting, what
happened? What was the pushback?
<span>(Note that we are using an open-ended
question here. We do not want our biases to influence their answers.)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: Well, we were having issues
in production at that moment. We were spending a lot of time reading logs,
trying to understand what was happening. Also, we were under pressure to
deliver a new feature. That could be the reason why people were not really
receptive to my idea when I proposed it. One of the engineers said that we have
no time for it now.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: The answer sheds even more light on the situation. First, it reveals
that the team was under pressure (a data point on how the candidate might
perform in such circumstances). Second, it shows that the candidate wanted to
improve the situation by investing in observability (this is great for us!). It
also tells us there was a conflict (a data point on how the candidate might
defuse them). Now we should dig into those individual aspects.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Why did you want to add
metrics?
<span>(asking <i>why</i> will force the candidate
to explain their reasoning. That defines the task they had to do at the
moment.)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: Because reading logs is not
the same as having metrics that you can query. Some visibility would have
improved the situation. I just wanted to understand the problem, fix it and
prevent us from getting into it in the future. We had to start somewhere, and
having those metrics would have provided a lot of value.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: This candidate demonstrates that they care about the runtime (a valuable
trait for us!). They opt to invest a bit today for a better future (again,
aligned with our values). If they care about those things in our company, we
would be happy to work with them. Now, let us dig into the conflict bit.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Interesting, and how did
you handle the situation of your coworker saying a flat-out «no» to
your idea?
<span>(Note that here we exaggerate a bit what the
candidate said. Will they correct our impression? Will they confirm it and
elaborate more on how they saw the situation?)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: I did not reply at the
exact time they said no. I did not want to provoke a conflict in front of
everyone during a standup meeting. It was not the first time I got a pushback
either. But we were all suffering, and I thought it was critical to add metrics
to our system to help us out of the situation. So after the meeting, I
approached my manager and explained the value we will get if we have metrics. I
asked for help pushing this forward.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: yes, this was an open conflict, and we need to drive the questions to
the resolution.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: And what happened? How
did you present the idea to your manager?
<span>(Note the open-ended question again. It
pushes the candidate to explain <i>how</i> they behaved, allowing us to derive
the <i>why</i> behind that.)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: I explained that we were
drowning in operational work and that we were blind. I learned in the SRE book
that measuring requests and latencies is one of the first steps to do.  <span>(Note: this could be cargo-culting. Let us make a
note, so we can later dig into their reasoning.)</span> I thought it made sense
to try it. I told my manager that I was ready to take ownership of the whole
process. Initially, I just wanted to add a couple of metrics as a proof of
concept and see if that improved our situation.  If it did, we would spend less
time debugging and more time working on features. He liked the idea, and we
started working on a plan to communicate to our team that I would start working
on it.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: From their answers, we already have a clear definition of the action
that the candidate took. But there are more data points about the candidate.
They think about the team’s success (time spent working on a product instead of
debugging). They built a proof-of-concept to validate the idea before proposing
a full solution. They approached the manager asking for help instead of openly
arguing back. This behavior could hint at them being context-aware and a
team-player. They understood that the whole team is under stress caused by the
pressure to deliver.</p>

<p>The natural next step would be to push for closure and ask how the situation
ended. If you need more context, you can continue asking open-ended questions.
You will discover more details and get a more refined picture of a candidate’s
behavior. You can ask what the candidate learned from the situation and what
conclusions they drew from it. But let us wrap up the example here.</p>

<h2 id="the-conclusion">The conclusion</h2>

<p>As many of you probably realized, this is an interpretation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result">STAR</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOARA">SOARA</a>
techniques. The question explicitly asks for a story from the past, not for an
imaginary scenario. How a candidate replies to such an interview will yield a
lot of information and map to a behavior. Their answer will tell a story, and
their narrative will highlight what they value. From that, we would see what
their natural tendencies will be. And if you did your introspection and know
what your behaviors are, then comparing those two will answer whether you can
work together.</p>

<p>Note, however, that those techniques are not a silver bullet either. They will
not give you a 100% precise picture of a candidate out of a limited interview
time. No method will do that for you. But when applied correctly, they raise
your accuracy way above just the feelings. Focus on understanding and
thoroughly defining your culture. That will give you the exact dimensions along
which to measure your candidates. That, in turn, will provide a set of values
to assess. From them, you get an understanding of which questions are efficient
for you and which are not. Practice using the best ones, and you will answer
the second question with ease and precision.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the AutoIterative platform will assess the candidate’s ability to do
the work.</p>

<h2 id="and-of-course-the-marketing-pitch">… and, of course, The Marketing Pitch™</h2>

<p>We solved the problem of software developer technical assessment. You no longer
need to resort to obscure rituals or torture them with the «Can you
reverse a linked list on a whiteboard?» (true story™) type of
questions. You no longer have to <i>*guess</i> whether the candidate can
deliver something that works. With the AutoIterative Production Challenges™,
you can instead just <i><em>test</em></i> that. And you can do it without investing a
single engineering hour before you know the answer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"> <p>Was pulled in to a fun customer issue last Friday around disabling RC4 in Active Directory. What happened was, as you can imagine, not good: RC4 was disabled and half their environment promptly started having a Very Bad Day.</p> <p>— Steve Syfuhs (@SteveSyfuhs) <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveSyfuhs/status/1366526316397301761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2021</a></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Twitter warning:&nbsp;</strong>Like all good things this is mostly correct, with a few details fuzzier than others for reasons: a) details are hard on twitter; b) details are fudged for greater clarity; c) maybe I'm just dumb.</p> </blockquote> <p>RC4 is a stream cipher. A stream cipher is kinda sorta like a one time pad (note: kinda, and sorta). A one-time pad is a cryptographic operation that takes one value and XORs it against a random value. A^B = C. A is your data, B is random noise. C is your encrypted cipher.</p> <p>They're incredibly useful because the XOR operation is only reversible when you know A or B, and if B is suitably random that means you have to guess for all combinations of B. In other words you have to brute force it. As far as cryptography goes that's nearly perfection.</p> <p><img data-src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvbcZfVVkAMDSrh.jpg" alt="RC4 is broken" width="691" height="1203" src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvbcZfVVkAMDSrh.jpg"></p> <p>However, the trick with one-time pads is that you need as many random bits as you have data. If you have 10 data you need 10 random. If you 10k data you need 10k random. You cannot repeat the random, lest you introduce a pattern and code breakers just love patterns.</p> <p>So a stream cipher could take a one-time pad and cut the key down to a fixed length, manipulating the key every operation. Let's say you have 100 data and 10 random. The first 10 data get XOR'ed to the 10 random, then the 10 random get XOR'ed to something else. Repeat 10 times.</p> <p>This turns out to be incredibly simple to code and is incredibly fast relative to other crypto algorithms. However, the cost is that you're now doing key scheduling which means if you can predict the schedule you've broken the cipher.</p> <p>RC4 fits the bill here. It's painfully simple to implement. Here it is in entirety. But it's also irreparably broken.</p> <p>The thing with RC4 is that if you have enough data transformed by a single key you can eventually predict what the original plaintext is. This became a semi-practical attack in 2013 when some smart folks figured out how to apply this to TLS. <a href="https://isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/">https://isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/</a></p> <p>For this attack to happen it requires observing billions of bytes of data. This is done easily enough with TLS, hence why folks jumped at disabling RC4 cipher suites. TLS isn't the only place RC4 is used, and RC4 is still broken, so it's just good form to disable it everywhere.</p> <p>So now we have Active Directory and RC4 is enabled by default. In 2021?! How dare. Weeeeeelllll, RC4 isn't quite that bad in this case. Like, it's bad, but not super bad because each key will only ever be used for encrypting small amounts of data.</p> <p>The current attacks require observing *lots* of data encrypted with a single RC4 key. For Kerberos we're talking maybe 8-16kb at most, not the gigabytes required for the attack. So it's bad, but not end of the world bad.</p> <p>But that's no excuse. Why is it still there? Well, it turns out the RC4 cipher suite has a unique property: it doesn't require a salt when doing key agreement.&nbsp;</p> <p>Huh?</p> <p>So Kerberos has two legs between a client and KDC. AS and TGS.&nbsp;</p> <p>AS is how you authenticate yourself: here's password gimme krbtgt.&nbsp;</p> <p>TGS is: here's krbtgt gimme service ticket.</p> <p>Now we don't ever just send the password to the server. What we do is we encrypt a thing using the password as a key and fire that thing over to the server. The server also has your password and can decrypt. If it decrypts then we agree we both know the password.</p> <p>But Active Directory doesn't store the password itself. It stores a key derived from the password. That is, take the password and hash it, and store that hashed value. You encrypt against this hashed value.</p> <p>So lets go back in time, circa mid 90's when Active Directory was being built. Back then, in the real world, Windows authentication was NTLM. NTLM kinda sorta worked similarly where you derived a key from a password and used that key to sign some stuff.</p> <p>That derivation was and is admittedly very lame. It's `md4(password)`. So in NT Server in the directory database was username + md4(password), and that's it.</p> <p>And taking the cryptographic properties of NTLM out the picture for a moment, it still kinda sucked as an authentication protocol. It didn't offer server authentication and it wasn't easily extendable for future changes. So Active Directory switched to Kerberos.</p> <p>But we wanted upgrades to be seamless. When you left work Friday afternoon logging in to NT and came back Monday morning we wanted you to be able to log in to AD without any fuss, despite the fact that we changed literally everything out from under you.</p> <p>And Kerberos at the time was using DES (eww). This posed a problem. You can't transform an MD4 key into a DES key. The protocol certainly didn't let you do weird things like DES(MD4(password)), so Windows created the MD4+RC4 crypto system.</p> <p>The magic of this is that the NTLM key and Kerberos key are interchangeable so no password changes were required. Over time as users changed their passwords Active Directory would derive these newer, stronger, keys and would inform clients to prioritize these stronger keys.</p> <p>This turns out to be phenomenally powerful because it transparently migrates users to stronger keys without breaking anyone, at a small cost of delaying weeks or months as password changes occur. Is it perfect? No. Does it keep the masses happy? Yes.</p> <p>But there's another small problem: salts. Salts add randomness to passwords, making their hashed form incomparable to other hashes. hash('password', salt1) &lt;&gt; hash('password', salt2). We do this for all sorts of reasons, but the primary is so it's harder to guess the password.</p> <p>But salts complicate the protocol. Both client and KDC need to take the password and salt and derive the same key, so both need to know them. Seems simple enough? Just use a well known value...?</p> <p>Ah no, they need to be unique, otherwise two identical passwords with the same salt will form the same hash. Oops. Okay, compute a salt from the username. Aha, here we go, this works. It's unique and both parties know it. And it doesn't change! Oh wait, it can.</p> <p>Users change their usernames all the time because names change all the time. If the salt were just the username that means we'd have to recompute the hash in AD every time the username changed, which means we'd need to know the password and only admins change usernames so 🤔.</p> <p><img data-src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvbpCjIVcAEjMED.jpg" alt="AS-REP Ping response" width="457" height="387" src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvbpCjIVcAEjMED.jpg"></p> <p>Okay, so what if the KDC only changes the salt on password change and just tells us what it is whenever we authenticate? And so this is how Kerberos works. The client "pings" (no not ICMP) the KDC and the KDC says here ya go.</p> <p>And so long story short (hahahaha, oh.) we come to the customer issue. RC4 doesn't require a salt. AES requires a salt. You can see in the previous screenshot the ARCFOUR instance doesn't provide a salt because there just isn't one.</p> <p>If you use RC4 you don't need to ping the KDC. You can just derive the key from the password and go. Therefore if you disable RC4 conversely you must always know the salt.</p> <p>This poses a small challenge. Sometimes you don't want the system to know the password itself, so you provide these things called keytabs. They're files with some structured data that map users to derived keys. You derive the keys upfront once so you only need the password once.</p> <p>Sometimes these files are generated without having line of sight to a KDC too so the tool generating the file has to guess which salt to use. Sometimes the tool guesses the wrong salt. Oops.</p> <p>So you generate these files and deploy the thing and the system chugs along just fine until you disable RC4 and the whole things comes crashing down. The system was using RC4, and RC4 worked because there wasn't a salt. When it switched to AES it required the salt and...oops.</p> <p>Well that's a pretty lame experience for anyone, let me tell you. Why did the tool guess the wrong salt? I've already told you: because the name changed.</p> <p><img data-src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvbtgCeVEAgLAHT.jpg" alt="UPNs can change" width="416" height="563" src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvbtgCeVEAgLAHT.jpg"></p> <p>Active Directory lets you change your username. You actually have two different usernames. Your sAMAccountName and your UPN. You can use either to log in with Kerberos, but Active Directory will only derive your salt from a single value: the sAMAccountName + Realm.</p> <p>Well it happens that their UPN is in the form samaaccountname@customrealm.com, but their realm is anotherrealmentirely[.]com. As such their salt was ANOTHERREALMENTIRELY.COMsamaccountname. This happens when you add custom UPN suffixes.</p> <p>The password never changed so the salt never had a chance to change (not that it would). And the tool to generate the keytab just derived the salt from the user principal name, which in most cases is fine, but in this case wasn't.</p> <p>And so you might think to yourself that this isn't that big a deal you haven't ever changed the usernames or the suffixes or anything like that. It turns out there's exactly one scenario that every environment hits: when you promote the first DC in a forest.</p> <p>When you create a forest the domain admin is the machine's local administrator account. I'm not talking implicitly, I'm talking the local admin is copied into the AD database including it's password. The password that was set when you built the machine, before it had a realm.</p> <p>And the domain admin is part of the protected users group so RC4 is already disabled for them. That means they MUST use AES, which means they MUST use a salt, which means the salt had to exist when the machine was first built. Oy.&nbsp;</p> <p>So the realm is the computer name.</p> <p><img data-src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvcBd4FVoAQ6NhK.jpg" alt="The realm is the computer" width="945" height="414" src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvcBd4FVoAQ6NhK.jpg"></p> <p>Anyway. Here's some useful links as you consider getting rid of RC4.</p> <p><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/tough-questions-answered-can-i-disable-rc4-etype-for-kerberos-on/ba-p/382718">Tough Questions Answered: Can I disable RC4 Etype for Kerberos on Windows 10 ?

<h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
</center>
<p>
This paper describes a possible Internet service that
some major organization such as
Harvard University, AT&amp;T,
the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers,
the American Mathematical Society, the American Medical Association,
or even the Vatican, might offer: a home page "in perpetuity".
Such a "perpetual page" or "eternity page" or
"e-memorial page" would be a home page that the organization would
help the customer set up, with a guarantee that it would
last for (say) 500 years, or until the organization no
longer exists.
It would list all the things that the customer would like to
be remembered for (accomplishments, family, etc.).
As the population of the U.S. ages,
such a service should prove very popular.
After all, almost everyone wants to be remembered by posterity.
</p><center><h2> Details </h2></center>
<ul>
<li>
The name for this service needs to be chosen with care, and
of course registered. "Eternity service",
"Perpetual page", "Eternity page", "E-memorial page",
"Everlasting page"
are a few possibilities. I will use "Perpetual page"
in this paper.

</li>
<li>
The first version of this paper was written in
December 1996, although the idea for the "Perpetual home page"
first occurred to me in January 1996.
Not surprisingly,
it turns out that other people have had similar ideas, and there may be some
commercial services that provide electronic gravestones available even now.
But my vision is that
this service would be offered by a major organization or institute,
that has already existed for a long time and
has some chance of existing 500 years from now.
And I'm not thinking of tombstones, but home-pages.

</li>
<li>
The "Perpetual page" could include such things as:
<ul>
<li>
photographs of houses, boats, paintings, other precious possessions
</li>
<li>
lists of awards, accomplishments
</li>
<li>
writings, drawings, songs, even unpublished novels
(disk space is cheap)
</li>
<li>
links to perpetual pages of one's family (including ancestors!) and friends
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
This is the customer's chance to write their own
<em>New York Times</em> obituary page, or "time capsule".
(Many people do not realize that except for a handful of major obituaries,
every obituary item in the <em>New York Times</em> has to be
purchased at about $40 per line -- this can be a humiliating
experience for the next-of-kin.
Setting up a "Perpetual page" in advance for the sick
and elderly could be both therapeutic and comforting for the family.)

</li>
<li>
There should be a generous amount of disk
space available for each page - a minimum of ten megabytes,
to allow a number of photographs to be included. (Most Internet
providers at present do not allow nearly enough disk space.)
As my colleague 
Andrew Odlyzko has pointed out in his
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~amo/doc/tragic.loss.txt">
discussion of the future of scholarly journals</a>,
the cost of disk space is dropping so rapidly that it is likely that 
the cost of providing a service
in perpetuity will be not much more than that of providing it for
one year.

</li>
<li>
The organization would help the customer set up the initial page, and would
provide instructions on how to maintain it.
A "help desk" would be part of the service.

</li>
<li>
One way to structure the offer might be to tell customers:
For a one-time fee of $X, we will provide you with Y MB of
storage, and as long as you pay a small monthly fee,
you can keep modifying it.  Once you stop paying the monthly fee
(say because you die, or switch to a different
provider) we will keep the latest version <em>forever</em>.

</li>
<li>
Part of the offer would be a guarantee that when the Internet is replaced
by some other service in a few years, all the "Perpetual pages"
would be automatically converted to the new medium.

</li>
<li>
It is important that the organization offering the servce
should have been in existence for a long time, and have a good chance of
still existing 500 hundred years from now.
The organizations mentioned in the Abstract certainly
satisfy these conditions, and it is easy to think of others. 
Such a service would not carry much conviction
if offered by some tiny local Internet service provider.

</li>
<li>
This is the first time in history that such a thing is possible.

</li>
<li>
Incidentally,
the <em>New York Times</em>} for Saturday Dec. 7 1996 describes (on page D2)
a patent, US 5,517,791, for a new tombstone design that can
incorporate a person's life story - including photographs.
So ideas like the one I am proposing are "in the air".

</li>
<li>
As one may verify by visiting cemeteries in New Jersey, tombstones are rarely
legible after a hundred years have passed.  One of the advertisements for the
proposed service could show a family searching through a
cemetery full of grave stones that have been worn smooth,
looking for the lost grave of an ancestor.  Furthermore,
as the world population continues to explode,
cemeteries will become increasingly irrelevant.

</li>
<li>
The "perpetual page" service would especially appeal to mature customers.
There are several ways in which advertisements could point out the futility
of earlier attempts to be remembered, even by world leaders.
For example, one advertisement could show a replica of the original
Mausoleum at Halicarnassus,
after which all later mausoleums are named.
(See <em>The Oxford History of the Classical World</em>,
ed. J. Boardman et al., Oxford, 1993, p. 150.)
<center> <img src="http://neilsloane.com/doc/maus1.jpg"> </center>
<p>
One of the Seven Wonders of the World, it was
built in the year 353 for King Mausolus of Caria by his wife.
It no longer exists.
"But if King Mausolus had had a perpetual page, we could still read
about his victories today ...".

</p></li>
<li>
An alternative way in which the "perpetual page" could be used is
by family and friends after the death of a loved one, by setting up a
permanent memorial for the deceased.  The Page would need to have an
authorized keeper, to screen out inappropriate material.
A certain amount of permanent space would be purchased, to which
interested parties could contribute in any way they wished.


</li>
<li>
Another advertisement could have a voice reading P. B. Shelley's
poem <strong>Ozymandias</strong>,
while the picture shows dust blowing around an appropriate ruin:

<pre>     I met a traveller from an antique land 
     Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone 
     Stand in the desert ... Near them, on the sand,
     Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
     And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
     Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
     Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
     The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:
     And on the pedestal these words appear: 
     `My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: 
     Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!' 
     Nothing beside remains. Round the decay 
     Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
     The lone and level sands stretch far away.
</pre>
<center><img src="http://neilsloane.com/doc/ozy4.jpg"> </center>
</li>
<li>
It will also give all the unpublished poets and writers,
the unrecognized painters and musicians, the scientists
whose theories are rejected, the opportunity to have their
work immortalized.

</li>
<li>
Yet another advertisement could have Jessye Norman singing the moving
and unforgettable aria "Remember Me"
from Henry Purcell's "Dido and Aeneas".
(The formal title
is "Thy hand Belinda - when I am laid in Earth"
[Philips CD 434 161-2].)

</li>
</ul>

<p>“What is the point of using a tool that will facilitate you to do something you don’t even know what it is? That’s not facilitation. That’s ignorance support and MUST be avoided”. Mário Júnior</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The web is a very interesting and powerful platform but exploring its powers requires knowledge of their existence and a bit of its internals comprehension. The most essential terms when we talk about web are: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTTP</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JavaScript</a>. Some people would argue that I should add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSON</a> to the list, but lets just say JSON is included in JavaScript. If you know these terms and you are familiar with them, then you got a word to say about web development.</p>
<p>The terms I just listed define the web and most of them are not just terms, are languages with their very own purpose, syntax, and limitations: HTML, CSS, JS.</p>
<p>Imagine having to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript without the proper tools to assist you for example: debugging JavaScript code, Inspecting CSS properties and DOM Elements. This was the stack of challenges that web developers had to face long back ago if they decided to embrace that trio. To get around this, technology companies came up with Frameworks literally <em>giving developers the possibility of building web application without having to master HTML and CSS and without even writing a single line of JavaScript.</em></p><p><a data-bid="2" href="https://techblog.hostmoz.net/en/linkout/11671/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/techblog.hostmoz.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/620x90-pix.jpg?fit=620%2C90&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/techblog.hostmoz.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/620x90-pix.jpg?fit=620%2C90&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/techblog.hostmoz.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/620x90-pix.jpg?w=620&amp;ssl=1 620w, https://i2.wp.com/techblog.hostmoz.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/620x90-pix.jpg?resize=300%2C44&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" width="620" height="90"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.zkoss.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZK,</a> <a href="http://www.javaserverfaces.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSF</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ASP</a>, all them still sell with that same propaganda, but now we have the tooling we needed to use that trio.</p>
<p>Now we got web browsers with super-powers and <em>we don’t just want to be presenting forms to users</em>. These new features the browsers are supporting, are supposed to be used to enhance business processes, to make an effective change in users lives and this is why I brought this conversation to the table, because most of us seem to be stuck in that tooling-less time.</p>
<p>People no longer make jokes about JavaScript, they follow it, they love it so much that they even made some effort to have it running in other environments different from web browsers (take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NODE.JS</a> project as an example). Microsoft even invested creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TypeScript</a> and yet you hate and fear JavaScript?</p>
<p>Some people would argue that in enterprise, “how it looks” is not the most important, because the most important is that “it works”. For these people, I would say: “How it looks” defines the time the user will take to accomplish his goals, “How it looks” may not matter when you are offering a solution to someone that has no choice, because if that person has a choice, trust me, I would stick to the solution that works and looks better. <strong>People don’t want to open their browsers on their retina display powered screens to see some “basic” web app that “just works”.</strong> Wake up fellers, it’s not the “just make it work” era anymore. Presentation can make people happier and happy people are guaranteed to deliver better results, now tell me that’s not an “enterprise” matter!</p>
<p>We can also shift the view, from the end-user perspective to the software design perspective. Frankly speaking, web servers are only useful nowadays because they allow us to deliver dynamic content. But the client-side (Browsers) only understands HTML, CSS and JS. The framework you use, being it <strong>ZK, JSF, ASP</strong> or whatever HTML generator engine you use that sells you the “no javaScript” propaganda, will actually generate HTML, CSS and JavaScript and then send it straight to the browser. What if you write HTML, CSS and JS by yourself? What if you separate the client from the server, as the best practices suggest (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separation of concerns</a>)? Wouldn’t you get a clear vision of what each of the layers should do? Instead of gluing them and building some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monolithic</a> and server-dependent web app? Wait! Did I just say “server-dependent”? Yes I did say that and what I was trying to say is that, you shouldn’t need a server to test the UI (only the UI) of a web app. If you detach your UI from your Back-End and use pure web technologies (CSS, HTML and JS), you get the chance to explore the maximum of each of the parts and that’s what you are supposed to do. You are supposed to give the best you can and right now, <a href="https://www.primefaces.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PrimeFaces</a>, <a href="https://www.zkoss.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZK</a>, <a href="http://www.telerik.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telerik</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICEfaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IceFaces</a>, etc, are the best you can. These tools are limiting your power, thus, limiting the power of your enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>I have nothing against these ideas, companies, or their owners</strong>, and I don’t want them to be extinct, I want them to evolve their business too. I want them to stop selling frameworks that will uniformize UI and <strong>start selling services</strong>. I want them to sit and build a UI for a specific problem, with the attention that specific problem deserves, using the pure web.</p>
<p>I had this idea for too long in my mind and I lived with the fear of unleashing it, but then I realised I’m not the only one with this thoughts. I’m a big fan of <a href="https://martinfowler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martin Fowler</a>, I have been reading some of his articles, watching some tech-talks of his and he is a professional I admire and I look at as an inspiration. When I figured out that the company he works for, is kinda advising people to do exactly what I have been thinking about, I told myself: “It’s time to unleash this thoughts and raise a debate if necessary”. Martin fowler works for <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThoughtWorks</a>, a software respected company that have developed solutions for companies all over the world and here is what they said about JSF and ASP Forms:</p>
<p>“We continue to see teams run into trouble using JSF – JavaServer Faces – and are recommending you avoid this technology. Teams seem to choose JSF because it is a Java EE standard without really evaluating whether the programming model suits them. We think JSF is flawed because its programming model encourages use of its own abstractions rather than fully embracing the underlying web model. JSF, like ASP.NET webforms, attempts to create stateful component trees on top HTML markup and the stateless HTTP protocol. The improvements in JSF 2.0 and 2.2, such as the introduction of stateless views and the promotion of GET, are steps in the right direction, maybe even an acknowledgement that the original model was flawed, but we feel this is a too little too late. Rather than dealing with the complexity of JSF we recommend teams use simple frameworks and work closely with web technologies including HTTP, HTML and CSS.” ThoughtWorks Radar</p>
<p>I think the essential was caught. <strong>Let’s embrace the real web and lets also innovate in presentation in order to enhance and improve the life of our customers and partners</strong>.</p>
<p>I want to end this article with a question for the local enterprises (Maputo/Mozambique): <em>Why aren’t you hiring Front-End/UI/UX engineers? Would it be because you are going monolithic or because presentation doesn’t matter?</em></p>
<p>I want you to leave a contribution on this article. Say something on the comment box down there.</p>
<p>It’s always a pleasure for me to share my thoughts with all of you guyz.</p>

              <p>Hi from the team who built the "mesonet" weather station networks in the state of South Australia!</p>
              <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesonet">mesonet</a> is a term for a network of automated weather stations designed to monitor meteorological phenomena at high geographic density and updated frequently.</p>
              <p>We built these networks to help prevent pesticide <a href="#spraydrift">spray drift</a> - the phenomenon in which pesticide spray that is applied to a crop ends up drifting to other crops, sometimes many kilometres away.</p>
              <p>Spray drift can be a huge problem, as it can lead to damage or even destruction of highly valuable crops, and can also cause pollution to waterways and harm to native ecosystems.</p>
              <p>The biggest factor in spray drift the presence of a <a href="#thermalinversions">thermal inversion</a>, a state in which temperature increases with increasing altitude, which usually happens in the evening and overnight when the earth is cooling, but can happen at other times. However other meteorological phenomena also affect the likelihood of spray drift, and different types of spray respond differently.</p>
              <p>So we designed a <a href="#ourweatherstations">weather station</a> to measure all the relevant meteorological phenomena, and in particular to detect thermal inversions, and a custom <a href="#webapp">web app</a> to display the data in format that is very fast and simple to access and understand.</p>
              <p>We've now deployed 70 of these stations across two of the major agricultural regions of South Australia, and so far it seems to be making a difference: no damage due to spray drift has been reported in these regions since the networks were rolled out.</p>


              

              <a name="background"><h2>Background</h2></a>

              <p>A group of stakeholders in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_North">Mid North region of South Australia</a> had identified spray drift as a major issue.</p>
              <p>The region, to the north of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia">South Australia</a>'s capital of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, has a thriving agricultural sector, producing wheat, barley, wine grapes, pulses, livestock and other produce.</p>
              <p>The total annual output from the region is valued at nearly AUD $2 billion. It has been estimated that the potential loss in production from spray drift could be as high as $178M/year, and potential harm to waterways and native ecosystems is significant.</p>
              <p>The local stakeholders worked with meteorologists and researchers to develop a solution, then sought funding from the South Australia state government to fund the project.</p>
              <p>In 2018, a $1.4M grant was provided, and a pilot rollout of 40 weather stations was undertaken.  It was named the Mid North Mesonet.</p>
              <p>The pilot was deemed successful, and in 2019, another grant was provided by the state government for a network in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverland">Riverland</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Mallee">Mallee</a> region to the north-east of Adelaide.</p>

              <p>In the two years since the Mid North Mesonet was rolled out, there have been no reported instances of crop damage due spray drift.</p>

              <a name="spraydrift"><h2>The Problem of Spray Drift</h2></a>
              <p>Farmers spray pesticides on their crops to manage pests. It is an important feature of modern farming. Herbicide may be applied to target broad-leaf plants, other times to target summer weeds.</p>
              <p>Spray drift occurs when pesticide spray 'drifts' across into non-target areas.</p>
              <p>Spray drift is a problem because:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>The affected non-target area may be particularly susceptible to pesticides (i.e. broad-leaf crops such as grapevines are especially vulnerable)</li>
                    <li>Some markets are highly sensitive to the amount of pesticide residues detectable in the end products (i.e. wine exports to China; organic farms; etc)</li>
                    <li>The affected non-target area might be a sensitive natural ecosystem (i.e. local waterways)</li>
                    <li>The affected non-target area might include rain water tanks used for drinking water</li>
                    <li>It is a waste of pesticide product and labour time costs</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <a name="causesofspraydrift"><h2>Causes of Spray Drift</h2></a>
              <p>A combination of conditions can lead to spray drift.</p>
              <h3>Wind Speed</h3>
              <p>Wind speed that is very low or very high.</p>
              <h3>Temperature</h3>
              <p>A temperature over about 28°C (83°F).</p>
              <h3>Humidity</h3>
              <p>The effect of humidity varies depending on the type of spray. The spray manufacturer's instructions should provide guidance.</p>
              <h3>Atmospheric Stability</h3>
              <p><i>Unstable</i> or <i>stable</i> conditions can lead to spray drift. Conditions should be <i>neutral.</i></p>
              <h3>Thermal Inversions</h3>
              <p>A thermal inversion, in which temperature increases with increasing altitude, is a major risk factor for spray drift.</p>
              <p>Inversions generally happen in the evening and overnight as the earth cools, but they can happen at other times.</p>

              <a name="thermalinversions"><h2>Thermal Inversions</h2></a>
              <p>For current farming practices, long-distance spray drift generally occurs during very stable weather conditions (i.e. little to no air turbulence).</p>
              <p>A thermal inversion occurs when a warm layer of air sits above a cooler layer of air near the ground.</p>
              <p>This reduces air turbulence and can act as a ‘lid’ for an airborne pollutant source. The lack of air turbulence means the smaller spray droplets float without settling on the target crops.</p>
              <p>A very slight breeze can then carry these floating droplets large distances before they eventually descend into a non-target area.</p>
              <p>It is illegal to spray during a thermal inversion.</p>

              <p><strong>The problem: it is very difficult for farmers to tell if a thermal inversion is underway.</strong></p>

              <p>Our weather stations were designed to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Measure temperature at 1.2m and 10m, in order to detect inversions</li>
                    <li>Measure all weather metrics that are relevant in determining whether it is safe to spray</li>
                    <li>Update data every 10 minutes, so farmers have access to the most recent readings</li>

              <a name="webapp"><h2>The Web Application</h2></a>

              <p>We initially used an off-the-shelf web application for displaying meteorological data, but soon realised we needed something tailored to our needs. We found a company that was already in the business of building web-applications to display environmental data for farmers, and they were willing to build a customised version for us.</p>

              <p>The key requirements for the application were:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each of the monitored metrics displayed on a map, with fast/simple switching between each metric</li>
                    <li>A dashboard of all the current key metrics and recent historical graphs</li>
                    <li>Long-term graphs of all the key metrics also available, and as well as the past 48 hours of data in tabular format</li>
                    <li>The site must display well and be easy to use on a mobile device, and be fast to use even in areas with low cellular signal strength, given that much of the usage will be by farmers out in the field in remote areas.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p>The key technologies are:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
                    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
                    <li>Redis</li>
                    <li>Sidekiq for queue processing</li>
                    <li>React</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p>Data is uploaded from the data logger via FTP (which may seem primitive, but the world of meteorological data still relies heavily on FTP).</p>

              <p>On detection of new data, the application first takes the most recent readings, and updates the data structures for the map and dashboard views.</p>

              <p>The historical data is then placed in a queue, for updating of historical graphs.</p>

              <p>All the data for the map view, dashboards and historical graphs are formatted into a JSON hash then serialized and stored in the Redis cache. That way, when the React web interface makes a request, the pre-formatted data can be retrieved and sent very quickly, as no querying, processing or formatting of data is required at request time.</p>

              <a name="results"><h2>Results so far</h2></a>

              <p>In the two years since the Mid North Mesonet was deployed, there have been no reported cases of crop damage due to spray drift.</p>

              <p>Damage and loss had been reported in most of the previous years - though not all. So it is too early to tell if the problem has been completely solved, but indications are promising.</p>

              <p>Other government bodies and NGOs are expressing interest in establishing their own mesonets.</p>

audio, which includes emphasis that’s not on the page</i></p><div>
<h2 id="intro"><strong>Intro</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Hello, and welcome to CoRecursive. I’m Adam Gordon Bell. I’m trying to find and share the personal experiences of building software. I’m not really a big gamer, but lately I fell down this rabbit hole into the world of Casey Muratori, and this project that he started on Twitch in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
The videos are me just programming. They’re not even good. I mean, I’ll be honest. I’d love to say that they’re amazing, and that I’m really great. But they’re not. They’re not. All they are is a regular programmer who does actual real programming work. Right? It just ended up taking on a life of its own.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Casey’s game programming videos, they started a movement. It’s a movement that in some ways feels like software development from the ’70s. But in other ways, it’s totally modern and maybe points towards the future of learning or entertainment. I’m not sure where to start with Casey’s story, but the basics of his approach, they date to this job he had in the late ’90s.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
In 1999, I took a job at RAD Game Tools. I was still a C++ programmer at the time, meaning I was still … If I was going to write a matrix multiplication, it would be like templatized on the size of the matrix. Right? Traditional C++ class hierarchy with inheritance kind of programming. Smart pointers, for example. One of the things that was cool about RAD Game Tools is it was me and there were two other programmers there. RAD Game Tools is legendary in that the amount of money they make per programmer is staggering.</p>

<p>They were making millions of dollars a year and they had three programmers or something, and not on weird web laundering of money where you basically you’re selling ads to be like … Literally selling software. This is libraries they’re selling. Right? The two programmers there at the time, beside me, when I joined Jeff Roberts, who has literally written the video codec for every game basically in existence almost in history. Every game. Name a game, the videos play back through something Jeff wrote, right? From basically the year ‘94 to today.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Whatever the latest game is you pick up, it’s videos are playing back through something Jeff wrote. The other programmer was John Miles, who’s the guy who wrote the engine for Ultimate 5 way back in the day. He wrote the Miles Sound System which was the sound system used in most dos games. It was extremely popular, still exist to this day, in fact, and it’s used by people for sound. I want to say he also wrote the render on Wing Commander III. Anyway, those two programmers who were there and they are old school C programmers.</p>

<p>Here I am looking at this and I’m like, “Well, these are way better programmers than me, and they don’t use any of this stuff, and I wonder why.” Right? Why is it that you get some programmers who are literally some of the best programmers I’ve ever seen and they don’t use any of this stuff? Why is that? Right? Not only that, but if you take Jeff, for example, it might be argued he’s a programmer who as far as the video game world is concerned. I mean, it’s staggering to think of how many games have his code in it. Right?</p>

<p>Because they all [inaudible 00:03:32] It’s just like looking at how impactful they are and what amazing stuff they were able to do, and it’s like why am I using all this stuff? Do I know something they don’t? Because that seems unlikely. Right? There’s a little bit of programmery I always know what I’m doing nonsense, and it’s like do you? I mean, why are these other people who are so good not need that thing? Right. Being honest with you, you have to be a little bit introspective and go, “What’s going on here?”</p>
<h2 id="being-critical-of-your-own-skills"><strong>Being Critical Of Your Own Skills</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Did these guys talk to you and say why are you using templates or-</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
No. It was just … I mean, I am always as critical of my own habits as I am of anybody else’s, right? If I am aggravated with some piece of software that someone else’s … I’ve had some famous rants about Visual Studio, for example, and how bad it’s gotten. That dialogue, I mean, you might be tempted to think that that is just me complaining about someone else [inaudible 00:04:36] software. No. That dialogue is happening in my head about my programs all the time. I always think they’re terrible, right?</p>

<p>I’m always going what could I have done to make this less terrible? It only comes out of that. It was me just looking and going like, “There’s probably something to learn here.” Incontrovertible, these guys are better programmers than I am. That’s true. One reason for that could be that I just suck and I’m never going to get any better, so it doesn’t matter. So just keep using C++ and whatever. Right? Another possibility is that I could learn to be as good as they are, and I’m just not taking it seriously enough. I’m not trying. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Yes I’m trying to program, but I’m not trying to get better. Right? What are things I can use to get better? Well, I can look at what they are doing and go, “What about what I am doing is different, and can I assess if any of those are the answer?” Because they might not be. It might be that they just happened to program in C and I happened to program at C++, and they happened to be good and I happen to suck. That’s a totally possible thing that could have happened there. But another thing could be that actually I could be good, I could be writing code as good as they are, but I need to learn what are the things that they know that I don’t?</p>

<p>What are the practices they have that I don’t have? Right? I always try to do that as much as I can. If I see something that looks like it’s working well, or that they’re getting something done well, I try to go, “How can I reassess what I’m doing to see whether there’s something of that that would make a difference for me?” Because I want to be better, I don’t want to be writing bad code. But it’s not always obvious how to improve.</p>
<h2 id="trying-just-plain-c-programming"><strong>Trying Just Plain C Programming</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Did you spend time watching them code?</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Not in so many words. I never walked into someone’s office and was like, “Teach me how to program.” But I tried to say what are the things I could do that would assess my own practices in light of the fact that I have some good examples just sitting here? Because typically watching a programmer program at that time would have been creepy. I’d be sitting and we’d be like, “Kilroy was here.” I’m peeking up over the chair. A little Casey head pops up. What I did was I was in charge of the character animation system, and I wrote the first version, it sucked. I was going to write the second version as, let me try. Because I started programming C, not C++, and I had become a C++ programmer.</p>

<p>I was like, “Let me try just going back to see,” because honestly I know how to do it because I used to program [inaudible 00:07:22]. Let me try going back to C and what I’m going to do is I’m only ever going to use one of these features in C++ if I actually can demonstrate to myself that it would create a benefit here. What I found was that literally the only two things that were at all useful were operator overloading and function overloading. Those are the only two. Everything else, I was like, “Yep. The code was better without it.” Unlike most programmers, I actually had the experience of literally taking the time to see, do these features actually improve the code or don’t they?</p>

<p>I could actually test it because I was fortunate to have the time and control over a project to actually see what happened. From there, I was just like, “You know what? I need to do that for everything. I need to actually start taking this seriously and stop just assuming that because someone else puts something in a language that it must be good.” When you change your thinking to I’m going to evaluate rather than I’m going to trust, what you start finding is that most things most people say are mostly wrong, and the reason for that is they have to be because a lot of them are overlapping.</p>

<p>Most of the time you see two different people suggesting two different ways to do something, obviously someone’s wrong or there isn’t a better way to do it, meaning it doesn’t matter which one you pick. Either somebody was wrong and one of them was the correct way, in which case there was one that you should have rejected, or it doesn’t matter which way you do this, in which case they were all wrong for suggesting that you needed to do it this way. I think ever since that point in my career, it’s been about 20 years since then, I’ve just always evaluated things as carefully as I could.</p>

<p>When I see a new thing suggested, I go, “What does this actually yield?” If I look at the difference between doing it this way and doing it in whatever way I would have done it before, and I go, “Does that result in less lines of code, less bugs, less time?” Blah, blah, blah. I go, “Can I make an argument along any of these lines?” What you’ll find out if you do this, honestly, is a lot of the stuff is just a waste of your time.</p>
<h2 id="the-do-it-yourself-development-aesthetic"><strong>The Do It Yourself Development Aesthetic</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Casey, didn’t just leave C++ behind, he also nurtured this sort of obscenely DIY development aesthetic that’s pretty uniquely his. He doesn’t use an IDE. Just Emacs <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. He doesn’t use make or a build script. He doesn’t use any libraries. He thinks other people should try this approach.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
I think everyone should have the experience of building something from the ground up. Most programmers, no matter what they work on, would benefit greatly from having written one thing from scratch, meaning start in a fairly bare language, such as C, don’t use the libraries, just write everything yourself from just basic things. Even better if you want to try assembly language, but assembly language has a bunch of things that you have to do, like register …</p></div></div>

		<p>Yet another PDP-1 riddle, extended mode.</p>

		<p><span>Y</span>esterday, we solved the mystery of <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/2021/train-spotting-1">two well-known images</a>, formerly known as “The PDP-1 at the Tech Model Railroad Club”, with the help of the Hacker News community. — A triumph of shared knowledge.</p>
		<p>In 1971, the German artist Daniel Chodowiecki (1726 – 1801) commented his etching “Enlightenment” <em lang="de">(Aufklärung)</em> by the words, “However, if the sun only rises, mists do no harm.” <em lang="de">(Indessen wenn die Sonne nur aufgeht, so schaden Nebel nichts.)</em> In real life, mists rise only to reveal another bank of fog. Which is the very process of research. — And this is certainly no exception. So this is a post about annother bank of fog, in the amazing form factor of a fully transitorized electronic contraption apt to manipulate 18-bit words in realtime according to a stored program and human interaction.</p>

Es wird auch wohl noch lange das schicklichste bleiben, wegen der Nebel, die immer aus Sümpfen, Rauchfässern und von neuen Brandopfern und Götzenaltären aufsteigen werden, die sie leicht verdecken können. Indessen wenn die Sonne nur aufgeht, so schaden Nebel nichts.”</p>

		<h2>Another PDP-1B Prototype?</h2>
		<p><span>Y</span>esterday’s sunrise, <em>um,</em> success was the indentification of the scene of a series of images showing a somewhat rudimentary front part of a DEC PDP-1 and a Type 30 Visual CRT display next to a model railway layout. And we proceeded to conclude that this was a PDP-1 at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, operated by the Program Head of the CS program, J.A.N. Lee (probably around 1970).</p>

		</figure>

		<p>However, this also posed a new riddle, as at least two sources referred to this machine as a PDP-1B. Namely, the history page of the UMass Amherst CS program’ website,</p>
		<blockquote>
		The PDP-lB of those early days was soon replaced by three PDP-11s and a PDP-l5 with a graphics system.

		</blockquote>

		<p>Following established knowledge, there was a single PDP-1A prototype, followed by two PDP-1B pre-production prototypes (one going to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL, the other to BBN) and the production models PDP-1C and PDP-1D, the latter being the enhanced time-sharing model. Further, the two pre-production prototypes had a 4-cabinets main unit, which was repackaged for a more cost effective and reliable 3-cabinets design, and finally to a 4-cabinets design allowing for dedicated space for expansion modules for the production models. This history leaves no apparent room for a PDP-1B at Amherst. So is this an error in these attributions, maybe referring to a common source as a single point of failure, or is there more to this?</p>
		<p>Update: Gordon Bell et al. mention a third PDP-1 prototype in <a href="http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/_Books/Bell-ComputerEngineering.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="PDF">Computer Engineering. A DEC View of Hardware System Design</a> (Digital Press, Maynard, MA, 1978): <em>“A third machine, similar to the 1/A and 1/B, was constructed for internal use.”</em> (pp. 136, 137)</p>

		<h2>PDP-1 Lineage</h2>
		<h3>All-White PDP-1s</h3>
		<p>The first prototype, PDP-1A, was an all white machine, featuring an integrated control desk with built-in CRT and operator’s console, a three-cabinet packaging of the main unit, and a Friden Flexowriter as a console typewriter. This machine was presented at the Eastern Joint Computer Conference in Boston in December 1959.</p>

		<p>The same machine (and the same image) also appeared in the initial announcement in Datamation, November/December issue 1959:</p>

		</figure>

		<p>Then, there is a white 4-cabinets machine seen in early DEC materials, here from a brochure from March 1961. This all-white machine features a 4-cabinets main unit, a detached control console with black print and the early DEC logo (more on this later), a CRT display in similar hexagonal housing as later Type 30 CRTs, but mounted on a narrower, single-unit stand, and a Soroban console typewriter (a modified IBM Model A):</p>

		</figure>
		<p>Apparently, we see this machine again at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), in an image in <a href="http://www.walden-family.com/bbn/bbn-print2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“A Culture of Innovation – Insider Accounts of Computing and Life at BBN”</a> by David Walden and Raymond Nickerson (ed.), 2010; page 51:</p>

		</figure>
		<p>The following, rather blurry image from <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/08/102740407-05-01-acc.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Digital Equipment Corporation – Nineteen Fifty-Seven to the Present”</a> (Digital Equipment Corporation, Maynard, MA, 1972; p.3) seems to show the same machine (all white, 4 cabinets, detached console), but with a different CRT with the standard double-unit display stand. Notably, the paper-tape devices on the left and the chairs look much like the one the BBN image, hinting at the photo showing the same installation.</p>
		<figure>

		</figure>
		<p>The same configuration appears in yet another photo (from the “DIGITAL Computing Timeline”), here, explicitely tagged as <em>“The PDP-1 operating system, the world's first timesharing system, is written by engineers at MIT and BBN for the PDP-1. (…) Shown here is the PDP-1 installation at BBN.”:</em></p>

		</figure>

		<p>At this point it may be fair to assume that the images of the white PDP-1B, found in early DEC brochures, are actually depicting the BBN PDP-1B.</p>

		<p>The last image (to my humble knowledge) in this lineage of all-white PDP-1s featuring a detached console seems to be an early production PDP-1 in 3-cabinets packaging at Itek (allegedly the second production machine):</p>
		<figure>

		</figure>

		<p>Something, all these all-white machines with a detached console have in common, is that they are lacking an integrated paper-tape unit. In these images, we see a separate generic paper-tape unit associated to the machine, usually to the left of the control console. DEC even envisioned the tape unit as a detached desk appliance, much like the control console:</p>

		</figure>

		<p>Here’s a short history of this strand of PDP-1s, as comprehensively told in <a href="http://www.walden-family.com/bbn/bbn-print2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“A Culture of Innovation – Insider Accounts of Computing and Life at BBN”</a> (ibidem, pp. 53–55):</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>The Eastern Joint Computer Conference was in Boston in December 1959, and there Fredkin saw the PDP-1 and “realized it was fantastic.”
		The project to design and build the PDP-1 had started just four months prior to that. Ben Gurley was the designer, and he also built the computer with the help of one engineering assistant.</p>
		<p>“So,” says Fredkin, “I convinced BBN to become Digital’s first customer for the PDP-1. We arranged to borrow the prototype PDP-1 while Digital built the first ‘production’ version.” The prototype machine (a PDP model 1a) was delivered to BBN in early 1960.
		At the time, according to Fredkin, Digital had the idea that a computer manufacturer shouldn’t do software. Thus, Fredkin wrote the assembler for the machine, wrote utility routines (like a rudimentary operating system), and so forth. In that era programs were typically written on ruled sheets with columns for the various fixed-length instruction fields. Ed’s assembler for the PDP-1 was called FRAP, which stood for “free of rules assembly program” and which allowed variable-length instructions. At some point Fredkin also wrote light pen software for the machine.</p>
		<p>Eventually the first production model PDP-1, a PDP model 1b system (serial number 2), arrived at BBN. That was Digital’s first PDP-1 sale. Fredkin says,</p>
		<p>When the PDP-1b arrived, BBN had a ceremony with a lot of hoopla. I wrote a little program so that the PDP-1b could cut its own ribbon at a ribbon-cutting ceremony (appropriate since one of the ideas was for the PDP-1 to interact with the real world). Digital founder Ken Olsen was present.</p>
		<p>Bill Fletcher also was working with Fredkin on the PDP-1b. (…)</p>
		<p><strong>PDP-1b Time-Sharing: the Research Computer System</strong></p>
		<p>Fredkin says that he had the idea of hiring John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky. This soon led to plans to develop a time-sharing system for the PDP-1. McCarthy had the idea of time-sharing, and Fredkin saw the potential for time-sharing on the PDP-1. (…) Fredkin says,</p>
		<p>John’s invention of time-sharing and his telling me about his ideas all occurred before the PDP-1 existed. When I first saw the PDP-1 at the Eastern Joint Computer Conference, I realized that it was the perfect low-cost vehicle for implementing John’s ideas. That is why I specified that several of the modifications for time …</p></blockquote></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We are usually involved in projects demanding a high level of software quality, whether they be large legacy applications, where the customer is already beset with problems and is trying to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted, or newer pilot projects, which need to be built on stable foundations. As experienced technical experts we can of course help to get things on the right track. Having said that, we frequently find that our customers initially do not understand how quality is about a lot more than just good technology.</p><p>Even technically excellent teams can slip into quality problems if the working conditions or the project goal are unclear. In this article we explain why this is the case and what we can do about it.</p><h2>Is it a bug or a feature?</h2><p>Poor software quality often only comes to management’s attention when the number of errors reaches an unacceptable level. Yet what is actually a bug and what is just a (missing) feature? This question often leads to discussions between the product and development teams and cannot, strictly speaking, be answered without a clear written specification of the software’s requirements.</p><p>How do we decide during development what can be removed and what needs to remain? Most developers have experienced the situation where a bug fix leads to a string of new ones, due to something “not working like it used to” in the new version. For fear of breaking something, we often see developers steer clear of improving bad software design, which in turn leads to a continuing deterioration of the software’s maintainability.</p><p>To escape from this dilemma we need a shared understanding of what the software actually is: that is to say, what can it do and what not? Each user story should include clear acceptance criteria and, where applicable, define what is out of scope. For effective software development the team also needs to understand the broader context, i.e. not just <em>what</em> it is developing, but also <em>why</em> it is required and what concrete use cases are envisaged. Experienced teams avoid bugs through this type of communication, before they even begin with the implementation in code.</p><p>The development team still of course needs the right technical skills and experience in order to ensure that the software functions properly and is adequately protected through automated tests. Best practices such as pair programming, code reviews and test driven development (TDD) can help achieve this.</p><h2>Tests</h2><p>We frequently encounter projects with inadequate test coverage. Our approach is not to write new code or fix a bug without corresponding automated tests to verify the expected behaviour. This, however, presupposes that it is clear what the software is supposed to do.</p><p>Acceptance criteria in a user story serve as a basis for understanding this. Acceptance test driven development (ATDD) even goes so far as to translate the written specification into executable tests. Similarly, in the case of bugs, the way in which the functionality deviates from expected behaviour and how the error can be reproduced need to be clearly defined. This information can then be mapped into appropriate automated test cases so as to ensure functional correctness and avoid regression.</p><p>It is critical for the business to understand high test automation as an integral part of high-quality software <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/2020/09/wie-qualitaet-uns-schneller-macht/">which actually makes development faster</a>: development speed should always be measured based on <em>working</em> features. Unfortunately, the deployment of technical experts is in many cases not enough to communicate this message, rather, the business often requires significant cultural and organisational upheaval, which reaches as far as management level, to achieve this. Development teams cannot bring about such a change on their own.</p><p>Additionally, efficient test automation can only be achieved when developers and testers work together cross-functionally. If testing is only carried out after the development stage (for example by a dedicated QA department) many of the advantages of test automation, such as fast feedback loops, are lost. Consequently organisational aspects such as team structure and process often go hand in hand with technical matters.</p><p>It is, on the other hand, not enough just to deliver good requirement documents and to expect a new culture to appear. Teams need to be capable of mapping these requirements onto an efficient test pyramid and ensuring the software still works in ensuing months and years. Even good teamwork is a skill that cross-functional teams need to learn through practice.</p><p>Furthermore, code testability is very much dependent on good software design. Technical methods, for example test driven development and refactorings, can help to improve this, and such methods can be more readily established when experienced developers or coaches are on hand.</p><h2>Refactorings</h2><p>Legacy applications often suffer from old code being difficult to understand and maintain. This leads to new features being very expensive and to an ever-increasing bug rate.</p><p>Experienced teams refactor their application code continuously and ideally avoid these pitfalls. They are capable of recognising how the software design can be improved as they go along in order to implement the current feature and regularly switch between the “two hats” (new functionality and refactoring) to achieve the goal in hand. They also keep an eye on upcoming requirements to ensure the technical foundations are optimised to deal with them. In order to achieve this they keep open a continuous dialogue with product team representatives and understand the current business goals.</p><p>But what happens when larger refactorings are required? Teams with only a technical focus might prefer to leave no stone unturned in order to achieve their interpretation of technical perfection and might even push for a complete rewrite of the application. This is, however, rarely the most efficient use of limited resources.</p><p>Refactorings should always be geared towards making the job in hand and future requirements easier and quicker to implement. Yet in order to achieve this, it is important to understand where the application is heading. A clear product vision and strategic focus on defined goals is critical so that refactorings with the most value (i.e. which improve future development speed) can be prioritised.</p><p>Whether larger refactorings should be undertaken is always a judgement call, which cannot be made solely based on technical reasons. A clear product strategy, which defines the key parameters for anticipated functional requirements, is incredibly helpful to estimate the relative effort of the refactorings and to answer important questions such as:</p><ul><li>How and to what extent will this component be extended in the coming development cycles?</li><li>Does the current software design satisfy the requirements on the product roadmap?</li><li>Do we (in the worst-case scenario) need to throw this component away and start from scratch?</li></ul><p>Nonetheless, even the best product vision cannot be fulfilled if teams do not have the technical skills to dig themselves out of the hole they find themselves in. Once it is clear where the journey is heading, developers still need the right technical skills and training to understand how to refactor a legacy application and keep the project on the right track.</p><h2>Architecture</h2><p>Software architecture is not an end in itself, but should seek to provide an optimal technical foundation for the product’s business requirements. There is no such thing as “the best architecture”, rather, it is always a question of making trade-offs. A software product will always have multiple architecture goals which conflict with and need to be weighed up against each other. Again, the product’s goal and its functional requirements will also play an important role here in making the appropriate architectural decisions.</p><p>During development, even the best teams will keep coming up against conflicts between current and future requirements. On the one hand, software architecture should be evolutionary and be improved incrementally, as it is impossible to predict users’ feedback and the exact nature of future priorities. Yet, on the other hand, certain architectural decisions do need to be made early enough in the development process so that the right foundation is in place to facilitate productive development. Only a well-functioning team, which not only brings together the relevant technical and business knowledge but also assumes responsibility for the software’s architecture, will be in a position to make the right decisions and react to changes in requirements in the best possible way.</p><p>Only through such teamwork is it possible to identify the right context boundaries in the application and to define the business domains and their objects. It is also critical to establish a universal language for these domains, so that business objects and the software’s use cases are clearly understood by the entire team.</p><p>Successful teams discuss the software’s architecture as part of their daily business and are able to experiment with various possible solutions. This is not possible in organisations where small predefined tasks are imposed on development teams from above or where teams are constantly under pressure from external deadlines. Agile practices in self-organised teams are therefore an important precondition for good architecture decisions.</p><p>It is, on the other hand, not enough simply to introduce agile frameworks and hope that this leads to teams being immediately capable of good software architecture. This will usually not be the case without support and coaching from experienced developers, especially if the previous working conditions were very different and the developers do not have prior experience of working in self-organised teams.</p><h2>Code quality and the “four eyes principle”</h2><p>Methods such as clean code, pair programming and code reviews help to achieve a high level of software quality. As technical coaches we can help out in these areas, but this …</p></div></div>

<p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you know should know by now the perpetual licensing pattern: you buy a license to certain software, you receive updates for a year or two, depending on the license, then you stop receiving updates for the app and you can use that version forever.</p>



<p>The main problem with this type of license, from a user’s perspective, is consistency. <a href="https://pacurar.dev/uses/">I use</a> quite a few software with this type of license BUT the main difference is that some are updated daily/weekly or at least monthly and some are less frequently updated.</p>



<p>Most applications receive tons of updates after the initial release and then they magically stop receiving updates or new features for a while. My question is: why buy another year of your software if in the past 5-6 months I received only a minor update? What will I miss if you do not update it? Well, for most applications, you won’t miss anything… except some euros in your pocket.</p>



<p>On the other hand, there’s software like TablePlus that is fully worth paying for it year by year because it is updated a lot and you would miss a lot of features if you are stuck on an old version.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I have a problem with all subscriptions lately. You pay a subscription for everything, and now you are required to pay monthly for software too. It all piles up, and sure, developers make more money and they can afford 5$ here and 5$ there, but again, it all piles up and at the end of the month you end up giving a lot of money on licenses.</p>



<p>So… maybe a perpetual license is ok though and it all depends on the developer itself if clients would renew their license: keeping an updated app and adding new features would make a higher percentage of the clients renew their license for another year.</p>



<p>What do you say, what is the best license for you and your needs? How many perpetual licenses do you pay yearly?</p>

First, you have to be able to recognize what good looks like in that domain. Second, you must have realistic expectations for how hard it should be (how much work it will take) to achieve that result – the scope,” writes Bezos.</p><p id="2783">Recognition and scope, according to Bezos, are the two most important rules to deliver high standards. And in an example that applies directly to writers, he says, “We don’t do PowerPoint presentations at Amazon. Instead, we write narratively structured six-page memos.” And the quality of these memos, Bezos admits, varies widely.</p><p id="fa97">Here’s the difference between a great memo and an average one.</p><p id="c6c4">Average writers fail to recognize what differentiates their work from that of the top writers in their field. And this failure of recognition never propels them in the right direction. They can’t do better because they don’t understand what better looks like.</p><p id="5d9e">Although, at Amazon, “often when a memo isn’t great, it’s not the writer’s inability to recognize the high standard, but instead a wrong expectation on scope: they mistakenly believe a high-standards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours, when really it might take a week or more,” writes Bezos.</p><p id="75f4">To prove his point, Bezos uses an interesting <strong>headstand analogy</strong>. He says if you try to perfect a headstand in just two weeks when in reality it takes about six months of daily practice, you’re just going to end up quitting. In other words, it’s not about hard work, it’s about having realistic beliefs on scope.</p><p id="0489">According to Bezos, great memos are:</p><ul><li id="4ea6">written and re-written,</li><li id="468d">shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work,</li><li id="4bf5">set aside for a couple of days,</li><li id="4fee">and then edited again with a fresh mind.</li></ul><p id="11cb">Again, all of these things, re-writing, editing, giving your work the room to grow, and asking for suggestions and improvements, are all really the best pieces of writing advice out there. But, “the key point”, Bezos insists, “is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope – that a great memo (or any piece of writing) probably should take a week or more.”</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

<p><em>Update: There’s a <a href="https://www.innoq.com/en/blog/is-domain-driven-design-overrated/">slightly extended version of this post</a> over at the INNOQ company blog.</em></p>
<p>There, I said it. Now that I have your attention: Domain Driven Design (DDD) has recently gained additional popularity, as evidenced by new books, conference talks (and even complete conferences dedicated to it), and lots of trainings – including some by our very own colleagues at <a href="https://www.innoq.com/">INNOQ</a>. And in contrast to my click-bait headline, I’m actually a fan. <a href="https://www.dddcommunity.org/book/evans_2003/">Eric Evans’s book</a>, the additional work writing and evangelizing it done by <a href="https://vaughnvernon.com/">Vaughn Vernon</a> (e.g. in <a href="https://www.case-podcast.org/15-domain-driven-design-with-vaughn-vernon">this very good podcast</a> with my colleague Joy) and many others, are all very good additions to our industry’s body of knowledge. In the best sense of pattern languages, DDD gives clear names to things that many developers and designers know how to do, but cannot reliably and compatibly communicate about.</p>
<p>But I’m annoyed by the fact that recently, it seems that any time somebody talks about how to architect system or service boundaries, or even just mentions non-technical design, everybody feels compelled to bring in the DDD experts – as if they were the only superheroes who could possibly design anything at all. This is just as bad as any other situation where you blindly apply the solution that’s currently en vogue, just because it is the thing everyone talks about, and not because it is the right solution for the job. DDD is great, but it’s just one of many tools and techniques you should be aware of.</p>
<p>I think there is a more important aspect that people miss, especially when they get into DDD as their introduction to design in general. DDD emphasizes the importance of naming, and it suggests you should strive for a common, ubiquitous language, in the context you’re designing for. But it also uses its own language – concepts like bounded context, aggregates, entities, value objects, etc. – for our domain, the domain of designing systems. And while these are all well and good, they’re only one possible language. There’s value in calling a value object a value object, if this is a term many people understand, to facilitate communication. But the existing, common DDD concepts are not the only concepts you should consider – they are just examples of a very common trait of designing and architecting systems: Coming up with and recognizing patterns, giving them good names, and using them to give the system structure and integrity. If in your architecture, there’s a common pattern that you use a Filter to route requests to a Handler, or a concept of a Document that is handled by an Agent, then these things may occur again and again, on the same level as Services or Repositories, and end up being way more important to you. This is fine! This concept, that we can and should invent our own languages, is to me way more important than many naïve DDD practitioners think. I like to believe that DDD experts know this very well, and view any DDD material as a starting point, not an end result – but if all you’re doing is applying the by-the-book definition of existing DDD terms, and trying to shoe-horn any problem into this existing structure, yours is a very sad designer’s life.</p>
<p>There is a life beyond DDD. Not every good design needs to be Domain-Driven (though I can accept it should always be driven by the domain, just not necessarily in the DDD sense). You can design good systems even if you’re not a DDD expert.</p>

<article>
    <p>While coding professionally I’ve used Gradle, Maven, and Ant. I think Gradle is my least favorite.</p>
<p>There have been a couple good critiques of Gradle that I’ve read lately. I want to note them here for completeness, but then move on to outline my own frustrations which come from a different angle.</p>
<p>First there is <a href="https://www.bruceeckel.com/2021/01/02/the-problem-with-gradle/">this</a> article by Bruce Eckel. The central argument really spoke to me and got me thinking about this topic. In the post Bruce states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To do anything [in Gradle] you have to know everything</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been my experience and frustration as well, and is not typically a sign you are using a good tool.</p>
<p>In the second <a href="https://phauer.com/2018/moving-back-from-gradle-to-maven/">article</a>, Philipp Hauer writes about (amongst other things) the unnessisary churn Gradle causes by regularly <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/upgrading_version_5.html#dependencies_should_no_longer_be_declared_using_the_compile_and_runtime_configurations">breaking compatibility</a>, in addition to the confusing and opaque rules of the DSL.</p>
<p>Again, 100% agree here. I will also note Gradle constantly <a href="https://github.com/gradle/performance-comparisons/blob/e174b35fcd9aef362f8062fe08443870ce2061da/exclude-merging/apiweb/dependencies.gradle#L4">offering</a> <a href="https://github.com/gradle/performance-comparisons/blob/e174b35fcd9aef362f8062fe08443870ce2061da/exclude-merging/apiServiceLayer/dependencies.gradle#L6">multiple</a> <a href="https://github.com/gradle/build-analysis-demo/blob/4aaac6d82f2dc4bd1e9a7825d420c1b32856f789/build-producerator/build.gradle.kts#L8">ways</a> to do the same thing does not help here :~).</p>
<p>These are both great articles. They’ve made a case I find compelling, and are worth a read, but I’m not going to dive any deeper into those topics. I just want to make them visible, and will now move on.</p>
<p>I want to focus on Gradle from the perspective of a large organization, and how it is a terrible build tool for maintaining numerous projects.</p>

<p>The company I work for uses Gradle heavily now for our builds. We have been migrating to a microservice world for a while now, so have an ecosystem of, I wanna say, a couple hundred services and libraries. All of these services and libraries have at least one - but usually two - Gradle builds, so the total number is roughly 2x that.</p>
<p>We also have one git repository per service, no monorepo, so naturally have some jobs that do care-taking. Bump dependencies, enforce formatting rules, perform small migrations, etc. Gradle is horrible for this type of automation.</p>

<p>So how do we update our <code>build.gradle</code> with new dependencies?</p>
<p>Ultimately we need to be able to understand groovy. We don’t want to write a full-blown interpreter, so we support a subset of what we need to understand in the Gradle DSL. In our case we enforce a convention where each project declares its dependencies in a <code>dependencies.gradle</code> file that is simple enough for dumb parsers to understand and modify.</p>
<p>With this convention we have come full circle! We didn’t like declarative builds because they weren’t flexible enough, so we moved to Gradle, which is really just Groovy. But now we can’t understand what Gradle builds are doing, because the underlying language is too complex for dumb parsers. So we introduce an ad-hoc declarative style.</p>
<p>In the end Gradle enforces very little. There is some convention, but you can really do what ever you want, so gods know what is happening in those hundreds of Gradle files.</p>

<p>There’s another thing we’ve been working on lately. Gradle now has a <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html">Kotlin</a> variation of it’s DSL<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Our company is heavily using Kotlin now, so a developer has been working on a script to migrate the hundreds of projects to the <code>build.gradle.kts</code> format. I agree with this migration. We all use Kotlin, so switching the format will give us more comfort and ease in maintaining those builds. It’s how this migration is happening that made my jaw drop.</p>
<p>In the end everything is just Groovy, and there is no great Groovy to Kotlin converter available, so the present migration strategy is basically: run a bunch of regexes against the <code>build.gradle</code> to optimistically search and replace Groovy with Kotlin syntax. <strong>A human</strong> then needs to come in and fix the final n% of things that didn’t convert properly. On hundreds of projects.</p>
<p>This is insane. For any organization that is trying to build an automated system for updating and migrating hundreds (if not thousands) of projects, it is insane that our best option is use <code>grep</code> and cross our fingers. This is not the first migration we have done, and will not be our last, and the number of projects is only going to increase.</p>

<p>We are a professional community that naturally values structured data and automation. Using Gradle effectively and ironically breaks both these things. We need to do better. So what does that “better” look like?</p>
<p>I actually think Maven got it 90% right. A coworker has a line I really like, that highlights some of what I believe Maven got right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your builds are not special.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>100% this.</p>
<p>This first thing I like about the Maven model is it discourages doing crazy things! Virtually all builds are just pointing at some source files, referencing some jars, and compiling. Maybe we push the end result somewhere when we’re done. Why on earth are we using a general purpose programming language to declare what should almost always be copying and pasting from a template.</p>
<p>Conversely, Maven discourage hacks and one-offs by limiting us to a purely declarative format. If we <em>really</em> need something special, we have a plugin framework where we can punch out of the stricter declarative world, and then we’re just coding in Kotlin. Boom! Do all the crazy your heart desires.</p>
<p>The other thing Maven got right is having a strict convention and format. This is really where the power lies for large organizations. It’s a simple enough “language” that parsers are multiple and battle tested. How far do you have to reach in a given language to parse and understand XML? In any mainstream language you probably have multiple options. Not just regexes.</p>
<p>This is exactly why Maven tooling has always been so out-of-the-box functional. The structure is well-defined, and there are fewer unexpected things because one-off hacks are discouraged. Gradle tooling on the other hand has always been near non-existent. IntelliJ supports Gradle and does a decent job, but it was a long road to get here. The support was incredibly buggy in early days, and even now seems a little flaky. Meanwhile, Maven tooling has just quietly worked this whole time.</p>
<p>Of course what Maven didn’t get right was XML. Maven was written at the time we all had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">collective insanity</a> and thought everything should be XML. We’re still kinda dealing with the hangover. XML has a lot of properties that are great for builds, but is a total eyesore.</p>

<p>I want something Maven like, but no XML. Right off the bat I don’t think YAML is the right thing here, we want something simpiler and stricter. I’m honestly not sure if a format like this exists, but I’m shouting into the void and hoping a response comes back. If one doesn’t exist maybe we need to <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">make one</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>For my build tool and language I want something that has these properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Strict and static. Wouldn’t it be great if IntelliJ yelled at us if we forgot a mandatory argument? Wouldn’t it be great if IntelliJ told us an argument we were using on a plugin is deprecated? Wouldn’t it be great if we could do a “Find Usages” on a dependency or plugin?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple. Writing interpreters for this should be easy so automated tools can do their thing. Even better, the build tool itself provides an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An accessible and rich plugin and lifecycle API. Maybe one of the mistakes of Maven was it was too strict, and that led to Gradle. Let’s try to meet in the middle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support rich documentation. This is where XML is especially brutal. What if we could click on the argument of a plugin, and IntelliJ would bring us to well-formatted documentation. 😍.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No meaningful whitespace please. We should have learned this was a bad idea a long time ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First class fat-jars! No Kotlin or Java build tool has this as a first-class feature, and literally every JVM developer I know uses them<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.  The whole JVM world is just relying on some guys <a href="https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow">side project</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s a big ask, but I think we need something new. When I look at the herculean efforts made towards the development of Gradle, I can’t help but think it could be redirected to something smaller and simpler. This is such core part of our development workflow. I think it’s worth the investment.</p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The Kotlin DSL is pretty great, and definitely an improvement, but yet another example of Gradle throwing in yet another way to do things and further splintering the knowledge base. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

		<p>Unit testing is a powerful way to verify that code works as intended and creates a quick feedback loop for development &amp; learning. However, setting up a reproducible unit-testing environment is a time-consuming and delicate affair. At Replit, our goal is to give people coding superpowers by demolishing barriers and democratizing access to expert tools. Today, we're launching our zero-setup unit testing environment.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/unit_tests/unit_tests.gif" alt="unit tests demo"></p>
<p>At launch we'll support three of our most popular programming languages: Java, Python, and JavaScript pre-setup with the most popular frameworks in each category. We'll be adding more with time, and you can visit our <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/UnitTesting">docs</a> for more information about how to get started.</p>
<p>We think this feature will be handy for CS educators, online course creators, and developers. But as always, we're excited to explore unique ways people will leverage this feature. So let us know how you use it!</p>

	<div>
		<p><span>TL;DR:</span> Ada is an extremely interesting and robust programming language that has a lot to offer modern developers of system 
	and bare-metal software. At very least, Ada presents many interesting ideas that designers of modern programming languages could stand to learn much from. If you want a 30 second version of this article, check out the 
	<a href="#practical_example">practical example</a> that I provide for a comparison of Ada with C.</p>

<p>
	Much of the technical material presented in this article is available as part of <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/User:Ajxs">my contributions</a> to <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page">osdev.org</a>
</p>
<p>
	I consider myself a rational man. While I may believe in an entirely deterministic model of the universe, I certainly
	do not believe it to be guided by any conscious process.
	I do not believe in destiny. This absence of guidance makes such fortuitous occurrences as the one I will discuss all
	the more extraordinary, and for this I am all the more grateful.
</p>

<h2>A Chance Collision</h2>
<p>
	By no deliberate design of my own, I happen to live close to a university. Not in the kind of ‘University town’ common
	to much of Europe or the United States, but in the densely packed suburban sprawl of the inner-city. My regular walk
	to and from the local shopping centre takes me past several of the buildings belonging to the highly regarded
	engineering faculty of the aforementioned University.
</p>
<p>
	Making my way home one serendipitous afternoon, I happened across a sizeable stack of books sitting on the curb
	outside one of the University’s engineering buildings. The university was ostensibly in the process of liquidating its stockpile
	of old engineering books, and had left them in a pile for the local council to collect. Amongst material covering a
	wide variety of academic disciplines, two books in particular caught my eye: <i>Building Parallel, Embedded, and
	Real-Time Applications with Ada</i>, and <i>Concurrent and Real-Time Programming in Ada</i>.
</p>
<p>
	I had heard of Ada before. I understood that it came from a pedigree of languages developed for the United States
	military, and that it still occupied a niche in the development of safety-critical applications, nothing more.
	Curious, I threw the books in my bag and off I went.
</p>


<h2>Exceeding My Expectations</h2>
<p>Admittedly, I had pictured Ada’s syntax resembling the uncompromising verbosity and rigid construction of COBOL, or
	perhaps the Lovecraftian hieroglyphics of Fortran’s various eldritch incarnations. Turning the pages, I was pleasantly
	surprised by modern constructs associated with modern high-level languages such as ranges, slicing and
	exception-handling. The syntax — Admittedly verbose by modern standards<sup><a href="#footnote_3">3</a></sup> — seemed deliberately and purposefully
	constructed to make the language comprehensible at a glance.</p>
<p>The fact that Ada was designed with embedded-software in mind was of particular interest to me. I already had some
	limited experience with bare-metal development on the x86 and ARM platforms using C and assembly, so the prospect of
	using higher-level constructs on bare-metal seemed promising to me.</p>

<h2>Not the Camel You Expected</h2>
<p>A common pejorative refrain directed at Ada by its many detractors is that it is a language “designed by committee”,
	or even worse, a language “designed by committee <i>for the military</i>”<sup><a href="#footnote_1">1</a></sup>. The implication of which being that (so-called)
	design by committee precludes it from any real-world practicality. I contend that it is better to design a language to fit an
	existing problem domain than to pick your weapon of choice and set out in search of new problem domains to apply it
	to<sup><a href="#footnote_2">2</a></sup>. I will spare readers a detailed retelling of Ada’s conception within the Department of Defence’s <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/pol-hist/history/holwg-93/holwg-93.htm">‘High Order
	Language Working Group’</a>, save to say that the Ada programming language was born of the need for single, unified
	higher-level language suitable for use in the multitude of Real-Time Embedded systems developed by the DoD<sup><a href="#footnote_4">4</a></sup>. In the
	wise words of the working-group’s chair, Colonel William A. Whitaker: “It was concluded that no existing language
	could be adopted as a single common high order language for the DoD, but that a single language meeting essentially
	all the requirements was both feasible and desirable.”. If such a thing was indeed feasible, the DoD’s deep pockets
	would help it bring it into existence. Ironically, given its status as the de-facto standard language of modern embedded-system development, the C language was considered unsuitable for this purpose: “When Bell Labs were
	invited to evaluate C against the DoD requirements, they said that there was no chance of C meeting the requirements
	of readability, safety, etc.” (Whitaker, 1993). After its successful implementation, in what would prove a controversial decision, the DoD would go so far as to mandate 
	the use of Ada for all in-house software engineering.</p>

<h2>So What Makes It Special?</h2>
<p>
	Ada has many useful features that are of particular interest for low-level programming and operating-system development. One
	feature in particular that impressed me greatly was Ada’s <i>representation clauses</i> (see below). They provide a highly granular way to define the
	in-memory representation of low-level data structures. I was very quickly able to adapt my own long suffering operating-system development project to Ada, improving the
	quality of my codebase greatly in the process. The following section details some of Ada’s features:
</p>

<h3>Custom Types</h3>
<p>
	In addition to being a strongly typed language, Ada allows for the definition of new scalar, enumerated and record types.
	Custom primitive types can also be constrained to a predefined range of values.
	The example below demonstrates the definition of a new integer type based upon Ada’s native <code>Natural</code> type, restricted
	to a predefined range.
	The use of the subtype directive informs the compiler that other variables of the <code>Natural</code> type are compatible with
	the newly defined subtype.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>VGA_COL_COUNT</span> <span>:</span> <span>constant</span> <span>:=</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
<span>VGA_ROW_COUNT</span> <span>:</span> <span>constant</span> <span>:=</span> <span>24</span><span>;</span>

<span>subtype</span> <span>Col</span> <span>is</span> <span>Natural</span> <span>range</span> <span>0</span> <span>..</span> <span>VGA_COL_COUNT</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>subtype</span> <span>Row</span> <span>is</span> <span>Natural</span> <span>range</span> <span>0</span> <span>..</span> <span>VGA_ROW_COUNT</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
	The below example illustrates the creation of incompatible custom integer types. While their base type and range
	constraints are identical, Ada treats both as separate, incompatible types. An assignment of a variable of one type
	to the value of another is illegal, and will trigger a compile-time error.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Integer_1</span> <span>is</span> <span>range</span> <span>1</span> <span>..</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Integer_2</span> <span>is</span> <span>range</span> <span>1</span> <span>..</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
<span>A</span> <span>:</span> <span>Integer_1</span> <span>:=</span> <span>8</span><span>;</span>
<span>B</span> <span>:</span> <span>Integer_2</span> <span>:=</span> <span>A</span><span>;</span> <span>-- illegal!</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
	The following example demonstrates the creation of a custom enumerated type. It also demonstrates a subtype of an enumerated type with a constrained range of values.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Day_Of_Week</span> <span>is</span> <span>(</span><span>Monday</span><span>,</span> <span>Tuesday</span><span>,</span>
  <span>Wednesday</span><span>,</span> <span>Thursday</span><span>,</span> <span>Friday</span><span>,</span> <span>Saturday</span><span>,</span> <span>Sunday</span><span>);</span>

<span>subtype</span> <span>Work_Day</span> <span>is</span> <span>Day_Of_Week</span> <span>range</span> <span>Monday</span> <span>..</span> <span>Friday</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
	A variable with the type of <code>Work_Day</code> is restricted to its constrained range. Any attempt to assign a value outside
	of this range to a variable of this type will raise a <code>Constraint_Error</code> exception at runtime.
</p>

<h2>Representation Clauses</h2>
<p>
	Ada allows for explicitly defining the in-memory representation of scalar and compound types. The following example
	demonstrates the definition of a record type (equivalent to structures in C), as well as its associated
	representation in memory.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span>--  The format of the System Table Descriptor pointer used by the processor</span>
<span>--  to load descriptor tables like the GDT and IDT.</span>
<span>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span>type</span> <span>System_Table_Descriptor</span> <span>is</span>
   <span>record</span>
      <span>Size</span>   <span>:</span> <span>Unsigned_16</span><span>;</span>
      <span>Offset</span> <span>:</span> <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>Address</span><span>;</span>
   <span>end record</span>
<span>with</span> <span>Size</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>48</span><span>;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>System_Table_Descriptor</span> <span>use</span>
   <span>record</span>
      <span>Size</span>   <span>at</span> <span>0</span> <span>range</span> <span>0</span>  <span>..</span> <span>15</span><span>;</span>
      <span>Offset</span> <span>at</span> <span>0</span> <span>range</span> <span>16</span> <span>..</span> <span>47</span><span>;</span>
   <span>end</span> <span>record</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
	The <code>Size</code> aspect specifier instructs the compiler that the <code>System_Table_Descriptor</code> type must be 48 bits in size. The
	record representation clause instructs the compiler as to the required layout of this record type in memory. This
	example specifies that the <code>Size</code> member should occupy bits 0 to 15, and the <code>Offset</code> member should occupy bits 16 to
	47. This feature is analogous to C’s bit-fields. The following example demonstrates defining the in-memory
	representation of an enumerated type.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span>--  The privilege level for a particular descriptor.</span>
<span>--  These correspond to the 'protection ring' that this descriptor is</span>
<span>--  accessible from.</span>
<span>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Descriptor_Privilege_Level</span> <span>is</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>Ring_0</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_1</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_2</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_3</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>with</span> <span>Size</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>Descriptor_Privilege_Level</span> <span>use</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>Ring_0</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_1</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_2</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_3</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>3</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
	The <code>Size</code> aspect specifier instructs the compiler that the <code>Descriptor_Privilege_Level</code> type must be 2 bits in size.
	The representation clause instructs the compiler as to required representation of each possible value of the
	enumerated type in memory. In this example the value of <code>Ring_0</code> will be represented by a value of <code>0x0</code> in memory, the
	value of <code>Ring_1</code> will be represented by <code>0x1</code>, and so on.
</p>

<h2 id="practical_example">A Practical Example</h2>

<p>
	The following example, and accompanying comparison with C, demonstrates the configuration of a hypothetical UART device by interfacing with an 8-bit memory-mapped configuration register.

March 1, 2021 | https://bdickason.com/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bdickason.com/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/">archive.org</a>

<p>Do you remember your first time using a modern smartphone? A vibrant screen that responded instantly when you tapped replaced cramped keyboards. You could sign your name, drag and drop apps around the screen, and even spin the giant Price is Right wheel to set your alarm. In 2007, this felt like a the future. There's a reason it was called 'the Jesus phone.'</p>
<p>At that same time, The Motorola Razr (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_IK295sfxQ">video</a>) was the top phone on the market. It was a flip phone with the ability to take photos, play videos, browse the web, and play music. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Phones in 2007 had the same features as the iPhone. The Palm Treo (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK7FvGz4Jkc">video</a>) even had a touch screen.</p>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/smartphones-2007.png">
<p>The difference was <em>speed</em>.</p>
<p>When you touched a Razr or a Palm phone, there was a delay. It felt sluggish and slow. Apple removed the delay between your finger tapping the screen and something happening. Your finger could finally manipulate the UI in realtime, just like in the real world. It felt magical. If there was even a slight delay, the whole experience fell apart.</p>
<p><strong>Speed is a killer feature. Speed is a differentiator.</strong></p>
<p>Yet teams consistently overlook speed. Instead, they add more features (which ironically make things slower). Products bloat over time and performance goes downhill.</p>
<p>New features might help your users accomplish something extra in your product.
<strong>Latency stops your users from doing the job they already hire your product for.</strong></p>
<p>Slow ui acts like tiny papercuts. Every time we have to wait, we get impatient, frustrated, and lose our flow.</p>
<h2>Honestly assess your speed</h2>
<p>I want you to take a moment and approach your product with a fresh set of eyes: Eyes for speed  👀</p>
<p>Go through your onboarding flow and try your core product features. Take mental note of how long each step takes to appear on the page then to be interactive.</p>
<p>How slow is it?
Be honest.
It’s ok, I’ve been there too.</p>
<p>Does your checkout page take 10+ seconds to load? Did you have to wait for a loading indicator multiple times along the way? Did things look interactive but weren’t loaded yet?</p>
<p>Every one of these is an opportunity. The great thing about speed (also called ‘performance’) is that you can stack rank it and burn it down.</p>
<p>Imagine what your product would feel like if everything happened in real time.</p>
<p><img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/speed-keanu-sandra.png"></p><p>Be like Keanu and fix every slowdown in your product. Your users will thank you.</p>
<h2>Places where speed matters</h2>
<ul>
<li>Speed during Checkout - Every second of page load time kills conversion rates. A 1 second delay <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/">reduces conversion rate by 7%</a>.</li>
<li>Framerate in Virtual Reality - The early days of Virtual Reality caused intense nausea akin to motion sickness <a href="https://link.medium.com/QyheLe9rbeb">when framerates dropped below 60fps</a>.</li>
<li>Design Tools - Users are consistently frustrated when Sketch or Figma are slow. <a href="https://quizlet.com/blog/everything-i-know-about-design">Designers have high APM</a> (actions per minute) and a small slowdown can occur 5-10 times per minute.</li>
<li>The core interaction of your product - Your product exists to save people time or help them solve a problem. Introducing friction or delay during the most important flow of your product will drive people crazy. Notion has developed a reputation for being a sluggish product:</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/reddit-notion.png">
<h2>Perception vs. Reality</h2>
<p>If you can’t speed up a specific action, you can often fake it. Perceived speed is just as important as actual speed. Even if you can’t be fast, you should appear to be fast.</p>
<p><strong>Large content</strong> - Render the screen while content loads so the user knows what’s coming.
<strong>Long load times</strong> - Make the screen interactive, even if everything hasn’t loaded.
<strong>Waiting for an action</strong> - Allow the user to take the action and keep moving but post the action in the background.
<strong>Very long actions</strong> - If you have an action that will take 30s or more, offer to notify the user (e.g. via email) when the action is available.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of products that fake being fast:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook’s app pioneered loading images that look like actual content. The structure and UI of the page loads but the content does not. As a result, you can still use the product and prepare to take actions, even if the content hasn’t loaded.</li>
<li>Games have a rule to never block the input thread. You can slow down the visuals but the controls should always feel responsive so the user feels in control.</li>
<li>Robinhood has you swipe up to trade, but runs your transaction in the background and notifies you via email when your trade is complete.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When is it ok to be slow?</h2>
<ul>
<li>When there is a physical constraint that causes things to take a while (e.g. dispensing money from an ATM)</li>
<li>When you want to give people a chance to correct a mistake (e.g. Gmail's "undo" feature)</li>
<li>When a human has to keep up with a machine (e.g. we slow down video game framerates, otherwise the game would run at 60x speed and overwhelm you).</li>

<h2>Bonus Fun: What would it be like to live with lag?</h2>
<p>Imagine making breakfast with a 1 second latency added to every action you take. Even something as simple as moving your hands so that an egg rests over a bowl becomes incredibly challenging.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a real life experiment where 0.5-3s of latency was added to everyone's action via a VR headset:</strong></p>

March 1, 2021 | https://www.raywang.org/blog/2021-02/mondays-musings-inside-why-mainframe-alive-and-thriving | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.raywang.org/blog/2021-02/mondays-musings-inside-why-mainframe-alive-and-thriving">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:articleBody">

<p>Mainframes entered the market in the early 1950's when IBM and the seven dwarfs (Burroughs, Unisys, NCR, Control Data, Honeywell, GE, and RCA) created the computing age and competed for critical applications, sophisticated modeling, and large-scale transactions and workloads among the largest of organizations.&nbsp; Over the past seven decades, compute power, storage, and networking have seen various waves of centralization and decentralization amidst each wave of disruptive technology adoption.</p>

<p>As with each wave, pundits, analysts, and industry watchers have forecasted the death of the mainframe.&nbsp; Yet, the venerable mainframe has prevailed.&nbsp; In a Q4 2020 update on mainframe usage, IBM shared the following statistics on mainframe adoption:</p>

<ul>
	<li>67 of the Fortune 100;</li>
	<li>45 of the top 50 Banks;</li>
	<li>8 of the top 10 Insurers;</li>
	<li>8 of the top 10 Telcos;</li>
	<li>7 of the top 10 Retailers;</li>
	<li>4 of the top 5 Airlines;</li>
</ul>

<p>use the mainframe.</p>

<p>While it may be one thing to tout usage of a technology by which organizations continue to adopt a technology, IBM has grown usage as measured by MIPS, a method of calculating the raw speed used, by 350% over the past ten years.</p>



<p>The newest mainframes include the latest <a href="https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2018/0417-01.html">Fujitsu GS21 </a>series announced April 2018 along with Fujitsu Software GSS21sx V20 which supports connections with open systems. In September 2019, IBM launched the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/hardware">IBM Z15 </a>showcasing key capabilities such as encryption anywhere, cloud native development, and instant recovery.&nbsp; From many conversations with CIO's in healthcare, travel, financial services, and pharma, the mainframe continues to play a key role in their overall modernization strategies.&nbsp; For many of these organizations, they are working with public cloud vendors such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud while keeping their intense workloads on the mainframe for both cost and security reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, many competitive industry leaders value a hybrid approach with cloud and mainframe as a trusted, efficient architecture for their enterprise organizations delivering intense hybrid workloads from securely filing a healthcare claim, making life-saving prescriptions, booking travel, initiating a credit check, and reducing fraud in banking online.&nbsp; A hybrid approach enables top businesses to apply the right technologies to the right workloads to reduce their risk.&nbsp; Why? Elasticity, distributed compute and storage, and shared infrastructure have continued to withstand the test of time.&nbsp; As the CIO of a Fortune 50 financial services entity noted, "The security, performance, reliability, and value equation of the mainframe give us confidence to continue with our hybrid approach.&nbsp; The cost of data movement and I/O costs would be punishingly expensive with our current public cloud contracts"</p>

<p>Moreover, investments by organizations such as Broadcom and IBM's in Zowe, the open mainframe project, enable all users to access an integrated and extensible open source framework for z/OS.&nbsp; Users can use one language to access open systems and open software through a set of common APIs and OS capabilities.&nbsp; Consequently, developers can use the same tools for the cloud and mainframe enabling a broader set of developers and resources to work on both.&nbsp; The numbers show this as well with 94 of the top 100 IBM Z Enterprises are running Linux on Z and able to modernize with the mainframe.&nbsp; In addition, a 2019 survey of mainframe professionals conducted by Forrester for IBM showed that nearly 90% of professionals in enterprise computing careers agree the job market for their skill set is growing, and 75% believe there is a high demand for their skills in mainframe.</p>



<p>The growth of mainframe adoption has come at the same time the public cloud has expanded.&nbsp; Constellation estimates that 20% of the world's workloads are now in the public cloud.&nbsp; As adoption continues, co-existence of mainframe, on-premises, and cloud deployments will continue for at least the next decade.&nbsp; In a 2020 Deloitte <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/consulting/articles/hello-mainframe-our-old-friend.html">survey</a> also confirmed that mainframe usage continues to grow with:</p>

<ul>
	<li>74% believe the mainframe has a long-term viability as a strategic platform for their organizations</li>
	<li>91% identified expanding their mainframe footprints as a moderate or critical priority in the next 12 months</li>
	<li>72% are planning upgrades to their mainframe in the next three years</li>
</ul>

<p>While public cloud usage has gained ground, hybrid cloud approaches have become mainstream among top organizations.&nbsp; Many business and technology leaders have expanded and grown their existing investments in mainframe for their critical next gen computing environments. In fact, businesses rely on both the cloud and mainframe to lead digital transformation efforts built on trust to achieve peace of mind, with speed, security, versatility, elasticity, and scale on demand in a hybrid environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As leaders move forward, they should focus on getting the most out of their cloud and mainframe investments to improve organizational ROI.&nbsp; Modernizing on the mainframe can be done in concert with distributed and cloud platforms.&nbsp; Balancing out data gravity and I/O costs will determine which technology to place transactional processing and critical workloads.&nbsp; In the meantime, teams can easily use the same tools and standards such as open source across all platforms including mainframe.&nbsp; Form always follows function and tech decisions must match the business use case.&nbsp; Constellation expects mainframe to play not only a key role for decades to come, but also to expand its footprint in the overall technology and business strategy of leading organizations.</p>

					<br><h2>Welcome to geezer town, junior.</h2>
<p>While researching my recent article, “<a title="Article on Age Discrimination by yours truly" href="https://improvingsoftware.com/2009/04/20/age-discrimination-and-programming-jobs/" target="_self">Age discrimination and Programming Jobs</a>”&nbsp;, I discovered a <a title="NYT Article: &quot;Now Hiring, if you're young.&quot;" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/26/opinion/now-hiring-if-you-re-young.html" target="_blank">1998 Op-Ed piece from The New York Times</a>&nbsp;that cited some startling statistics from the NSF and Census bureau about the longevity of a software engineering career.</p>
<blockquote><p>[S]ix years after finishing college, 57 percent of computer science graduates are working as programmers; at 15 years the figure drops to 34 percent, and at 20 years — when most are still only in their early 40’s — it is down to 19 percent. In contrast, the figures for civil engineering are 61 percent, 52 percent and 52 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p><img data-attachment-id="677" data-permalink="https://improvingsoftware.com/2009/05/19/programmers-before-you-turn-40-get-a-plan-b/retiredprogrammer/" data-orig-file="https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/retiredprogrammer.jpg" data-orig-size="210,210" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="RetiredProgrammerButton" data-image-description="<p>Retired programmer button</p>
" data-medium-file="https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/retiredprogrammer.jpg?w=210" data-large-file="https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/retiredprogrammer.jpg?w=210" title="RetiredProgrammerButton" src="https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/retiredprogrammer.jpg?w=468" alt="RetiredProgrammerButton" srcset="https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/retiredprogrammer.jpg 210w, https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/retiredprogrammer.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px">I find the defensive tone of the article and the use of dubious sampling of only computer science graduates to support its conclusion undermines its credibility. In a lot of ways, the Government has been very slow to grok the software engineering trade. In this study it completely ignores the significant number of working programmers who either earned their degree in another discipline or never finished college.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Still, smart money seems to concur that the software engineer depreciates only slightly more slowly than the machine he or she toils behind as exemplified in this 1996 comment from <a title="Craig Barrett Bio" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Barrett_(businessman)" target="_blank">Craig Barrett</a>, then President and Co-founder of Intel.</p>
<blockquote><p>The half-life of an engineer, software or hardware, is only a few years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure, the guy’s a suit, but more importantly he was (at the time) a 57 year old former engineer publicly reinforcing the discriminatory notion of expiration dates on other engineers. It’s scary as hell to think that such an influential industry insider thinks that a programming career is roughly the same as a professional basketball player’s.</p>

<h2>My take on the issue</h2>
<p>Considerable accusatory ink has been dedicated to the age discrimination problem in technology, but I suspect it may be an inevitable consequence of the rapid pace of change that defines this field.</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The market value of an employee is primarily determined by experience in technologies relevant to the employer.</li>
<li>Software engineering reliably undergoes a major technology shift at least every 10 years.</li>
<li>While a technology shift doesn’t completely negate the skills of veterans, it certainly levels the playing field for recent grads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now put yourself in the shoes of a prospective hiring manager using a newer technology like Ruby on Rails for which nobody other than <a title="Creator of Rails" href="http://www.loudthinking.com/about.html" target="_blank">David Heinemeier</a>has more than about 5 years of experience. &nbsp;Sure, that extra 10 years of C++ experience is a positive differentiator for the veteran over the upstart with the same 3 years of Rails experience.&nbsp; All things equal you’d naturally hire the guy with more total experience.</p>
<p>However, all things are NOT equal. Those 10 years of C++ experience made the veteran candidate progressively more expensive as they leveraged the value of that experience in jobs requiring C++. The problem is that the marginal utility of that extra experience must exceed the marginal cost of hiring the veteran to justify paying the premium.</p>
<p>Herein is the source of the problem. The more irrelevant experience a candidate has, the more lopsided the utility/value equation becomes, and this presumes that the manager even has the luxury of paying extra to get that experience.</p>
<p>Even if the veteran prices himself competitively with a younger candidate, the hiring manager has to consider the implications of bringing in someone taking a big pay cut. Will they have morale issues from day one? Are they going to change their mind after a month that they really do need that extra cash and leave? It’s a sticky situation.</p>
<p>The unfortunate truth is that unlike other forms of discrimination that are more arbitrary and capricious, age discrimination can often be a result of objective and sound business justifications. I’m not trying to justify it as an acceptable practice, but just trying to describe the pickle it puts the manager in trying to make a sound business decision without compromising the ethical and legal obligations of the company.</p>
<h2>So what’s your plan B?</h2>
<p>Assuming you aren’t fabulously wealthy, accepted to clown college, or the fatal victim of a Red-bull induced heart attack by 40 a mitigation strategy is in order. Here are some viable options.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="678" data-permalink="https://improvingsoftware.com/2009/05/19/programmers-before-you-turn-40-get-a-plan-b/chooseadventure/" data-orig-file="https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/chooseadventure.jpg" data-orig-size="190,310" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="chooseadventure" data-image-description="<p>Choose Your Adventure Book Cover- The Cave of Time</p>

<h3>Work for the one person who would never discriminate against you.</h3>
<p>No. Not your mother. You! If you aren’t the entrepreneurial type, consider a consultancy. For some reason that I don’t completely get, a little gray hair and a smattering of experience in different technologies can create a beneficial bias for companies when they are renting brains instead of buying them outright. It may have something to do with the tendency for consultants to be vetted from higher up in the management chain where the silver foxes live.</p>



<h3>Give in to the dark side and go into management.</h3>
<p>I’d argue that a career in programming does precious little to prepare someone for management, but clearly management thinks that everyone including technologists harbors a deep longing to “graduate” into their ranks. I think it a fallacy that no one would continue to design and build software for 20 years unless they had no ambition or growth potential. However, people like me that respect such dedication to the craft are in the minority. Maybe it is best to just stop fighting it, but consider the following before taking the plunge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mid-level managers often make very little more, if not the same as high level engineers.</li>
<li>It gets progressively harder to keep up with new technology because you don’t work directly with it.</li>
<li>Meetings, politics and dealing with unrealistic requests will pretty much become your life.</li>
<li>You may try to avoid it, but management-speak will creep into your vocabulary (did you notice my “paradigm” comment earlier?)</li>
<li>Even when it isn’t your fault, it’s your fault.</li>
<li>Even when you make it succeed, your team should get the credit.</li>
<li>Being the wunderkind as a technologist is much easier to do in technology than management, you’ll have to check your ego at the door.</li>
<li>You will be forced to make decisions that affect people’s personal life (pay, bonus, firing, etc.) and this is hard to stomach sometimes.</li>
<li>It is very empowering, enjoyable to be able to set the agenda and sometimes say, “No. We ain’t doing that shit.”</li>
<li>Computers are predictable, people are complicated. You will eventually fantasize about robot employees.</li>
<li>Mentoring can be very rewarding, but also very challenging.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>The most difficult thing in the world is to know how to do a thing and to watch someone else do it wrong without comment.<br>
-Theodore H. White.</p></blockquote>
<h3>You’ve got a cash cow, milk that sucker!</h3>
<p>I know you love programming because you like technology, so this may go against your very nature, but no one says you’ve got to jump every time some snot-nosed kid invents a new way to run byte-code. You have invested a lot of time and energy mastering the technology you use, and your experience differentiates you. Money follows scarcity, and snow-birding on an older technology, if you can stomach it, may just be the way to protect your earning potential. The industry turns on a dime, but is slow to retire proven technology. It is highly likely that you will still be able to earn some decent coin in the technology you know and love even after a few decades.</p>

                            <h2>Corporate Strategy at Scale: Emerging Thinking on How Companies and Economies Evolve</h2>

<div><p>
One of the key leadership dimensions required in our increasingly dynamic business and economic environment is a sound understanding of the big picture. Shrinking product lifecycles and corporate lifespans make it essential for those in charge of bringing to market the innovations of tomorrow to widen and extend their horizons further into the future. This course introduces a novel way of understanding how businesses and economies, as complex systems of unique business spaces, evolve and interrelate over long periods of time. It is a holistic perspective that allows us to define and analyze emerging behaviors that cannot be determined simply by examining each system part in isolation.</p><p>

In this course, we will learn about (1) a new theory of needs and value; (2) commoditization and innovation as the two fundamental forces that shape the business and economic environment; (3) the foundation of lasting corporate success—an alignment between a company’s intent and its actual approach to business; and (4) an economy’s natural behavior and its impact on the society. We will discuss examples from such companies as Apple and IBM, and will review and reassess some established and popular theoretical concepts. The framework will provide those in product management or product marketing with a valuable new tool for positioning new products, motivating teams, and crafting successful strategies.</p><u>Guest Speakers</u><p> include:</p><u>April 15</u><p>: "<strong>Science Fiction as a Business Tool</strong>" -&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogerspitz/" target="_blank">Roger Spitz</a></strong>, Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Techistential</p><u>April 22</u><p>: "<strong>Understanding Needs in Emerging Markets</strong>" -&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.uvm.edu/business/profiles/srini_venugopal" target="_blank">Srinivas Venugopal</a></strong>, Assistant Professor of Marketing at&nbsp;University of Vermont</p><u>April 29</u><p>: "<strong>Strategic Cartography: Mapping Tech Product Expansions</strong>" -&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kitmerker/" target="_blank">Kit Merker</a></strong>, Chief Operating Officer at&nbsp;Nobl9</p><u>May 6</u><p>: "<strong>Market Segmentation as a Key Success Driver in a Fast-Changing World</strong>" -&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jen-whelan-a280b113/" target="_blank">Jennifer Whelan</a></strong>, Vice President and Head of B2B Marketing at Verizon Media</p><u>May 20</u><p>: "<strong>Complexity Trade-Offs in Companies and Economies</strong>" -&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-siegenfeld/" target="_blank">Alexander Siegenfeld</a></strong>, Graduate Student Researcher at New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI) and MIT Media Lab</p><u>May 27</u><p>:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akvaal/" target="_blank">Andrew Kvaal</a></strong>, Chief Operating Officer at Ampion, Inc.</p></div>

        <p>I really don't.&nbsp; I mean I guess it's because part of me just feels 
like writing.&nbsp; I don't talk to too many people, so this is sort of my 
way of expressing myself.&nbsp; And when I do talk to people I generally 
don't say much, I just listen and ask questions.&nbsp; I don't feel my life 
is anything but ordinary, although I guess it is rather spectacular.&nbsp; I 
mean it is life after all, and I once heard that all the dead wish for 
is to be alive.<br></p><p>Not even sure why I feel the need to express 
what it is I'm thinking anyways.&nbsp; It's rather futile and meaningless.&nbsp; 
Among other things I also don't care if anyone even reads this, nor do I
 expect anyone too.&nbsp; It's almost like talking to yourself in the shower 
when no one is in the room.<br></p><p>Feels nice.</p><p>Although, I 
guess from an outsiders point of view, it might look a bit foolish.&nbsp; A 
man just rambling about nothing.&nbsp; Could be soothing I suppose, the 
distraction from your own thoughts, into the world of some one else's. 
The liberty to lose yourself, and end up in the imagination of someone 
else.&nbsp; If it's a well enough written piece, it might even spark an 
emotion, or a laugh.&nbsp; Maybe even chuckle. Unfortunately, that's not what
 you're getting today.</p><p>You're stuck with this, a rambling.<br></p><p>There
 was this one time I was just sitting there looking outside, and I 
imagined a squirrel.&nbsp; I'm sure there was probably a squirrel near by, 
but I didn't see it, so I had to imagine one.&nbsp; Granted what I imagined I
 don't think any squirrel would do, at least currently. &nbsp;</p><p>It held a
 concerto.&nbsp; It walked on stage, this imaginary stage, and started to 
conduct one of the most amazing pieces of compositions ever imagined, by
 pigeons.&nbsp; The rats of the sky.</p><p>As they flew and frolicked through
 the melody of his rhythm, it all started to fall into place.&nbsp; I would 
say I was escaping what ever it is I was doing to enjoy this, but in 
reality I had nothing to escape, I was sitting in silence with company.</p><p>Not
 sure why it was a squirrel I imagined either.&nbsp; Probably had something 
to do with the fact that another time I was sitting in silence, I saw an
 actual squirrel trying to get some from some other squirrel.&nbsp; It 
actually managed to score.</p><p>The simple things in life.&nbsp; </p><p>Now I
 probably shouldn't even publish this, I mean for all it's frankness 
it's simply yet another waste of space.&nbsp; Although it is a space that I 
enjoy wasting.&nbsp; I guess one of these days I should write something of 
value or sustenance.&nbsp; Perhaps even of use.&nbsp; </p><p>I'd probably be 
getting ahead of myself at that point though, as most things I say lack 
value, and are too light to have sustenance.&nbsp; Yet here we are.&nbsp; It's 
almost like reading a bad book, you keep turning the pages in hopes you 
will find that nugget of wisdom.</p><p>But alas it wont come, I will 
instead just torture your poor thoughts with more fluff.&nbsp; Not because I 
want too, but because I feel I must.&nbsp; Why I feel that is unknown to me, 
yet I keep writing.&nbsp; I could go down some rabbit hole of why or how you 
could do something, but that would be no fun.&nbsp; It would simply be 
literal.</p><p>Plus the poor rabbit would probably be upset you are in 
his hole.&nbsp; He would probably scream some obscenities to us anyways for 
intruding in it's hole.&nbsp; How would we even make it down this hole, I'm a
 human, and most rabbits are tiny, so I guess it would have to be some 
sort of hybrid rabbit human hole.&nbsp; I also don't even know your 
dimensions, what if you're a giant, or a spec.&nbsp; Would it even work, or 
would the hole collapse on it's self by us just being in it's presence.</p><p>Would
 the rabbit even be a he? Could be a female rabbit you know, which would
 make the intrusion that much worse.&nbsp; Not because gender plays any role 
in this rabbit hole, but because rabbit holes rhyme with foes.&nbsp; Which 
the lady rabbit would definitely consider us.&nbsp; So I guess it would be 
best to go down a manhole instead.</p><p>But the acoustics wouldn't be 
as good for the squirrel concerto.&nbsp; What a pity, because that reality 
was starting to pigeonhole me.&nbsp; Then again it's easy to throw anything 
into a hole.&nbsp; The problem turns out to be catching what ever you threw 
in before it unrolls.&nbsp; Thankfully we got rock and roll instead</p>

    <div>
      
      <div><p>We’ve launched a brand new version of Element, called <a href="https://element.io/element-home">Element Home</a>!<br></p><p>It’s the Element app, but faster, personalised and under your control - all packaged up so you don’t have to worry about how it works! You can just enjoy the fact you know you chose someone you trust (us!) with your data.<br></p><p>So that you know, here’s what’s going on behind the scenes with Element Home; in practice you’re getting your own fully managed, dedicated server alongside your Element app. It means you have a notably faster service than when using a typical free public server - you’re saved the hassle of self-hosting and it’s guaranteed to be kept updated with the very latest and greatest Matrix hosting best practices.<br></p><div><p>On top of faster messaging, Element Home comes with five user accounts. It’s the ideal way for a family, or groups of friends, to get a super-quick professionally hosted version of Element.</p><p><strong>A new type of messenger</strong></p></div><p>As you know, Element is completely different to most messaging apps. <br></p><p>Because Element is <strong>decentralised</strong>, the app itself (what you see) is separate from the Matrix hosting service behind it (what you don’t see; the movement of messages and where they are stored).<br></p><p>That’s important because it lets users decide where their messages and data are kept. In owning that choice, you also get to own your data and messages rather than having them sucked up into the likes of Facebook Messenger, Signal, Telegram or WhatsApp.<br></p><p>Some people choose to host themselves, and that’s great. As it requires some technical knowledge, many others choose to use a free public hosting service such as Matrix.org to get up and running.<br></p><p>Element Home is a third option; the ability to pay for a fully managed, dedicated server (aka a ‘homeserver’). Being a dedicated server, it devotes itself to just a handful of users; and that’s why it’s so much quicker than a typical free public server that constantly juggles thousands of users.</p><p><strong>There are many messaging apps, but surprisingly little choice.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 2108w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Element compared with centralised messaging apps.</figcaption></figure><p><br><strong>Free vs $10 per month</strong><br></p><p>As you know, Element and Matrix is all about giving you choice. If you want to use the free version, that’s completely fine by us!<br></p><p>But here’s the extra you get in return for a few bucks a month:<br></p><ol><li>Element Home means you’re <strong>hosted by Element Matrix Services</strong> - our Matrix-based hosting platform used by big companies and public sector organisations. You have a <strong>dedicated server</strong> (so you’re sharing minimal infrastructure with anyone else), fully managed and maintained by the most Matrix-savvy team in the world.<br></li><li>Professional-hosting means the service is <strong>notably faster</strong> than when hosted by a typical free public server, and <strong>always fully updated</strong> and maintained.<br></li><li>An Element domain that you can name, so you can make <strong>memorable Matrix IDs</strong> such as @yourfirstname:yoursurname.ems.host. Use your surname as the domain, and it’s perfect for family sharing!<br></li><li><strong>Five Element accounts</strong> - so after using one yourself, you’ll have four more for family or friends - so that’s <strong>just $2 per user per month</strong> for a super-quick data sovereign messaging service (you can add more users if you wish).</li></ol><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png 848w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Matching IDs for all the family!</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Wishing you could turn back time?!</strong></p><p>If you’re an Element user and you’re self-hosting, or using a typical free public server (such as Matrix.org), you can simply copy your existing account over to Element Home. Currently, you can only do this in the Element web app (we’re working on an equally simple upgrade from within Android and iOS). Once you’ve upgraded your ‘old’ account will still be live, so feel free to keep it or delete it as you see fit.<br></p><p>For those not already up and running on Element, just <a href="https://element.io/element-home">sign up for Element Home</a> from here.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><small>This article by Dr <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> is part of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru" title="SuperMemo Guru">SuperMemo Guru</a> series on memory, learning, creativity, and problem solving.</small>
</p>


<h2><span id="Estimating_total_knowledge_in_the_brain">Estimating total knowledge in the brain</span></h2>
<p>I am finally closer to being able to say how much knowledge a human brain can hold. Scientists have counted the number of synapses in the human brain (above 100 trillion), and came up with staggering numbers on brain capacity. However, in real life, we see the brain as an unreliable and forgetful device. For an average student, to learn 100 new French words for an exam is an effort. To memorize 45,000 words of English in the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Advanced_English" title="Advanced English">Advanced English</a> collection is a feat very few achieved for the cost in time. In other words, trillions of synapses seem to contradict our struggles with mere thousands of questions we need to know to function effectively on a daily basis.
</p>
<h2><span id="SuperMemo_estimates">SuperMemo estimates</span></h2>
<p>30 years ago, using simulations of the learning process in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>, I predicted that I will not see a human memorize a million <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item" title="Item">items</a>. Today, even a million seems like a super-optimistically high number.
</p><p><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> makes estimates easy. We can count individual questions and answers, and worry less how many bits of information get stored in the brain. The estimates are pretty inaccurate to evaluate the totality of knowledge. For example, I once computed that I am able to recognize around 30,000 human faces without even trying. Some knowledge flows in effortlessly. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> measures harder knowledge that we want to preserve due to its high value.
</p><p>For 32 years now, I have been using SuperMemo to control what knowledge I remember with high recall. In those three decades, there were a couple of breakthroughs where I could sense a significant acceleration or an increase to the quality of learning. In particular, the arrival of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a> in 1999 and the employment of the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Priority_queue" title="Priority queue">priority queue</a> in 2006 were such booster events. However, the total number of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item" title="Item">items</a> in the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Collection" title="Collection">collection</a> is not a true reflection of knowledge. In <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a>, the tolerance for knowledge overload increases, and the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Priority_queue" title="Priority queue">priority queue</a> makes it possible to focus on top priority <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item" title="Item">items</a>, while neglecting lesser knowledge. In other words, we can perfectly know a smaller set of items, and know a huge set of items more superficially. The only good reflection of knowledge would be to consider the probability of recall for all individual items.
</p>
<h2><span id="Adding_up_memory_retrievability">Adding up memory retrievability</span></h2>
<p>With the new <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition" title="Spaced repetition">spaced repetition</a> algorithm, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Algorithm_SM-17" title="Algorithm SM-17">Algorithm SM-17</a> (2015), we can finally take a <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Repetition_history" title="Repetition history">repetition history</a> of each <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item" title="Item">item</a> and estimate the chance of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Recall" title="Recall">recall</a> at any point in time with pretty good accuracy. The last tool missing in the box was a chance to take any point in time (a date), and run the estimate for all items in the entire <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Collection" title="Collection">collection</a> (e.g. <i>"How much did I know on Jan 1, 2000?"</i>). The only problem with such estimates is that they are computationally expensive. Finally, in 2020, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_18" title="SuperMemo 18">SuperMemo 18</a> makes it possible to chose a selected number of time points in the lifetime of any <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Collection" title="Collection">collection</a>, and run total knowledge estimates. For any date, the total knowledge estimate is the sum of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_retrievability" title="Memory retrievability">memory retrievability</a> estimates for that given point in time.
</p>
<p>Total knowledge can be estimated by adding up <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_retrievability" title="Memory retrievability">memory retrievability</a> for all individual items</p>
<h2><span id="Longitudinally_largest_data_set">Longitudinally largest data set</span></h2>
<p>I safely hold the record for the longest continuous use of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition" title="Spaced repetition">spaced repetition</a> (over 32 years at the moment of writing). I will keep the title as long as I keep learning. I was simply the first to start (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Birth_of_SuperMemo" title="Birth of SuperMemo">Birth of SuperMemo</a>). I hope to keep going as long as health permits. This is why my own collection is the best source of data today to make lifelong learning estimates (Jan 1, 2020). 
</p><p>There was a minor problem on the way however. Full record of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Repetition_history" title="Repetition history">repetition history</a> was kept only as of 1996 (due to costs and limitations on the available storage in the late 1980s). Seemingly, this might make the first 9 year of data unreliable. However, SuperMemo can provide a reasonable simulation of repetition histories for items with a known number of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Lapse" title="Lapse">lapses</a>, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Repetition" title="Repetition">repetitions</a>, and the last <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Interval" title="Interval">interval</a>. Those simulations cut the 9 years to roughly 6-7 years, and are accurate enough to make an imperceptible difference to the final outcome unless a major incongruity hides in that early period. I bet my right hand this is not the case. I was easily able to learn at 10,000 items per year in the early years, but total <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Retrievability" title="Retrievability">retrievability</a> estimates cut this number substantially.
</p><p>I split my 32 years of learning into 60 equal intervals and let the computational procedure run overnight. In the morning, I had a beautiful graph that I want to share for the new year 2020. The staggering conclusion is that all my perceptions about acceleration, slow downs, improved learning, or neglect were largely illusory. For 32 years, I kept building up knowledge at a remarkably steady rate. In the early years, the effort seemed a bit harder, I needed more self-discipline, there were outstanding items, long days of repetitions, etc. In the times of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a> it all turn out to be fun, learning with pleasure, and learning on demand, i.e. learning mostly for a specific purpose when I needed new knowledge. My departure into unrelated areas of learning proceeded at leisurely pace. With all those seeming upheavals and changes, hardly any kink shows up in the graph. Many people misread that observation as a disappointment with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>. Metaphorically speaking, I am only surprised with the smooth ride of the rocket. The speed is no less fantastic.

<h2><span id="Conceptualization_process">Conceptualization process</span></h2>
<p>To make a good estimate of maximum human knowledge, we need to have data that would span a 100 years period. This is how long an average human might live given a perfect lifestyle, good health, and a couple of other conditions. My 32 years of learning fall into the most uneventful period that is characterized by steady linear progress. In theory, the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Conceptualization" title="Conceptualization">conceptualization</a> process in the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Concept_network" title="Concept network">concept network</a> of the brain should begin slowly. It might possibly saturate when the ceiling of the brain size is reached. Those early and late changes in the speed of conceptualization will be reflected in the underlying speed of learning. This is illustrated in the figure with the light blue line marked as computational <b>Capacity</b>:

<h2><span id="Combining_data_from_many_users">Combining data from many users</span></h2>
<p>To make a good estimate I would need data from many users. In particular, the first 10 years of life, and the data past the age of 80 are most precious. We have surprisingly many users in those age categories, but all users learn at different speeds, use different strategies, learn different things, etc. This is why we need collections that span a decade or more. Short periods cannot be collated from many collections because they are largely uninformative. Regrettably, I have hundreds of collections submitted in various circumstances, and they mostly come from young or middle aged users. They also predominantly come from novices. To this day, I do not have any data from users above the age of 80.
</p><p>I was hoping that my own data might hint if the fifth decade of life brings some slowdown to the learning process. However, my data has been polluted with a great deal of self-experimentation. To account for artifacts of experimental learning, I needed extra correction procedures. In the end, depending on the method, I received a different verdict. My learning might have slowed down a bit, or it might have actually accelerated (my unreliable perception leans towards the latter).
</p><p>By combining data from collections of users at different ages I arrived at a hypothetical course of learning in a lifetime. Unfortunately, the projected slowdown after 70 is just a hypothesis. I tried to imagine myself in a wheelchair at 100, and the mere loss of mobility, I imagine, would undermine my ability to progress with learning at the present rate. I have no data to prove the slowdown. It is just a common sense speculation and my best guess based on four decades of analysis and deliberations on the nature of learning.

March 1, 2021 | https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Why, in 2021, does anyone need to learn about assembly language?
First, reading assembly language is the way to know <em>exactly</em> what
your program is doing. Why, <em>exactly</em>, is that C++ program 1 MiB (say)
instead of 100 KiB? Is it possible to squeeze some more performance
out of that function that gets called all the time?</p><p>For C++ in particular, it is easy to forget or just not notice some
operation (e.g., an implicit conversion or a call to a copy
constructor or destructor) that is implied by the source code and
language semantics, but not spelled out explicitly. Looking at the
assembly generated by the compiler puts everything in plain sight.</p><p>Second, the more practical reason: so far, posts on this blog haven’t
required an understanding of assembly language, despite constant
links to <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>. By <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottWolchok/status/1361022423399755776">popular
demand</a>,
however, our next topic will be parameter passing, and for that, we
will need a basic understanding of assembly language. We will focus
only on <em>reading</em> assembly language, not writing it.</p><p>The basic unit of assembly language is the <strong>instruction</strong>. Each
machine instruction is a small operation, like adding two numbers,
loading some data from memory, jumping to another memory location
(like the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto">goto</a>
statement), or calling or returning from a function. (The x86
architecture has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">lots of not-so-small
instructions</a>
as well. Some of these are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5959890/enter-vs-push-ebp-mov-ebp-esp-sub-esp-imm-and-leave-vs-mov-esp-ebp">legacy
cruft</a>
built up over the 40-odd years of the architecture’s existence, and
others are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">newfangled
additions</a>. )</p><p>Our first toy example will get us acquainted with simple
instructions. It just calculates the square of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm">norm</a>
of a 2D vector:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Vec2</span> {
    <span>int64_t</span> x;
    <span>int64_t</span> y;
};

<span>int64_t</span> <span>normSquared</span>(Vec2 v) {
    <span>return</span> v.x <span>*</span> v.x <span>+</span> v.y <span>*</span> v.y;
}
</code></pre></div><p>and here is the resulting x86_64 assembly from clang 11, <a href="https://godbolt.org/#z:OYLghAFBqd5QCxAYwPYBMCmBRdBLAF1QCcAaPECAM1QDsCBlZAQwBtMQBGAFlICsupVs1qhkAUgBMAISnTSAZ0ztkBPHUqZa6AMKpWAVwC2tQVvQAZPLUwA5YwCNMxEADZSAB1QLC62nsMTQS8fNTorG3sjJxd3JRUw2gYCZmICAONTTkVlTFU/ZNSCCLtHZzdFFLSMoOyFKuLrUujy1wBKRVQDYmQOAHIpAGZrZEMsAGpxQZ1kevx6KexxAAYAQRXV%2BuIDVXGANTzJSYB2WTXxi/HrAlduAH0CcYAPKbPVy6v6W4fxgE9XjbiY4AEQBaw212%2Bj1oJCMDAAjgZUph0BADsgjgA3NonN4fYiYAjdWjjTEAOie4wAVKSKZMZLTftTGWD1iC%2Bh1WCA%2BgBWPqkUx9Zb81DcnRyOTjBRdHqYemDTj8gjc4VtDoAaxAg0GZO1ev1BvcXL63H5guFpFFfX5ChAy1IyqFHNIcFgSDQRg8eHYZAoEA9Xp9KGEok4nGW2So3oIzltEAcKv5DmsqV%2B3MVpA9Ri0BAA8rRWGmnaQsEYRMB2ImS3gCflMZhbcXME88gYY%2Bn%2BddlB2hHgHMRU3osD2CMQ8EYOx0aPQmGwODx%2BIIQ2IJTJew5bZAOqgPIlGwBaXODcb7uZTYESGRySQW%2BJ5RKabQ1LKkcwlKIxYLeXx0Z9f0J%2BO%2BZQuHUuT5HQhTVPomSCHe4FJA0QEtCBlRFH%2BdSIU0H7lJwHTSt0vRcJy3J8gKVZWk8AAcrj7rc4yjOW4xhmSyxkpw4wQLghAkPK2TjHonres4vE4uKV4yEqiZqqQmrarqBoKdqRrcqaZHFlaNp2g6UkujAiAoKggk%2BuQlABkJLgMaG4aRtGsaUAmxbJrQqY9lmOb5oWValuWlbFvgtZqPWjYWs2rbtn0GZdsaFqsH2A7EL8Q79Bao7jpOpDTowLCVguAiSEI5YoKu8ixRu8DbrufgHkeJ5noMF7FTeNpgQ%2BEDmOhr7aEhn7ZCEP7%2BNBtSeN%2BiTdThOQJAUDQdXBiSQY0kTAbB02DS%2B9RFGNIF4TKhG4UIJFmuR3JUTRdGWcATGcCxbEcVxRDELxpD8YZgbCUMkiicVklOtJsk6opin7Sah3qdymn2o6qrEX0kggxaGnaT9HT1sQPgaNwQA%3D%3D">via Compiler Explorer</a>:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>imulq</span>   %rdi, %rdi

        <span>retq</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s talk about that first instruction: <code>imulq %rdi, %rdi</code>. This
instruction <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/imul">performs signed integer
multiplication</a>. The <code>q</code>
suffix tells us that it is operating on 64-bit quantities. (In
contrast, <code>l</code>, <code>w</code>, and <code>b</code> would denote 32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit,
respectively.) It multiplies the value in the first given register
(<code>rdi</code>; register names are prefixed with a <code>%</code> sign) by the value in
the second register and stores the result in that second
register. This is squaring <code>v.x</code> in our example C++ code.</p><p>The second instruction does the same with the value in <code>%rsi</code>, which
squares <code>v.y</code>.</p><p>Next, we have an odd instruction: <code>leaq (%rsi,%rdi), %rax</code>. <code>lea</code>
stands for “load effective address”, and it stores the address of the
first operand into the second operand. <code>(%rsi, %rdi)</code> means “the
memory location pointed to by <code>%rsi + %rdi</code>”, so this is just adding
<code>%rsi</code> and <code>%rdi</code> and storing the result in <code>%rax</code>. <code>lea</code> is a quirky
x86-specific instruction; on a more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISC</a>-y
architecture like ARM64, we would expect to see a plain old <code>add</code>
instruction.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>Finally, <code>retq</code> returns from the <code>normSquared</code> function.</p><p>Let’s take a brief detour to explain what the registers we saw in our
example are. Registers are the “variables” of assembly
langauge. Unlike your favorite programming language (probably), there
are a finite number of them, they have standardized names, and the
ones we’ll be talking about are at most 64 bits in size. Some of them
have specific uses that we’ll see later. I wouldn’t be able to rattle
this off from memory, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Architectural_features">per
Wikipedia</a>,
the full list<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> of 16 registers on x86_64 is <code>rax</code>, <code>rcx</code>, <code>rdx</code>, <code>rbx</code>,
<code>rsp</code>, <code>rbp</code>, <code>rsi</code>, <code>rdi</code>, <code>r8</code>, <code>r9</code>, <code>r10</code>, <code>r11</code>, <code>r12</code>, <code>r13</code>,
<code>r14</code>, and <code>r15</code>.</p><p>Now, let’s extend our example to debug print the <code>Vec2</code> in <code>normSquared</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Vec2</span> {
    <span>int64_t</span> x;
    <span>int64_t</span> y;
<span>    <span>void</span> <span>debugPrint</span>() <span>const</span>;
</span>};

<span>int64_t</span> <span>normSquared</span>(Vec2 v) {
<span>    v.debugPrint();
</span>    <span>return</span> v.x <span>*</span> v.x <span>+</span> v.y <span>*</span> v.y;
}
</code></pre></div><p>and, again, let’s see <a href="https://godbolt.org/#z:OYLghAFBqd5QCxAYwPYBMCmBRdBLAF1QCcAaPECAM1QDsCBlZAQwBtMQBGAFlICsupVs1qhkAUgBMAISnTSAZ0ztkBPHUqZa6AMKpWAVwC2tEJICcpLegAyeWpgByxgEaZiIAGykADqgWE6rR6hiaCfgFqdHYOzkZuHt5KKlG0DATMxAQhxqYWisqYqkHpmQQxTq7uXooZWTlhnLVlFXEJXgCUiqgGxMgcAORSAMz2yIZYANTiwzrICgT49DPY4gAMAILrGwvEBqqTAGpFktMA7LKbk9eT9gSe3AD6BJMAHjOXGze39A/PkwBPD7bb4AN1QeHQkywLgMwAACsQ7hAOpM0LQFsDNuIzgARLFbTZ3P4vWgkIwMACOBkymHQEGOyFOoNROM%2BYIAdDC4YjkR0Cd9iJgCL1aJNQRzXpMAFTiyXTGRygEypUEnG4gZdVggAYAVgGpFMAzWBtQOp0cjkkwUPT6mAVw04BoIOpNHS6AGsQMNhhyff6A4HvNqBtwDUaTaQzQMDQoQGtSC7jZrSHBYEg0EYfHh2GQKBBM9ncyhhKJOJw1k0qDmCO44xAXK6DS57JkATqnaRM0YtAQAPK0Vjt5OkLBGETAdhN0d4IXFUGYOMjzCvIoGWsdg13ZSboR4FzENt6LC7ghIoybro0ehMNgcHj8QSlsSWmR7lxxyBdVA%2BVJLgC0fbDJM/4LOgMy4hIMhyJIkbJEUqSaNoDSmE01itFUHhNBEgR0Ch4T%2BLhtAYfE1RNPBxR0KU9T6LkggUak1HlPYlSkVhzQ0aEqEccxsSYVwXQ2r0/QCUIOr6oa07Rq8AAcnj/g8aLPpM5YcmsHKcJMEC4IQJAOk0kx6FmObuPpqIWtBMjOk27qkF6Pp%2BoGTk%2BsGOphpJI7RrG8aJjZqYwIgKCoMZubkJQhYmR44wTuWlakNWrC1sQ9aNiOLa0G2u7dr2A5DtOY4TlOI74HOagLkukYrmuG4DJ224hpGrD7oexAAsegyRmeeAXrVKbXowLBTg%2BAiSEIE4oK%2B8hNR%2B8Dfr%2BQQAUBIFgRBUGyDIsGxoUlGmBA1j4Zwo3oSxbRkcMviEakB2jThqQke0nDnQxJR1NktGNKNz1Ua991nTx108b9WHDIJtoiZwWrieGUk6rJ8mKdFogqZwakaVpOlEMQ%2BmkIZwVFqZIySOZk3Wcmtn2b6znOWJobQ55OreQmSZupDAySHTkZeb5ZNdAuyVBCA3BAA">the generated assembly</a>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>subq</span>    <span>$24</span>, %rsp

</code></pre></div><p>In addition to the obvious call to <code>Vec2::debugPrint() const</code>, we have
some other new instructions and registers! <code>%rsp</code> is special: it is
the “stack pointer”, used to maintain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">function call
stack</a>. It points to the
bottom of the stack, which grows “down” (toward lower addresses) on
x86. So, our <code>subq $24, %rsp</code> instruction is making space for three
64-bit integers on the stack. (In general, setting up the stack and
registers at the start of your function is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue">function
prologue</a>.) Then, the
following two <code>mov</code> instructions store the first and second arguments
to <code>normSquared</code>, which are <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> (more about how parameter
passing words in the next blog post!) to the stack, effectively
creating a copy of <code>v</code> in memory at the address <code>%rsp + 8</code>. Next, we
load the address of our copy of <code>v</code> into <code>%rdi</code> with <code>leaq 8(%rsp), %rdi</code> and then call <code>Vec2::debugPrint() const</code>.</p><p>After <code>debugPrint</code> has returned, we load <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> back into
<code>%rcx</code> and <code>%rax</code>. We have the same <code>imulq</code> and <code>addq</code> instructions as
before. Finally, we <code>addq $24, %rsp</code> to clean up the 24
bytes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> of stack space we allocated at the start of
our function (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue#Epilogue">function
epilogue</a>),
and then return to our caller with <code>retq</code>.</p><p>Now, let’s look at a different example. Suppose that we want to print
an uppercased C string and we’d like to avoid heap allocations for
smallish strings.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> We might write something like

</span></code></pre></div><p>Our function prologue has gotten a lot longer, and we have some new
control flow instructions as well. Let’s take a closer look at the
prologue:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>pushq</span>   %rbp
        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %rbp
        <span>pushq</span>   %r15
        <span>pushq</span>   %r14
        <span>pushq</span>   %rbx
        <span>pushq</span>   %rax
        <span>movq</span>    %rdi, %r14
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>pushq %rbp; movq %rsp, %rbp</code> sequence is very common: it pushes
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#FRAME-POINTER">frame
pointer</a>
stored in <code>%rbp</code> to the stack and saves the old stack pointer
(which is the new frame pointer) in <code>%rbp</code>. The following four
<code>pushq</code> instructions store registers that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI">we need to save before
using</a>.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
Finally, we save our first argument (<code>%rdi</code>) in <code>%r14</code>.</p><p>On to the function body. We call <code>strlen(s)</code> with <code>callq strlen</code> and
store <code>sSize + 1</code> in <code>%rdi</code> with <code>lea 1(%rax), %rdi</code>.</p><p>Next, we finally see our first <code>if</code> statement! <code>cmpq $1024, %rax</code> sets
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register">flags register</a>
according to the result of <code>%rax - $1024</code>, and then <code>ja .LBB0_2</code>
(“jump if above”) transfers control to the location labeled <code>.LBB0_2</code>
if the flags indicate that <code>%rax &gt; 1024</code>. In general, higher-level
control-flow primitives like <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statements and loops are
implemented in assembly using conditional jump instructions.</p><p>Let’s first look at the path where <code>%rax &lt;= 1024</code> and thus the branch
to <code>.LBB0_2</code> was not taken. We have a blob of instructions to create
<code>char temp[sSize + 1]</code> on the stack:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %r15
        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %rbx
        <span>addq</span>    <span>$15</span>, %rdi
        <span>andq</span>    <span>$-16</span>, %rdi
        <span>subq</span>    %rdi, %rbx
        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rsp
</code></pre></div><p>We save <code>%rsp</code> to <code>%r15</code> and <code>%rbx</code> for later
use.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Then, we add 15 to <code>%rdi</code> (which,
remember, contains the size of our array), mask off the lower 4 bits
with <code>andq $-16, %rdi</code>, and subtract the result from <code>%rbx</code>, which we
then put back into <code>%rsp</code>. In short, this rounds the array size up to
the next multiple of 16 bytes and makes space for it on the stack.</p><p>The following block simply calls <code>copyUppercase</code> and <code>puts</code> as written in the code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rdi
        <span>movq</span>    %r14, %rsi
        <span>callq</span>   <span>copyUppercase</span>(<span>char</span>*, <span>char</span> <span>const</span>*)
        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rdi
        <span>callq</span>   <span>puts</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, we have our function epilogue:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %r15, %rsp
        <span>leaq</span>    -<span>24</span>(%rbp), %rsp
        <span>popq</span>    %rbx
        <span>popq</span>    %r14
        <span>popq</span>    %r15
        <span>popq</span>    %rbp
        <span>retq</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We restore the stack pointer to deallocate our variable-length array
using <code>leaq</code>. Then, we <code>popq</code> the registers we saved during the
function prologue and return control to our caller, and we are done.</p><p>Next, let’s look at the path when <code>%rax &gt; 1024</code> and we branch to
<code>.LBB0_2</code>. This path is more …</p></div></div></div>

<p>I don’t normally enjoy writing controversial posts about why new technologies are bad; I LOVE it! So here we go! We’re starting a new large-scale first-party project over at <a href="https://themadbotter.com/">The Mad Botter</a> (sorry no details today) that requires a significant level of low-level engineering work on Linux.  Initially, we considered using some sort of solution like CYthon to compile Python to native code, but we ultimately decided against it. That led us to look at compiled languages.  Spoiler alert! We went with C++.  Before you flip your lid, here’s why. </p>



<p><strong>Multiple Platforms / Native Code</strong>:  Sure, I’ve spent a lot of energy trying to find cross-platform solutions that work well and the solution I came to is that are always compromises that aren’t the ones that I care to make; with that said, there’s a lot of good reasons to go with more traditionally write once run everywhere solutions. C++ allows us to have shared code (with some platform specific modifications to be sure)  compiled  for each of our desired platforms while also having specific modules to take advantage platform specific features.  A key point here is that by platforms we are not just talking about operating systems but also processor architectures; I’m looking at you Apple Silicon</p>



<p><strong>Modern C++:</strong> Over the last few releases C++ has seen some changes that aim to sand down some of the rougher edges of the language. Collections and memory management have been getting a lot of good attention in the last few releases. In particular, we found smart pointers to be particularly attractive; dare I say they are downright familiar at least on their face to this Objective-C die-hard fan; yes, I am still pining for my square brackets!</p>



<p><strong>Team Familiarity: </strong>OK, so this is a bit of a weak one in terms of technical reasons, but it’s actually pretty important. Compared to the competing low-level languages (Go and Rust), all of the team has at least some experience in C++ with some of us having quite a bit of experience in the language. While it shouldn’t drive all technical decisions, experience is a factor. </p>



<p>Before landing on C++ we ended up with three languages in the running at the end of the process: C++, C# (.Net) and Rust. C# was eliminated first for a few reasons including some extra hoops to work in it on Linux and macOS; having said that, .Net is much easier to develop in on Linux and macOS now than it ever was before. Rust almost took the cup and <a href="https://coder.show/">Coder Radio</a> listeners will know I am a Rust fan, but ultimately the existing C++ experience on the team carried the day and like a vinyl record collection at a hipster swap-meet, it’s golden.  Let me know what you think on <a href="https://twitter.com/dominucco">Twitter</a> and if you’re in need of Python, IOT or mobile development, reach out! A</p>

<p><em><a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/05ccbc28">Listen to narrated version</a></em></p>
<p><strong>How many should be teaching people how to succeed instead of just succeeding in their own way?</strong></p>
<p>As independent creators carve out a new career path for themselves, I suspect that some are unintentionally picking a path that limits their growth and robs the world of their true potential.</p>
<p>This theory was triggered by this Hunter Walk tweet:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/s1btlni3fe2mzxhghkm6.png" alt="Hunter Walk: the emerging newsletter playbook seems to be &quot;B-Players Writing About A-Players While Being Subscribed to by C-Players&quot;">
</p>
<p>The message is clear: By doing B player things, you are at least doing better than C players. <strong>But you will <em>never</em> be an A player using the B player playbook.</strong></p>
<p>Is that a tradeoff you are consciously making?</p>
<p>Of course it is too reductive to reduce pluripotent people to "A players" and "B players". You can be both in different domains, or transition from one to the other. And of course this is nowhere near as bad as the real-life "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_ceiling">glass ceiling</a>" or a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_ceiling">bamboo ceiling</a>" in normal careers, where a certain set of the workforce is unable to progress by sheer fact of <em>who they are</em>. That is obviously despicable and is a far more important societal issue.</p>
<p>But the meta-creator ceiling is interesting to me because it is a path that new creators <strong>follow by choice,</strong> yet <em>without being aware of it's limitations</em> because nobody is incentivized to warn them. Perhaps because it is an easier game than others, or perhaps because of hype and marketing.</p>
<p>No judgment — I of all people know that there are many ways to avoid asking what it is I really want to do with my life.</p>
<p>Perhaps some definitions are in order: <strong>A "Meta-Creator" is someone who creates content about creating, instead of just creating.</strong></p>
<p>The temptation toward being a Meta-Creator is extremely high. There are three paths:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The A-B-C Loop</strong>: People want success porn. They are oblivious to the <a href="https://medium.com/@coffeeandjunk/cognitive-bias-narrative-fallacy-9cff93a597b2">narrative fallacy</a> and ignore luck and complicating details. Your success creating success porn gains you access to more successful people who are only too happy to let you write their hagiography. You can spend an entire career mythologizing successful people, living a life of a bard rather than a hero. Always the vibesmaid, never the vibe.</li>
  <li><strong>The Creator Strange Loop:</strong> To <a href="https://twitter.com/philip_kiely/status/1349361401316446211?s=20">quote the always-brilliant Philip Kiely</a>: "First you do X, then you make content about doing X, then you make content about that content... One day you realize you haven't done X for six months. And there is only so much room for content at the highest levels of abstraction." Every single step makes logical sense because you have credibility from having just done the thing. After a while every step you take you wind back up at the same spot because you're in the generic Creator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop">strange loop</a> everyone has pigeonholed you in.</li>
  <li><strong>The Audience-Building Loop:</strong> The natural end game of the current <strong>Audience-First</strong> and <strong>Build in Public</strong> memes is that you naturally attract an audience of wannabe builders. There are only so many topics they want to buy, and so many things to incestuously sell to each other. The successful cohorts will be supported by the far bigger unsuccessful ones in a self-organizing pyramid scheme.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be extremely clear: You can be enormously successful and happy being a Meta-Creator, and bring success and happiness to millions, and that is no small feat. I enjoy Tim Ferris' podcasts and Tren Griffin's blogposts. No judgment if that's your thing. The economics make sense too — in a gold rush, go mine a bit of gold, then sell copies of the shovel you used because it is now proven to work. Just don't spend too long thinking about <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1284597930398105600?s=20">who arranged those economics in the first place</a>.</p>
<p>But, one, you may have a lower chance of success pursuing this path than others, because it is both available to everyone and zero-sum.</p>
<p>But I write for reason two: the sneaking suspicion that <em>even if you win</em> and are top of the heap at the Meta-Creator game, you are still limiting yourself from what you could be doing with your life. What the people you <em>actually</em> look up to are doing with theirs. What the world could be benefiting from if the greatest minds of our generation just applied themselves to other problems than "How to Crush it on Twitter" or "Get a Million YouTube Subscribers" or the 3923rd "How Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger Think" blogpost.</p>
<p>Smart, capable people like you and I can often approach life with more ambition than direction. We want success more than we want to solve problems. I think the way to approach the question of "what do I do to be successful", may be to flip it on its head:</p>
<p>Assume you will be successful at whatever game you play. <strong>Are you playing a game you want to win?</strong></p>

            <h2>What is Literate Programming?</h2>
            <p>Literate programming is a style of programming invented by Donald Knuth, where the main idea is
            that a program's source code is made primarily to be read and understood by other people, and
            secondarily to be executed by the computer.</p>
            
            <p>This frees the programmer from the structure of a program imposed by the computer and means that
            the programmer can develop programs in the order of the flow of their thoughts.</p>
            
            <p>A Literate program consists of explanation of the code in a natural language such as English, interspersed
            with snippets of code to be executed. This means that Literate programs are very easy to understand and share,
            as all the code is well explained.</p>
            
            <p>Literate, a tool for literate programming, will allow you to take a literate source file (<code>*.lit</code>) and
            either <em>tangle</em> the source file which will create a file with executable code, or <em>weave</em> the
            source file, which will generate an HTML document to be read as formatted documentation.</p>

<p>On day one of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/09/lessons-learned-on-an-engineering-manager-job-search/">my new job</a>, my manager tried to warn me:</p>



<blockquote><p>You’re going to struggle with imposter syndrome on this team. I struggled with it. Everyone does. It’s a part of the job.</p></blockquote>



<p>I didn’t believe him. I brushed it off with a self-deprecating joke about my enormous ego. And for the first month or so, I was fine. But then I wasn’t. </p>



<p>Imposter syndrome is a <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/01/never-underestimate-peoples-ability-to-not-hear-you/">sneaky son of a bitch</a>. It took me another month to realize that’s what I was feeling. </p>



<p>In hindsight, it should have been obvious. I didn’t pay any attention to the good stuff. A <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/08/the-key-to-happiness-is-to-stop-getting-upset-all-the-dang-time/">happy</a> team member or a piece of positive feedback was happenstance and good luck, obviously. That all would have happened even if I didn’t join, obviously. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/16/the-2-responsibilities-of-a-manager/">Any manager</a> in my shoes would have done that, obviously.</p>



<p>But whenever I found a scrap of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/13/clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind/">negativity</a> or unhappiness or <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/02/09/say-things-that-can-be-wrong/">disagreement</a>, my brain said “AHA! I knew it! Told ya chump, you don’t belong here!” That went on until today, when I was writing a stream of consciousness post. I realized mid-sentence that this is good old fashioned imposter syndrome. It’s so stereotypical that it’s downright boring.</p>



<p>But the tricky bit is <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/06/10/spotting-broken-processes/">breaking the cycle</a>, because it’s self-fulfilling. Here’s how it goes down for me:</p>



<ul><li>Step 1: Feel like an imposter</li><li>Step 2: Feel the urge to earn respect and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/19/avoid-avoiding/">be liked</a> to prove that I’m not an imposter</li><li>Step 3: Try to please everyone rather than pushing for <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/30/2021-the-year-of-courage/">what I think is best</a> which may upset people </li><li>Step 4: Come across as wishy washy and inexperienced</li><li>Step 5: Notice that, and go back to step 1.</li></ul>



<p>By feeling like an imposter, I end up acting like one. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/02/we-become-what-we-are-told-we-are/">We become what we are told we are</a>, and I told myself that I’m an imposter.</p>



<p>I have to <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/01/01/making-success-controllable/">kill step 3</a>. Please excuse me while I hype myself up to do that:</p>



<ul><li>I’ve been on <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/02/whats-in-a-team-name/">dozens of teams</a> over the past 13 years. </li><li>I’ve <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/08/becoming-a-leader-the-hard-and-only-way/">led most of them</a>, and they’ve all been successful.</li><li>People usually like me OK, and <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/02/11/who-cares-if-youre-liked/">it’s ok if some don’t</a>.</li><li>And a lame appeal to authority: I’ve read <em>so many books</em> about this stuff.</li></ul>



<p>I know what I’m doing. The only way to <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/01/18/consistency-beats-quality/">break the cycle</a> is to go do it. </p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization">Database Normalization</a> can be complicated. The definitions of the various "normal forms" are academic and not very practical. All this can leave one feeling lost. Hopefully, this guide can help. <strong>This guide aims to be a practical, succinct guide to database normalization for the working software engineer.</strong> In what follows we will look at the first few normal forms and their properties in simple language. (If you just want a table of normal forms and their properties, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Normal_forms">this table</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="basic-columns-and-special-columns">Basic columns and special columns</h2>
<p>In what follows I will refer to table columns as either "basic columns" or "special columns". When I say "basic", I really just mean "not special", which raises the core question of: <strong>What is meant by "special column"? Simply put, a special column is a column you could use to uniqely identify rows within a table.</strong><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> It is of critical important in database normalization to identify all the special columns of a table. This might naively seem easy to do, but determining the special columns of a table can quickly become a subtle and debatable business.</p>
<p>That said, there is one special column that is always straightforward, and will show up in essentially every production database table you will ever interact with: the serial <code>id</code> column. It's basically the <em>most</em> special column of all because it exists for the sole purpose of uniquely identifying rows in a table. It's so special in fact, that, really, it's too special, and so we will completely ignore it when discussing database normalization. I discuss this oddity in more detail in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="ignoring-the-serial-id-column">Ignoring the serial <code>id</code> column</h3>
<p>The reason we ignore the serial <code>id</code> column is because what we are really looking for is the <em>naturally</em> special columns. We are looking for the fundamental attributes, or properties, of the entities in question. We want to normalize the "real" data, the data you <em>need</em> in order to appropriately describe the entities. The serial <code>id</code> column isn't "real" data, it's not a property of the entity, it's just tacked on to a row to guarantee unique identification. Only by normalizing against the "real" data will you actually gain the benefits of normalization, which are, among other things, less duplication and less redundancy.</p>
<p>So, while I will include the <code>id</code> column in examples, because that's the most practical way to interact with tables, please keep in mind that (1) we will be ignoring it, and (2) why we are choosing to do so (which, as a reminder, is because we are only concerned with "real" data).</p>
<h2 id="first-normal-form-1nf">First Normal Form, 1NF</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_normal_form">First Normal Form</a>, simply put, means <strong>don't put lists in table cells</strong>.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Putting a list in a cell is strongly discouraged unless you have a very good reason to do so. There are multiple datatypes that will allow you to do this, for example the <code>ARRAY</code> keyword in SQL, but just because you can doesn't mean you should.</p>
<p>Before I discuss the most common way I see this violation occur, I want to briefly discuss JSON and JSONB data in table cells. JSON(B) is a valid data type, and has many justifiable use cases, including NoSQL-like data storage, but it should still be avoided unless you have a good reason to use it. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/datatype-json.html#JSON-DOC-DESIGN">Section 8.14.2</a> of the PostgreSQL docs states the following on this topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ideally, JSON documents should each represent an atomic datum that business rules dictate cannot reasonably be further subdivided into smaller datums that could be modified independently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, probably the most common way you'll see 1NF being violated is with cells containing comma-separated values as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>name</th>
<th>books</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>East of Eden,Green Eggs and Ham</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>Grapes of Wrath,The Cat in the Hat</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The solution to the problem is to create a row per book instead:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>name</th>
<th>book</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>East of Eden</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>Green Eggs and Ham</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>Grapes of Wrath</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>The Cat in the Hat</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>See Appendix A for a SQL<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> script that transforms the unnormalized example data into the 1NF data as shown above. It is in a format that's easy to copy and paste and experiment with yourself, which I encourage you to do.</p>
<h2 id="second-normal-form-2nf">Second Normal Form, 2NF</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_normal_form">Second Normal Form</a>, simply put, means that, in addition to being in 1NF, <strong>every basic column is determined by <em>all</em> the special columns</strong>. <sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> <sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>An example 1NF table that violates 2NF is as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>name</th>
<th>book</th>
<th>price</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>East of Eden</td>
<td>25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>Green Eggs and Ham</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>East of Eden</td>
<td>25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>Grapes of Wrath</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <code>price</code> column is determined completely by the <code>book</code> column, and nothing else. But, the special columns are both <code>book</code> <em>and</em> <code>name</code>. This partial determination of <code>price</code> by just <code>book</code>, and not also <code>name</code>, is a violation of 2NF. The logic here is that if a special column has no impact on a basic column, then the basic column probably shouldn't be in the table at all.</p>
<p>The solution is separating out the book details into a second table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>title</th>
<th>price</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>East of Eden</td>
<td>25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Grapes of Wrath</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Green Eggs and Ham</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>name</th>
<th>book_id</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is sufficient to satisfy 2nd Normal Form.<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>See Appendix B for a SQL script that transforms the 1NF table into 2NF tables as shown above. It is in a format that's easy to copy and paste and experiment with yourself, which I encourage you to do.</p>
<h2 id="third-normal-form-3nf">Third Normal Form, 3NF</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form">Third Normal Form</a>, simply put, means that, in addition to being in 2NF, <strong>every basic column is <em>directly</em> determined by the special columns</strong>.<sup id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7">7</a></sup> <sup id="fnref-8"><a href="#fn-8">8</a></sup> This might sound confusingly similar to 2NF, but the key difference is <em>direct</em> determination. 2NF still allows for <strong>in</strong>direct determination, otherwise known as transitively dependent determination.</p>
<p>An example 2NF table that is violating 3NF is as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>loan_date</th>
<th>loanee</th>
<th>loanee_dob</th>
<th>book_id</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>2021-03-03</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>1902-02-02</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>2021-03-03</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>1902-02-02</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>2021-02-02</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>1900-01-01</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The problem is that <code>loanee_dob</code> is determined by <code>loanee</code>, but <code>loanee</code> is <em>not</em> one of the special columns, which are <code>book_id</code> and <code>loan_date</code>. It <em>is</em> true that, if you give me the special columns of <code>book_id</code> and <code>loan_date</code> I <em>will</em> find the <code>loanee_dob</code> unique to that row, but the "truth" of <code>loanee_dob</code> is <em>dependent</em> on the <code>loanee</code>. This indicates that the <code>loanee_dob</code> is <em>indirectly (i.e., transitively) dependent</em> on the special columns <em>through</em> the <code>loanee</code> column. This is the kind of indirectness we are trying to avoid.</p>
<p>The solution is extracting the transitively dependent columns into their own table. For example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>name</th>
<th>dob</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>1902-02-02</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>1900-01-01</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>loan_date</th>
<th>loanee_id</th>
<th>book_id</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>2021-03-03</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>2021-03-03</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>2021-02-02</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>See Appendix C for a SQL script that transforms the 2NF table into 3NF tables as shown above. It is in a format that's easy to copy and paste and experiment with yourself, which I encourage you to do.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-about-boyce-codd-normal-form-bcnf-35nf">A note about Boyce-Codd Normal Form, BCNF, 3.5NF</h3>
<p>There are edge cases in the technical definition of 3NF that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyce%E2%80%93Codd_normal_form">BCNF</a> attempts to address. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form#Definition_of_third_normal_form">This</a> is the best articulation of the difference between 3NF and BCNF/3.5NF that I've read, which occurs near the end of the section.) To the best of my knowledge, the simple takeaway is essentially the same it was for 3NF, i.e., <strong>every basic column is <em>directly</em> determined by the special columns</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="fourth-normal-form-4nf">Fourth Normal Form, 4NF</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_normal_form">Fourth Normal Form</a>, in a sense, <em>cannot be put simply</em>. If I had to try, I'd say that 4NF, "simply put", means that, in addition to being in 3NF, <strong>if a group of cells across one or more columns can determine a group of cells in one or more <em>other</em> columns, then the original group of cells in the original column(s) must at least be in the special columns</strong>. Since that "simple" sentence barely makes sense, I'll just include the technical version, instead of hiding it in a footnote. The technical version is: Every non-trivial, <em>multivalued</em> functional dependency is derived from a superkey, minimal or otherwise.</p>
<p>I have not found a dataset that, in my opinion, is unequivocally both in 3NF and violating 4NF, so at the moment I do not have an example nor script to transform the relation. The wikipedia pages for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form">3NF</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyce%E2%80%93Codd_normal_form">BCNF</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_normal_form">4NF</a> are good starting points for learning more about 4NF. When I find a good example, I will include it here.</p>
<h2 id="fifth-normal-form-and-beyond">Fifth Normal Form and beyond</h2>
<p>Things get quite academic and arguably non-practical after 4NF, and maybe actually after 3NF, although it does seems that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_normal_form#4NF_in_practice">4NF violations do actually occur in practice</a>.</p>
<p>I will chose not to cover <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_normal_form">5NF</a> and other higher-order properties that can be found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Normal_forms">this table</a> (which I also linked to in the intro). It is an interesting field of research, so I encourage you to dig deeper and look into these properties yourself.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope you found this guide helpful. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out! Happy coding :D</p>

<p>This is probably not the best solution. It is a fully contained solution. You are encouraged to copy and paste and experiment with it. For example, if you saved this file as <code>example.sql</code>, you could run the following from the command line (assuming you are using PostgreSQL):</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> createdb <span>test</span></span>

The following brief post is once again offered largely for the sake of interest, being concerned with the furthest limits of the distribution of early Byzantine material in Eurasia and Africa. What follows consists of a distribution map of fifth- to seventh-century AD Byzantine finds and contemporary imitations accompanied by a brief discussion and illustration of some of the items that have been found in the far west, far east, far north and far south of the 'Old World'. Needless to say, the extensive distribution of early Byzantine material shown here is of interest for a number of reasons from the perspective of this blog, not least the light that it sheds on early medieval Britain's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2016/04/heptarchy-harun-ibn-yahya.html">Byzantine</a> and <a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2016/05/anglo-saxon-finds-france-africa.html">Indian Ocean</a>&nbsp;imports and connections discussed in previous posts.</p><table><tbody>

The numbers refer to sections in the text, below. Note, the finds in the Kama region of Russia seem to have arrived there in the eighth to twelfth centuries from Central Asia, hence the inclusion—following Mango (ed.),&nbsp;Byzantine Trade, 4th-12th Centuries (Farnham, 2009), fig. 1.1—of a notional grouping of finds in a regular block to the southeast of the Aral Sea and an arrow indicating the relationship between these and the Russian finds.

<p><b>The Far West (1)</b></p><p>

For both <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.v.LX.html#fna_v.LX-p24.1">St Jerome</a>, writing near Bethlehem in 396, and <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4ZUhAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22the+island+of+Britain+lies+virtually+at+the+end+of+the+world%22">Gildas</a>, writing around a century later in late fifth- or early sixth-century Britain, the British Isles lay 'virtually at the end of the world towards the west and north-west'. Despite this, there was clearly an intriguing degree of contact between the British Isles and the early Byzantine empire during the fifth to seventh centuries, as has been discussed at length in a <a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2016/04/heptarchy-harun-ibn-yahya.html">previous post</a>. In terms of the material evidence for this connection, this is manifested by significant finds of fifth- to sixth-century Eastern Mediterranean and North African <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bBwtGITEd1oC&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;pg=PA297#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">pottery</a> in western Britain and <a href="https://aran.library.nuigalway.ie/handle/10379/3263">Ireland</a> (with around half of the total coming from the probable royal site of <a href="http://www.medievalhistories.com/luxury-tintagel-early-medieval-period/">Tintagel</a>, Cornwall), alongside Byzantine <a href="https://www.academia.edu/11482638/_Early_Byzantine_copper_coins_found_in_Britain_A_review_of_new_finds_recorded_with_the_Portable_Antiquities_Scheme_Ancient_History_Numismatics_and_Epigraphy_in_the_Mediterranean_World_ed._Og%C5%ADz_Tekin_Yayinlari_Istanbul_2009_263-274">coins</a>, metalwork, and a number of burials of people whose <a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2015/10/oxygen-isotope-evidence.html">isotope results</a> indicate that they could well have grown up in Byzantine North Africa. It has <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kIMmDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">often</a> been <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-09_A._Harris,_Britain_and_China_at_opposite_ends_of_the_world.pdf">suggested</a> that the material in the west may have arrived via a different mechanism to that in the east, perhaps representing direct, official contact via the Straits of Gibraltar and the Atlantic coast vs indirect transfer via merchants and elite exchange along the rivers of mainland Europe, although finds of late sixth- to early seventh-century Byzantine coins from the Anglo-Saxon royal site of Rendlesham, Suffolk, have recently been <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/div-classtitlesocial-and-economic-complexity-in-early-medieval-england-a-central-place-complex-of-the-east-anglian-kingdom-at-rendlesham-suffolkdiv/FE9E1DB3180F1390E97D97BF28B637D5">interpreted</a> as evidence for 'direct mercantile contacts' with the Byzantine world in eastern Britain too.</p><table><tbody>

<p><b>The Far East (2, 3, 4)</b></p><p>

If there is a substantial amount of early Byzantine material found in Britain and Ireland, the apparent westernmost extremity of the known world in late antiquity, there is also a notable quantity at the far eastern end too. In <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.v.LX.html#fna_v.LX-p24.1">St Jerome</a>'s letter, cited above, the rhetorical opposite extremity of the world to Britain was given as India, but Roman and Byzantine authors were certainly aware of the existence of China and parts of Southeast Asia. China was, for example, mentioned by <a href="http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp261_Roman_Chinese.pdf">Roman</a> and <a href="http://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/transcultural/article/view/6127/2962">early Byzantine</a> writers from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Roman_relations#Roman_geography">first century BC onwards</a> and it is included not only in Ptolemy's second-century AD <i><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PtolemyWorldMap.jpg">Geography</a></i> (which mentions parts of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ptolemy_Asia_detail.jpg">Southeast Asia</a> too), but also on the <i><a href="http://www.euratlas.net/cartogra/peutinger/11_india/india_8_2.html">Tabula Peutingeriana</a></i>, a fascinating map that seems to have had its origins in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_Peutingeriana">Late Roman period</a>. Moreover, <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uZ_sAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Roman</a> and especially <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1945062/The_Roman_Empire_according_to_the_Ancient_Chinese_Sources">Chinese sources</a> make several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Roman_relations#Possible_Roman_Greeks_in_Burma_and_China">references</a> to Hellenistic, Roman and early Byzantine entertainers, merchants and/or embassies being present in China and Southeast Asia, including a <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1945062/The_Roman_Empire_according_to_the_Ancient_Chinese_Sources">mission in 166 AD</a> that arrived via the south coast—probably entering China via Vietnam and claiming to have been sent by the Roman emperor <i>Andun</i> (Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus?), although this was perhaps really a commercial action that chose to represent itself this way—and numerous seventh- and eighth-century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Roman_relations#Fulin:_Eastern_Roman_embassies">Byzantine</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://byzantineperspectives.wordpress.com/2015/10/17/what-does-tang-china-have-in-common-with-anglo-saxon-england/">embassies</a>&nbsp;to Tang China.</p><p>

In terms of the early Byzantine material found in eastern parts of Eurasia, there is a variety of surviving artefacts ranging from glass vessels, metalwork and textiles through to gold and bronze coinage, with the latter being by far the most numerous category. The most easterly early Byzantine artefacts are actually found in Korea and Japan ('2' on the map, above). The former has seen finds of <a href="https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/glass-vessels/cwFZdR3ccuXZ-w?hl=en">glass vessels</a> from the late fifth- to early sixth-century AD royal tombs at <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sila/hd_sila.htm">Silla, Korea</a>, some of which appear to have actually been <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mpanKmU_ckYC&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">made in</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://ijkh.khistory.org/upload/pdf/ijkh-19-1-1.pdf">the early Byzantine empire</a> and others of which are believed to be <a href="http://www.unescobkk.org/fileadmin/user_upload/culture/Silk_Roads/The_Eastern_Silk_Roads_Story_2015_Conference_Proceedings_UNESCO_re.pdf">imitative</a> of Late Roman/Early Byzantine forms, whilst in Japan there have been not only finds of early Byzantine 'Levantine 1' <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284359734_Archaeometrical_investigation_of_natron_glass_excavated_in_Japan">glass beads</a> (probably made on the coast of present-day northern Israel) from fifth-century AD tombs, but the important mid-eighth-century AD imperial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Ds%C5%8Di">Shōsōin Repository</a> at Nara, Japan, is also reported to contain a number of Byzantine items including a <a href="http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp206_sasanian_persia.pdf">cushion cover</a> made in early Byzantine Syria. Interestingly, neither Japan nor Korea is mentioned in Roman or Byzantine sources, although a recent isotopic and mitochondrial DNA <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236210479_Stable_isotope_and_mtDNA_evidence_for_geographic_origins_at_the_site_of_Vagnari_South_Italy">study of burials</a> on the Imperial estate at Vagnari, southern Italy, has indicated that one of the adults buried there in the first or second century AD could have had Japanese ancestry, given that 'all modern mtDNA matches to her available haplotype sequence are from Japan'.<sup><a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2017/03/a-very-long-way-from-home.html#fn2">(2)</a></sup></p><p>

In addition to this material from the very far east, we also have a notable quantity of primarily sixth- to early seventh-century Byzantine <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-09_A._Harris,_Britain_and_China_at_opposite_ends_of_the_world.pdf">gold coins</a> and sixth- to eighth-century imitations from <a href="http://www.silk-road.com/newsletter/vol3num2/4_ying.php">tombs in China</a>, along with a number of <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=C9A7DAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;pg=RA1-PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">finds</a> of early Byzantine metalwork and <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-06_M-L._Chen,_The_Importation_of_Byzantine_and_Sasanian_Glass_into_China_during_the_fourth_to_sixth_centuries.pdf">glassware</a> (and imitations of the same) from this country too. Both this material and that discussed in the preceding paragraph is <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-09_A._Harris,_Britain_and_China_at_opposite_ends_of_the_world.pdf">often thought</a> <a href="http://www.silk-road.com/newsletter/vol3num2/4_ying.php">to have arrived</a> via Central Asia along the '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road">Silk Road</a>', especially given the presence of a number of <a href="https://www.academia.edu/27959139/Sogdiana_its_Christians_and_Byzantium_a_Study_of_Artistic_and_Cultural_Connections_in_Late_Antiquity_and_Early_Middle_Ages">similar finds</a> in areas such as Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, although some of the Byzantine items found close to the Chinese coast and in Korea and Japan could have alternatively arrived by the less-discussed southern, maritime 'branch' of the Silk Road instead. Certainly, earlier <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1945062/The_Roman_Empire_according_to_the_Ancient_Chinese_Sources">Roman</a> and <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uZ_sAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Greek</a> <a href="https://www.academia.edu/12682533/The_Power_of_Images_Coin_Portraits_of_Roman_Emperors_on_Jewellery_Pendants_in_Early_Southeast_Asia">mariners</a>&nbsp;made use of this route, and early Byzantine <a href="http://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/transcultural/article/view/6127/2962">written sources</a> moreover appear to make reference to it, whilst finds of fifth- to seventh-century&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire">Sasanian</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/caitlinrgreen/status/832976763626078211">glassware</a>&nbsp;in Japan are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/28504387/Priestman_2016_The_Silk_Road_or_the_Sea_Sasanian_and_Islamic_Exports_to_Japan">argued</a> to have probably arrived there via the sea route. With regard to this maritime 'road', another relevant find may well be that of a probably sixth-century Byzantine <a href="http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/2001/JSS_096_0b_Borrell_EarlyByzantineLampFromPongTuk.pdf">lamp</a> found in Thailand (marked as '3' on the map, above), and it is worth noting in this context that an East Javanese <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LhaWBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT45&amp;pg=PT45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><i>millefiori</i></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thebeadsite.com/abm-rio3.html">bead</a> of sixth-century date has been found at the Byzantine Red Sea port of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berenice_Troglodytica">Berenike</a> too (curiously, such beads are <a href="http://www.aihv.org/en/pdf/16-77.pdf">very rare indeed</a> outside of East Java, with the only other concentration really being in the Silla tombs of Korea, mentioned above!).</p><p>

Finally, thousands of fifth- to seventh-century <a href="http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/5357/1/Darley14PhD_redacted.pdf">Byzantine</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/10027506/Self_Other_and_the_Use_and_Appropriation_of_Late_Roman_coins_in_south_India_and_Sri_Lanka_4th-7th_centuries_A.D._">gold</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271621898_Roman_Coins_from_the_Masson_and_Mackenzie_Collections_in_the_British_Museum">bronze</a> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292142132_The_Role_of_Monetary_Networks_in_the_Trade_between_India_and_the_Roman_Empire">coins</a> and imitations are known from India and Sri Lanka ('4' on the map), accompanied by fifth- to sixth-century <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk:8081/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-02_K._R._Dark,_Globalizing_Late_Antiquity.pdf">amphorae</a> on coastal and inland sites in western India. Such finds support the <a href="http://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/transcultural/article/view/6127/2962">textual evidence</a> for continued <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O_AtKQAACAAJ">Indo-Roman trade</a> and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo%E2%80%93Roman_trade_relations">interaction</a> via the Red Sea beyond the more frequently discussed Early Roman era into the Late Roman/Early Byzantine period, as do both the Indo-Pacific imports found at sites such as <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bBwtGITEd1oC&amp;lpg=PA345&amp;pg=PA345#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Byzantine Berenike</a> and the recent <a href="https://www.academia.edu/22932720/Strontium_isotope_evidence_for_long-distance_immigration_into_the_Byzantine_port_city_of_Aila_modern_Aqaba_Jordan">isotopic analysis</a> of burials of the fourth- to fifth-century AD at the Byzantine Red Sea port of <a href="http://maajournal.com/Issues/2012/Vol12-1/Full8.pdf">Aila</a> (Jordan), which indicates that people from areas beyond western Asia and North Africa were living there then, including some who had potentially grown up in the Indus Valley.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div id="pico"><p>The year is 1964. The United States and the Soviet Union have narrowly avoided full-scale nuclear destruction and resolved the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War looms on the horizon, and Mao Zedong’s China—fresh off a split with the Soviets—has just successfully blown up its first atomic bomb in a dry lakebed in southeastern Xinjiang, near what is now the <a href="https://www.wildcamels.com/what-we-do/lop-nur-nature-reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">world’s largest reserve for Bactrian camels</a>. </p><p>China’s nuclear test announced the country as the world’s fifth nuclear-armed nation, though unlike France, the USSR, and the United Kingdom, the Chinese nuclear program was a black box for American intelligence. <a href="http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb488/docs/Doc%2028%2011-2-64%20inr%20on%20chinese%20test.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recently declassified government files show</a>, for example, that the U.S. was shocked to learn that the bomb was fueled by uranium, not plutonium. Military-industrial honchos were left scratching their heads as to how to gather intelligence, until a chance meeting between General Curtis LeMay and mountaineer Barry Bishop at a Washington D.C. cocktail party led to one of the most quixotic, unsuccessful operations in the CIA’s long history of screwups.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="792" height="612" src="https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg 792w, https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg?resize=300,232 300w, https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg?resize=768,593 768w, https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg?resize=62,48 62w" sizes="(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px"><figcaption><a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb488/docs/doc%2033%201-0-65%20circa%20AFtAC%20report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An Air Force analysis</a> of nuclear debris scatter, which confirmed the use of enriched uranium. The lower of the two large arrows flows from the Xinjiang test site.</figcaption></figure><p>Bishop was part of the first American team to summit Mt. Everest the year prior, and according to <a href="https://rockandice.com/snowball/the-secret-of-nanda-devi/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pete Takeda’s fascinating 2007 <em>Rock And Ice</em> story</a>, he gushed about the unobstructed views he enjoyed from the world’s (<a href="https://defector.com/a-geologist-rocks-my-world-on-why-earths-tallest-mountain-isnt-so-obvious/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arguably</a>) tallest mountain. Takeda writes that LeMay put the pieces together and, “From this casual exchange emerged an unlikely inspiration: Recruit America’s best high-altitude climbers to place a nuclear powered observation device atop the world’s greatest mountain range.” The hope was that a transceiver could pick up radio communications between Chinese nuclear personnel, remaining functional for years off of the heat from decaying plutonium isotopes. Per Takeda, the CIA’s device was an “oven-sized metal bin with five radiating fins” that weighed 125 pounds and was topped by a six-foot long antenna. If this sounds like a crude product of ’60s nuclear frenzy, consider that <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/electrical-power/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NASA’s Perseverance rover</a> is scooting around on Mars thanks to this exact sort of battery. </p><p>Bishop could no longer climb high alpine peaks after <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/first-successful-us-everest-summit-took-a-toll-on-barry-bishops-boots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing all of his toes in the Everest expedition</a>, but by 1965, the CIA started putting together a team, picked a name (Operation Hat), and chose a mountain. Everest straddled China’s border, so it was out of contention. CIA officials eventually chose Nanda Devi, the tallest peak entirely within India’s borders. Nanda Devi offered two advantages to the Americans: long sightlines into Western China and the help of an Indian state that the U.S. had just supported in its 1962 border skirmish with China. </p><p>At this point in history, Nanda Devi had only been summited by six people, with three others dying in the process, so the CIA recruited a dream team of famous American climbers. The corps included pioneering El Capitan big-waller <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/obituaries/tom-frost-dead.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Frost</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/07/us/luther-jerstad-61-alpinist-who-scaled-everest-in-1963.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1963 Everest</a> veteran Lute Jerstad, <em>Sports Illustrated</em> cover darling <a href="https://gripped.com/profiles/jim-mccarthy-was-first-climber-on-sports-illustrated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jim McCarthy</a>, and the unsung alpinist <a href="https://www.americanjournalofsurgery.com/article/S0002-9610(16)31088-1/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Schaller</a>. They <a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978STATE094511_d.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwent a training course</a> on nuclear technology and “the Asian mentality” at a South Carolina military base, though the climbers say they mostly spent time “playing volleyball and doing some serious drinking.” <a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978STATE094511_d.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The full team undertook a training mission on Mount McKinley</a> in June with their Indian counterparts, and even though “distressing weather and other difficulties kept them from the summit,” the CIA “chose to ignore” the omens and the American-Indian team set out for Nanda Devi in October 1965. </p><p>The CIA has not yet declassified files from the expedition, including apparently extensive photographs and journal records made by Schaller, so we do not have a detailed account of what happened on the mountain. But we do know how the mission ended: catastrophic failure. A storm pinned several climbers and the device down while they were roughly 1,800 feet from the summit. Indian intelligence lead Capt. M.S. Kohli was forced to call a retreat, and the team stashed the device in a crevice and attempted to anchor it in place, so it would stay put until they could come and retrieve it on the other side of winter.</p><p>McCarthy spoke at length with Takeda <a href="https://rockandice.com/snowball/the-secret-of-nanda-devi/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for the <em>Rock And Ice</em> story</a>—which really is great, Takeda makes his own attempt on Nanda Devi and narrowly escapes death by avalanche—and he recalled his fury at the expedition’s failure:</p><blockquote><p>When I realize that they’re dumping the fucking generator and going down the mountain, I’m like, ‘What the fuck are you doing? Have them bring it down! Are you crazy?’ I’m yelling at the top of my lungs.” According to McCarthy, the CIA case officer nearly had to pull him off Kohli. “He says to me,” McCarthy says, ‘You are creating an international incident!’”</p><p>“But,” McCarthy adds, “I had a vision of absolute clarity. We’re going to lose a SNAP generator, powered by plutonium, in the headwaters of the Ganges!”</p><cite><a href="https://rockandice.com/snowball/the-secret-of-nanda-devi/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rock And Ice</a></cite></blockquote><p>That might be what wound up happening. Nobody knows where the device ended up, since it disappeared from Nanda Devi at some point in the winter. The CIA ran a total of eight field operations in the region between 1965 and 1968, aimed at both finding the first device and getting another one up and running. Though they eventually implanted a plutonium device on nearby Nanda Kot, they have never been able to find their lost transceiver. The successfully placed device was also quickly buried under the snow and stopped working months later, after producing no useful intelligence.</p><p>The grim failure of Operation Hat resurfaced this month after violent floods killed over 50 people in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The floods <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/07/world/asia/india-glacier-flood-uttarakhand.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most likely began</a> when a chunk of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off and trapped flowing water, forming a lake that eventually burst through and swept through nearby valleys. The undeniable oddness of a glacial breaking apart during the winter has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56102459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led some locals to speculate</a> that perhaps the plutonium generator, which is still likely producing heat, led to the deadly floods.</p><p>There’s no evidence for the hypothesis, though even after years of reconnaissance missions and rigorous chemical assays of the surrounding area, nobody knows where the CIA’s lost nuclear-powered spy oven is. </p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The U.S. government has asked Google to fork over granular data on how its search engine works and is monetized, seeking to prove that the internet giant is a monopoly.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Justice and several state attorneys general are seeking comparable data on U.S. search results and related ad from Feb. 2, 2015 to Feb. 8, 2015 and from Feb. 3, 2020 to Feb. 9, 2020, according to a legal filing Monday.</p>

<p>The Alphabet Inc. unit is being asked to share data on how and where users searched in those periods, the quantity of different types of ads, revenue from those ads and what the underlying bids were for them, among other details. The government told the company it wants the information within 30 days.</p>

<p>The Justice Department under former U.S. President Donald Trump and 11 Republican attorneys general originally filed the suit. Three other states have since joined, including California, the site of Googleâ€™s headquarters. The latest data request shows the government is pressing ahead under a new administration led by Democrat Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The U.S. government alleges Googleâ€™s exclusive deals to distribute its search engine on browsers and phones, including Apple Inc.â€™s iPhones, violates the Sherman Actâ€™s prohibition on monopolization. Itâ€™s the most significant U.S. monopoly case since the one against Microsoft Corp. more than 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Google has said its deals donâ€™t prevent consumers from switching to other search providers. The company argues its success rests on superior technology.</p>
