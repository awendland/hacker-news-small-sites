<blockquote>
  <p>SEC Investor Education:</p>

  <p>New Year’s Financial Resolution: Avoid too-good-to-be-true “investments” with Ponzi scheme “red flag” claims like:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>“To the moon! To the mars!”</li>
    <li>“Number go up!”</li>
    <li>“Yearly return of 300+% in 2020!”</li>
    <li>“Could quadruple in 2021 and rally to $100,000!”</li>

</blockquote>

<p>A collection of “unpopular opinion” and get-rich-quick party spoiler “stop the music” articles on “Is Bitcoin a Ponzi? Is Bitcoin a Speculative Bubble? Is Bitcoin a Digital 21st Century Tulip Mania? Is Bitcoin Comedy Gold?”</p>

<p>From the Wikipedia:</p>

<p>Bitcoin has been described as an economic bubble by at least eight Nobel Prize Economists at various times, including Robert Shiller on 1 March 2014, Joseph Stiglitz on 29 November 2017, and Richard Thaler on 21 December 2017. On 29 January 2018, a noted Keynesian economist Paul Krugman has described bitcoin as “a bubble wrapped in techno-mysticism inside a cocoon of libertarian ideology”, on 2 February 2018, professor Nouriel Roubini of New York University has called bitcoin the “mother of all bubbles”, and on 27 April 2018, a University of Chicago economist James Heckman has compared it to the 17th-century tulip mania.</p>

<p>On 4 December 2013, Alan Greenspan referred to it as a “bubble” as did George Soros on 25 January 2018. Warren Buffett called bitcoin a “mirage” on 13 March 2014.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>Some “unpopular” bitcoin facts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bitcoin Proof-of-Waste Mining Is an Environmental Disaster</li>
  <li>Bitcon Is a Greater Fool BagHODLer Zero-Sum Fraudsters’ Greed Fest</li>
  <li>The Bigger the Lies the Better - To the Moon! Number Go Up! Will Quadruple to $100 000 in 2021!</li>
  <li>Bitcoin Is Comedy Gold - Bitcoin Is the New Standard?! - LOL</li>
  <li>When Will the Music Stop? (Hint: Try to Cash Out)</li>
</ul>

<p>So what!?  Do your own research! Here we go:</p>

                <p>In <a href="https://theirtimeline.com/1-million-sales-in-1-year-a-chronological-study-of-jack-butchers-visualize-value-part-1-the-unsung-era/">part 1</a>, we documented how Visualize Value was created as an attempt to productize the whole system of allowing businesses to better market themselves to customers. It was not a smooth sailing journey- there was no clear product until 11 months in.</p><p>In part 2, we will focus on the growth of VV's first digital product- Daily Manifest. </p><p>We will learn how Jack:</p><ol><li>more than tripled the price of his product... and continued having incredible sales,</li><li>created a community that was attuned to his creative process and eager to learn from him, and</li><li>introduced synergy among his offerings so that each offering helped to drive the sales of others.</li></ol><p>Let's dive in.</p><h2 id="recap">Recap</h2><p>Here are some stats from Visualize Value around the point of Daily Manifest launch (December 16 2019):</p><p>🗓 November 24 2019: Around 270 likes for a Tweet. While this is a major improvement over the initial tweets, there is nothing to suggest that Visualize Value will grow exponentially to its current scale of having a few thousand likes on each tweet.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Value.” <a href="https://t.co/dTYp5oqeU4">pic.twitter.com/dTYp5oqeU4</a></p>— Visualize Value (@visualizevalue) <a href="https://twitter.com/visualizevalue/status/1198295935580884992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>It is also hard to trace the exact factors that allowed Visualize Value to gain more exposure. A possible answer, aside from the natural compounding of his content, is that Jack has been going onto other platforms to talk about Visualize Value. An example is <a href="https://www.mavenadviser.com/podcast5/jack-butcher">the interview that he did with Maven Adviser</a>, released on November 28 2019.</p><p>At this point in time, Jack probably felt comfortable enough with the quantity and quality of Visualize Value's graphics that he decided it's time to gain more exposure via guesting on other platforms.</p><p>The key lesson here (discussed in <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/173-dru-riley-of-trends-vc">Courtland Allen's interview with Dru Riley</a>):</p><ul><li>Instead of rushing for the launch (or putting our product in front of as many people as possible), it is wiser to instead put it in front of a small audience and iterate until we find a product that works. If we refer to the first tweet above, we can already see the distinctive Visualize Value design in it. Contrast this with the account's initial tweets, which had different design elements.</li></ul><h2 id="rise">Rise</h2><p>🗓 February 17 2020: 15,000 VV followers on Twitter. It took about 13 months for Jack to accumulate this audience size. Again, one of the key principles of Jack's success is leveraging on existing audiences of other individuals and adding value to those individuals. How can you do something similar for your product?</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550">— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1229149748424331266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>💰🗓 February 25 2020: 1,000th order for Visualize Value's Daily Manifest. This is inline with the rough approximation that less than 10% of your audience will be active product buyers. For VV's case, it was around 3%.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just hit our 1,000th order. Thank you.</p>— Visualize Value (@visualizevalue) <a href="https://twitter.com/visualizevalue/status/1232137721998692353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>🗓 March 6 2020: Build a community. Now that Jack has created a sufficient audience size on Twitter, the next step is to create an environment for your audience to interact more closely with each other and you. This community can also provide closer feedback on what they hope to get from you, and you can create products that satisfies their need.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550">— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1235688840830033924?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>💰🗓 March 10 2020: $15.5k in revenue that took 14 months to grow. The first 11 months were spent iterating. Jack's ability to create bite-sized visuals (3 to 4 posts a day) allowed him to go through a huge number of iterations, thus speeding up the networking and audience building process.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It has taken me about 14 months to grow <a href="https://twitter.com/visualizevalue?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@visualizevalue</a> from $0 a month to $6k~ a month.</p><p>All while running an agency that is significantly more profitable, but significantly less specific, and all service based.</p><p>The product game is harder, but more satisfying. <a href="https://t.co/zepfk4Ix31">pic.twitter.com/zepfk4Ix31</a></p></div>— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1237219734233505792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 10, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>🗓 March 13 2020: Expanding on the community aspect, Jack launches his first office hours. You want to iterate a new product/service among a smaller (and ideally your close) audience, before launching it to the general public. Office hours also help to create a stronger bond among his community as it is a real-time event.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550">— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1238306163843903488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 13, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>💰🗓 March 30 2020: $5k sales in 24 hours. The trick? A substantial price increase + limited time is always an amazing combination to drive sales. This is a strategy often used- selling at a cheaper price initially to validate market + collect testimonials, then raising the price.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550">— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1244308058869772288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><figure><blockquote data-width="550">— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1244373984474472451?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Transparency time:</p><p>Results from a pre-price raise promotion:</p><p>$5k in 24 hours from a $19 product. </p><p>Thanks to all new members.</p><p>Now $57. Until it isn’t.</p><p>I’ll be breaking this all down in more detail in the VV community. </p><p>Hop in here: <a href="https://t.co/Zepgmxfnke">https://t.co/Zepgmxfnke</a> <a href="https://t.co/O1xay3CkOl">pic.twitter.com/O1xay3CkOl</a></p></div>— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1244475521292959747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>💰🗓 April 16 2020: The Daily Manifest made over $10k in sales. This ridiculous amount of sales of a one-page pdf is not driven by the sole prospect of daily planning; rather, the audience is also enticed by the prospect of joining a community that can teach them how to communicate better and earn more.</p><p>Jack's genius is in integrating different products and services so that there is synergy among them. What is a simple product of yours that you can add value to by integrating it with other services?</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550">— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1250618935415910400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 16, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>This concludes today's time capsule on Visualize Value's Daily Manifest. In future installments, we will further examine how Jack created his other products such as <em>Build Once, Sell Twice</em> and the <em>Permissionless Apprentice.</em></p><p>Subscribe to receive future issues that examine the exact path and timeline of successful entrepreneurs, and learn how you can apply those lessons to your own journey.</p><p>Give Their Timeline <a href="https://twitter.com/their_timeline">a shout out on Twitter</a> if there is any entrepreneur whom you'll like to be featured too.</p><p>Keep building! 🔨</p>

<p>Do surgeries work? Most of us assume they do, but is there any scientific evidence that they do?</p>

<p>In this episode, I talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/drianharris">Dr Ian Harris</a> who is a Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of New South Wales in Australia. He is a practicing orthopedic surgeon specializing in trauma surgery. Outside his practice, his research interests broadly cover the topic of surgical effectiveness and clinical research.</p>

<h3>Dive into Dr Ian Harris’ research</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28592661-surgery-the-ultimate-placebo">Book</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzueFu1cq5U">Lecture</a></li>
<li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HSd2K4IAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Papers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g3253">Relevant paper</a> backing the claim that most surgeries are ineffective</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes and key insights</h3>

<p>1/ <strong>What is a placebo surgery?</strong> It’s where you make an incision but not do anything. </p>

<p>It’s analogous to traditional placebo in medicine, where a sugar or salt pill is given instead of an active chemical to see whether the intended medicine has an actual impact.</p>

<p>2/ <strong>Majority of surgeries that Dr Ian Harris and other researchers have studied in fact are not more effective than placebos</strong>. This is shocking because even when we have no proof that they work, many of these surgeries are happening even today.</p>

<p>3/ <strong>Examples of such ineffective surgeries include back pain surgeries and knee pain surgeries.</strong> For such surgeries, randomized control trials have found that if you make an incision in the knee but don’t do anything, it’s as effective as actually conducting the surgery of the knee.</p>

<p>4/ Why do patients get better if the surgery doesn’t work? It’s because<strong> many diseases or pain have a natural progression</strong>, and we generally seek surgical/medicinal intervention when we’re in the worst condition. If the body heals / condition becomes better after that, we attribute improvement to the intervention rather than thinking it could have happened anyway (due to the natural course of the condition).</p>

<p>5/ As Dr Ian Harris said, the unsaid attitude could be stated like: “<strong>you have to operate on patients quickly before they get better</strong>“.</p>

<p>Remember: in many cases, if you get sick, you get better after that. And that is why placebos seem to work.</p>

<p>6/ It’s shocking to hear that randomized controlled trials (RCT) for many surgical interventions end up finding that they’re ineffective.</p>

<p>But what’s most shocking is that <strong>many other interventions have never been subjected to an RCT against a placebo</strong>. For many of the common procedures traditionally practiced, we don’t know whether they work at all or not.</p>

<p>7/ For sure, there are many studies that study variations of surgical methods. That is, they try to find out whether an incision from the left is better or from the right. </p>

<p>But very few studies try to find out whether the incision does anything at all for the patient. Shocking, but that’s the truth.</p>

<p>8/ In that sense, <strong>surgery is different than medicine</strong>. All new pharmaceutical molecules are subjected to rigorous clinical trials where they’re tested against placebo or doing nothing. In many countries, there’s no such procedure for surgical treatments. If there is a procedure for new surgical procedures, nobody is testing old ones that have been getting performed every day without evidence.</p>

<p>8/ If research indicates many of the currently practiced surgeries don’t work, why are they still practiced?</p>

<p>Well, <strong>if your salary depends on not believing something, you won’t believe it.</strong></p>

<p>9/ And such <strong>denial is not new</strong>. The most common surgical procedure in history was bloodletting. This practice which lasted for thousands of years was only questioned in mid 19th century, and even after randomized trials showed that it hurt the patient, it wasn’t abandoned suddenly. It died a slow death as its practitioners started dying. </p>

<p>10/ Even today, the fact that practices like Homeopathy survive suggests that <strong>seeking evidence of what works isn’t a big priority for society</strong>. Perhaps keeping traditions is a bigger priority.</p>

<p>11/ But because it’s costly and risky to perform surgeries, the urgent question is: <strong>what surgical procedures are today’s equivalent of bloodletting</strong>? And those that we know are bloodletting, how do we get rid of them as a society?</p>

<p>12/ As a patient, what should you do? Dr Ian Harris recommends that every time your doctor recommends a medical procedure, <strong>ALWAYS ask for risks and benefits</strong>. </p>

<p>Risks are a given and doctors generally are happy to talk about them. But nobody asks for benefits because they’re assumed to be there. </p>

<p>Ask and confirm about benefits explicitly.</p>

<p>13/ What if the pain isn’t going away at all? Should you then get surgery?</p>

<p>Golden advice by Dr Ian -&gt;  “<strong>the severity of your symptoms does not change the effectiveness of the operation</strong>“</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last weekend, I played in the Women Unite Over CTF, hosted by <a href="https://www.womenhackerz.com/">WomenHackerz</a> and several other organizations.&nbsp; There was a fantastic turnout, with 1,000 women playing!&nbsp; For many of the participants, it was their first time playing a CTF.</p><p>After the event was over, there was some discussion on what to do if you wanted to play more CTFs, if you got stumped a lot, etc.&nbsp; This is intended to be <strong>a guide for beginners who have just started playing CTFs</strong> (or for people who have never played, but would like to).</p><p>It certainly isn’t the only CTF resource out there, but I find that a lot of the resources are either big information dumps (hard to pick through as a beginner) or links without context or guidance on how to improve.&nbsp; This post seeks to change that.&nbsp; : )</p><h2 id="what-is-a-ctf">What is a CTF?</h2><p>CTF stands for “<strong>capture the flag</strong>.”&nbsp; It’s a hacking competition where the challenges (or a hacking environment, or both) are set up for you to hack.&nbsp; Once you successfully solve a challenge or hack something, you get a “flag”, which is a specially formatted piece of text.&nbsp; You can then submit that flag for points… the player or team with the most points wins!</p><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPcqmx1mpCOJJp6/giphy.gif" alt=""></p><p>Each challenge is usually oriented around a single concept.&nbsp; By solving challenges, you (hopefully!) learn about a new concept, vulnerability, tool, class of attack, etc.</p><h3 id="ctf-styles">CTF Styles</h3><p>Most CTFs are “<strong>jeopardy style</strong>", meaning that there are a handful of categories, and each of the (typically standalone) challenges falls in to one of those categories.</p><p>The categories vary from CTF to CTF, but typically include:</p><ul><li><strong>RE (reverse engineering)</strong>:&nbsp; get a binary and reverse engineer it to find a flag</li><li><strong>Pwn</strong>:&nbsp; get a binary and a link to a program running on a remote server.&nbsp; Cause a buffer overflow, etc. to bypass normal functionality and get the program to read the flag to you.</li><li><strong>Crypto</strong>:&nbsp; crypto means cryptography!&nbsp; Get an encrypted flag and figure out how to decrypt it (includes both classical and modern ciphers)</li><li><strong>Web</strong>:&nbsp; web-based challenges where you are directed to a website, and you have to find and exploit a vulnerability (SQL injection, XSS, etc.) to get a flag.</li><li><strong>Forensics/Stego</strong>:&nbsp; given a PCAP file, image, audio or other file, find a hidden message and get the flag.</li><li><strong>Other</strong>:&nbsp; this is a bit of a grab bag.&nbsp; Includes random puzzles, electronics-based things, OSINT, anything that doesn’t fit into the other categories.</li></ul><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/1vZaAcldbX8Xh6lMlV/giphy.gif" alt=""></p><p>Jeopardy isn’t the only style.&nbsp; There are a few <strong>attack/defense CTFs</strong>, where you are given control of a server that you must protect from other players, while also attacking other servers.&nbsp; These are fairly rare (and pretty difficult to set up, I imagine).</p><p>There are also CTFs that emulate <strong>pen testing</strong>, where you are given a target VM (“box”) to hack into, and escalate your privileges until you are a root user.&nbsp; These are also fairly rare but a lot of fun.&nbsp; Check out <strong>Metasploitable</strong> in late November (<a href="https://blog.rapid7.com/2018/11/05/announcing-the-2018-metasploit-community-ctf/">here is the announcement from 2018</a>), or <strong><a href="https://hackthebox.eu/">Hack The Box</a></strong> year-round.</p><h2 id="logistics-and-how-to-find-ctfs">Logistics and How to Find CTFs</h2><h3 id="wait-before-you-go-any-further">Wait!&nbsp; Before you go any further</h3><p>It’s definitely more fun to play with friends, or even internet strangers.&nbsp; Playing with other people means that you can get each other unstuck, and you can also support each other when you make progress, get a new tool working, or find a flag… or when you don’t.&nbsp; Especially when you’re new, CTFs can feel like repeatedly banging your head against the wall (there’s so much to learn in this field!).&nbsp; Having others to play alongside can definitely help lift that emotional burden when things aren’t going well, and give you people to celebrate with when you make a breakthrough.</p><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/haBeggedmenEA/giphy.gif" alt=""></p><p>You might think, “who am I going to convince to play CTFs” with me?&nbsp; &nbsp;There are many online groups that are open to beginners.&nbsp; A short list includes:</p><ul><li><a href="https://opentoallctf.github.io/">OpenToAll</a></li><li><a href="https://www.womenhackerz.com/">Women Hackers</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/IanColdwater/status/1068173165610831872">CTF Circle</a></li></ul><p>You can try Slack/Discord for local security meet-up groups to see if there’s any interest in teaming up.&nbsp; Same goes for university groups, if you’re a student.&nbsp; Finally, you can also check Slack or Discord for a given CTF, as often there are other people looking for teammates.</p><p>Even if your first response to this idea is “oh hell no”, give it try, at least once.&nbsp; : )</p><h3 id="where-to-find-ctfs">Where to find CTFs</h3><p>There are <strong>in-person CTFs</strong> (especially if you live on the east or west coast in the US) throughout the year, plus many at <strong>conferences</strong>.</p><p>But there are also plenty of <strong>online CTFs</strong>, which is what I mostly play.&nbsp; They typically happen on weekends, and run for 1-3 days, although some go for a week or more.&nbsp;&nbsp;To find them, check out <a href="https://ctftime.org/"><strong>CTFTime</strong></a> and click on “Upcoming”.&nbsp; This is continually updated (and sometimes at the last minute).&nbsp; Also keep an eye out on Twitter.</p><p>A few CTFs and CTF platforms are <strong>available online, year round</strong>.&nbsp; See the bottom of this post (“Bonus Round!") for more.</p><h2 id="and-now-for-the-resource-list">And now for the resource list!</h2><p>There’s really no substitute for actually doing CTF challenges, even if you only make a little bit of progress.&nbsp; This resource list has a few goals:</p><ul><li>Equip you with enough tools and knowledge to get started on a CTF challenge in a given category</li><li>Point you towards additional resources if you want to build up your skills outside of time-limited CTF events, and alert you to any category-specific sites or platforms</li><li>Give you a basic list of things to try if you have no idea where to start with a challenge</li></ul><p>There’s a LOT to learn.&nbsp; If you’re new, I recommend that you <strong>find a few beginner CTFs that are “jeopardy” style, and try a few challenges from each category and see what you enjoy doing</strong>.&nbsp; If you like doing one category, that’s great!&nbsp; It’s also great if you like to do a bit of everything.&nbsp; My top recommendation for a “jeopardy”-style beginner CTF is <strong><a href="https://picoctf.com/">PicoCTF</a></strong>, but there are more options in the “Bonus Round!” section at the bottom of this post.</p><p>This guide is by no means comprehensive.&nbsp; I know there are a ton of sites and resources out there.&nbsp; I wanted to share my top picks for each category, with options for different learning styles.</p><h2 id="re">RE</h2><p>Reverse engineering (RE), involves taking a binary and, well, reverse engineering it to determine its functionality (and find a flag).</p><p>In industry, RE skills are used for vulnerability research.&nbsp; You might be given a software program and asked to find vulnerabilities (without having source code).&nbsp; Similarly, malware research involves a lot of reverse engineering.&nbsp; In my view, it’s a bit more niche than its inclusion in CTFs would lead you to believe, but still a challenging/fun category.</p><p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/4UzW8S83pWoKs/giphy.gif" alt=""></p><h3 id="resources-to-get-started">Resources to get started</h3><p>It can be pretty daunting to get started in reverse engineering, especially if you have little or no experience in low-level programming languages like assembly.&nbsp; As you get started, try to find something in the code to orient yourself… a call to a standard library function (read, scanf, printf, etc.), comments, strings, etc.&nbsp; Then keep expanding and iterating from there.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Learning by doing</strong>:&nbsp; My top recommendation is <strong><a href="http://microcorruption.com/">Microcorruption</a></strong>.&nbsp; It’s a game where you try to reverse engineer (fictitious) bluetooth locks of increasing difficulty.&nbsp; It’s all in-browser (which means no tool setup), and has a tutorial level that introduces you some of the assembly and environment.&nbsp; I have <a href="https://jaimelightfoot.com/blog/category/microcorruption/">write-ups for each level</a> if you get stuck.</p></li><li><p><strong>Learning by reading</strong>:&nbsp; I’m going to double dip between this section and Pwn.&nbsp; I’d suggest <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Art-Exploitation-Jon-Erickson/dp/1593271441">Hacking: The Art of Exploitation</a></strong> and then <strong><a href="https://practicalbinaryanalysis.com/">Practical Binary Analysis</a></strong>.&nbsp; Hacking: The Art of Exploitation takes you from a very basic level through C, assembly, program memory, exploits, and much more.&nbsp; It’s incredibly thorough and definitely worth a read</p></li><li><p><strong>Learning by watching</strong>:&nbsp; Live Overflow has a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyAyN3GFM7A&amp;list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN"><strong>series on binary exploitation</strong></a>.&nbsp; Check out the playlist of videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyAyN3GFM7A&amp;list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN">here</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 id="re-focused-ctfs">RE-focused CTFs:</h3><p>I’m going to suggest <strong><a href="http://microcorruption.com/">Microcorruption</a></strong> one more time.&nbsp; : )&nbsp; There’s also FireEye’s yearly <strong><a href="http://flare-on.com/">Flare-On</a></strong> challenge, which will probably kick your ass (it always kicks mine) but it’s worth a try.</p><p>You can also find plenty of RE challenges in jeopardy-style events, both year-round and regular/short-term CTFs.</p><h3 id="tools-and-other-resources">Tools and other resources</h3><p>You will definitely need special tools to do RE challenges.&nbsp; There are lots of tools to choose from, as well as different categories of tools (disassembler, decompiler, debugger, etc.).&nbsp; In addition to having varying functionality, different tools are needed for different file types.</p><p>If you are a total beginner, I’ll once again recommend <strong><a href="http://microcorruption.com/">Microcorruption</a></strong>.&nbsp; A lot of the tools listed below can be difficult to set up, and in the interest of removing barriers to entry, I’m suggesting Microcorruption as an introduction to RE, because you don’t have to install anything to get started.</p><p>Eventually though, you’ll want to install and get familiar with different tools:</p><ul><li>My favorite is <strong><a href="https://binary.ninja/">Binary Ninja</a></strong> and have done some previous write-ups using it.&nbsp; I like the UI/UX and the available features.&nbsp; The only downside is that you need a license (I got mine originally through a BSides RE workshop, otherwise it’s $149).</li><li>There are plenty of free options as well.&nbsp; My second choice is <strong><a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a></strong>, which is free and fairly beginner friendly.&nbsp; There’s also <strong><a href="https://www.radare.org/r/">Radare</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.ollydbg.de/">Ollydb</a></strong>, <strong>gdb</strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/index.shtml">IDAPro</a></strong>, <strong>Objdump</strong> and many more.</li></ul><p>Similar to “try a bunch of categories and see what you prefer”, I recommend trying a bunch of tools and see what you prefer.&nbsp; I realize that installing a bunch of tools can be a gigantic pain in the ass, so here are a couple VM options that get you a bunch of pre-installed tools:</p><ul><li><strong>FireEye</strong> provides a VM image as part of their Flare-On competition (<a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/07/flare-vm-the-windows-malware.html">see this link for more info</a>) that includes many pre-installed RE tools.</li><li>You can also install a <strong><a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">Kali</a> VM</strong>, which comes pre-installed with various tools as well.</li></ul><p>As for more resources, <strong>OpenToAll</strong> has a <a href="https://github.com/OpenToAllCTF/REsources">fantastic list of RE Resources here</a>.&nbsp; This includes some foundational knowledge like C, x86 assembly, and more.</p><p>There’s also this free <strong><a href="https://www.begin.re/">beginner RE workshop</a></strong> that uses IDA.</p><p><strong>If you have no idea where to start with an RE challenge</strong>:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><ul><li>does <code>strings &lt;filename&gt;</code> reveal find any interesting strings in the program?&nbsp;
Open the file in a debugger/disassembler/decompiler tool (as listed above) and try to get a sense of what the program does.&nbsp; Are there any ASCII-range characters?&nbsp;</li><li>What user …</li></ul></div></div>

</ul>
<p>Recently I discovered a nice way to capture call stack in Haskell exceptions almost transparently, and I’m going to share it in this post</p>
<p>If this is a known technique, let me know, otherwise — enjoy using it.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-call-stack">What is a call stack</h2>
<p>Suppose somewhere in the program you use <code>error</code> to signal an impossible situation:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>foo ::</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb1-2">foo [] <span>=</span> <span>error</span> <span>"impossible!"</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3">foo a<span>:</span>_ <span>=</span> a</span>
<span id="cb1-4"></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span>bar ::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">bar a b <span>=</span> foo a <span>+</span> foo b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then accidentally use it with an empty list:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> bar [] []</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>***</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span> impossible<span>!</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><span>CallStack</span> (from <span>HasCallStack</span>)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">  <span>error</span>, called at stacks<span>.</span>hs<span>:</span><span>4</span><span>:</span><span>10</span> <span>in</span> main<span>:</span><span>Main</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Obviously, there is an error, but <code>GHCI</code> also prints a peculiar thing: a call stack! It contains only one entry and isn’t helpful, though… So you go to <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/">GHC manual</a> to see what <code>HasCallStack</code> the message is talking about, and there it is: <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#hascallstack"><code>HasCallStack</code> section</a>.</p>
<p>As the manual says, you add <code>HasCallStack</code> constraint to your <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> functions:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>foo ::</span> <span>HasCallStack</span> <span>=&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb3-2">foo [] <span>=</span> <span>error</span> <span>"impossible!"</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3">foo a<span>:</span>_ <span>=</span> a</span>
<span id="cb3-4"></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><span>bar ::</span> <span>HasCallStack</span> <span>=&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6">bar a b <span>=</span> foo a <span>+</span> foo b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now the output becomes much more informative:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> bar [] []</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><span>***</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span> impossible<span>!</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><span>CallStack</span> (from <span>HasCallStack</span>)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4">  <span>error</span>, called at stacks<span>.</span>hs<span>:</span><span>6</span><span>:</span><span>10</span> <span>in</span> main<span>:</span><span>Main</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5">  foo, called at stacks<span>.</span>hs<span>:</span><span>10</span><span>:</span><span>11</span> <span>in</span> main<span>:</span><span>Main</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6">  bar, called at <span>&lt;</span>interactive<span>&gt;:</span><span>5</span><span>:</span><span>1</span> <span>in</span> interactive<span>:</span><span>Ghci1</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You get function names, module names and even source locations for all calls starting from the <code>ghci</code> prompt down to the point where <code>error</code> is called.</p>
<p>Remember, however, that stack is captured only as far from the <code>error</code> call as there are <code>HasCallStack</code> constraint. E.g., dropping the constraint from <code>foo</code> will also exclude <code>bar</code> from the log:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> bar [] []</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>***</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span> impossible<span>!</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><span>CallStack</span> (from <span>HasCallStack</span>)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4">  <span>error</span>, called at stacks<span>.</span>hs<span>:</span><span>6</span><span>:</span><span>10</span> <span>in</span> main<span>:</span><span>Main</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Still, you get to know the precise location of the <code>error</code> call, which is nice.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat</strong>: <code>head</code>, <code>tail</code>, <code>read</code> and so on use <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/GHC-Err.html#v:errorWithoutStackTrace"><code>errorWithoutStackTrace</code></a> (for performance reasons), so you won’t ever see stack traces from them. One more reason to avoid <code>head</code>!</p>
<h2 id="using-exceptions">Using exceptions</h2>
<p>However, using <code>error</code> to report errors is not very convenient: you can pass only a <code>String</code> as an argument and so catching specific errors while propagating others becomes very hard and messy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is another mechanism in GHC for that: exceptions. So you define your custom exception type and throw it from the <code>foo</code> function like this:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>data</span> <span>FooException</span> <span>=</span> <span>FooException</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2">  <span>deriving</span> (<span>Show</span>, <span>Exception</span>)</span>
<span id="cb6-3"></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><span>foo ::</span> <span>HasCallStack</span> <span>=&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb6-5">foo [] <span>=</span> throw <span>FooException</span></span>
<span id="cb6-6">foo a<span>:</span>_ <span>=</span> a</span>
<span id="cb6-7"></span>
<span id="cb6-8"><span>bar ::</span> <span>HasCallStack</span> <span>=&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-9">bar a b <span>=</span> foo a <span>+</span> foo b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You run it and expect to see the nice exception with a stack trace. But…</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> bar [] []</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><span>***</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span> <span>FooException</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You get none! What is going on, and how <code>error</code> is different from <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Control-Exception.html#v:throw"><code>throw</code></a>?</p>
<p>The reason is that exceptions don’t capture the stack trace automatically, even when thrown from a place with <code>HasCallStack</code> context. There is an <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/12096">open issue</a> to do so, reported back in 2016, but no progress was made yet.</p>
<h2 id="capturing-stacks">Capturing stacks</h2>
<p>But what if we want to capture stack with exceptions? One possible way would be to save the stack (represented as <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/GHC-Stack.html#t:CallStack"><code>CallStack</code></a> type) as part of the exception constructor, then make your custom <code>throwWithStack :: HasCallStack =&gt; Foo -&gt; IO ()</code> function and use it everywhere, but that is too cumbersome, and you may just forget to use the right throwing function.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a better way. Recall that magic <code>HasCallStack</code> constraint captures call stack from the point where something annotated with it is used. We don’t want to annotate <code>throw</code>, but there is one more thing on the same line — exception constructor itself! It turns out, you can use GADTs to capture stack with an exception data:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>data</span> <span>FooException</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2">  <span>FooException</span><span> ::</span> <span>HasCallStack</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>FooException</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then access it in <code>Show</code> instance:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>instance</span> <span>Show</span> <span>FooException</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2">  <span>show</span> <span>FooException</span> <span>=</span> <span>"FooException\n"</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span> prettyCallStack callStack</span>
<span id="cb9-3"></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><span>deriving</span> anyclass <span>instance</span> <span>Exception</span> <span>FooException</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><span>-- alternatively, derive Show from stock and print call stack in 'displayException' method.</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here <code>callStack</code> is provided by <code>GHC.Stack</code> and will use <code>HasCallStack</code> constraint introduced by pattern match on <code>FooException</code> GADT constructor.</p>
<p>Let’s see an example of how it works:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> bar [] []</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><span>***</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span> <span>FooException</span></span>
<span id="cb10-3"><span>CallStack</span> (from <span>HasCallStack</span>)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb10-4">  <span>FooException</span>, called at stacks<span>.</span>hs<span>:</span><span>18</span><span>:</span><span>16</span> <span>in</span> main<span>:</span><span>Main</span></span>
<span id="cb10-5">  foo, called at stacks<span>.</span>hs<span>:</span><span>22</span><span>:</span><span>11</span> <span>in</span> main<span>:</span><span>Main</span></span>
<span id="cb10-6">  bar, called at <span>&lt;</span>interactive<span>&gt;:</span><span>7</span><span>:</span><span>1</span> <span>in</span> interactive<span>:</span><span>Ghci1</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For another example, here is a real call stack I reproduced in our production code:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>Exception</span><span>:</span> <span>Operation</span> timeout</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><span>CallStack</span> (from <span>HasCallStack</span>)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3">  <span>TimeOut</span>, called at src<span>/</span><span>Database</span><span>/</span><span>Bolt</span><span>/</span>Connection.hs<span>:</span><span>38</span><span>:</span><span>36</span> <span>in</span> hasbolt<span>-</span><span>0.1</span><span>.</span><span>4.3</span><span>-</span>inplace<span>:</span><span>Database.Bolt.Connection</span></span>
<span id="cb11-4">  run, called at src<span>/</span><span>XXX</span><span>/</span><span>DB</span><span>/</span>Impl.hs<span>:</span><span>42</span><span>:</span><span>43</span> <span>in</span> xxx<span>-</span><span>0.3</span><span>.</span><span>5.0</span><span>-</span>inplace<span>:</span><span>XXX.DB.Impl</span></span>
<span id="cb11-5">  runDB, called at src<span>/</span><span>XXX</span><span>/</span><span>DB</span><span>/</span>Impl.hs<span>:</span><span>124</span><span>:</span><span>14</span> <span>in</span> xxx<span>-</span><span>0.3</span><span>.</span><span>5.0</span><span>-</span>inplace<span>:</span><span>XXX.DB.Impl</span></span>
<span id="cb11-6">  programs, called at src<span>/</span><span>XXX</span><span>/</span><span>API</span><span>/</span>Program.hs<span>:</span><span>33</span><span>:</span><span>17</span> <span>in</span> xxx<span>-</span><span>0.3</span><span>.</span><span>5.0</span><span>-</span>inplace<span>:</span><span>XXX.API.Program</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p><code>HasCallStack</code> is a magic constraint, so the fact that this trick works may or may not be a coincidence: some later change in GHC may stop GADT pattern match from affecting how <code>HasCallStack</code> is solved. However, I think that this approach is useful enough and may be used in practice. Just don’t forget to add enough <code>HasCallStack</code> to places which can fail.</p>
<p>Don’t forget, though, that <code>HasCallStack</code> is not free and sometimes can break some optimizations, especially if used in recursive functions (that’s the reason <code>head</code> &amp; friends do not capture the stack).</p>
<p>Of course, this post does nothing to help debugging standard exceptions, like <code>IOError</code>. For that, the usual way is to build with <code>-prof</code> and run your code with <code>+RTS -xc</code>, as documented in <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/runtime_control.html#rts-flag--xc">the manual</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Appendix</strong>: Common misunderstandings regarding nuclear</p>



<h2>1. Can we achieve our climate goals without nuclear energy?</h2>



<p>Looking at global energy consumption, the situation seems bleak. Over 80% of global consumption still comes from fossil fuels. Consequently, <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/download/#full">the IPCC report notes</a> that, above all, the capacity of low-emission renewables – wind, solar and geothermal energy – must be multiplied in order to combat climate change. Additionally, IPCC report scenarios for 1.5 degrees warming require a two to sixfold increase for nuclear power.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Mwc7IATWBVsl4dcDZ5OBNl7wR68n8WcKaCC359ZMBsdYfM_JT1NlDgHOXEJNE7p8p6Z-EwSw_pEkH4pEZ17DSazKelHzu1uNkRx_ts2ollYmNBUUed8-dNyXehFZh5RXu7OpZ_vU" alt=""></figure>

<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/kUXqwLAM04PQzFDYyXXi1AcDVB86AF153eD_gQP8NOpuQaHiqQWRHaBy6PFjokDQNyNJE_ZwPbEfGh6fNo1RUzeYz1U5KV3d5wMMlCs2-DOGMN_UozX_SStEvC33ESHAi2FScg0Z" alt=""></figure>



<p>Traditionally, opposing nuclear power is associated with trust in a notion, created in the media and in public discourses, that a problem-free renewable-energy based solution is waiting for us just around the corner, and that this solution will cover all future energy needs. For example, with news about how Denmark has been run entirely by renewable energy for a day, an image is created that soon the same solution will work everywhere. At the same time, the media overlooks the fact that this is about electricity consumption; the total energy consumption by Denmark is still largely based on fossil fuels. Even though low-emission renewables are likely to be the most significant future energy form, renewables alone may not be able to replace all fossil energy forms in, for example, heating or increasing electrification. Wind and solar energy have challenges related to the variability of the energy production and they often need support from other energy sources. Therefore, it is worth keeping various nuclear-power based solutions as part of the energy mix.</p>



<p>The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) predicts that, <a href="https://www.irena.org/publications/2018/Apr/Global-Energy-Transition-A-Roadmap-to-2050">in 2050, renewables could produce two thirds of all energy needed</a>. When realized, this would be a great achievement! However, also the last third of the energy required in 2050 must be produced by low-emission means and not by fossil energy sources. Additionally, the report by IRENA, unfortunately, estimates that heating would largely be based on bioenergy. This is not a sustainable solution. Bioenergy cannot be sustainably increased by much, as forests must be kept as carbon storage, and be partly utilized as higher-value products, such as in wood construction. Also, human action – farming and gathering of nature’s biomass production for human use – is already driving a rapid loss of biodiversity and shrinking of species populations. When the challenge is as enormous as it is, low-emission renewables and nuclear power should not be pitted against each other. Such juxtaposition only benefits the fossil industry.</p>



<h2>2. Is nuclear power sustainable?</h2>



<p>To stop climate change, it is essential to minimize the carbon emissions from energy production. The picture below shows that nuclear power has one of the smallest carbon footprints of all electricity sources per unit of energy produced.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Vw7bDJAtG-CPOkk9wUp3Nl8KVsBGuGsQndXSSufd56MXm737dyy_yS3jyXgE8AuA94qYg0hRNnE1Oem_DfFlHXorkJmthDqiDiomw4pb4WM5kcnfDiiRZeTsztP7Z8mEDqWNfYxu" alt=""></figure>



<p><em>Median values for lifecycle emissions of different electricity sources: IPCC 2014</em></p>



<p>Some criticize nuclear power for the problems related to mining uranium. However, this kind of criticism makes one wonder what the better option would be, as all sources of energy have their own problems related to the required minerals. Renewable sources of energy require more different metals per unit of energy than nuclear power does. Nonetheless, in order to replace fossil fuels, we will need many times more low-emission renewables than we currently have.</p>



<p>The image below indicates the land use footprint of nuclear power and wind power based on actual projects. The nuclear footprint is likely overestimated, since the uranium mine depicted here produces more than three times what is used by the nuclear power plant, and the site can accommodate at least a fourth large reactor. The footprint of wind power is underestimated, as the mines and backup power needed by wind power are not included.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7jZAQK6TNHxqfFNQ7Rt7fZfbGWFen1z7pWS6AUD7mMJWZhh1IEn41Om0fdn0Qxq7kdW4BHemoimSteE1HRzOpcseSd_R54F1ucF0J8MtL-dHXjSQIdTdZ5fpSpRFWRhOiwfV7Scx" alt="" width="821" height="634"><figcaption>Data for wind park is from Environmental Impact Assessment of Oosinkangas wind park, data for nuclear is from google maps.</figcaption></figure>







<h2>3. Is nuclear power safe?</h2>



<p>Many of those opposing nuclear power originally formed their position as a reaction against the indifference towards risks in the Soviet Union, and in particular, against the resulting Chernobyl accident. This is understandable. However, there have been no accidents in plants constructed after 1980, and statistically speaking, nuclear power is actually <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-is-the-safest-form-of-energy">the safest form of energy</a>.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pNxE_sClx7Q_dd_65EC4vmiZCXeMBZcR9B_Ko_9CUgep3aHF7brgKNM-xQmdg6ykpTKyefUUQrY9R5S5-XxRRh8WZe-MrnnCHcLSqOwaXB8K4Fy4vYu42TaQG3fw7BCWmtSLdezQ" alt=""></figure>



<p>Nuclear power has also been opposed due to fears of nuclear arms proliferation. However, if a country wants to make nuclear weapons, it can make them also without civilian nuclear reactors.&nbsp; Using modern nuclear reactors to make weapons material (plutonium), is actually multiple times more expensive, and easier to detect than other options, such as enriching uranium with centrifuges (e.g. Iran) to weapons grade or using a simple graphite pile to make plutonium (examples in and after Second World War). IAEA supervises the use of nuclear power and the use and transport of nuclear materials to prevent nuclear arms proliferation. Here, a strong global civilian nuclear community is a great asset.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>4. How harmful is nuclear waste?</h2>



<p>Spent nuclear fuel is also a common safety concern. However, nuclear waste management is already heavily regulated by the laws and procedures both in the EU and in the member states. In practice, spent nuclear fuel has never harmed anyone, anywhere. Spent nuclear fuel emits radiation and must be kept separate from the biosphere. This is not very hard: a few meters of water or concrete is adequate to stop the radiation.&nbsp; In the long term, it is preferable (safer, cheaper) to store the spent fuel for example in deep geological storage, or use it to make new nuclear fuel and low carbon energy in breeder-reactors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The graph below shows the average radioactive doses humans get, by source (Data: United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, 2008. <a href="https://www.unscear.org/docs/publications/2008/UNSCEAR_2008_Report_Vol.I.pdf"><em>https://www.unscear.org/docs/publications/2008/UNSCEAR_2008_Report_Vol.I.pdf</em></a>). As can be seen, the nuclear fuel cycle, which includes spent fuel, is barely the size of a rounding error. </p>



<p><img width="587" height="432" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/elCKjgL1BvrGdfke6Eeb9pvVsa0z25ibYbr-o7_QnjomNagxufXXiufj4EIduJBwUX4Bvic77Y-TcbUNecvqVkzJnmPUCF7IYznBPlHrzRUitJajkcgi0Z3I69TNN5XOEsNn6Iq1"></p>



<p>Finland’s spent nuclear fuel repository <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onkalo_spent_nuclear_fuel_repository">Onkalo</a> sets an example for the final disposal of nuclear waste. The independent nuclear and radiation regulator STUK has stated that the repository can be built to be passively safe. The margin of safety is such that even the purely academic modeling exercise, where everything goes wrong, the maximum doses someone might get, at 0.00018 mSv, are in the neighbourhood of a million times too small to cause any significant harm to the local population ten thousand years into the future.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>5. Is nuclear power too slow to build?</h2>



<p>Some argue that nuclear reactors are too slow to manufacture compared to the immediacy of the climate crisis. The reactors take multiple years to plan and build. However, the EU is likely still many years or decades away from ending emissions from its energy production – and even then, the energy production infrastructure needs constant rebuilding. Therefore, the nuclear reactors that start to generate power years or decades from now will help in reducing the remaining emissions. If nuclear energy is not an available tool to reduce emissions, then reaching carbon neutrality might take longer, as we argue in the next section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the reactor production is not always as slow as some of the worst recent examples indicate. According to<a href="https://pris.iaea.org/pris/"> IAEA’s PRIS database</a>, the plants built during 1990s and 2000s took less than six years to build on average, and currently the average building speed in China is around 5-6 years. The recent delays in western nuclear projects are largely due to lost expertise and supply chains during the 30 years of not building nuclear and building new First-Of-A-Kind plants that had unfinished designs when construction started. These can all be mitigated, leading to faster projects that stay on budget better.</p>







<h2>6. Is nuclear power too expensive?</h2>



<p>Some 10-20 years ago, wind and solar were very expensive. Since then, we have had extremely supportive policies and poured billions of euros in subsidies and tax-breaks for wind and solar. They have proliferated, and they have become cheaper. As can be expected, humans get better and more efficient in the things they do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This can be observed in nuclear power as well. Several decades of not building nuclear in Europe led to prohibitively expensive “First-of-A-Kind” projects, plagued with delays and problems. Yet elsewhere, the rest of the world (ROW)&nbsp; kept on building nuclear, and can do it at low cost, relatively on time and on budget. This can be seen in the image below, taken from the recent global study “Nuclear Cost Drivers Project” done for the Energy Technologies Institute.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As it is abundantly clear that we need much more nuclear power to mitigate climate change effectively and within the required timeframe, it would make sense to make building it cheaper. Having a program to build nuclear, instead of politically risky one-off projects every decade or so, can substantially bring down nuclear energy’s costs, halving them or even more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nuclear plants are big and time-consuming project even when they are successful. Therefore, the cost of capital also plays a …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Let’s say my goal this year is to get to 10k monthly recurring revenue (MRR).</p>

<p>MRR first, everything else second. I would ruthlessly cut out all activities that don’t lead to a measurable MRR increase. For example, I would stop writing blog posts like the one you’re currently reading. I certainly wouldn’t create fun projects like What to Tweet or take the time for non-transactional Zoom calls.</p>

<p>I would focus on my revenue generating projects, crank up the advertising machinery and do everything I can think of that potentially increases my MRR.
I’m fairly confident that I would reach 10k MRR by the end of the year. But at what price?</p>

<p>Let’s take a step back for a second.</p>

<p>You know who manages by metrics? Big companies like Google, Amazon and LinkedIn.</p>

<p>And what do they have in common?</p>

<p>Their core product got notably worse over time.</p>

<p>Google’s search results are dominated by ads and many users now use workarounds to find what they’re looking for (“Best headphone reddit”). LinkedIn looks like Minesweeper. Facebook was a fun place to meet friends. And if you search for an electronics product on Amazon, you immediately feel like you’re at a flea market in the middle of Shenzhen.
This is the result of hundreds of decisions that were motivated by a short-term focus on specific metrics like revenue and click rates. And while these decisions most likely optimized the metrics, they made the user experience worse.</p>

<p>The problem is that we don’t have the technology to measure the right thing. Or maybe the “right thing” is inherently immeasurable.</p>

<p>Or, and that’s my personal favorite, we’re dealing with a Schrödinger’s cat like situation. The “right thing” is only the right thing as long as we’re not trying to optimize it.
This is known as Goodhart’s law. “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.“</p>

<p>Let’s consider another example.</p>

<p>Who else manages by metrics? Politicians!</p>

<p>Instead of some boring historic example (there are plenty, just read “Seeing like a State”), I’m going to spice things up by talking about something that’s happening right now.
It’s not hard to anticipate what I want to talk about since there’s precisely one thing that’s currently happening: Covid-19.</p>

<p>Politicians try to manage the situation by focusing on metrics like the “R number”. At least here in Germany the motto is: let’s lower the R number at all costs.
Turns out the cost of this strategy is incredibly high. It’s just not immediately measurable.</p>

<p>For example, everyone’s getting fatter since all gyms and sport clubs are closed. Most people are developing unhealthy eating habits because there’s simply nothing else to do. Social connections are rapidly degregating even though everyone knows how important they’re for the human wellbeing.</p>

<p>I’m not a doctor and don’t play one on the internet, but I can easily imagine that there are lots of further unintended consequences of the current lockdown policy. For example, since most people now spend most of their time indoors alone and wear masks when they leave their homes, their immune system isn’t stressed regularly like it usual is. Hence I wouldn’t be surprised if many people will get sick of other diseases once the lockdown ends as a result of weakened immune systems.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, I’m all for taking Covid seriously. In fact, I’ve been hoarding masks since 2009. I spent the summer of 2009 with a bunch of friends in Lloret de Mar (a party hotspot in Spain) just when news of the swine flu started to emerge. Long story short, everyone in our group got sick (20+ people) except for my girlfriend and me because we’ve been wearing masks.
Now the most famous example how focusing on metrics can have unhealthy consequences is the cobra effect. I’ll just quote from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The term cobra effect originated in an anecdote that describes an occurrence during India under British rule. The British government was concerned about the number of venomous cobras in Delhi. The government therefore offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially, this was a successful strategy; large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, however, enterprising people began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped. When cobra breeders set their now-worthless snakes free, the wild cobra population further increased.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is one more example I always have to talk about when the topic comes up: academia.</p>

<p>Stagnation apologists love to argue that the lack of progress in science is simply a result of the fact that all low-hanging fruit are gone.</p>

<p>That’s complete nonsense. There’s still plenty of low-hanging fruit. It’s just that everyone is so busy chasing meaningless metrics that they can’t see them.</p>

<p>In academia the metric of choice usually has something to do with the number of citations. But just like Google’s backlink-driven algorithm (which was in fact inspired by academia’s citation metrics) was quickly gamed by savvy webmasters, academia’s algorithm is gamed by careerists.</p>

<p>And I’m not talking about some tiny minority here. If you want to survive in academia, you have to play the citation game. And if everyone is cheating, at the very least you have to do the same to stand a chance.</p>

<p>You have to partner up with others because five people can write five times as many papers. You agree to constantly cite each other. Likewise, you focus on incremental additions to established ideas because that’s the safest way to new publications regularly. You work on the stuff everyone else is working on because how else are you going to get citations?</p>

<p>And one thing you absolutely have to avoid like the plague is the risky and deep kind of research that leads to real progress in the field.</p>

<p>The problem isn’t that citations are a bad metric, and we need to come up with smarter ones. Instead, it’s just Goodhart’s law in action.
Every attempt to manage academia makes it worse.</p>

<p>As soon a new metric is introduced it will misdirect the attention of scientists towards playing the game, instead of progressing science.</p>

<p>I talked about three areas, but the same pattern occurs almost everywhere. For example, just remember when everyone started minimizing fat in their diet or how grades are used to measure “learning”.</p>

<p>Crucially the problem is not the specific metric that’s being used. Whatever new metric gets introduced will soon again be made useless by Goodhart’s law. The metrics game will always be akin to Whac-A-Mole.</p>

<p>Now where does this leave us? If management by metrics doesn’t work, what else should we do?</p>

<p>First of all, I think that looking at metrics can be helpful. They just shouldn’t be the sole yardstick decisions are measured against.</p>

<p>And while the map never will be the territory, the picture you’re looking at gets more accurate the more metrics you consider. For example, if politicians would not just consider the R number but hundreds of metrics that take different aspects of a population’s wellbeing into account, the decisions would be better ones.</p>

<p>The obvious problem is that decisions become much harder if you consider more than one metric.</p>

<p>But more importantly there are so many factors we can’t measure that nevertheless should be taken into account.</p>

<p>The more I think about it the more I become convinced that it all boils down to talking to people.</p>

<p>And I’m not talking about surveys that distill thousands of standardized “conversations” into a few numbers or analytics tools that do similar things for behavior. I’m talking about real one-on-one interactions.</p>

<p>Just imagine if Jeff Bezos would talk to hundreds of real (non pre-vetted) Amazon customers each month and take what he hears in these conversations seriously. Or if politicians would have long conversations with regular people from all wakes of life. Or if academic committees would actually talk to applicants before filtering them out based on citation metrics.</p>

<p>In our hyper rational world it’s extremely hard to justify decisions based on the mere gut feeling you got from a few conversations. But this is exactly what people should be doing.</p>

<p>Engagement metrics will never tell you if users are genuinely happy when they use your product. But a few genuine conversations will.</p>

<p>A resume will never tell you if a person is genuinely interested in uncovering unknown truths about nature. But a 30-minute conversation will.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s so much easier to reach a consensus if you just hire the candidate with the highest citation metrics or implement the feature that will lead to the largest revenue increase in the next quarter. But while it’s the easiest decision it’s usually not the best one.</p>

<p>And I think the same applies not just to managing organizations but also to managing ourselves.</p>

<p>Just by listening to my own body I’ll always know better than any fitness tracker if I slept well, better than any blood test if my diet is healthy, and better than my bank account if I’m happy.
That doesn’t mean that I’ll not use a fitness tracker, make regular blood tests, or check my bank account. But I certainly won’t allow them to dictate my decisions.</p>

<p>I’ll look at all the facts and take everything in, even the stuff that can’t be measured, and then I’ll just go with my gut.</p>

        <p>Throughout my engineering career, I've come across dozens if not hundreds of equipment suppliers. But there are a few suppliers that leave a long lasting impression. Thorlabs is one of them. Why?</p><p>It is quite silly actually. Everytime I order a linear actuator, motorized stage or axis controller... something that's just normal industrial hardware, it ships unremarkably with billable weight in hundreds of dollars, docks and sits at the shipping &amp; receiving until I haul it into the lab. Cut open the box, and you see this:</p><figure><img src="https://neil.computer/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>Source: https://jlfenimore.wixsite.com/jenniferfenimore/lab-snacks</figcaption></figure><p>This little red box brings so much joy it is hard to describe. Thorlabs shipping boxes contain one or more of these red boxes, it's got - cookies, candies, granola bars, chips, etc. with seemingly a singular heartwarming goal - to put a smile on my face. They didn't have to do it but they did. And they've been doing this for many years. Infact, they've trademarked "Lab Snacks" which is such a cool name on its own! Food and Drink are not allowed in our lab, except when it comes to the Thorlabs Snacks.</p><p>Thorlabs founder, Alex Cable, wrote an <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/about_us.cfm">article</a> about his vision of what customer centricity is, there is so much to learn from it, Wikipedia quotes:</p><blockquote>An important part of Thorlabs' brand and culture is Lab Snacks. Lab Snacks were created to support the famished grad student researching all night, serving as an occasional meal for someone hard at work.</blockquote><p>I implore you to read the original <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/about_us.cfm">article</a> because it exemplifies what a CEO and Founder should do to build an honest, customer centric business and how to genuinely connect with them. Everything at Thorlabs, from their phone support to documentation, is focusing on how best to make you, the customer, successful. Therein lies their success and they double-down on it.</p><p>Thorlabs has left such a long-lasting impact on me that I am writing this post after last enjoying Lab Snacks 2 years ago.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<p>Let me state up front that, while we’re going to be talking about an open source project that was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25833206">recently submitted</a> to Hacker News’s “Show HN” section, the intent of this post is not at all to shame the developer who tried their damnedest to do the right thing. They’re the victim, not the culprit.</p>



<h2>RSA, Ya Don’t Say</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, an HN user shared <a href="https://github.com/tomquirk/zuccnet">their open source fork of a Facebook’s messenger client</a>, with added encryption. Their motivation was, as stated in the readme:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>It is known that <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/facebook-reads-messenger-messages/">Facebook scans your messages</a>. If you need to keep using Facebook messenger but care about privacy, Zuccnet might help.</p><p>It’s pretty simple: you and your friend have Zuccnet installed. Your friend gives you their Zuccnet public key. Then, when you send a message to your friend on Zuccnet, your message is encrypted on your machine before it is sent across Facebook to your friend. Then, your friend’s Zuccnet decrypts the message. Facebook never sees the content of your message.</p><p>I’m not a security person and there’s probably some stuff I’ve missed – any contributions are very welcome! This is <em>very</em> <strong>beta</strong>, don’t take it too seriously.</p></div><cite>From Zuccnet’s very humble README.</cite></blockquote>



<p>So far, so good. Facebook is abysmal for privacy, so trying to take matters into your own hands to encrypt data so Facebook can’t see what you’re talking about is, in spirit, a wonderful idea.</p>







<p>However, there is a problem with the <em>execution</em> of this idea. And this isn’t a problem unique to Zuccnet. Several times per year, I come across some well-meaning software project that makes the same mistake: Encrypting messages with RSA directly is bad.</p>



<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/tomquirk/zuccnet/blob/42e351e36b3b5dbaef06256ed11313fab77adb25/src/util/crypto.js#L57-L84">Zuccnet source code</a>:</p>


<pre title="">const encryptMessage = (message, recipientPublicKey) =&gt; {
  const encryptedMessage = crypto.publicEncrypt(
    {
      key: recipientPublicKey,
      padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING,
      oaepHash: "sha256",
    },
    Buffer.from(message),
  );

  return encryptedMessage.toString("base64");
};

/**
 *
 * @param {String} encryptedMessage - base64 encoded string
 */
const decryptMessage = encryptedMessage =&gt; {
  const encryptedMessageBuffer = Buffer.from(encryptedMessage, "base64");
  const { privateKey } = getOrCreateZuccnetKeyPair();
  const message = crypto.privateDecrypt(
    {
      key: privateKey,
      padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING,
      oaepHash: "sha256",
    },
    Buffer.from(encryptedMessageBuffer),
  );
};
</pre>


<p>To the Zuccnet author’s credit, they’re using OAEP padding, not PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. This means their code isn’t vulnerable to Bleichenbacher’s 1998 padding oracle attack (n.b. most of the RSA code I encounter in the wild is vulnerable to this attack).</p>



<p>However, there are other problems with this code:</p>



<ol><li>If you try to encrypt a message longer than 256 bytes with a 2048-bit RSA public key, it will fail. (Bytes matter here, not characters, even for English speakers–because emoji.)</li><li>This design (encrypting with a static RSA public key per recipient) completely lacks forward secrecy. This is the same reason that <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">PGP encryption sucks</a> (or, at least, one of the reasons PGP sucks).</li></ol>



<p>There are many ways to work around the first limitation.</p>



<p>Some cryptography libraries let you treat RSA as a block cipher in <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/the-ecb-penguin/">ECB mode</a> and encrypt each chunk independently. This is an incredibly stupid API deign choice: It’s slow (asymmetric cryptography operations are on the order of tens-to-hundreds-of-thousands times slower than symmetric cryptography) and you can drop/reorder/replay blocks, since ECB mode provides <em>no semantic security</em>.</p>

<p>A <strong>much</strong> better strategy is to encrypt the data with a symmetric key, then encrypt <em>that key</em> with RSA. (See the <a href="#rsa-pkcs1">end of the post</a> for special treatment options that are especially helpful for RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding.)</p>



<p>Working around the second problem usually requires an Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE), similar to what I covered in my <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/11/14/going-bark-a-furrys-guide-to-end-to-end-encryption/">Guide to End-to-End Encryption</a>. Working around this second problem <em>also</em> solves the first problem, so it’s usually better to just implement a forward-secret key exchange protocol than try to make RSA secure. </p>



<p>(You can get forward secrecy without an AKE, by regularly rotating keys, but AKEs make forward secrecy automatic and on-by-default without forcing humans to make a decision to rotate a credential– something most people don’t do unless they have to. AKEs trade user experience complexity for protocol complexity–and this trade-off is almost universally worth taking.)</p>



<p>Although AKEs are extremely useful, they’re a bit complex for most software developers to pick up without prior cryptography experience. (If they were easier, after all, there wouldn’t be so much software that encrypts messages directly with RSA in the first place.)</p>



<p>Note: RSA itself isn’t the reason that this lacks forward secrecy. The problem is how RSA is used.</p>



<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>



<h3>For Developers</h3>



<p>First, consider <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/08/fuck-rsa/">not using RSA</a>. Hell, while you’re at it, <a href="https://www.cryptofails.com/post/75204435608/write-crypto-code-dont-publish-it">don’t write <em>any</em> cryptography code that you don’t have to</a>. </p>



<p>Libsodium (<a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/bindings_for_other_languages">which you should use</a>) does most of this for you, and can easily be turned into <a href="https://github.com/soatok/rawr-x3dh">an AKE comparable to the one Signal uses</a>. The less cryptography code you have to write, the less can go catastrophically wrong–especially in production systems.</p>



<p>If jettisoning RSA from your designs is a non-starter, you should at least consider taking the Dhole Moments Pledge for Software Developers:</p>



<blockquote><p>I will not encrypt messages directly with RSA, or any other asymmetric primitive.</p><cite>Simple enough, right?</cite></blockquote>



<p>Instead, if you find yourself needing to encrypt a message with RSA, remind yourself that RSA is <em>for encrypting symmetric keys, not messages</em>. And then plan your protocol design accordingly.</p>



<p>Also, I’m pretty sure RSA isn’t random-key robust. Ask your favorite cryptographer if it matters for whatever you’re building.</p>



<p>(But seriously, you’re better off not using RSA at all.)</p>



<h3>For Cryptography Libraries</h3>



<p>Let’s ask ourselves, “Why are we forcing developers to know or even care about these details?”</p>



<p>Libsodium doesn’t encumber developers with unnecessary decisions like this. Why does the crypto module built into JavaScript? Why does the crypto module built into <em>most</em> programming languages that offer one, for that matter? (Go is a notable exception here, because their security team is awesome and forward-thinking.)</p>



<p>In my opinion, we should stop shipping cryptography interfaces that…</p>



<ul><li>Mix symmetric and asymmetric cryptography in the same API</li><li>Allow developers to encrypt directly with asymmetric primitives</li><li>Force developers to manage their own nonces/initialization vectors</li><li>Allow public/private keys to easily get confused (e.g. lack of type safety)</li></ul>



<p>For example: <a href="https://dholecrypto.com/">Dhole Crypto</a> is close to my ideal for general-purpose encryption.</p>



<h3 id="rsa-pkcs1">Addendum: Securing RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5</h3>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> Neil Madden informs me that what I wrote here is actually very similar to a standard construction called <a href="https://kel.bz/post/kem/">RSA-KEM</a>. You should use RSA-KEM instead of what I’ve sketched out, since that’s better studied by cryptographers.</p>



<p>(I’ve removed the original sketch below, to prevent accidental misuse.)</p>

<p>Capitalist hegemony has short-circuited people into buying wildly illogical and ridiculous propaganda like: “<em>Lift yourselves up by the bootstraps</em>” (which shows the almost religious power of capitalist propaganda, that the impossible can become possible), or “<em>Communism doesn’t work</em>”, when in fact <strong>Communism did work extremely well.</strong></p>

The mass housing projects began in the 60s, they were completed in the 70s, and by the 70s, there were homeless people, but they often had genuine issues with mental health.</li>

<p>When it is claimed that a system <em>works</em>, we should ask, <strong>who it works for</strong>. Capitalism benefits a tiny number of rapacious capitalists, to the detriment of the rest of us, while Socialism works for the masses.</p>

<p>I’m trying to convince friends and family to switch to Signal. Opened the Signal App after several months today and I was welcomed with 100+ unread “X just joined Signal” messages. And it irritated me right away! Not for some privacy concern but because looking at 100+ automated, unread messages is simply unpleasant. So many email apps base their whole business plan around the ‘zero inbox’ idea. Instead here I was on Signal, greeted with unnecessary messages. You don’t expect me to click each one to mark as read! Or go look for solutions to bulk-delete or mark-all-read right after I signup. The two friends that I had chatted with long back were embedded deep into the sea of these messages.</p>
<p>I go back and forth between whether first impressions are as important — but dare I say, for Web and Mobile Apps they are.</p>
<p><strong>Signal ought to act confidently about its presence in the messaging Apps domain now and not act as a newbie in the market.</strong></p>
<p>P.S.: There’s an option under settings to Switch Off the “Contact Joined Signal” notifications. This should be default off or completely removed from the App.)</p>

            <p><em><strong>Cash and Stock Transaction Valued at Approximately $8.0 Billion</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Teledyne and FLIR to Host Joint Conference Call and Webcast at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Today</em></p>
<p>THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. and ARLINGTON, Va. – January 4, 2021 – Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY) (“Teledyne”) and FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLIR) (“FLIR”) jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Teledyne will acquire FLIR in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $8.0 billion.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, FLIR stockholders will receive $28.00 per share in cash and 0.0718 shares of Teledyne common stock for each FLIR share, which implies a total purchase price of $56.00 per FLIR share based on Teledyne’s 5-day volume weighted average price as of December 31, 2020. &nbsp;The transaction reflects a 40% premium for FLIR stockholders based on FLIR’s 30-day volume weighted average price as of December 31, 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the transaction, Teledyne has arranged a $4.5 billion 364-day credit commitment to fund the transaction and refinance certain existing debt.&nbsp; Teledyne expects to fund the transaction with permanent financing prior to closing.&nbsp; Net leverage at closing is expected to be approximately 4.0x adjusted pro forma EBITDA with leverage declining to less than 3.0x by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Teledyne expects the acquisition to be immediately accretive to earnings, excluding transaction costs and intangible asset amortization, and accretive to GAAP earnings in the first full calendar year following the acquisition.</p>
<p>“At the core of both our companies is proprietary sensor technologies. &nbsp;Our business models are also similar: we each provide sensors, cameras and sensor systems to our customers. &nbsp;However, our technologies and products are uniquely complementary with minimal overlap, having imaging sensors based on different semiconductor technologies for different wavelengths,” said Robert Mehrabian, Executive Chairman of Teledyne. &nbsp;“For two decades, Teledyne has demonstrated its ability to compound earnings and cash flow consistently and predictably. &nbsp;Together with FLIR and an optimized capital structure, I am confident we shall continue delivering superior returns to our stockholders.”</p>
<p>“FLIR’s commitment to innovation spanning multiple sensing technologies has allowed our company to grow into the multi-billion-dollar company it is today,” said Earl Lewis, Chairman of FLIR. &nbsp;“With our new partner’s platform of complementary technologies, we will be able to continue this trajectory, providing our employees, customers and stockholders even more exciting momentum for growth. &nbsp;Our Board fully supports this transaction, which delivers immediate value and the opportunity to participate in the upside potential of the combined company.”</p>
<p>Jim Cannon, President and Chief Executive Officer of FLIR, said, “We could not be more excited to join forces with Teledyne through this value-creating transaction. &nbsp;Together, we will offer a uniquely complementary end-to-end portfolio of sensory technologies for all key domains and applications across a well-balanced, global customer base. &nbsp;We are pleased to be partnering with an organization that shares our focus on continuous innovation and operational excellence, and we look forward to working closely with the Teledyne team as we bring our two companies together to capitalize on the important opportunities ahead.”</p>
<p><strong>Fourth Quarter Financial Results</strong></p>
<p>In a separate press release issued today, Teledyne announced improved preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. &nbsp;The Teledyne press release is available on www.teledyne.com. &nbsp;FLIR noted today that it expects to meet or exceed the full year fiscal 2020 guidance it provided on October 30, 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Approvals and Timing </strong></p>
<p>The transaction, which has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, is expected to close in the middle of 2021 subject to the receipt of required regulatory approvals, including expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, approvals of Teledyne and FLIR stockholders and other customary closing conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Advisors </strong></p>
<p>Evercore is acting as exclusive financial advisor and McGuireWoods LLP is acting as legal advisor to Teledyne in connection with the transaction.&nbsp; Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. LLC is acting as exclusive financial advisor and Hogan Lovells US LLP is acting as legal advisor to FLIR in connection with the transaction. &nbsp;Teledyne has entered into a 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility credit agreement with Bank of America as sole lead arranger and administrative agent.</p>
<p><strong>Conference Call and Webcast </strong></p>

                    <p>Jack Ma and Jack Dorsey, two of the leading tech entrepreneurs for their respective nations, are currently perfect juxtapositions for how <strong>different their respective countries’ systems are in managing the power of tech giants and digital information infrastructure.</strong></p><p>In October 2020, Jack Ma, China’s wealthiest man and the model idol of China Inc., was preparing to float Ant Group, in what was billed to be the largest IPO in the world. There were signs that the Chinese government was already looking to reign in some of the Chinese Tech Giant’s influence. On October 24, Ma made a rather controversial speech at a gathering of political heavyweights at the Bund Summit in Shanghai. The next day, <strong>Ma disappeared</strong> from public sightings and Ant’s IPO was halted on November 3, two days before it was supposed <a href="https://viralwegrow.com/blog/government-versus-big-tech/">to go live</a>.</p><p>In parallel timing across the Pacific, Jack Dorsey alongside the CEOs of the other Big Tech firms, were subjected to Section 230 Congressional hearings. There, the Democrats focused on how Big Tech was failing to deal with misinformation and the extremism happening on social media networks. The Republicans focused on the issues of censorship. Both political sides made little actual progress on meaningfully reigning in Big Tech however. On the 8th of January, <strong>President Trump was suspended </strong>from Twitter and any accounts he made to get around it, were also suspended.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="spanstylecolorcc6601thecompaniesthatthejacksbuiltspan"><span>🃋 The Companies That The Jacks Built</span></h2>

During and before this period, China was becoming more open to access by foreigners. As an English teacher by training, Jack Ma was fortunate to work in a tour guide position that enabled him to interact with Western foreigners. His tours allowed him to meet two such foreigners that changed his life and later Alibaba’s trajectory.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/how-a-visit-to-australia-helped-jack-ma-become-an-internet-tycoon">first</a> was his friendship with Australian electrical engineer, Ken Morley. The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/09/30/how-jerry-yang-made-the-most-lucrative-bet-in-tech-history/">second</a> was with Yahoo founder, Jerry Yang. The blossoming friendship resulted in Morley sponsoring Ma on his first ever overseas trip, to Newcastle in Australia.</p><p>According to Ma, the trip “<em>totally changed</em>” his future and instilled him with an appreciation for how Western market economics worked. The experiences shaped his later exposure to the differences in the U.S. economy to the Chinese one, and how the opportunities for the Chinese Internet economy.</p><p>Alongside the opportunistic timing of China’s market reforms, Jack Ma also met a fantastic operator in the form of American educated, Taiwanese financier, Joseph Tsai. Much of Alibaba’s financial and legal structure, it’s international dealings, were created by Tsai. As Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Tsai streamlined Alibaba’s operations. Under his instruction, he created operational standardisation and facilitated critical international investments to Alibaba’s growth and strategic acquisitions.</p><h3 id="dorsey-">Dorsey:</h3><p>Born in 1976, St Louis, Missouri, Jack Dorsey lived in the country with the highest proliferation of computers in the golden era of Commodore computers. The 1981 release of the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/desktops/76735/the-golden-age-of-commodore-computers">Commodore VIC-20</a> marked the beginning of low-cost home computers. The $299.95 launch was attractive for many home users by its inclusion of BASIC, Atari 2600 compatible controller ports, and color graphics that suited themselves well to video games. The period of cheaper computing and emergence of high school computer clubs, provided an opportunity for Dorsey to study and play around with IBM Computers.</p><p>Dorsey’s interest in computing and programming would see him drop out of University and move to California to work as a programmer. Whilst there, he was inspired by LiveJournal and AOL for a Web-based realtime status/short message communication service. When he saw the implementations of instant messaging, Dorsey began to wonder whether he could use instant messaging as a status output to be easily shared among friends.</p><p>In 2000, Dorsey built a simple prototype that let him update his friends on his life via BlackBerry and email messaging. The idea didn’t seem to be too popular, so Dorsey began freelancing and also went to work for podcasting startup Odeo. There, he met his Twitter co-founders, Biz Stone and Evan Williams. In 2006, the three would build the Twitter prototype. Evan would <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6505/the-march-of-twitter-analysis-of-how-and-where-twitter-spread.aspx">blog about it</a>, others who used to work with him at Google would follow suit, and Twitter would become a viral product after becoming popular among attendees of the South by Southwest convention in Austin in March 2007, where Twitter usage would exceed more than 60,000 Tweets per day.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="spanstylecolorcc6601theamericandreamvsthechinesedreamspan"><span>🃋 The American Dream Vs The Chinese Dream </span></h2>

As the country with the longest continuous history in the world, China has not forgotten its long standing history of geopolitical greatness and the <a href="https://imperialglobalexeter.com/2019/07/11/how-the-century-of-humiliation-influences-chinas-ambitions-today/">Century of Humiliation</a> by the Western powers and Japan. This Dream has fluctuated alongside the political conveniences of the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the more laissez-faire attitude of the 1990s.</p><p>The two differing dreams have greatly influenced the narrative and general population sentiment on how each country’s system should be run. In the U.S, there has been a general lack of Government appetite or unwillingness to reign in private corporate power. The rise of a <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/rise-liberaltarian">Liberaltarian class</a> has not been favourable to an <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/a-guide-to-statistics-on-historical-trends-in-income-inequality">income and wealth divide</a> for the traditional working class. China in contrast is ruled by a Party that espouses a narrative for <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11366-020-09695-3">Authoritarian order</a>, pointing to periods of great dynasties with a ruling Mandate, lest it falls to the periods of chaos when such dynasties fell apart.</p><p><strong>“<em>It doesn’t matter if a cat is black or white. So long as it catches mice</em>” - Deng Xiaoping</strong></p><p>The two different dreams posit different outcomes.</p><p>In the U.S., Jack Dorsey is able to boot off the U.S. President from its platform with little to no pushback. Thierry Breton, the European Union’s Digital Commissioner, notes this as a “<em>9/11 moment of social media</em>”. In an opinion piece, he <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/thierry-breton-social-media-capitol-hill-riot/">writes</a> that the “<em>fact that a CEO can pull the plug on POTUS’s loudspeaker without any checks and balances is perplexing. It is not only confirmation of the power of these platforms, but it also displays deep weaknesses in the way our society is organized in the digital space</em>”.</p><p>In China, even the wealthiest man and most well known Chinese ‘model’ entrepreneur can be removed (i.e. ‘step down’ as executive chairman). The Antitrust laws can be very quickly <a href="https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/draft-revisions-of-the-anti-monopoly-law-public-comment-draft/">redrafted</a> and the very biggest Tech companies <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/china-fines-alibaba-tencent-for-flouting-rules-in-past-deals">fined</a>.</p><p>Both countries have Tech Giants who are monopolistic in behaviour. In the U.S., allegations range from collusion in <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/01/16/377614477/tech-giants-will-pay-415-million-to-settle-employees-lawsuit">employee wages</a> to “copy, acquire, kill” <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/10/6/21505027/congress-big-tech-antitrust-report-facebook-google-amazon-apple-mark-zuckerberg-jeff-bezos-tim-cook">strategies</a>. In China, among all 124 unicorns - private companies with a valuation of $1 Billion USD - 50.8% are controlled or owned by the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2154437/true-dominance-chinas-baidu-alibaba-and-tencent-revealed-and-how">BAT</a>: Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent.</p><p>As 2021 plays out, we may start to <strong>see more signs as to how regulation will form for the management of digital information</strong>. In China, it is clear that the CCP views its control over currency and financial flows as critical to its hold over the country’s political economy. Regulation will be implemented on any financial challenger of the CCP’s ‘bank’ status. In the US, it is uncertain how the new Biden administration will manage oversized corporate interests.</p>

      <p>If you've been following me awhile, you know that I was <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2016/6/3/ruby-fellow-hired">hired by AppFolio</a> years ago to measure Ruby 3's performance, especially on Rails. This has been a long trip. And that very first project is finally over: Ruby 3 exists and I can check its final, released Rails performance.</p>

<p>If you <strong><em>have</em></strong> been following along, the numbers in this post won't surprise you. But it's important to do the final measurement. If you haven't been following, this will bring you up to date.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2>What Am I Measuring?</h2>

<p>In concept, I'm measuring "how fast is Ruby 3 versus Ruby 2.6 or 2.7 for a typical real-world Rails workload?"</p>

<p>"Typical real-world workload" is a vague, hand-wavy concept. But there are a lot of specifics that can back it up. I used <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2018/4/2/rails-ruby-bench-what-and-why">Rails Ruby Bench</a>, something I've written for this purpose and used for years now.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/noahgibbs/rails_ruby_bench">Rails Ruby Bench</a> runs a copy of <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse">Discourse</a>, a common and popular Rails app to host internet forums. It's one of the biggest available "real" open-source Rails apps, making it a fine choice for "real world" benchmarking. RRB runs a set of simulated pseudorandom user requests against the running Rails app, and times how long they all take to finish. So it's a throughput test. <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2019/11/28/how-do-i-use-rails-ruby-bench">You can run it yourself if you like</a>, though it's a bit complex and finicky. The dark side of using real-world software is hitting real-world complexity and bugs.</p>

<p>The Ruby versions I measured were my hacked Ruby 3.0 versus 2.6.6 and 2.7.1.</p>

<p>RRB has run against AWS m4.2xlarge instances for nearly its whole existence. That's what I'm doing again. For now: m4.2xlarge instances, 10 processes, 6 threads/process, the same as I've been <a href="https://rubykaigi.org/2017/presentations/codefolio.html">using for over 3 years</a> for this purpose. With this post, it has fulfilled its purpose: to measure the total speedup from 2.0 to 3.0 of a typical real-world Ruby on Rails application.</p>

<p>And I can finally stop supporting some hideous old hacks to make that possible.</p>

<p>These results are running 90 batches per Ruby version of 15,000 requests each. That's enough to get pretty solid results, but not to detect the tiniest differences. If you need to detect the tiniest differences in speed, you should probably be analysing your own workload more carefully instead. Anything below about half a percent in speed is going to be dwarfed by differences for your own specific operations. It kinda breaks the abstraction of asking "how fast is Ruby 2.X?" — at some point you don't care about the language generally, you care about the parts of it that you specifically use a lot.</p>

<h2>Methodology and Extra Pitfalls</h2>

<p>This post <a href="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/rails/performance/ruby/hows-the-performance-of-ruby-3.0.0-preview1.html">clearly follows the methodology of my 3.0.0-preview1 review</a>, of course. The main difference is that the Ruby branch was updated to the final release of 3.0.</p>

<p>Since I'm benchmarking with very old code for compatibility reasons, I hacked together <a href="https://github.com/noahgibbs/ruby/tree/new_fake_2_8">a fake branch of Ruby 3</a> that doesn't remove some of the deprecated features and reports its version number as 2.8 instead of 3.0. The branch includes all the new Ruby 3 code except for <a href="https://github.com/noahgibbs/ruby/commit/17f4f604254b50cdc2c43eb8264f8cbf42c4ce59">a recently-added per-thread deadlock detection feature</a> that replaced a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bit</a> I still needed for a deprecated feature. The per-thread deadlock detection feature isn't be used in my benchmark, especially because it didn't exist until after Ruby 2.7.</p>

<p>Here are those reverted features:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/assets/images/ruby_30_deprec.png" alt="A variety of Ruby 3.0.0 deprecations-turned-errors I Reverted - you can find them in the commits list on GitHub, too."></p>

<p>Using a hacked version of the latest Ruby with Rails 4.2 means there were several incompatible code chunks in ancient dependencies. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>I had to change tzinfo-1.2.3/lib/tzinfo/ruby<em>core</em>support.rb in its one-liner for "open_file". It was passing the options as a hash, not keywords. Ruby 3.0 keyword-passing changes broke this.</li>
<li>Discourse uses discourse/lib/freedom<em>patches/ams</em>include<em>without</em>root.rb, a horrible old monkeypatch for ActionModel 0.8/0.9, and it causes an infinite recursion. I made discourse/app/serializers/topic<em>list</em>item<em>serializer.rb's method last</em>poster_username return a static string, sidestepping the problem. Sigh.</li>
</ul>

<p>And a new hack, apparently due to something about my hideously-hacked Ruby 3.0 branch that lies about its version number:</p>

<ul>
<li>I had to rebuild BigDecimal 1.3.5 to remove three instances of rb<em>check</em>safe_obj() from the C extension code. Since safe mode isn't being used, it does nothing. But it also doesn't link correctly to the (no-op, only a warning) code.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are pretty trivial changes, so I shouldn't be unfairly benefiting or penalizing Ruby 3.0 compared to 2.6 or 2.7. The discourse change (probably the biggest for performance) was also made where it would affect every Ruby version, not just 3.0.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>First off, I <strong><em>did not</em></strong> see the occasional crashes with high numbers of threads, that <a href="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/rails/performance/ruby/hows-the-performance-of-ruby-3.0.0-preview1.html">I saw in Ruby 3.0.0-preview1</a>. I was worried they were because of my changes to the Ruby code, but apparently it was just that 3.0.0-preview1 wasn't the most stable prerelease. The final released Ruby 3.0 seems to be fine.</p>

<p>Second, when I initially ran 30 batches of 15,000 HTTP requests per batch... The performance numbers were nearly identical. 169.1 reqs/sec, 171.4 reqs/sec and 170.8 reqs/sec. Particularly for version 2.7 versus 3.0, that's well within the noise threshold, where the test is just saying "these look pretty much the same to me." They were within 0.6 requests/second of each other with a standard deviation of 1.39. That's basically identical.</p>

<p>So: Ruby 3.0.0-preview1 had been a few percentage points slower than 2.7. Tested to the same tolerances, Ruby 3.0.0's release version was <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> the same speed as 2.7.</p>

<p>I'm a glutton for punishment, so I started another VM instance and ran another 60 batches of 15,000 requests for each Ruby version.</p>

<p>Let's have a table for at least <em>some</em> visual variation, shall we?</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><td></td><th>Ruby 2.6.6</th><th>Ruby 2.7.1</th><th>Ruby 3.0.0</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Median Throughput</th><td>171.1</td><td>173.0</td><td>172.8</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Fastest Run of 60</th><td>174.5</td><td>175.5</td><td>176.4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Slowest Run of 60</th><td>168.6</td><td>171.3</td><td>169.2</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>This is once again well within the noise threshold. Ruby 3.0 has a <strong><em>tiny</em></strong> bit more variance than 2.7, but by so little that it could easily just be random. And none of these have <strong><em>much</em></strong> variance — nothing that would suggest the test is unstable or that it's getting lots of outliers and averaging them out. The 2.7 and 3.0 results are basically identical.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Ruby 3.0.0-preview1 was a tiny bit slower than 2.7. The release 3.0 is exactly the same speed as 2.7. Preview1 would also occasionally crash for me in a way that might have been the hackiness of my testing... But apparently wasn't. The release version of 3.0 had zero crashes during any of my testing. So I think preview1 was a bit unstable — it happens with prerelease versions sometimes.</p>

<p>Does that mean Ruby 3 failed in its promises? <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">I don't think so, personally</a>. But that's not what this article is about.</p>

<p>This article is asking "how is the Rails performance of Ruby 3.0.0?" And the answer is "exactly the same as Ruby 2.7.1, which is about two percent better than 2.6.6." You can <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2019/3/7/ruby-speed-roundup-20-through-26">get more historical perspective on that here</a>. The total comes to 1.75x the speed of (75% faster than) Ruby 2.0.0-p0.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/assets/images/RRBPerfHistory_720.png" alt="A graph showing the fast-then-slow gain of speed from Ruby 2.0.0-p0 to Ruby 2.7 and 3.0"></p>

<p>If you're into the low-level crunchy details of Ruby performance, <a href="https://fastruby.io/blog/tags/performance">FastRuby.io also has a whole category of performance posts</a> which you may enjoy.</p>

    <p>This is a pure 6510 assembly program for the Commodore 64 made by Bright Pixel in 2019, because why not.</p>

<p><img src="https://celso.io/assets/demo.gif?raw=true" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">C64</a> was a famous 8-bit machine in the 80s and the highest-selling single computer model ever.</p>

<p>Its hardware and architecture set it appart from other 8-bit personal computers at the time. Unlike most of the others, the C64 had dedicated advanced MOS chips for graphics and sprites (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_VIC-II">VIC-II</a>), sound (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6581">SID</a>), I/O (the CIA), and many others.</p>

<p>These chips were not only powerful for the time, but they could perform their tasks autonomously, independently of what the main CPU, a MOS technology 6510 microprocessor, was doing. For instance, the VIC-II could generate interrupts on automatic sprite collisions. The CPU and the other chips also shared common data and memory BUSes.</p>

<p>To cope with all these chips inside 64Kbytes of addressable memory, the C64 had something called memory overlay, in which different chips would access different physical data locations for the same memory address. For instance the $D000-$DFFF block could be used for RAM, I/O or access to Character ROM, by the CPU, depending on a $0001 setting. Chips would have to be turned on or off, or instructed to look for data at specific RAM/ROM locations all the time to make the most of the machine as a whole.</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/0430_-_C64_Mainboard_ASSY250407_RevB.jpg" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<p>This was impressive in the 80s, for a relatevily cheap mass-market personal computer.</p>

<p>Programming the C64 was more than a lot of fun, it was a form of art. Because of the way all this hardware was packed together, handling the machine meant knowing its memory map and registers by heart, and dominating quite a collection of tricks, some of which weren’t documented at all. What ended up being written for the C64 by the fervent community of developers all over the world went way beyond the imagination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Tramiel">Jack Tramiel</a>.</p>

<p>Today, in 2019, the cult is still alive. There are vast groups of developers still writing C64 games and demos, restoring and using old machines, or using emulators. The SID sound chip was so revolutionary that it still drives a community of chiptune artists <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/8-bit-symphony/8-bit-symphony-pro-double-orchestral-cd-of-8-bit-classics">all over</a> the world. The <a href="https://www.hvsc.c64.org/">High Voltage SID Collection</a> has more than 50,000 songs archived and growing.</p>

<p>At Bright Pixel, we like to go low-level, and we think that understanding how things work down there, even if we’re talking about a 40 years old machine, is enriching, helps us become better computer engineers and better problem solvers. This is especially important in a time when we’re flooded with hundreds of high-level frameworks that just “do the job.” Until they don’t.</p>

<p>This is a simple demo for the C64:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It was coded entirely in 6510 assembly.</li>
  <li>It makes use of the VIC-II graphics, character ROM and sprites.</li>
  <li>It plays music using the SID chip.</li>
  <li>Uses raster-based interrupts, perfectly timed.</li>
  <li>Implements a random number generator.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can download the source code for it in <a href="https://github.com/brpx/c64">this repository</a>, change it and run it a real machine or an emulator. The code is all annotated, and you can use the <a href="https://github.com/brpx/c64/issues">issue tracker</a> to ask us questions or make suggestions, we’ll be listening.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<h3 id="assembler">Assembler</h3>

<p>We used the <a href="http://theweb.dk/KickAssembler/">Kick Assembler</a> to build the PRG from the source. KA is still maintained up until today, with regular releases launched every couple of months. It supports <a href="http://www.unusedino.de/ec64/technical/aay/c64/brti.htm">MOS 65xx assembler</a>, macros, pseudo commands and has a couple of helpers to load SID and graphics files into memory. Unfortunately, you need Java to run it, but it’s worth the trouble.</p>

<p>Here’s the setup in OSX.</p>

<p>Install Java</p>

<div><div><pre><code>brew update
brew install homebrew/cask/java
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Install Kick Assembler</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl http://theweb.dk/KickAssembler/KickAssembler.zip -o /tmp/KickAssembler.zip
sudo unzip /tmp/KickAssembler.zip -d /usr/local/KickAssembler
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This should be the contents of /usr/local/KickAssembler/KickAss.cfg</p>



<p>And we have this alias in our ~/.bash_profile for convenience.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>alias kick="java -jar /usr/local/KickAssembler/KickAss.jar"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="c64-emulator">C64 emulator</h3>

<p>There are plenty of Commodore 64 emulators out there.</p>

<p><img src="https://celso.io/assets/emulator.png?raw=true" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/">VICE</a>, the Versatile Commodore Emulator, is a program that runs on a Unix, Win32, or Mac OS X machines and emulates the C64 (and every other 65xx Commodore machine too).</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.dirkwhoffmann.de/virtualc64/">VirtualC64</a> is an interesting alternative for OSX written from scratch using C++ and native Cocoa and provides a real-time graphical inspector of the CPU, Memory, and the other Chips, while it’s running.</li>
</ul>

<p>We used VICE. One more bash alias:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>alias c64="/Applications/x64.app/Contents/MacOS/x64"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>

<p>Debugging assembly when things go south can be challenging. Back in the 80s, debugging meant spending hours doing trial and error, rebooting the machine, reloading the code from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_Datasette">cassette</a> (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_1541">disk drive</a>, if you were lucky), and writing code to paper just in case you’d lose it in the process.</p>

<p>Luckily, now we have way better tools.</p>

<p><img src="https://celso.io/assets/debugger.png?raw=true" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/c64-debugger/">C64 65XE Debugger</a> is a C64 and Atari XL/XE code and memory debugger that works in real-time and embeds the VICE emulator in the same graphical interface. It allows you to see what’s happening with every chip, register, memory block; you can set breakpoints, run the program instruction by instruction, and see what’s happening right in the embedded emulator.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The VICE emulator <a href="http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/vice_12.html#SEC271">built-in monitor</a> can also be used to examine, disassemble, and assemble machine language programs, as well as debug them through breakpoints. It has loads of powerful features.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where were these tools in 1986?</p>

<h3 id="graphics">Graphics</h3>

<p>Dealing with graphics is a lot easier now too.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/micheldebree/retropixels">Retropixels</a> is a cross-platform command-line tool to convert any image to Commodore 64 graphical modes and file formats, including Koala (.kla or .koa), which is supported by the Kick Assembler load helpers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/Esshahn/spritemate">Spritemate</a> is an online browser-based Commodore 64 sprite editor and supports importing and exporting of the most common file formats, as well as direct Kick Assembler hexadecimal arrays.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sid-songs">SID songs</h3>

<p>SID is short for the MOS 6581/8580 Sound Interface Device, the programmable sound generator chip inside the C64.</p>

<p>A SID file (song.sid) is a special file format, later popularized by modern age SID Players and emulators, which contains both the data and the 6510 code necessary to play a music song on the SID chip.</p>

<p>Here are a few things you should know about SID and SID files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A SID file contains both the data and the code to play the music. The code must reside in a specific RAM address, specified inside the SID file, and changes from music to music, which means that if you want to use another .sid file with this demo, you need to make sure that:
    <ul>
      <li>It starts in the same memory address.</li>
      <li>You change the code accordingly if it doesn’t (advanced).</li>
      <li>It doesn’t overlap with the rest of the memory we need to run our program (Kick Assembler will warn you if it does). RAM is scarce and musics can be big.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You can check the SID file <a href="https://www.hvsc.de/download/C64Music/DOCUMENTS/SID_file_format.txt">specification here</a>.</li>
  <li>You should absolutely take a look at the <a href="https://www.hvsc.de/">High Voltage SID Collection</a> and this <a href="https://tamats.com/apps/sid/">SID player &amp; visualizer</a> (<a href="https://github.com/jagenjo/sidviz">github</a>) in javascript</li>
</ul>

<p>Kick Assembler has a helper script to load and parse a SID file directly into your project. <a href="http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/webhelp/content/ch12s03.html">loadSid()</a> places the song code and data in the proper RAM location while assembling, and provides the initialization and play subroutines which you can use with your code. Check <a href="http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/webhelp/content/ch12s03.html">here</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="other-resources">Other resources</h3>

<p>These are handy resources you can use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://sta.c64.org/cbm64mem.html">Commodore 64 memory map</a> explaining the functioning of all addresses, registers and memory blocks.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/">C64 Wiki</a> is the online bible of all things Commodore 64, including detailed information of how the hardware works.</li>
  <li>Not the bible, but <a href="https://codebase64.org/">Codebase64</a> is pretty good too.</li>
  <li>A Kick Assembler <a href="https://github.com/gryf/kickass-syntax-vim">syntax file</a> for Vim.</li>
  <li>Understanding the <a href="http://www.coding64.org/?p=164">character and bitmap</a> graphics modes, memory banks, and how the chips interact with each other.</li>
  <li>6510 CPU <a href="http://www.unusedino.de/ec64/technical/aay/c64/bmain.htm">instructions</a>.</li>
  <li>Great article explaining the VIC-II <a href="https://dustlayer.com/vic-ii/2013/4/26/vic-ii-for-beginners-screen-modes-cheaper-by-the-dozen">screen modes</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-code">The Code</h2>

<p>We’ve annotated the .asm sources with all the information you need to understand what we’re doing, why, and where to find more. You can start by looking at the main <a href="https://github.com/brpx/c64/blob/master/card.asm">card.asm</a> file and move from there.</p>

<p>To assemble the sources into an executable PRG file, all you need to do is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>java -jar /usr/local/KickAssembler/KickAss.jar card.asm
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the output should be something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://celso.io/assets/assembly.png?raw=true" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<p>Here’s a quick run through the main components of this little demo. Find the rest of the information in the <a href="https://github.com/brpx/c64/blob/master/card.asm">source</a> itself.</p>

<p><strong>Loading external files with Kick Assembler</strong></p>

<p>Kick Assembler has a couple of helpers to load known file formats into memory at assembly time. We’re using two of these, <a href="http://theweb.dk/KickAssembler/webhelp/content/ch12s02.html">LoadBinary()</a> and <a href="http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/webhelp/content/ch12s03.html">LoadSid()</a>.</p>

<p>LoadBinary is loading the Koala screen bitmaps we previously converted with <a href="https://github.com/micheldebree/retropixels">retropixels</a>, while LoadSid is loading the data and code to play the music.sid file. You can check the <a href="https://github.com/brpx/c64/blob/master/card.asm">code</a> to see how we handle the music playing and the screen bitmaps in memory.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>.var music = LoadSid("music.sid")
.var picture1 = LoadBinary("screen1.koa", BF_KOALA)
.var picture2 = LoadBinary("screen2.koa", BF_KOALA)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Setting and using the interrupts</strong></p>

<p>We’re using <a href="http://www.unusedino.de/ec64/technical/aay/c64/brti.htm">raster interrupts</a> with our demo. These interrupts trigger at specific scan lines that we set with $D012.</p>

<p>First, we need to turn on the interrupts and set the first one when the program starts. This is how:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// disable the interrupts
sei
// first interrupt will be irq1 at scan line 240
setupirq(240, irq1);
// interrupt control - enable all interrupts with $7b
lda #%01111011
sta $dc0d
// interrupt control register - enable raster interrupt with $81
lda #%10000001
sta $d01a
// enable interrupts now
cli
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Later we use the irq1 and irq2 interrupts.</p>

<p>irq1 is triggered at scanline 240, and we use it to change the VIC-II to text mode, scroll the bottom text message and play the music.</p>

<p>irq2 is triggered at scanline 10, and we use it to alternate between the two pictures by switching the VIC-II to bitmap mode and pointing it to the right memory banks.</p>

<p>Here’s irq1 from the <a href="https://github.com/brpx/c64/blob/master/card.asm">code</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>irq1:
    ack();
    // keep scrolling the bottom line
    jsr scroll_message
    // keep the music playing
    jsr music.play
    // jump to irq2 at line 10
    …</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust has taken the programming language world by storm. Since its 1.0 release in 2015, it has been one of the most loved programming languages with a loyal following of developers and contributors.</p><p>To learn why this language is favored so much between developers, we have started a new series on Rust in production. In it, we’ll interview people that have used Rust for significant projects: apps, services, startup MVPs, and others.</p><p>For the first installment of the series, we interview Michael Fey, VP of Engineering at <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>. Read further to find out why they chose Rust for their product, the benefits of Rust for security-centered applications, and what cool libraries you should look into if you’re developing something similar in Rust.</p><h3 id="could-you-tell-us-a-little-about-your-company-and-your-role-there%3F">Could you tell us a little about your company and your role there?</h3><p>1Password is a password manager trusted by millions of people and 70,000 businesses to secure their sensitive data. It remembers all your passwords so you don’t have to, and comes with apps for all major browsers, plus desktop and mobile.</p><p>I am the VP of Engineering for Client Apps here at 1Password. If you have ever had the pleasure to use 1Password on your Mac, Windows PC, iPhone, iPad, Android phone, or tablet, or in your browser, then you’ve been lucky enough to use something my team has built. We’ve been around since 2004, and we take a lot of pride in building a well-crafted experience and keeping people safe online.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/xa/xarnasmy.111_(5).jpg" alt="Michael Fey" loading="lazy"></p><h3 id="can-you-talk-about-the-stack-of-1password%3F-how-big-a-part-of-your-codebase-is-written-in-rust%3F">Can you talk about the stack of 1Password? How big a part of your codebase is written in Rust?</h3><p>We’ve been using Rust in production at 1Password for a few years now. Our Windows team was the frontrunner on this effort to the point where about 70% of 1Password 7 for Windows is written in Rust. We also ported the 1Password Brain – the engine that powers our browser filling logic – from Go to Rust at the end of 2019 so that we could take advantage of the speed and performance of deploying Rust to WebAssembly in our browser extension.</p><p>These have been in production for the last few years and we’ve seen great success. So much so that we’re now in the midst of a complete rewrite of nearly our entire product lineup, and Rust is a major part of that story. We are using Rust to create a headless 1Password app that encompasses all of the business logic, cryptography, database access, server communication, and more wrapped in a thin UI layer that is native to the system on which we’re deploying.</p><h3 id="did-any-of-rust%E2%80%99s-advantages-like-speed-or-type%2Fmemory-safety-influence-the-choice-of-using-rust-for-1password%3F">Did any of Rust’s advantages like speed or type/memory-safety influence the choice of using Rust for 1Password?</h3><p>One of the main things that drew us to Rust initially was the memory safety; it definitely excites us knowing that Rust helps us maximize our confidence in the safety of our customers’ secrets. Beyond memory safety, though, there’s so much more we love about the Rust ecosystem. There is a significant performance benefit to the lack of a traditional runtime; we don’t have to worry about the overhead of a garbage collector, for instance. Rust offers a form of “program correctness” and many guarantees against undefined behaviour at runtime. The strong type system enforces these rules at compile-time. Carefully aligning application logic with Rust’s strong type rules makes APIs difficult to use incorrectly and results in simpler code that’s free from runtime checking of constraints and invariants; the compiler can guarantee there are no invalid runtime code paths that will lead your program astray before it executes. Having to perform less runtime state validation leads to cleaner, more efficient, more focused, and higher quality code. Rust requires very little runtime debugging compared to other languages. If it compiles, you can be fairly sure it won’t exhibit unexpected behaviour. It may not be what you <em>want</em> but it will be “correct”. 🙂</p><p>Another very powerful (and often overlooked) feature of Rust is its procedural macro system, which has allowed us to write a tool that automatically shares types defined in Rust with our client-side languages (Swift, Kotlin, and TypeScript). The output from this tool handles the serialization/deserialization process automatically, meaning our client-side devs can continue to work in their language of choice while interacting with the Rust library and can be free from the concerns of JSON parsing over the foreign function interface (FFI). We get all of this while enjoying the benefits of compile-time type checking in every one of our target languages. We’ve integrated this tool into our continuous integration server as well, meaning that changes to the Rust models can result in compilation failures in the client applications that are caught during our review process.</p><p>This tool has been an integral component in our development process, allowing us to move much more quickly than ever before. Once our types are defined in Rust, we are able to immediately generate equivalent types in our client-side languages. This allows our devs to focus on solving problems without having to hand-roll boilerplate code to communicate over the FFI.</p><h3 id="how-good-is-rust%E2%80%99s-support-(library-and-otherwise)-for-developing-security-centric-applications-like-1password%3F">How good is Rust’s support (library and otherwise) for developing security-centric applications like 1Password?</h3><p>There is more than enough to build a majority of the base that security-centered applications require. There are two large, prominent cryptography platforms (<em><a href="https://github.com/briansmith/ring">ring</a></em> and the <a href="https://github.com/RustCrypto">Rust Crypto</a> group) that together provide a wealth of functionality. As I mentioned above, writing with Rust itself gives you much greater confidence in your memory usage and makes it much harder to accidentally introduce a memory-related exploit into your application. There is also a wonderful system in place for keeping track of vulnerabilities that do show up from time to time in Rust crates: the <a href="https://rustsec.org/">RustSec</a> database, which is community-sourced by other Rust developers and is updated frequently with new information that can be consumed in CI audit scans. The batteries-included test framework that Rust and Cargo also include mean that you always have an easy way to write unit-test suites for correct behavior in critical code, like any cryptographic functions that you write.</p><p>While safe native Rust libraries for everything are the dream (and they will come in time), there is always the option to dip down and easily consume something in C or from native platform libraries. We use this to great effect in our Rust code for things like calling out to the native implementations of biometric unlock (Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello) and platform-specific settings implementations like NSUserDefaults on Apple platforms.</p><h3 id="any-particular-rust-libraries-that-you-want-to-feature%3F">Any particular Rust libraries that you want to feature?</h3><p>Absolutely. Tokio, Hyper/Reqwest, Ring, and Neon all have a home in 1Password and are fundamental in allowing us to tackle this ambitious project at all. You should also check out our <a href="https://crates.io/crates/password-rules-parser">password-rules-parser</a> on <a href="http://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, which is based on a spec primarily being backed by Apple. Their tools and docs can be found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/password-rules/">here</a>.</p><h3 id="where-is-rust-great-to-use%2C-and-where-does-it-fall-short-in-your-stack%3F">Where is Rust great to use, and where does it fall short in your stack?</h3><p>Rust has fulfilled 90% of what we were hoping for when we started this project. We’ve been able to deploy it to nearly every one of our target platforms in some way shape or form (with the exception of Apple Watch). The language itself has been designed with modern sensibilities and is improving with every release. It has great documentation and an active community.</p><p>Although there are countless crates available for use, we did have to roll our own logging and tracing tools to ensure that they were safe to use in 1Password. Additionally, we constructed a substantial localization implementation to meet the requirements of our products.</p><p>It did fall short for us in one key area: We were hoping WebAssembly would take us further in the browser and our browser extension than it has. WebAssembly has been great as a function library, but attempting to stand up an entire runtime in WASM has been a challenge. Many of the issues we ran into, however, were not limitations of Rust but of WebAssembly as a deployment platform.</p><h3 id="what-was-the-biggest-challenge-while-developing-1password-with-rust%3F">What was the biggest challenge while developing 1Password with Rust?</h3><p>Many of the folks on our team were new to Rust, and they experienced the typical learning curve that comes with its memory management and ownership model. We are also finding the compile times to be pretty beefy; our CPUs and fans are definitely getting a workout. 😄</p><h3 id="are-you-satisfied-with-the-result%3F">Are you satisfied with the result?</h3><p>Absolutely.</p><p>If you’re new to Rust, start small and build on top of that. We ran a large number of experiments when we were getting started to try and find the edges of what a Rust-based solution could provide. When your experiments pan out, try to reimagine the ways you used to work with other languages and see if your code can benefit from Rust’s philosophy.</p><p>If you’re new to 1Password, you can <a href="https://start.1password.com/sign-up/plan?c=1PCORE2021">sign up today with this link</a> and save 50% off your first year for family and individual accounts.

		<blockquote>
<p>We have made Arm servers&nbsp;boring.</p>
<p>Jon&nbsp;Masters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Standards are boring. Satisfied users may not want to migrate to other boards
the market tries to sell&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>So Arm market is flooded with piles of small board computers (<span>SBC</span>). Often they
are compliant to standards only when it comes to&nbsp;connectors.</p>
<h3>But our hardware is not&nbsp;standard</h3>
<p>It is not a matter of ‘let produce <span>UEFI</span> ready hardware’ but rather ‘let write
<span>EDK2</span> firmware for boards we already&nbsp;have’.</p>
<p>Look at Raspberry/Pi then. It is shitty hardware but got popular. And group of
people wrote <span>UEFI</span> firmware for it. Probably without vendor support&nbsp;even.</p>
<h3>Start with <span>EBBR</span></h3>
<p>Each new board should be <span>EBBR</span> compliant at start. Which is easy — do ‘whatever
hardware’ and put properly configured U-Boot on it. Upstreaming support for your
small device should not be hard as you often base on some already existing&nbsp;hardware.</p>
<p>Add <span>16MB</span> of <span>SPI</span> flash to store firmware. Your users will be able to boot <span>ISO</span>
without wondering where on boot media they need to write&nbsp;bootloaders.</p>
<p>Then work on <span>EDK2</span> for board. Do <span>SMBIOS</span> (easy) and keep your existing Device
Tree.  You are still <span>EBBR</span>. Remember about upstreaming your work — some people
will complain, some will improve your&nbsp;code.</p>
<h3>Add <span>ACPI</span>, go <span>SBBR</span></h3>
<p>Next step is moving from Device Tree to <span>ACPI</span>. May take some time to understand
why there are so many tables and what <span>ASL</span> is. But as several other systems show
it can be&nbsp;done.</p>
<p>And this brings you to <span>SBBR</span> compliance. Or SystemReady <span>ES</span> if you like&nbsp;marketing.</p>
<h3><span>SBSA</span> for future&nbsp;design</h3>
<p>Doing new SoC tends to be “let us take previous one and improve a bit”. So this
time change it a bit and make your next SoC compliant with <span>SBSA</span> level 3. All
needed components are probably already included in your Arm&nbsp;license.</p>
<p>Grab <span>EDK2</span> support you did for previous board. Look at <span>QEMU</span> <span>SBSA</span> Reference
Platform support, look at other <span>SBSA</span> compliant hardware. Copy, reuse their
drivers, their&nbsp;code.</p>
<h3>Was it&nbsp;worth?</h3>
<p>At the end you will have <span>SBSA</span> compliant hardware running <span>SBBR</span> compliant&nbsp;firmware. </p>
<p>Congratulations, your board is SystemReady <span>SR</span> compliant. Your marketing team may
write that you are on same list as Ampere with their Altra&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>Users buy your hardware and can install whatever <span>BSD</span>, Linux distribution they
want. Some will experiment with Microsoft Windows. Others may work on porting
Haiku or other exotic operating&nbsp;system. </p>
<p>But none of them will have to think “how to get this shit running”. And they
will tell friends that your device is as boring as it should be when it comes to
running <span>OS</span> on it == more&nbsp;sales.</p>

January 20, 2021 | https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>During a recent “Zoom” lecture a student asked me a question about outliers. In the process of answering I realized something that I knew was true but had never seen explained in any sources. This post is my first attempt to develop an <strong>analogy that connects least squares methods, like regression or PCA, to physical intuition about springs or elastics</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-simplest-version">The simplest version</h2>
<p>To illustrate I will use data from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/index.html">gapminder</a> conveniently provided in an R package by Jenny Bryan. Consider these two variables in the dataset, GDP per capita and life expectancy, plotted here in a standard scatterplot:</p>
<p><img src="https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/least-squares-as-springs_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="624"></p>
<p>(To have a less busy plot, one with fewer points, I’ve subsetted the data to the year 2007 and countries in Asia).</p>
<p>Now we’re going to bring physical intuition into this by imagining these points as physical objects. For example, we can interpret the mean <span>\((\bar x, \bar y)\)</span> = 6252.7, 70.7 as the center of mass (if we assume every point has the same mass). This is the larger, blue point in the plot above. It’s not really important to think of mass specifically, just that this point is the center of the physical ensemble.</p>
<p>We need a few simple rules for our physical system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing the data is not allowed, i.e.&nbsp;the points are immovable.</li>
<li>For methods like regression (or PCA), we imagine a rigid object like a line (or hyperplane, in multiple regression) passing through the points, and the points exerting some force that changes the position of this body</li>
<li>If these methods use the standard least squares loss function then this force can be represented by springs or elastics, all of the same length and strength, attached at one end to the points and on the other end to the line (or hyperplane).</li>
</ul>
<p>This line (or hyperplane) may bounce around at first as the springs pull it toward their anchoring points, but eventually it settles into an equilibrium where the forces from all the opposing springs are balanced out. In this equilibrium state we have two immediate consequences:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The rigid object (line or hyperplane) <em>must pass through the center point</em>. If it did not, there would be a net force acting on the object pulling it toward the center point, hence it would not yet be at equilibrium. In other words, all of the forces that would <em>shift</em> the object are exactly balanced out so it does not shift.</li>
<li>The same is true about <em>torques</em>, all of the forces that would <em>rotate</em> the object are balanced out.</li>
</ol>
<p>For regression we need one more rule: the springs are guided so they only pull in directions aligned with the axis of the outcome variable, i.e.&nbsp;“vertically.” Let’s call this the <strong>vertical rule</strong> for reference later.</p>
<p>Here is our simple example in picture form:</p>
<p><img src="https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/least-squares-as-springs_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="624"></p>
<p>(To create this plot I have copied the <code>geom_spring</code> example by <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasp85/status/1331338379636649986">Thomas Lin Pedersen</a> from (the new version of!) the <a href="https://ggplot2-book.org/spring1.html">ggplot2 book</a>).</p>
<p>If you are not immediately convinced that this intuition pays off, consider the issue that motivated me to think of this in the first place: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influential_observation">influential outliers</a>, points with high “leverage” in the statistical sense. The definition of statistical leverage is a bit complicated. But we can get the right intuition about it from a physical sense rather than those formal definitions. See the point in the bottom left of the plot above? Since it is pulling closer to the end of the line it has more leverage in the actual <em>physical</em> sense. This is the explanation I prefer to give students who aren’t taking a mathematical statistics course.</p>
<p>(In case you’re wondering, that point is Afghanistan, a nation where the United States remains at war for almost two decades now…)</p>
<p>Let’s see what happens when we move this one point so its leverage is being used to rotate the line clockwise instead of counter-clockwise. The old regression line, before this change, is shown as a faded line below for comparison.</p>
<p><img src="https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/least-squares-as-springs_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="624"></p>
<p>Notice the following changes: the center of mass has shifted a little, the point we moved is now a greater distance from the line so its force is larger, and the line has rotated noticeably due to the influence of this one point, even though our dataset has over 30 points, because that point has a lot of leverage.</p>
<h3 id="hookes-law">Hooke’s law</h3>
<p>Is this intuition correct? Can we really think of least squares solutions (e.g.&nbsp;regression lines) as the equilibrium of a system of springs? Yes, or elastic rubber bands, or any material with linear elasticity, i.e.&nbsp;that follows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke's_law">Hooke’s law</a>. Let’s consider how to apply this to regression, where for each point <span>\((x_i, y_i)\)</span> in the data, the spring attaches to the regression line at the point <span>\((x_i, \hat y_i)\)</span>. So the spring is stretched to a length of <span>\(|r_i| = |y_i - \hat y_i|\)</span>, and Hooke’s law says each spring is pulling on the line with a force proportional to this distance.</p>
<p>When the system of the line and springs has stopped moving and settled into an equilibrium, this equilibrium position minimizes the <em>energy</em> of the system, which in this case is just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#Potential_energy_for_a_linear_spring">potential energy</a>. The potential energy stored in a spring that is stretched a certain distance is the integral of the force over that distance, and since the force scales with the distance this means the energy scales with the squared distance. Hence, the equilibrium of this physical system <strong>minimizes the total potential energy</strong>:</p>
<p><span>\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{2}k |r_i|^2 = \frac{1}{2}k \sum_{i=1}^n  (y_i - \hat y_i)^2
\]</span> where <span>\(k &gt; 0\)</span> is the spring “stiffness” constant. The line that minimizes this is the same as the least squares regression line because the constants in front don’t change the minimizer. This argument works just as well for multiple regression as simple regression, even if we can’t visualize the higher dimensional plots involved. We can still think of springs that are pulling, perpendicular to the <span>\(y\)</span>-axis, on a hyperplane. In this case there can be torques in various different hyperplanes passing through the center of mass but they’re all balanced out, so the hyperplane doesn’t get “tilted” in any direction (if it’s in equilibrium).</p>
<h2 id="principal-components-analysis">Principal components analysis</h2>
<p>Although PCA is often considered a more advanced topic than (simple) regression, its justification in our physical analogy is actually simpler. All we need to do is drop the <strong>vertical rule</strong> that was required for regression. In this case, the springs are allowed to rotate their angle of departure from the points, and their position of attachment to the line (or hyperplane) can slide to accommodate this change in angle. This results in an equilibrium where the springs are stretched as little possible. The total potential energy reaches a lower value because the springs are no longer constrained in which direction they can pull.</p>
<p><img src="https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/least-squares-as-springs_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="624"></p>
<p>I’ve plotted the line in a different color to emphasize that it’s <a href="https://benediktehinger.de/blog/science/scatterplots-regression-lines-and-the-first-principal-component/"><strong>not</strong> the regression line</a>. Notice that the springs are no longer pulling vertically, instead they connect to the line at the point on the line which is <em>nearest</em> (as measured by overall distance, not just distance in the <span>\(y\)</span>-coordinate alone).</p>
<p>(This is also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_least_squares">total least squares</a> or a special case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deming_regression">Deming regression</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="model-complexityelasticity-machine-learning-or-ai">Model complexity/elasticity: machine learning or AI</h2>
<p>We can keep building on this analogy by using it to understand more complex modeling methods with another very simple idea: <strong>elasticity of the model object itself</strong>. Instead of a rigid body like a line (or hyperplane), if we imagine it’s made of an elastic material that can be (locally) stretched and deformed then we can get more complex types of regression models.</p>
<p>In this analogy, simpler models like linear regression correspond to more rigid objects like an unbendable metal stick, and more complex models allow flexibility or elasticity when fitting the conditional expectation function like a bendable plastic stick, a rubber band, or even a tensionless string in the most complex case where the model is allowed to fit the points perfectly.</p>
<p>For example, here’s the local polynomial regression method (<code>loess</code>) used by default in the <code>ggplot</code> function <code>stat_smooth</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/least-squares-as-springs_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="624" data-distill-preview="1"></p>
<p>This intuition is not only useful for learning the basic ideas of model complexity and machine learning, it can even be used for cutting-edge research. For example see this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06943">recent paper</a> on elasticity in neural networks (by my friend Weijie Su and his coauthor!)</p>
<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>I think there’s a lot of <em>potential</em> here for statistics education, especially for younger students. It wouldn’t be too difficult to create a physical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_machine">classroom demonstration</a> using springs or elastics, especially for the PCA case since that wouldn’t require any guiding tracks to constraint the force direction to be vertical.</p>
<p>I also need to teach myself some more advanced plotting to <code>gganimate</code> these examples. If I succeed I’ll update this page.</p>
<h2 id="references">References</h2>
<p>I was surprised by how difficult it was to find any references for this elementary idea that provides physical intuition for such an important method as least squares regression. If you’re aware of any others please contact me because I would be glad to know of them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
              <p>It is 1996. Your boss asks you to set up a business intelligence team. You sit through a bunch of meetings with system integrators, before picking one who promises to deliver your system on time and under budget. They deliver it two years late and a million dollars over budget. Oh well. Your data engineers create and manage data pipelines from your ERP systems, and your data analysts use OLAP cubes to do ad-hoc analyses for businesspeople.</p><p>It is 2006. Your boss asks you to set up a business intelligence team. You sit through a couple of vendor meetings, before deciding to go all in on the Tableau ecosystem. You hire a small team of data engineers, who set up and then maintain ETL pipelines from your source systems to your data warehouse. They use Ralph Kimball’s dimensional data modeling to transform that data during the ETL step. It’s a lot of work. Your data analysts then copy slivers of that transformed data and perform their analyses on Tableau software running on their own laptops.</p><p>It is 2018. Your boss asks you to set up a business intelligence team. You don’t bother hiring a data engineer. Instead, you set up a sales call with <a href="https://fivetran.com/">Fivetran</a>, and take out your corporate credit card when they ask you to pay for their software. This allows you to pull data from your other cloud software vendors — software services like Salesforce and Mixpanel and Stripe — which you dump into a cloud-based columnar database. You borrow Steve from product engineering for a few weeks to do this. He sets up <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a>. You take dbt and use it transform all that data you have in your data warehouse. You release Steve back to his product team shortly after.</p><p>Your data analysts spend their time modeling data, writing tests for said data, and documenting your datasets. They try as much as possible to enable business users to find and manipulate the data for themselves. They’re able to do this because you’ve decided on a tool like Holistics or Metabase or Redash to connect to your cloud data warehouse. Those tools enable easy dashboard and report creation, along with the ability to create and share explorable data marts.</p><p>One day, one of your data analysts comes up to you. “You know,” she says. “This is the first analytics job where things feel different. I’m not dealing with data extracts in Tableau. I’m also not talking to data engineers as much, mostly because all of the data I need is dumped into one data warehouse — I just use dbt.”</p><p>“That’s great!” you say, “What’s the problem?”</p><p>“So I’m spending all this time writing data modeling code, and writing documentation for our data marts and models, and creating dbt tests, and so I don’t spend that much time in raw SQL as much anymore. That worries me.”</p><p>“Why does it worry you?”</p><p>“Well my friends in banks and other companies are still dealing with SQL and data extracts and Tableau visualizations. Sometimes their bosses tell them to go write some longass query and generate a CSV for a VP to inspect. And I’m not doing any of those things. I’m doing this weird set of activities. What if I become unhireable?”</p><p>“Oh,” you say. “Hmm.”</p><p>Your data analyst folds her arms and leans against the door to your office. She watches your face carefully.</p><p>“I guess —“ you say, thinking back to all the previous systems that you’ve watched over, “Well, I guess … maybe this is the data analyst job of the future.”</p><p>And that’s how we got here.</p><p>Two years ago, a bunch of people decided to give this role a new name. They noticed that their jobs had changed, and that the set of things that they produced was strikingly different from all the data analyst roles they’d been in in the past.</p><p>They decided to call this new job ‘analytics engineer’; as opposed to ‘data analyst’.</p><p>Thus, the topic of this blog post.</p><h2 id="the-birth-of-a-new-role">The Birth of a New Role</h2><p>The creation of a new role can be <em>incredibly</em> messy. Back in 2010, I distinctively remember jokes about how ‘data scientist’ just meant ‘overglorified statistician’. It took us a while before we collectively understood that ‘data scientist’ meant ‘someone with more software engineering ability than a statistician, and with more statistical knowledge than a software engineer.’</p><p>Even today, however, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">Wikipedia page on data science</a> sports a line reading “There is still no consensus on the definition of data science, and it is considered by some to be a buzzword.”</p><figure><img src="https://www.holistics.io/blog/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-13-at-11.27.35-PM.510c339bb8c7405ba1faaba1473c3ff6.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.holistics.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-13-at-11.27.35-PM.510c339bb8c7405ba1faaba1473c3ff6.png 600w, https://www.holistics.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-13-at-11.27.35-PM.510c339bb8c7405ba1faaba1473c3ff6.png 1000w, https://www.holistics.io/blog/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-13-at-11.27.35-PM.510c339bb8c7405ba1faaba1473c3ff6.png 1066w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>We should expect things to be equally messy with analytics engineering.</p><p>It’s worth taking a step back to ask: <em>why</em> come up with a new name for a new role? Why not just call &nbsp;it ‘data analyst’ and be done with it? After all, it is simply the shape of the job that has changed; the outcomes are still identical — data analysts and analytics engineers alike exist to provide business managers with the numbers they need for their decisions. Sure, analytics engineers do different things in their jobs when compared to data analysts, but what they do is very much influenced by the tools and technologies that are available to them.</p><p>There are three reasons for this. (There are probably more, but these three are mine).</p><p>First, because analytics engineers and data analysts do different things, it is useful — from a signalling standpoint — to differentiate between the two kinds of jobs. Companies that use a contemporary data stack are likely to want a different sort of data professional compared to companies that work with data extracts and Tableau. Similarly, analytics engineers who write and maintain data models and data tests would likely want to learn different things compared to data analysts who spend their time arguing with data engineers over their last batch of ETL pipeline requests. A new name allows these professionals to find each other, in what is an already crowded industry.</p><p>This is a good thing.</p><p>Second, analytics engineering requires a different <em>organizational shape</em>. Notice how there’s less reliance on data engineering with contemporary data stacks. Notice also that analytics engineering work is defined by higher-leverage activities: things like creating reusable data models, documenting and surfacing data resources within the business, or building systems to catch bad data early. This is by design: many of the tools that define today’s data landscape were <a href="https://www.holistics.io/books/setup-analytics/data-servicing-a-tale-of-three-jobs/">built in response</a> to the pains of previous generations of data tools; they enable and encourage a higher leverage set of activities.</p><p>The implication here is that a data team that consists of analytical engineers will have to be run differently from a team that consists of the typical ‘data analyst, data engineer, and data scientist’ triptych. It is useful to know that this is the case; calling this out under a different name will make it easier to talk about the organizational changes that companies would need to make when hiring for analytics engineers.</p><p>For instance, the career path for an analytics engineer is likely to be different to that of a data analyst — since the analytics engineer does higher impact things, and is no longer exclusively a junior role. Second, the nature of analytics engineering means that the hiring practices around a data team must change as well; in the dbt blog post about analytics engineering, for instance, Claire Caroll <a href="https://blog.getdbt.com/what-is-an-analytics-engineer/">writes</a>:</p><blockquote>It turns out, your company can get pretty far with a single analytics engineer working as a data team of one supporting a whole business. But for those companies that need a larger data team, how does this team structure scale? Do you simply hire another analytics engineers? Or do you diversify?<p>In our experience, we see team members start to become more specialized, with roles that align more closely with those that we started with. Depending on your needs your next hire may be a data engineer, or a data analyst.</p></blockquote><p>Third and finally, analytics engineering is simply a good excuse for data vendors to reposition themselves. This is good ol’ enterprise marketing, and it is ultimately why so many companies are talking about analytics engineering today (ourselves included!)</p><p>The logic is as follows: you are a BI tool vendor, and you want to stand out from the incumbents. What do you do? The answer: you invent a new category, and then you position yourself as one of the first companies to serve that category.</p><p>Michael Kaminsky wrote <a href="https://locallyoptimistic.com/post/analytics-engineer/">The Analytics Engineer</a> in January of 2019. In October the same year, Claire Carroll of dbt wrote <a href="https://blog.getdbt.com/what-is-an-analytics-engineer/">When did analytics engineering become a thing? And why?</a>. Shortly afterwards, dbt repositioned their entire company to become ‘the analytics engineering workflow tool’, a position that has continued till today:</p><figure><img src="https://www.holistics.io/blog/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-14-at-1.46.00-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.holistics.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-14-at-1.46.00-AM.png 600w, https://www.holistics.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-14-at-1.46.00-AM.png 1000w, https://www.holistics.io/blog/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-14-at-1.46.00-AM.png 1214w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It was perhaps questionable if ‘analytics engineering’ really <em>was</em> a thing in 2019. Sure, the ideas existed in the zeitgeist, but we at Holistics were more familiar with the term ‘dataops’ as a placeholder for these ideas. In 2020, however, the folks at dbt ran <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/coalesce">Coalesce</a>, a conference on analytics engineering; they also raised 12.9 million dollars to accelerate this trend. The ideas behind ‘dataops’ seemed to have been subsumed into ‘analytics engineering’ in the months since.</p><p>dbt’s positioning is ultimately why I think analytics engineering will become a thing: they are absolutely motivated to <em>create the category</em>. This is both good marketing, and — to their credit — a good name for a wave that truly exists.</p><p>Now we just have to figure out what it all actually means.</p><h2 id="what-exactly-is-analytics-engineering">What <em>Exactly</em> is Analytics Engineering?</h2><p>The honest truth is that we just don’t know.</p><p>In his original blog post on <a href="https://locallyoptimistic.com/post/analytics-engineer/">The Analytics Engineer</a>, Michael Kaminsky wrote:</p><blockquote>While data scientists and analysts are writing a lot of code, being great software engineers isn’t what they’ve been trained for and it often isn’t their first priority. Similarly, while data engineers are great software engineers, they don’t have training in how they data are actually used and so can’t always partner effectively with analysts and data scientists.<p>I believe this gap should be filled in by analytics engineers.

January 20, 2021 | http://www.lambdabytes.io/posts/codertodev/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.lambdabytes.io/posts/codertodev/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="article">
        <p>Today I read the great article <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/crossover-project/are-we-really-engineers/">Are we really engineers?</a> which reminded me about the difference I make between <em>Coder</em> and <em>Developer</em> which in turn made me reflect the question of <em>When do students become Developers?</em></p>
<p>To me, a <em>Coder</em> is someone, who… codes. It is all about cracking out many lines of code and about getting stuff done without too much thinking about architecture and code design. A <em>Developer</em> on the other hand codes but puts also a lot of thought and hard work into architecture and code design. I don’t want to start a flamewar over these exact definitions - I know people call themselves <em>Coders</em> and are what I call <em>Developers</em> and vice versa; that is not my point, I just needed two names to distinguish between these two kinds of archetypes.</p>
<p>Now it seems that in recent years the demand for what I call <em>Coders</em> has gone up substantially which is directly reflected in the education programmes offered: there are a huge number of coding schools both online and also local (real) ones, competing for students. What they teach is <em>coding</em> (it sounds so much cooler than programming, doesn’t it?) in a hip language such as Python.</p>
<p>In my opinion the increasing demand has two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The AI hype in the few last years seems to have caused the impression that <em>everyone has to learn how to code</em> because then <em>everyone has the power of AI at their fingertips</em> which will ultimately <em>magically solve all of mankinds problems</em>.</li>
<li>The industry longs for cheap and readily available workforce to <em>satisfy the AI hype</em> and also <em>simply do the coding</em> of whatever solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>This reminds me of a quote attributed to the great Edsger Dijkstra: <em>Industry suffers from the managerial dogma that for the sake of stability and continuity, the company should be independent of the competence of individual employees. Hence industry rejects any methodological proposal that can be viewed as making intellectual demands on their workers.</em></p>
<p>This is, of course wishful thinking, which would fail horribly - at least for Software Engineering (SE). When we regard <a href="http://www.lambdabytes.io/posts/selearning">SE as a learning process</a>, where the shared learning of a team is a core investment, then striving for cheap workforce which can be easily replaced is not going to work. Yes, there are problems which can be solved by cheap workforce “Coders” but they are (hopefully) not your core domain - these problems can be solved by tools / 3rd party frameworks / libraries, outsourced or even implemented by AI ;)</p>
<p>Now contrast this with a “formal” bachelor computer science degree. Coding is basically what students learn in the first 2-3 semesters - therefore, after 2-3 semesters we can regard students as <em>Coders</em>. However in a <strong>real</strong> CS degree students <strong>must not</strong> stop there and in the remaining 3-4 semesters they <strong>have to</strong> make the step towards <em>Developers</em>. Why? Because a proper CS education is more than <em>coding</em>, it is in the end all about concepts and abstractions. Coding is merely a means to an end to explore and express these fundamental concepts and abstractions: architectures, tactical (code) design, design patterns, cohesion, coupling,… Therfore, <em>coding</em> is just a means to an end but it is certainly not a means to an end in itself.</p>
<p>Generally, the tremendously important <strong>initiation rite</strong> from <em>Coder to Developer</em> happens between the 3rd and 4th semester in a larger SE project where students develop a non-trivial (web-based) business solution for a fake customer in groups of around 5 people. It is there, where they are subjected to proper code design such as DDD, design patterns, various architectures, all within a proper (agile) development process with proper treatment of requirements (User Stories,…). Although what students learn in this initiation rite is only a tip of the iceberg, of which they will explore much more when they finally start working in the industry, it is this very first exposure which causes an everlasting change in their thinking and approach to writing software.</p>
<p>Just as every disruptive initiaton rite, it has a deeply transformative effect, changing the student <em>From Coder to Developer</em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I spent a good part of my career in the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) space (g'day Atlassian Bamboo, hello Bitbucket Pipelines 👋). One thing that was clear to me when we built Tability is that we'd have to borrow some ideas from Engineering to solve the OKRs problem.</p><h2>Wait, what's the problem with OKRs?</h2><p>I&nbsp;highly recommend Christina Wodtke's book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Radical-Focus-Achieving-Important-Objectives-ebook/dp/B01BFKJA0Y">Radical Focus</a>, as it illustrates one of the common pitfalls of OKRs: people forget.</p><p>Here's how the story goes. A team has grown past the point where the founders can keep track of everything. They start looking for a better way to organize work. They hear/read about OKRs. They love it! They define the first set of OKRs, put it all in a spreadsheet. Everyone is excited. They start working on the top priorities.</p><p>A month later: no one can remember what the OKRs were, and folks are going in different directions again. They put all their efforts into planning and forgot to define a way to track progress.</p><h2>Out of sight, out of mind.</h2><p>Work is paradoxically a powerful generator of distractions. Every project seems to be growing a set of extra features, becoming a giant squid holding the team hostage. Every week is producing dozens of calls, hundreds of emails, taking your attention away from your main priorities. Every task has its own&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns#:~:text=Unknown%20unknowns">unknown unknows</a>&nbsp;taking you down the rabbit hole.</p><p>So, coming back to our OKRs, they're doomed to fail unless we have some sort of framework in place to support them. Not because the team won't care, but because the team won't have the time to think about it —&nbsp;unless we push it back to them.</p><h2>CI/CD principles to the rescue</h2><p>Here's a definition of Continuous Integration taken from Martin Fowler's website.<em>‍</em></p><blockquote><em>Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly.</em>‍</blockquote><p>Right — this is super tech-centric. So this is not so much about enabling CI in your spreadsheets but more about understanding why it's a popular approach to software development.</p><p>Product teams around the world have adopted CI/CD because they realized that fast iterations produce much better results than doing some grandiose planning with a waterfall approach to delivery. Checking progress early and often reduces the cost of being wrong and allows you to validate your direction by getting feedback from your customers.</p><p>Things get even more interesting when you look at the 5 principles of Continuous Delivery&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://continuousdelivery.com/principles/">published by Jez Humble</a>:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Build quality in</li><li>Work in small batches</li><li>Computers perform repetitive tasks, people solve problems</li><li>Relentlessly pursue continuous improvement</li><li>Everyone is responsible</li></ol><p>I absolutely believe that you can and should apply these principle to the OKRs process.</p><h2>The 5 principles of OKRs</h2><h3>Build quality in</h3><blockquote>"It's much cheaper to fix problems and defects if we find them immediately"</blockquote><p>Don't wait until the end of the quarter to realize that one of your Key Results has gone off-track. A daily rhythm for OKRs is too much, but you should check progress on your Key Results every week (ideally a Monday to refresh things after the weekend). Get on top of every KR that has been in the red for more than 2 weeks.</p><h3>Work in small batches</h3><blockquote>"It reduces the time it takes to get feedback on our work, makes it easier to triage and remediate problems, increases efficiency and motivation, and prevents us from succumbing to the sunk cost fallacy."</blockquote><p>Phrases like "we can't track progress before next month" are red flags. The work done to make progress on the Key Results should start producing an impact in a matter of weeks and not months. &nbsp;Don't go for big bangs. Do your best to get incremental progress through the quarter.</p><h3>Computers perform repetitive tasks, people solve problems</h3><blockquote>"The goal is for computers to perform simple, repetitive tasks, such as regression testing, so that humans can focus on problem-solving"</blockquote><p>This one is a cautionary tale against too much automation with OKRs. I've seen cases where teams wanted progress on Key Results to be automatically updated via scripts or integrations, without any human intervention.</p><p>This kills the benefits of OKRs as you lose the problem-solving part. The value of OKRs comes from (1) people being reminded of the top priorities, and (2) people actively thinking about the gap between where they are and where they're supposed to be.</p><p>Full OKRs automation removes the human touch. Computers should help you collect the data, but only your team can interpret it and use it to make critical decisions.</p><h3>Relentlessly pursue continuous improvement</h3><blockquote>"Don't treat transformation as a project to be embarked on and then completed so we can return to business as usual."</blockquote><p>I think OKRs suffer a bit from their history. It's a process that is often associated with C-suite and large companies, and it sounds a lot like strategy jargon. That can make it a hard sell for some teams that take it as a different way to do micro-management (and sometimes they're right!).</p><p>OKRs should empower teams and encourage bottom-up innovation — but you need to have the right culture. It means creating space for people to try and fail, and it means investing in the right tools and processes to let your team grow.</p><h3>Everyone is responsible</h3><blockquote>"Everyone works together to achieve the organizational level goals, rather than optimizing for what's best for their team or department."</blockquote><p>OKRs are first and foremost about alignment. The goal is to create a shared North Star and define a common language to describe what success looks like.</p><p>This is also why OKRs should be team-based rather than people-based. It's about doing what's best for the customers and the business, not what's good for each member of the organization.</p><h2>What it means in practice</h2><figure id="w-node-28ee5141bd0f-ec75c961"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7cf835bc0fc5eb13e5c57d/5fb4269265df7bf80f8b2785_weekly-ritual.png.001.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>The weekly ritual of Product Teams</figcaption></figure><h3>Check progress every week</h3><p>In a normal Continuous Delivery flow you'd want code to be integrated every day. That's going to be too much for OKRs, and a weekly cadence is more than enough.</p><p>Update progress on Key Results on Monday, then let the team focus on work during the week. They'll have the right context in mind and should be able to make a dent for the next OKRs meeting.</p><h3>Use red/yellow/green statuses to indicate your confidence levels</h3><p>You need a simple way to understand when things are getting off-track. In software it happens when the build goes red. You can get similar results by using traffic lights to indicate your confidence level for each of the Key Results.</p><p>Make sure to keep the history of your checkins! Don't replace existing values in your spreadsheet as it'll prevent you from seeing trends.</p><h3>Make your KRs measurable</h3><p>Avoid binary Key Results (it's shipped/not shipped) or vague statement (users love our product). If you want your team to be effective, you'll need to have concrete ways to measure progress.</p><ul role="list"><li>It's shipped -&gt; We go from 0 to 350 weekly active users</li><li>Users love our product -&gt; We increase our NPS from 20 to 60</li></ul><h3>3 reds = all hands on deck</h3><p>Continuous Integration requires the build to be fixed as soon as it's broken. Things have to be a bit more lenient with OKRs as progress can fluctuate, but I'd recommend having a serious chat on the 3rd red update.</p><p>It won't always be about getting the team to drop everything to focus on one goal. Sometimes you'll realize that perhaps you were too ambitious, or it was the wrong KR to begin with. But — you must have that discussion to get everyone on the same page.</p><h3>Keep it light!</h3><p>Continuous Delivery is only possible if deploying code to production is a breeze. Same goes for updating the OKRs.</p><p>If it feels like a chore or takes people hours to update their KRs, then they'll stop doing it. And if they stop updating their KRs, then they'll soon forget about them. You'd be back to square one.<br></p></div><p>Of course, this is the end of the article where I tell you that we built <a href="https://tability.io/">Tability</a> precisely for that purpose. Anyway, give it a try, it's free and you get unlimited users on every plan!</p></div>]]>

Custom Static Analysis Rules Showdown:<br>
Brakeman vs. Semgrep
</p>
<p>
By Jason Kielpinski (Tech Reviewers: Justin Collins, Erik Cabetas, Clint Gibler)
</p>
<p>
In application assessments you have to do the most effective work you can in the time period defined by the client to maximize the assurance you’re providing. At IncludeSec we’ve done a couple innovative things to improve the overall effectiveness of the work we do, and we’re always on the hunt for more ways to squeeze even more value into our assessments by finding more risks and finding them faster. One topic that we revisit frequently to ensure we’re doing the best we can to maximize efficiency is static analysis tooling (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_application_security_testing" target="_blank">aka SAST</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Recently we did a bit of a comparison example of two open source static analysis tools to automate detection of suspicious or vulnerable code patterns identified during assessments. In this post we discuss the experience of using Semgrep and Brakeman to create the same custom rule within each tool for a client’s Ruby on Rails assessment our team was assessing. We’re also very interested in trying out GitHub’s CodeQL, but unfortunately the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24648281" target="_blank">Ruby support is still in development</a> so that will have to wait for another time.
</p>
<p>
Semgrep is a pattern-matching tool that is semantically-aware and works with several 	languages (currently its Ruby support is marked as beta, so it is likely not at full maturity yet). Brakeman is a long-lived Rails-specific static-analysis tool, familiar to most who have worked with Rails security. Going in, I had no experience writing custom rules for either one.
</p>
<p>
This blog post is specifically about writing custom rules for code patterns that are particular to the project I'm assessing. First though I want to mention that both tools have some pre-built general rules for use with most Ruby/Rails projects -- Brakeman has a fantastic set of built-in rules for Rails projects that has proven very useful on assessments (just make sure the developers of the project haven't disabled rules in config/brakeman.yml, and yes we have seen developers do this to make SAST warnings go away!). Semgrep has an <a href="https://semgrep.dev/r?lang=ruby&amp;sev=ERROR,WARNING,INFO&amp;tag=security,owasp,best-practice" target="_blank">online registry of user-submitted rules for Ruby</a> that is also handy (especially as examples for writing your own rules), but the current rule set for Ruby is not quite as extensive as Brakeman. In Brakeman the rules are known as “checks”, for consistency we’ll use the term “rules” for both tools, but you the reader can just keep that fact in mind.
</p>
<p>
First custom rule: Verification of authenticated functionality
</p>
<p>
I chose a simple pattern for the first rule I wanted to make, mainly to familiarize myself with the process of creating rules in both Semgrep and Brakeman. The application had controllers that handle non-API routes. These controllers enforced authentication by adding a before filter: <span>before_action :login_required</span>. Often in Rails projects, this line is included in a base controller class, then skipped when authentication isn't required using <span>skip_before_filter</span>. This was not the case in the webapp I was looking at -- the before filter was manually set in every single controller that needed authentication, which seemed error-prone as an overall architectural pattern, but alas it is the current state of the code base. 
</p>
<p>
I wanted to get a list of any non-API controllers that lack this callback so I can ensure no functionality is unintentionally exposed without authentication. API routes handled authentication in a different way so consideration for them was not a priority for this first rule.
</p>
<p>
Semgrep
</p>
<p>
I went to the Semgrep website and found that Semgrep has a <a href="https://semgrep.dev/learn" target="_blank">nice interactive tutorial</a>, which walks you through building custom rules. I found it to be incredibly simple and powerful -- after finishing the tutorial in about 20 minutes I thought I had all the knowledge I needed to make the rules I wanted. Although the site also has an online IDE for quick iteration I opted to develop locally, as the online IDE would require submitting our client’s code to a 3rd party which we obviously can’t do for security and liability reasons. The rule would eventually have to be run against the entire codebase anyways.
</p>
<p>
I encountered a few challenges when writing the rule:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It's a little tricky to find things that do not match a pattern (e.g. lack of a <span>login_required</span> filter). You can't just search all files for ones that don't match, you have to have a pattern that it does search for, then exclude the cases matching your negative pattern. I was running into a <a href="https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues/1892" target="_blank">bug</a> here that made it even harder but the Semgrep team fixed it when we gave them a heads up!
</li>
<li>
Matching only classes derived from <span>ApplicationController</span> was difficult because Semgrep doesn’t currently trace base classes recursively, so any that were more than one level removed from <span>ApplicationController</span> would be excluded (for example, if there was a class <span>DerivedController &lt; ApplicationController</span>, it wouldn't match <span>SecondLevelDerivedController &lt; DerivedController</span>.) The Semgrep team gave me a tip about using a metavariable regex to filter for classes ending in “Controller” which worked for this situation and added no false positives. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
My final custom rule for Semgrep follows:
</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>rules</span>:
<span>-</span> <span>id</span>: controller<span>-</span>without<span>-</span>authn
  <span>patterns</span>:
  <span>-</span> <span>pattern</span>: <span>|</span>
      <span>class</span> <span>$CLASS</span>
        <span>...</span>
      <span>end</span>
  <span>-</span> pattern<span>-</span><span>not</span>: <span>|</span>
      <span>class</span> <span>$CLASS</span>
        <span>...</span>
        before_action <span>...</span>, <span>:login_required</span>, <span>...</span>
        <span>...</span>
      <span>end</span>
  <span>-</span> metavariable<span>-</span><span>regex</span>:
      <span>metavariable</span>: <span>'$CLASS'</span>
      <span>regex</span>: <span>'.*Controller'</span>  
  <span>message</span>: <span>|</span>
  <span>$CLASS</span> does <span>not</span> use the login_required filter<span>.</span>
  <span>severity</span>: <span>WARNING</span>
  <span>languages</span>:
  <span>-</span> ruby
</pre></div>

<p>
I ran the rule using the following command: <span>semgrep --config=../../../semgrep/ | grep "does not use"</span>
</p>
<p>
The final grep is necessary because Semgrep will print the matched patterns which, in this case, were the entire classes. There’s currently no option in Semgrep to show only a list of matching files without the actual matched patterns themselves. That made it difficult to see the list of affected controllers, so I used grep on the output to filter the patterns out. This rule resulted in 47 identified controllers. Creating this rule originally took about two hours including going through the tutorial and debugging the issues I ran into but now that the issues are fixed I expect it would take less time in future iterations.
</p>
<p>
Overall I think the rule is pretty self-explanatory -- it finds all files that define a class then excludes the ones that have a <span>login_required</span> before filter. Check out the <a href="https://semgrep.dev/learn" target="_blank">semgrep tutorial lessons</a> if you’re unsure.
</p>
<p>
Brakeman
</p>
<p>
Brakeman has a <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/wiki/Creating-Custom-Brakeman-Rules" target="_blank">wiki page which describes custom rule building</a>, but it doesn't have a lot of detail about what functionality is available to you. It gives examples of finding particular method calls and whether user input finds their ways into these calls. There's no example of finding controllers.
</p>
<p>
The page didn't give any more about what I wanted to do so I headed off to Brakeman's <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/tree/main/lib/brakeman/checks" target="_blank">folder of built-in rules</a> in GitHub to see if there are any examples of something similar there. There is a <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/blob/main/lib/brakeman/checks/check_skip_before_filter.rb" target="_blank">CheckSkipBeforeFilter</a> rule which is very similar to what I want -- it checks whether the <span>login_required</span> callback is skipped with <span>skip_before_filter</span>. As mentioned, the app isn't implemented that way, but it showed me how to iterate controllers and check before filters.
</p>
<p>
This got me most of the way there but I also needed to skip API controllers for this particular app’s architecture. After about an hour of tinkering and looking through <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/blob/main/lib/brakeman/tracker/controller.rb" target="_blank">Brakeman controller tracker code</a> I had the following rule:
</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>require</span> <span>'brakeman/checks/base_check'</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Brakeman</span><span>::</span><span>CheckControllerWithoutAuthn</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>Brakeman</span><span>::</span><span>BaseCheck</span>
  <span>Brakeman</span><span>::</span><span>Checks</span><span>.</span>add <span>self</span>

  <span>@description</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Checks for a controller without authN"</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>run_check</span>
  controllers <span>=</span> tracker<span>.</span>controllers<span>.</span>select <span>do</span> <span>|</span>_name, controller<span>|</span>
      <span>not</span> check_filters controller
  <span>end</span>
  <span>Hash</span><span>[</span>controllers<span>].</span>each <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>name</span>, controller<span>|</span>
    <span>warn</span>  <span>:controller</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>name</span>,
          <span>:warning_type</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"No authN"</span>,
          <span>:warning_code</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>:basic_auth_password</span>,
          <span>:message</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"No authentication for controller"</span>,
          <span>:confidence</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>:high</span>,
          <span>:file</span> <span>=&gt;</span> controller<span>.</span>file
  <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>

<span># Check whether a non-api controller has a :login_required before_filter</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>check_filters</span> controller
  <span>return</span> <span>true</span> <span>if</span> controller<span>.</span>parent<span>.</span>to_s<span>.</span>include? <span>"ApiController"</span>
  controller<span>.</span>before_filters<span>.</span>each <span>do</span> <span>|</span>filter<span>|</span>
      <span>next</span> <span>unless</span> call? filter
      <span>next</span> <span>unless</span> filter<span>.</span>first_arg<span>.</span>value <span>==</span> <span>:login_required</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>true</span>
  <span>end</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>false</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Running it with <span>brakeman --add-checks-path ../brakeman --enable ControllerWithoutAuthn -t ControllerWithoutAuthn</span> resulted in 43 controllers without authentication -- 4 fewer than Semgrep flagged.
</p>
<p>
Taking a close look at the controllers that Semgrep flagged and Brakeman did not, I realized the app is importing shared functionality from another module, which included a <span>login_required</span> filter. Therefore, Semgrep had 4 false positives that Brakeman did not flag. Since Semgrep works on individual files I don’t believe there’s an easy way to prevent those ones from being flagged.
</p>
<p>
Second custom rule: Verification of correct and complete authorization across functionality
</p>
<p>
The next case I wanted assurance on was vertical authorization at the API layer. <span>ApiControllers</span> in the webapp have a method <span>authorization_permissions()</span> which is called at the top of each derived class with a hash table of function_name/permission pairs. This function saves the passed hash table into an instance variable. <span>ApiControllers</span> have a before filter that, when any method is invoked, will look up the permission associated with the called method in the hash table and ensure that the user has the correct permission before proceeding. 
</p>
<p>
Manual review was required to determine whether any methods had incorrect privileges, as analysis tools can’t understand business logic, but they can find methods entirely lacking authorization control -- that was my …</p></div></div>

The focus of this post is on two important yet lost elements of the pre-modern landscape of Lincolnshire, namely a large area of common land named Lissingleys—very probably the meeting-place for the whole of Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Scandinavian Lindsey—and the road running north-eastwards from Lincoln to the coast at Grimsby. The latter routeway is first recorded in 1675, but is believed to have originally run along the northern border of this common pasturage and meeting-site, and other place- and field-name evidence suggests that this road may well be of a similar antiquity to the meeting-place itself.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-C_lyVZq2UK8/X-nTCtYTVjI/AAAAAAADOxU/qiyfZtxaMroL5Gwv-3ZKZ38YbhI1OYUJACLcBGAsYHQ/s1200/Lissingleys-large.jpg"><img data-original-height="237" data-original-width="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-986EuoGDpsg/X-nTCYtFIpI/AAAAAAADOxQ/h1-5bWtwDZkhzfOc9JTgTcTXTf2wlKeeQCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/Lissingleys-500.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td>(a) Lissingleys in 1820, before its enclosure in 1851, as depicted in Henry Stevens' drawing for the Ordnance Survey&nbsp;(image: Wikimedia Commons);&nbsp;(b) A map of the three ridings of Lindsey set against the pre-Viking landscape of the region, showing the location of Lissingleys at the point at which the three ridings met (image: Green, Britons and Anglo-Saxons, fig. 27).

First, it was an extraparochial area that was considered to lie outside any single ecclesiastical or civil parish until its enclosure in 1851, with the rights of intercommoning here being shared between eight surrounding parishes. Second, there was a concentration of multiple important estates belonging to key landholders within Anglo-Scandinavian Lindsey surrounding the site in 1066, implying that access to it was of some importance, although this centrality seems to have evaporated by 1086, when a similar pattern is conspicuous by its absence. And third and most importantly, the land itself lay at the exact point where the boundaries of the three ridings of Viking-era Lindsey met. Indeed, the eight vills that had common rights in Lissingleys were distributed across all three ridings, and the boundaries of these three ridings and their constituent wapentakes moreover look like they have been deliberately adjusted to meet at Lissingleys, suggesting that the site was important even prior to the creation of the ridings (which were probably in existence by <i>c. </i>900, if not before). All of this strongly suggests that Lissingleys was a place of considerable importance to the organisation of Anglo-Scandinavian Lindsey and probably pre-Viking Lindsey too, and it has been credibly identified as the meeting-place for the whole community of Anglian and Anglo-Scandinavian Lindsey. Support for this conclusion is offered by both the archaeology of the immediately surrounding area and the name Lissingleys itself, as I have argued at length <a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/p/britons-and-anglo-saxons-lincolnshire.html">elsewhere</a>. In particular, a strong case can be made for this rural meeting-site having been an important focus in both the Early Anglo-Saxon and Romano-British periods too, with the name arguably containing Late British/Archaic Welsh <i>*liss-</i>, the root of Welsh <i>llys</i>,&nbsp; meaning ‘court, hall’ or ‘parliament, gathering of nobles’ (compare the name Liss, <i>Lis/Lissa</i>, in Hampshire, which also derives from this element).(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/lissingleys-and-the-lincoln-grimsby-road.html#fn1">1</a>)</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kW5acYZblLI/X-nXqHauTTI/AAAAAAADOxo/9LyjakXqUREsbb_cXfNciGhZVFk0n-cZwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1200/Lissingleys-parishes-commonrights-manors-large.jpg"><img data-original-height="246" data-original-width="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wLsBkXXrsJY/X-nXp4ZFS2I/AAAAAAADOxk/BpZm5kS0AwAQCslCqpBV04Phck63tVBCgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/Lissingleys-parishes-commonrights-manors-500.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Two maps showing the parish (red lines), hundred (green line) and riding-and-hundred boundaries (yellow lines) in the immediate area around Lissingleys extraparochial area, shown in purple.

Whether it was always this size or perhaps slightly larger in extent is open to debate; Henry Stevens' draft map for the Ordnance Survey shows a number of old enclosures immediately to the north and south of Lissingleys which might conceivably have originally been parts of it that were lost after its apparent decline in centrality/importance post-1066—if so, then the total original area of Lissingleys could have been up to around 3.1 km² or 765 acres. It is perhaps worth noting in this context that the extent of Lissingleys as mapped by the&nbsp;<i>Historic Parishes of England and Wales: an Electronic Map of Boundaries before 1850</i> project, based on the 1851 enclosure map, seems to be missing an area on the eastern side that is depicted as a definite part of Lissingleys on the 1820 map, so there were clearly alterations to its borders taking place in the modern era. Furthermore, in 1807 Lissingleys was described as comprising 'between five and six hundred acres of very wet land', suggesting that even greater losses of land from Lissingleys may have taken place in the late eightheenth to early nineteenth centuries.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/lissingleys-and-the-lincoln-grimsby-road.html#fn2">2</a>) As to what occurred here, such meeting-sites as this were a fundamental element of government and society in Anglo-Saxon England, where the free men from across the region (here the three ridings of Lindsey) met to discuss, arrange and decide the judicial, administrative, financial and other business of the region, hence the apparent importance of access to this site that is implied by the clustering of manors of key figures within the region around Lissingleys in 1066. They also frequently became
sites of fairs and occasional markets, sometimes associated with scatters of metal-detected material, and in this context it is worth noting that there is indeed a very extensive multi-period scatter of material found immediately to the south of Lissingleys.&nbsp;</p><p>Another notable characteristic of Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Scandinavian meeting sites is an association with major routeways, reflecting the need for the site to be accessible to all who had to attend it. Unfortunately, Lissingleys nowadays lies away from the major roads of the region. However, there are good reasons for thinking that one of the key highways of pre-modern Lincolnshire actually ran either immediately next to or even across the northern edge of Lissingleys, prior to the remaking of the medieval Lincolnshire landscape by enclosure and the turnpike acts. The road itself, which ran from Lincoln to Grimsby, is first attested by John Ogilby in his 1675 <i>Britannia</i>&nbsp;road atlas, where it was one of 100 major British routeways drawn by Ogilby as strip-maps at a scale of 1 inch to the mile:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-po8-oEov3MU/X-n3taRiGsI/AAAAAAADOyY/cDQYO4ZlShoV-OPGcqtcuisdh3gzEypXgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1670/Lincoln-Grimsby-1675.jpg"><img data-original-height="368" data-original-width="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nl9nVAh8zxY/X-n3sH4ArBI/AAAAAAADOyU/csJN6ddSbJ46-JzOhMz5aGZddTfbnEr4gCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/Lincoln-Grimsby-1675-small.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td>A coloured version of John Ogilby's 1675 strip-map of the route from Lincoln to Grimsby, on the right side of the page; click <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-po8-oEov3MU/X-n3taRiGsI/AAAAAAADOyY/cDQYO4ZlShoV-OPGcqtcuisdh3gzEypXgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1670/Lincoln-Grimsby-1675.jpg">here</a> for a larger version of this map (image: John Ogilby, <i><a href="http://www.fulltable.com/vts/m/map/ogilby/mna.htm">Britannia</a></i>, 1675, Public Domain).</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Ogilby's road follows the current Lincoln–Market Rasen road, the A46, north-east from Lincoln for a couple of miles, crossing a 'rill' (Nettleham Beck), a cross-roads with the Old Drovers' Road from Horncastle to Doncaster (mentioned in the early fourteenth century and mapped in the eighteenth), and a heath (Nettleham and Scothern Heath); however, at the point that the present A46 turns eastwards to Dunholme, Ogilby's 1675 road carried on into Welton before turning east and running through the hamlet of Ryland. From here it runs east before rejoining the A46 to cross Snarford Bridge (originally a ford, to judge from the place-name), passing the now-demolished Snarford Hall and Snarford Park, and then runs north-east to Faldingworth Ings and Shaft Wood. At the point the A46 turns north and runs into Faldingworth village, with a minor road running south to Friesthorpe, Ogilby's road then seems to have instead crossed the fields of the southern part of Faldingworth parish directly to Buslingthorpe parish (as the road is indeed depicted as doing on Armstrong's map of 1779 and Cary's map of 1787), where it subsequently is thought to have run to the south of Buslingthorpe village and effectively across the northern boundary of the Lissingleys meeting-site and common pasture, separated from it only by the&nbsp;<i>c.&nbsp;</i>200 metre wide old enclosures mentioned above. At the eastern end of Lissingleys, the seventeenth-century road then turned north and ran along the present-day minor route to Middle Rasen, before turning eastwards onto a 'Green Lane' and across what are now the fields south of Market Rasen to join Mill Road and thus enter the town proper.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/lissingleys-and-the-lincoln-grimsby-road.html#fn3">3</a>)&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Xh2IzUcgNGA/X-sayCZIbQI/AAAAAAADO1A/qmUr7SIYKYEckP5otqjVT40VYtha402vQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1100/LincolnGrimsbyRoad1-large.jpg"><img data-original-height="435" data-original-width="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0lwjEX70WgU/X-saxq3dtLI/AAAAAAADO08/JAG10qSCDeo4JpuK0BB-ooXXFmRn7w4UwCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/LincolnGrimsbyRoad1-500.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td>A map of the first half of Ogilby's 1675 road from Lincoln to Grimsby as far as Market Rasen, showing the proximity of Lissingleys to the road; note, it deviates from the current A46 in two places, first when it goes through Welton and Ryland before returning to the A46 route just before Snarford Bridge, and second just before Faldingworth, when it carried on across the old open fields to run just to the north of Lissingleys before turning sharply north along a present-day minor road—it carried on along this until just before Middle Rasen, when it turned right along a 'Green Lane' and then across present-day fields to meet Mill Road, Market Rasen.

Leaving Market Rasen north of the River Rase (here named 'Ankam', <i>i.e.</i>&nbsp;the&nbsp;Ancholme, of which the Rase is a tributary), it crosses Tealby Moor eastwards to the south of Hamilton Hill before crossing a brook to enter Tealby village. There is no single road following this route nowadays, but there are footpaths and tracks on this route are thought to represent it, although which water-mill is the one mentioned by Ogilby is …</p></div></div></div>

						<p>This an opening post of mini blog post series about various uses of dithering for quantization and sampling in video games. It is something most of us use intuitively in every day work, so wanted to write down some of those concepts, explain and analyze them in Mathematica.</p>
<p>This post is just a table of contents.</p>
<p><a href="https://bartwronski.com/2016/10/30/dithering-part-one-simple-quantization/">Part one – dithering – definition and simple 1D quantization.</a></p>

<p><em><strong>Update April 2020</strong></em>: I didn’t expect to come back to blue noise a few years later, but I <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2020/04/26/optimizing-blue-noise-dithering-backpropagation-through-fourier-transform-and-sorting/">wrote a small additional blog post</a> on alternative method for generating blue noise patterns for dithering by “optimizing” frequency spectrum. You can treat it as <strong>part three-point-five</strong>. 🙂</p>

    <h3>Urwhat?</h3>
    <p>
    Given the events of the first few weeks of 2021 and the ensuing discourse
    regarding online communities, decentralized platforms have become something
    of a hot topic. None of these are mainstream in any sense outside of the
    privacy/FOSS/developer community, but some of the more popular ones include
    <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a>, and <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a>. All of these have in common
    the fact that they are part of the "fediverse", a community of self-hosted
    platforms that can interact with each other via the ActivityPub protocol.
    Via ActivityPub, you can see PeerTube videos from Mastodon, people on
    different Pleroma servers can follow each other, your self-hosted blog can
    allow comments via Mastodon, etc. I think these are fantastic projects and a
    step forward for the Internet, but a different project caught my eye
    recently - <a href="https://urbit.org/">Urbit</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Urbit is one of things that is surrounded with so much
        <label for="sn-aesthetic">mystique</label>
        <span id="sn-aesthetic">
            I mean, just look at that aesthetic on their homepage and blog.
            Minimal, enigmatic, and eyecatching. A+ job to the designer.
        </span>
    and promises so much that it is guaranteed to be either revolutionary or a
    complete scam.  The project aims to be not only a peer-to-peer network but
    also include an operating system, virtual machine, not one but two
    (functional!)  programming languages, and an identity system.  These kinds
    of clean-slate, from-the-ground-up reimaginings of computing rarely leave
    the ground, and when they do they're often pretty <a href="https://templeos.org/">unusable</a>.  I just <strong>had</strong> to
    see for myself.
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Nine Lightyears Away, Just Outside the Kepler Solar System</h3>
    <p>
    Urbit is trying to be what the Internet was supposed to be, according to the
    ideals of the 1980s. In that prehistoric era, people imagined that the
    Internet would be a peer-to-peer network of individuals freely sharing
    information, unhampered by existing centralized systems or physical borders.
    This, as we now know, never came true. The Internet of today is incredibly
    centralized, and looks more like the computing environment of the 1970s -
    individuals hook up terminals (now phones, tablets, laptops, etc.) to giant
    corporate-owned mainframes (now servers run by Google, Amazon, etc.) that
    store and own all of our data and do the actual computing behind the
    applications we use. Part of why Urbit is such a radical project is because
    it realizes that we can't reverse this process of centralization given our
    current computing infrastructure. If you're tech savvy and willing to front
    the costs you can certainly buy a VPS and host your own stuff, but your
    elderly relatives aren't going to swap out Facebook for an EC2 instance
    anytime
        <label for="sn-ec2">soon.
        </label> <span label="sn-ec2">
            Urbit definitely does not solve the necessity for technical
            competency that's endemic to these kinds of alternative platforms, as you'll
            later see.  I suppose the creators left it up to the end-users to build
            comfortable clients.
        </span>
    Instead, Urbit is a truly personal OS built from the ground up that runs in
    a virtual machine on any Unix system.
    </p>
    <p>
    Urbit is not only an OS - it's an identification system.  Each Urbit
    instance exists as a unique member in a hierarchy. In the Urbit universe,
    there are 2^8 galaxies, each galaxy has 2^8 stars, and each star has 2^16
    planets. This gives approximately 4 billion unique IDs, each of which are
    stored as Ethereum tokens. As you might have noticed there's 7 billion
    people in the world at the moment, but only 4 billion IDs for a "personal
    OS" to go around. This is intended in order to create scarcity, making IDs less
    likely to be abused and give users skin in the game when it comes to Urbit
    as a platform. The IDs themselves are all serialized via a pretty quirky
    syllabic naming convention, with rarer entities having shorter names:
    <code>~zod</code> is the name of a galaxy, <code>~taglux</code> is the name
    of a star, and <code>~rovnys-ricfer</code> is the name of a planet.  If you
    don't have an identity yet you can also boot up a free and disposable
    instance called a "comet", which will have a super long 128-bit name like
    <code>~dasres-ragnep-lislyt-ribpyl--mosnyx-bisdem-nidful-marzod</code>. You
    can do so right now after <a href="https://urbit.org/using/install/">installing</a> the Urbit binary and
    running <code>urbit -c comet-name-here</code>. Once you boot up (it'll take
    a while) you should see a prompt appear.
    </p>

    <h3>Beyond the Horizon of Sanity</h3>
    <p>
    Urbit, in terms of software, is composed of several tightly coupled projects.
    The entire inspiration behind building an entire software stack from the
    ground up, and what makes the OS truly peer-to-peer, is the fact that it's
    built entirely of pure functional code. This allows for interesting stuff
    like totally deterministic behavior, the ability to serialize and then
    deserialize the entire machine state, sending and executing code over the
    wire, and its snappy tagline: "An operating function." The actual core OS of
    Urbit is named <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/tutorials/arvo/arvo/">Arvo</a>, the
    assembly code of which is called <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/nock/">Nock</a>, which runs on the <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/vere/">Vere</a> runtime/interpeter.
    Nock is incredibly low-level but distinct from typical RISC/CISC assembly in
    that it's purely functional so there's no registers, pointer poking, or
    syscalls going on - it's all just S-expressions and operations on
        <label for="sn-lisp">S-expressions.</label>
        <span id="sn-lisp">
        Don't get your hopes up, it's nothing like Lisp. Just similar data
        structures.
        </span>
    I have to say, all of these sleek monosyllabic names get a little tiring
    after a while and do a very poor job of hinting at their purpose for
    newcomers.  Imagine if everything on Unix was named the same way -
    <code>systemd</code>?  Oh, you mean Sarp? <code>libcurl</code>? Yeah, that's
    called Clon now.  At least we're already used to Gimp.
    </p>
    <p>
    Much like how basically everything in Unix is written with C and compiled
    down to assembly, everything on Urbit is written in <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/tutorials/hoon/">Hoon</a> and then compiled
    down to Nock. Hoon is, as you can probably guess by now, a pure functional
    programming language.  When I read this on the tin I got pretty excited, and
    was looking forward to checking out an entire OS written from the ground up
    in something like Haskell or ML or a Lisp dialect.
    </p>
    <p>This was <strong>not</strong> the case. Abandon all hope, ye who enter.</p>
    <p>
    It's truly like nothing I've seen before, and I'd like to think I've been
    around the block when it comes to programming language design. The primary
    ingredient in Hoon is schizophrenia. It makes Terry Davis look like Brian
    Kernighan. To illustrate, let's take a look at <strong>literally</strong>
    the <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/tutorials/hoon/hoon-school/list-of-numbers/">first
    example</a> in the docs:
        </p><pre>            <code>
|=  end=@
=/  count=@  1
|-
^-  (list @)
?:  =(end count)
  ~
:-  count
$(count (add 1 count))
            </code>
        </pre>
    <p>
    What does this do? Oh, isn't it obvious? It takes a number <code>n</code>
    and returns a list from 1 to <code>n</code>. No, none of those symbols are
    comments or decorators; every single character above is semantically
    significant. I can deal with complexity where it's necessary, but a short
    look at the docs requires learning a whole new lexicon. The tutorial jumps
    around from concepts like "gates" to "arms" to "runes" to "molds" in such a
    way that it seems deliberately obscure and frustrating. What could possibly
    be so insufficient or broken about, say, functions (after all, it calls
    itself a functional language) that they had to be reinvented? Also - this is
    a minor nitpick, but somewhat representative of the language in general - in
    Hoon, 0 is true and 1 is false <a href="https://youtu.be/5furYtfVuIk">.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    Because I have yet to do more with the language than go through the tutorial
    and its exercises a few times, I probably haven't earned the right to be too
    scathing. Who knows, perhaps Hoon is a joy to work with once you pass the
    event horizon and become one with the bits. There's a couple resources
    besides the official tutorial that I'll likely check out in the future:
    there's the <a href="https://urbit.org/community/hoonschool/">Hoon
    School</a> online course (again, if a language requires a six-week online
    course just to learn the fundamentals that should really tell you something)
    and the community-managed <a href="https://hooniversity.org/">Hooniversity</a> tutorial.  I'll leave it
    at this - it's a real achievement that
        <label for="sn-vanes">so much</label>
        <span id="sn-vanes">
        Arvo kernel modules are called <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/vane/">Vanes</a>, and there are
        quite a few. There's modules for an HTTP client (separate from the
        server module?), peer-to-peer networking, a filesystem, a terminal, and
        a build system to name a few. Not sure what the userspace is like,
        though.
        </span>
    has been written in the language so far.

    <h3>Astroturfing</h3>
    <p>
    Alright, we've decided we're ready for the future of the Internet and want
    to buy in.  Where do we start?
    </p>
    <p>
    Most people just start out with buying a planet. Stars are fairly expensive
    at around $4,000 when I checked at the time of writing this, and galaxies
    are even more expensive and only available via private sale since most of
    the 256 have been given out to contributors/friends of the project. Stars
    and galaxies also represent quite a responsibility because of their dual
    role as infrastructure in the Urbit network, so if you don't want to make
    any kind of commitment then buying a planet is the way to go. There are a
    few places you can buy one - <a href="https://urbit.live/">urbit.live</a>,
    <a href="https://urbit.me/">urbit.me</a>, and <a href="https://planet.market/">planet.market</a> are the first few Google
    results.
    </p>
    <p>
    I decided to get mine on urbit.live. I just chose the first

                    <p>A study was recently reported <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19012651.breakthrough-discovery-reveals-way-reversing-motor-neurone-disease-damage/">in the press as showing promise for a cure for ALS</a>.
Although the content reported by the press is accurate, the interpretation by members of the ALS community is wrong: There is no way (yet) to cure ALS, but on the other hand <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00401-020-02252-5">the study reinforces and clarifies the long-suspected link between ALS and metabolism</a>.</p>

<p>About 10 to 20% of cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are familial, with the C9orf72 mutation being the most common cause of familial ALS.
The pathological mechanisms of the C9orf72 mutation in ALS remain unclear. Indeed, the loss of function induced by a mutation of C9orf72 alone does not contribute to the deficits of lysosomal rapid axonal transport in C9orf72 motor neurons derived from stem cells.</p>

<p><strong>Enormous energy needs</strong>
The processes involved in the functioning of motor neurons are all very energy consuming, which raises the question of whether alterations in energy metabolism contribute to defective axonal transport. Apart from alterations in the microtubule machinery observed in a rare mutation causing ALS: FUS, until the present study, however, it had not been shown that the metabolism of motor neurons from ALS patients differed from those of healthy motor neurons.</p>

<p><strong>OXPHOS is the metabolic pathway of mitochondria</strong>
For their energy supply, neurons, unlike astrocytes, are primarily dependent on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative phosphorylation (or OXPHOS) is the metabolic pathway in which cells use enzymes to catalyze the oxidation of nutrients, releasing the energy needed to form ATP. In almost all aerobic eukaryotes, oxidative phosphorylation takes place within the mitochondria.
During oxidative phosphorylation, electrons are transferred from electron donors to electron acceptors, such as oxygen, via redox reactions. These redox reactions release energy which is used to form ATP.
This is a very efficient route for generating energy, compared to other processes using fermentation such as anaerobic glycolysis.</p>

<p><strong>The importance of energy from mitochondria in axonal transport</strong>
The extraordinary length of motor neuron axons - 20,000 times longer than the diameter of their soma - suggests a particular metabolic vulnerability of motor neurons to deficits in key processes involved in maintaining axon form and function.</p>

<p>The transport of mitochondrial cargo, unlike vesicular transport, depends on the availability of mitochondrial ATP. Defective transport of the cargo to the distal axon has been reported in several types of ALS, and not just in genes involved in the transport of proteins in the axon. It is well established from animal models of ALS that axon targeting results in delay in disease progression and improved survival and that prevention of motor neuron loss only, but not axonal degeneration, is insufficient to promote patient survival.</p>

<p><strong>Demonstration of a modified axonal transport</strong>
To better understand this question, the scientists studied induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from autopsy of patients containing the most common mutation causing ALS, C9orf72. These stem cells have been matured into motor neurons. They then demonstrate that motor neurons affected by the C9orf72 mutation have (in vitro) shorter axons, an axonal transport of the mitochondrial cargo which is altered and a modified mitochondrial metabolism.</p>

<p>The scientists then show that this deregulation is selective for the spinal (motor) neurons of the anterior horn, and is absent in the spinal (sensory) neurons of the dorsal horn (deregulation in the spinal motor neurons of the ventral horn, but not in sensory neurons of the corresponding dorsal horn).</p>

<p><strong>Gene therapy manipulating PGC1α restores a good phenotype of mutated motor neurons and their axons</strong>
The scientists then carried out by gene therapy an alteration of the genome of the mitochondria in the motor neurons carrying the C9orf72 mutation which are derived from stem cells. This alteration of the genome corrected the metabolic deficit and also saved axonal length and transport phenotypes.</p>

<p>The scientists were able to stimulate mitochondrial function (and biogenesis) through the manipulation of its main regulator, PGC1α, leading to the rescue of axonal phenotypes, providing a new mechanical link between mitochondrial bioenergetics. and axonal dysfunction.</p>

<p><strong>A link with TDP-43?</strong>
These data suggest that targeting the PGC1α pathway may be highly relevant for neurodegeneration, as it is possible that there are other mechanisms leading to axonal dysfunctions observed in motor neurons with the C9orf72 mutation. For example, recent findings show that the repeated proteins of the C9orf72 dipeptide can lead to cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43. Thus, the pathology of TDP-43, observed in the vast majority of ALS cases, including C9orf72, modulates mitochondrial homeostasis by regulating the processing of mitochondrial transcriptions.</p>

<p>Conversely, TDP-43 exerts a toxicity by penetrating into the mitochondria and by specifically altering the OXPHOS I complex and by inhibiting its translation which causes mitochondrial dysfunction.</p>

<p>Finally, recent work from Onesto et al. showed that there is compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis, as evidenced by the upregulation of PGC1α, in dermal fibroblasts derived from patients with the C9orf72 mutation in ALS.</p>

<p>This suggests that despite the deleterious effects of the mutation, most cell types can compensate for mitochondrial dysfunction by stimulating biogenesis.
The specific vulnerability to motor neurons could result in part from an inability of motorneurones to modulate this homeostatic mechanism when they face too much energy expenditure.</p>

        <section>
            <p>I've been contemplating ways to build more resilient web applications. One consistent issue that seems to crop up in my explorations is that we have no way to execute JavaScript at a given priority.</p>

<p>We can write asynchronous code, but this doesn't provide a general-purpose resiliency primitive.</p>

<h4 id="unyieldy">Un-yield-y</h4>

<p>It is possible to write code that "yields" to allow other code to execute. Writing everything as async functions can accomplish this in specific cases, though only promise chains can be interrupted and it lacks any form of scheduling. This technique relies entirely on authors writing code to be interruptible, explicitly indicating where interruption may occur.</p>

<p>In addition to being opt-in, code that uses async/await, Promises or callbacks is still largely synchronous. The code between each point of asynchrony (await, Promise, callback) can't be interrupted. The following example function can only yield in a single location, the remaining code executes synchronously:</p>

<pre><code>async function amazing() {  
  let items = [];
  let seen = new Set();
  for (let i=0; i&lt;1000; i++) {
    let item = await db.get(i);
            // ^ yielding can only occur here
    if (!seen.has(item.name)) {
      seen.add(item.name);
      items.push(item);
    }
  }
  return items;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Combined with the fact that most JavaScript doesn't use async/await or even Promises, makes it insufficient as a general-purpose resiliency primitive. <strong>Most of the JavaScript executed by browsers is synchronous.</strong></p>

<h4 id="whyyield">Why yield?</h4>

<p>There is no language or platform feature that allows for interrupting arbitrary synchronous work in order to prioritize other work. There are a few reasons why we might want such a feature, but the one I find most compelling is to apply resiliency paradigms to <em>existing</em> web code. Effectively, we want the ability to interrupt code wasn't written to be interrupted in order to allocate more time to executing high-priority code.</p>

<pre><code>function veryGoodCode() {  
  const start = Date.now();
  while (Date.now() - start &lt; 1000) {} // 🧐
  generateRevenue(); // 💸
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code we run from npm modules, third-party embeds and ads is all given access to the same pool of computing power as an application's core functionality. Multi-process improvements in the browser like <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/oop-iframes">out-of-process iframes</a> address this for certain types of content embedded from other origins, which can mitigate the performance impact of things like ads. Unfortunately, we don't have a similar solution for our own applications.</p>

<p>Applications are usually composed out of many distinct parts, but each part currently has the ability to impact the performance of all other parts. <strong>We are missing a platform primitive for composing JavaScript modules while imposing performance constraints</strong>.</p>



<p>I drafted a proposal a while back and shared to various browser engineers, called <a href="https://github.com/developit/element-worklet">Element Worklet</a>. The proposal uses the existing concept of a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worklet">Worklet</a>, which is a standalone ECMAScript Module that executes in an isolated environment. This isolation means Worklets can be executed wherever is most suitable: Audio Worklets run on the audio rendering thread, Paint Worklets run on the compositor thread.</p>

<p>Element Worklets are a new type of Worklet that can register Custom Elements. The code for an Element Worklet has access to a limited subset of the DOM API, which allows code to register one or more Custom Elements using the standard <code>customElements.define()</code> method. Custom Elements registered by a worklet must inherit from a global <code>WorkletElement</code> class, and are only able to render into their Shadow DOM (as well as being able to set their own attributes).</p>

<p>Custom Elements registered by an Element Worklet are called "worklet-backed elements". These can be used on the main thread like any standard Custom Element, and can also be referenced from within the Shadow DOM of other worklet-backed elements, enabling arbitrary composition.</p>

<h4 id="example">Example</h4>

<p>The following example shows how a <code>&lt;code-editor&gt;</code> element can be built as an Element Worklet. Doing so encapsulates the code editor implementation so that its performance is not impacted by the surrounding page. It also ensures the page's performance is not impacted by the editor.</p>

<p>First, an HTML page includes the <code>&lt;code-editor&gt;</code> element in its markup the same as it would for a Custom Element. Then, a <code>code-editor.js</code> worklet module script is loaded using <code>addModule()</code>:</p>

<p><code>index.html</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;code-editor value="function foo(){}"&gt;&lt;/code-editor&gt;

&lt;script&gt;  
  customElements.addModule('/code-editor.js');
&lt;/script&gt;  
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>code-editor.js</code> module is loaded in a new JavaScript context, separate from the page and its JavaScript. The module declares a Custom Element class that extends <code>WorkletElement</code>, and uses the <code>connectedCallback()</code> lifecycle method to instantiate <a href="https://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a> within its Shadow DOM. The element also observes "value" attribute changes to update the editor text. Finally, the Custom Element is registered via <code>customElements.define()</code>.</p>

<p><code>code-editor.js</code></p>

<pre><code>import CodeMirror from 'https://unumd.glitch.me/codemirror';

class CodeEditor extends WorkletElement {  
  static get observedAttributes() {
    return ['value'];
  }

  connectedCallback() {
    const shadow = this.attachShadow({ mode: 'closed' });

    this.editor = CodeMirror(shadow, {
      value: this.getAttribute('value')
    });
  }

  attributeChangedCallback(name, prev, value) {
    if (name === 'value') this.editor.setValue(value);
  }
}

customElements.define('code-editor', CodeEditor);  
</code></pre>

<p>Once the worklet module has finished executing and <code>customElements.define()</code> is called, the <code>code-editor</code> element is upgraded on the main thread.</p>

<h4 id="datasharing">Data Sharing</h4>

<p>Custom Element properties set from the main thread are not reflected on a <code>WorkletElement</code>, only attributes. Attribute changes are observed the same as they are in Custom Elements, declared via a static <code>observedAttributes</code> property on the element's constructor. Attribute changes changes invoke <code>attributeChangedCallback()</code> on the WorkletElement instance, and may be batched.</p>

<p>Complex data and transferrables can also be shared. The main thread and worklet instances of a WorkletElement each have a <code>port</code> property, which are ports of an MessageChannel specific to that instance, and can be used for message passing. This is similar to how <code>processor.port</code> is provided by audio worklet's AudioWorkletNode/AudioWorkletProcessor.</p>

<h4 id="usecases">Use Cases</h4>

<p><strong>Ads:</strong> Advertisements currently use iframes for encapsulation, a technique of increasing cost as the effects of Spectre mitigations make their way into browsers. Element Worklet could provide a lightweight alternative to iframes for this use-case.</p>

<p><strong>Third Party Embeds:</strong> Embedded content like comment widgets, chats and helpdesks all of these currently use some combination of same-origin scripting and iframes, usually mixing origins (eg: a script in the embedder context communicating with an iframe from the embedee's context). Moving from <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> + <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> to Element Worklet seems like a reasonable fit for this case.</p>

<p><strong>AMP:</strong> The semantics defined in this proposal map reasonably well to <code>&lt;amp-script&gt;</code>, and a prototype of Element Worklet has been built using <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/worker-dom">worker-dom</a>, the library that underpins <code>&lt;amp-script&gt;</code>. AMP's approach is much more broadly applicable than Element Worklet, seeking to support arbitrary third-party code running in a sandboxed DOM environment. However, it's possible a solution like worker-dom would be able to leverage something like Element Worklet to simplify Element registration and upgrades, and to mitigate transfer overhead between threads.</p>

<p><strong>Lazy Loading:</strong> Component-based frameworks and libraries strive to provide solutions for lazily downloading, instantiating and rendering portions of an application. This process is entirely implemented in userland, which has the unfortunate side effect of making it invisible to the browser. In certain scenarios, it may be possible to use Element Worklet as the underly mechanism for lazily loading and rendering pieces of a component-based User Interface.</p>

<p><strong>UI Component Libraries:</strong> If this model can be shown to provide performance guarantees for Element registration, upgrade and rendering, it's possible a UI library would choose to provide their components as worklet-backed Elements through the use of one or more Element Worklets. This could have interesting implications for performance, since it would provide a way to impose performance guarantees. This is a safety net developers do not currently have for prebuilt modules. The (large) portions of a typical app that are defined by code installed from npm would have less ability to negatively impact the performance of first-party code.</p>

<h4 id="feasibility">Feasibility</h4>

<p>The hard part with such a broad proposal like this is making it something that would be feasible to implement. Part of the design of Element Worklet is aimed at avoiding implementation issues, like the use of a minimal DOM subset and exclusively asynchronous interaction between threads.</p>

<p>As part of investigating whether Element Worklet could be implemented at all, I've created an <a href="#prototype">Element Worklet prototype</a>. The prototype also demonstrates how Element Worklet could be used to control the performance impact of UI components, in addition to insulating their performance from the page.</p>

<h4 id="openquestions">Open Questions</h4>

<p>This proposal glosses over a some details that would be important were it to be implemented in a browser:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What DOM APIs should be available to Element Worklet code? Can <code>WorkletElement</code> provide a sufficient API surface to allow current libraries and approaches to be reused with minimal modification?</p></li>
<li><p>How would a Worklet obtain information that required the main thread to perform layout? (we need <code>async getBoundingClientRect()</code> and friends!)</p></li>
<li><p>Is the level of encapsulation too limiting? Does it fail to meet the needs of the most obvious use-cases like embedded video players?</p></li>
<li><p>Should Element Worklet provide an analog for Custom Element property getters/setters? Could custom properties/methods defined on a WorkletElement …</p></li></ul></section></article></div></div>

The firm’s strategy has dramatic implications for the future of media and the venture capital industry. </p><p>This is the story of how Andreessen Horowitz disrupted the world of venture capital by cozying up to the media and then, how they purposefully threw that relationship away.</p><p>Let me tell you the story from the beginning.</p><p>About a decade ago, <strong>Margit Wennmachers</strong> sent an email to reporter <strong>Kara Swisher</strong>. </p><p>Swisher took a break from horseback riding to <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20100614/outcasts-wennmachers-joins-andreessen-horowitz-as-partner/">write that Wennmachers was leaving Outcast</a>, the communications agency she co-founded with <strong>Caryn Marooney</strong>. Wennmachers was joining the one-year-old venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz as a full partner – a rare title for a woman in Silicon Valley, especially in 2010.</p><p>Wennmachers explained her strategy for positioning the firm in the early days, <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/20/brand-building-a16z-ideas-people-marketing/">in an interview</a> on Andreessen Horowitz’s in-house podcast. “I wanted to try and get a cover story because – this sounds old fashioned now, because everybody reads their news on Twitter and it's all online whatever – but there's still a statement that comes with a cover story that is in print, that you see at the airport,” she recalled. </p><p>With Wennmachers’ press savvy, <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong>’s idea-a-second patter, and <strong>Ben Horowitz</strong>’s gravitas, the trio took Silicon Valley by storm. The firm outbid competitors for sought-after companies, spun up a slew of services for founders, and pitched its story relentlessly to the press.</p><p>With Wennmachers’ encouragement Andreessen penned a now <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">historic Op-Ed</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in 2011, titled, “Why Software is Eating the World.” The phrase became so ubiquitous that it can seem like everything eats the world these days. </p><p>“Margit is really a hidden founder of this firm,” a startup founder who has raised money from the firm told me. “The power dynamics there is, Marc, Ben, and Margit.” </p><p>Communications executives and reporters alike are in awe of Wennmachers for her sway with the media. “Comms in the Valley – she's the number 1 draft pick. She's very good,” one public relations person said. “I would never want to be crosswise with her.” </p><p>While Wennmachers’ strategy in that early period would have been familiar to many in Hollywood and Washington, it was less common in clubby and decorous Silicon Valley at the time. “She would say that was her job – to manage information so that she could shape the narrative,” one person who knows Wennmachers said. </p><p>Wennmachers deployed industry gossip and access to her firm’s partners to stay in the good favor of many reporters. </p><p>One communications executive at an Andreessen Horowitz portfolio company recalled Wennmachers fishing for information about an upcoming story on behalf of reporters. Wennmachers pushed to deliver the information to the reporters herself, this executive said. </p><p>A high-powered rival PR executive described Wennmachers as an enforcer: “<em>You don't cross us and if you do, we shut off the information flow.</em>”</p><p>One member of the press recalled Wennmachers chasing down a potential bit of news. When Wennmachers returned the call and threw cold water on the story, the reporter took it in stride. Wennmachers told the reporter that they were now a “friend of the firm.” The comment struck the reporter as odd. They were just trying to get the facts right. But Wennmachers’ attitude seemed to reflect a coziness that she had come to expect from reporters dutifully covering Silicon Valley. </p><p>Wennmachers regularly hosted salon-style dinners at her home near the Presidio in San Francisco with reporters, portfolio companies, and the firm’s partners. While it’s not unusual for a venture capital firm to host reporters for a dinner, Wennmachers did it better than anyone else. When I attended one of her dinners in 2014, it felt like I’d finally gotten invited inside the Silicon Valley. &nbsp;</p><p>“I was invited to dinner at her house with members of the media. It was incredible,” one founder recalled. “That was like a cool invitation. If you were in the press you were really excited about getting dinner at Margit’s house, which is kind of mind-blowing if you think about it.” </p><p>Wennmachers can put on a friendly façade, but if you spend much time with her you come to realize that she’s a profoundly serious person. She doesn’t win over reporters because she’s fun. It’s because she cuts through the bullshit. She fundamentally understands what makes a good story. She knows what motivates reporters better than many reporters. That’s part of what makes the firm’s turn against the media so worrying.</p><p>Back in that early media heyday, Wennmachers doled the firm’s partners out to media companies who were eager to have them speak at lucrative conferences. And the firm’s partners were game to prophesize in audacious terms about what the future might look like, filling column inches.</p><p>Swisher and Wennmachers – two women who climbed their way to dominance in an industry overrun with men – are friendly to this day. Many Silicon Valley insiders strongly suspect that Wennmachers was one of Swisher’s sources when she covered Silicon Valley’s day-to-day dramas. But Swisher describes Wennmachers as fiercely loyal to her own companies, though Wennmachers “also did not pretend a problem I might call about was not one.” </p><p>Marc Andreessen himself had a cozy relationship with reporters like Swisher. "Marc is fully in charge of his own communications and has over time stopped wanting to deal with the press for lots of reasons, including some mistakes he made.” </p><p>From 2009 through 2015, Andreessen Horowitz earned a run of truly phenomenal press coverage, catapulting itself into the very top echelon of venture capital firms – at least based on its reputation. The media loved that bald headed internet geek and his gruff business guru sidekick. And over cocktails or lunch at the Battery, reporters probed Wennmachers for information, even if she rarely earned a mention in their stories. </p><p>Then the magazine writer <strong>Tad Friend </strong>pitched a profile of Marc Andreessen for the <em>New Yorker</em>. Wennmachers already saw the firm’s position in the popular consciousness beginning to shift. The firm was no longer an exciting upstart. “At that point I was at a stage where it was like ‘enough.’ ‘We're done talking about ourselves,’” Wennmachers said in the podcast interview. On the other hand, she reasoned, “The <em>New Yorker</em> is the <em>New Yorker</em>, so how often is the <em>New Yorker</em> going to write the definitive piece on venture capital? Once in a decade? Maybe? Well, do I want that to be about whoever or do I want that to be about us? At that point, I want to occupy that spot?” </p><p>She decided to do the story – though of course <em>she</em> wouldn’t occupy it. She merited a single passing mention. Marc Andreessen’s shiny head was the focus instead.</p><p>The story ran in May 2015, with the title, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/tomorrows-advance-man">Tomorrow’s Advance Man</a>.” The glowing portrait instantly became one of the seminal stories on the venture capital industry.</p><p>Despite running more than 10,000 words, the article made a single passing mention of one of Andreessen Horowitz’s most important investments, Zenefits. The firm had backed up the truck to invest in <strong>Parker Conrad’s</strong> human resources software company and hyped it in the press. But cracks had started to appear. By the end of 2015, Buzzfeed reporter <strong>Will Alden</strong> had planted the seeds of Zenefit’s unraveling, raising questions about whether the company’s health insurance brokers were properly licensed. </p><p>That same year, John Carreyrou revealed that Theranos had “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901">struggled with its blood testing technology</a>.” Theranos had mostly raised money outside of Silicon Valley. But some venture capitalists tied their reputations to defending the company anyway. Marc Andreessen, who tweeted prolifically at the time, appeared to develop an affinity for blocking people who tweeted negatively about Theranos. </p><p>For reporters – and especially their editors – the Theranos story was a sign that tech reporters needed to take a more critical eye towards the startups they covered. Carreyrou was an investigative reporter, not on the Silicon Valley beat at all. Tech reporters shouldn’t have missed Theranos’s shortcomings. So, they redoubled their efforts.</p><p>Then, indeed, Andreessen Horowitz found itself with a troubled portfolio company of its own. In May 2016, I reported<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-zenefits/?sref=WS92jZg5"> in Businessweek</a> about Zenefit’s self-disruption. Many other tech reporters also dug into the company’s failings.  </p><p>Behind the scenes, <strong>Kim Milosevich</strong>, then Wennmachers’ top lieutenant, went to task pointing much of the blame for the company’s implosion on its co-founder <strong>Parker Conrad</strong> – who certainly deserved a big portion of the credit for the company’s problems. </p><p>But Andreessen Horowitz partner <strong>Lars Dalgaard</strong> had cheered Conrad on, telling Conrad to double the company’s revenue growth target, I reported back then. Zenefits was the company Andreessen Horowitz wanted to grow, grow, grow. Years earlier, Ben Horowitz himself had <a href="https://a16z.com/2010/03/17/the-case-for-the-fat-startup/">penned an essay</a> making the case for “fat startups,” ones that spend aggressively to block out their competitors. Zenefits seemed to be running that playbook. </p><p>But as the company’s business started to falter and with mounting regulatory risk, Horowitz stepped in to help push Conrad to step aside. The firm laid the blame at Conrad’s feet. And <strong>David Sacks</strong>, who had been the company’s chief operating officer, was sold to the world as a turnaround CEO. </p><p>That same year, the press started to turn its attention to Andreessen Horowitz itself, wondering if this firm really lived up to all the hype we’d been fed over the years. </p><p>My occasional bridge partner, <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter <strong>Rolfe Winkler</strong>, wrote in …</p></div></div>

January 20, 2021 | https://blog.maiot.io/is-your-ml-reproducible/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.maiot.io/is-your-ml-reproducible/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-content">
    <div id="blogpost">
        <p>It is now widely agreed that <a href="https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2020/08/31/5-reproducibility/">reproducibility is an important aspect of any scientific endeavor</a>.  With Machine Learning being a scientific discipline, as well as an engineering one, reproducibility is equally important here.</p>

<p>There is widespread fear in the ML community that we are living through a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-confronts-reproducibility-crisis">reproducibility crisis</a>. Efforts like the <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020">Papers with Code Reproducibility Challenge</a>, signaled a clear call-to-action for practitioners, after a 2016 Nature survey revealed that <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970">70% of results are non-reproducible</a>.</p>

<p>While a lot of the talk amongst the community has centered on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389920300933">reproducing machine learning results in research</a>, there has been less focus on the production side of things. Therefore, today letâ€™s focus more on the topic of reproducible ML in production and create a larger conversation around it.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-reproducibility-important">Why is reproducibility important?</h2>

<p>
  â€œIf you canâ€™t repeat it, you canâ€™t trust itâ€� - All Ops Teams
</p>

<p>A good question to start with is why exactly reproducibility is important, for machine learning in particular. Here are list of benefits one gains by ensuring reproducibility:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Increases <strong>trust</strong></li>
  <li>Promotes <strong>explainability</strong> of ML results</li>
  <li>Increases <strong>reliability</strong></li>
  <li>Fulfills <strong>ethical</strong>, <strong>legal</strong>, and <strong>regulatory</strong> requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>Concretely, ML models tend to go through a lifecycle of being destroyed, forged anew and re-created as <a href="https://blog.maiot.io/technical_debt/">development evolves from rudimentary notebook snippets to a testable, productionized codebase</a>. Therefore, we better make sure that every time a model is (re-) trained, the results are what we expect them to be.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-big-deal">Whatâ€™s the big deal?</h2>
<p>One would think that reproducibility in production ML should be easy. After all, most machine learning is scripting. How hard can it be to simply execute a bunch of scripts again at a later stage and come to the exact same result, right?</p>

<p><strong>wrong</strong></p>

<p>Reproducibility of machine learning is hard because it spans many different disciplines, from understanding non-deterministic algorithmic behaviors, to software engineering best practices. Leaving aside the fact that most machine learning code quality tends to err towards the low side (due to the experimental nature of the work), there is an inherent complexity to ML which makes things even harder.</p>

<p>E.g. Just training a model on the same data with the same configuration does not mean the same model is produced. Perhaps one could achieve a similar <em>overall</em> accuracy (or whatever other metric), but even a slight change in parameters might skew metrics for slices of your data - leading to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai">sometimes very unpleasant results</a></p>

<p>So, how can we ensure that stuff like does not happen? In my opinion, one can break down reproducibility in the following aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The code</li>
  <li>The configuration</li>
  <li>The environment</li>
  <li>The data</li>
</ul>

<p>Letâ€™s look at each of these in turn.</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>
<p>Checking code into a version control system like Git ensures a clean trace of how code evolves, and the ability to rollback to any point in history. However, Git alone is not a fix for reproducibility, but only for one aspect of it.</p>

<p>In reality, reproducibility in production is solved by version control, testing of code as well as integrations, and idempotent deployment automation. This is hard to apply in practice. E.g. The main tool for ML is Jupyter notebooks, which are notoriously difficult to check into version control. Even worse, most notebook code is not sequential in its execution, and can have an arbitrary, impossible to reproduce, sequence of execution.</p>

<p>But even if ML practitioners follow a pattern of refactoring their code into separate modules, simply checking modules into source control is still not enough to ensure reproducibility. One needs to link the commit history to model training runs and models. This can be achieved e.g. by enforcing a standard in your team that pins a git sha to experiment runs. That way there is a global unique ID that ties the code and configuration (see below) to the results it produced.</p>

<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<p>Software Engineering preaches separation of application code and application configuration to allow for predictable and deterministic software behavior across environments. This actually translates well in a machine learning code: E.g. one can separate the model definition and training loop code, from the associated hyper-parameters which define the configuration.</p>

<p>The first step to unlock reproducibility is to actually separate configuration from code in the first place. For me this means, the code itself should NOT define:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Features</li>
  <li>Labels</li>
  <li>Split parameters (e.g. 80-20 split)</li>
  <li>Preprocessing parameters (e.g. the fact that data was normalized)</li>
  <li>Training hyper-parameters (including pre-processing parameters)</li>
  <li>Evaluation criteria, .e.g, metrics</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally all these are tracked separately in a <a href="https://blog.maiot.io/declarative_configs_for_mlops/">declarative config</a> that is human readable.</p>

<h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>
<p>If a ML result is produced on a dev local machine, there is a high chance it is not going to be reproducible. Why? Because developers, especially relatively inexperienced ones, are not super diligent in creating and maintaining proper virtual environments.</p>

<p>The obvious solution for this one is containerizing applications, with lets say, <a href="https://docker.com/">Docker</a>. However, here is another example of when skills of ML practitioners begin diverging from conventional software engineers. Most data scientists are not trained in these matters, and require proper organizational support to help and encourage them to produce containerized applications.</p>

<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>And finally, we arrive at the data. Data versioning has become one of the most discussed topics in the production machine learning community. Unlike code, you canâ€™t simply check data into version control easily (although tools like <a href="https://dvc.org/">DVC</a> are attempting just that).</p>

<p>In the same way as code, achieving basic versioning of data does not necessarily ensure reproducibility. There is a whole bunch of metadata associated with how data is utilized in machine learning development, all of which is necessary to persist to ensure trainings are reproducible.</p>

<p>Here is a simple, but common, example that illustrates this point. If you have ever worked with machine learning, have you ever created a folder/storage bucket somewhere that has random files in varying preprocessing states? Something like, <code>normalized_1.json</code> or perhaps even timestamped <code>12_02_19.csv</code>? Technically, a timestamped file is versioned data, but that does not mean associated runs with it are reproducible: One would have to know how, when and where (i.e. the aforementioned metadata) these versioned files are used to ensure reproducibility.</p>

<h3 id="concrete-example">Concrete Example</h3>
<p>While it may fall outside the scope of this blog, the open-source MLOps framework ZenML showcases a clear example 
of putting these principles in action <a href="https://docs.zenml.io/benefits/ensuring-ml-reproducibility.html">here</a></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Reproducibility in machine learning is not trivial, and ensuring it in production is even harder. ML teams need to be fully aware of the precise aspects to track in their processes to unlock reproducibility.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re looking for a head start to enable reproducibility: check out <a href="https://github.com/maiot-io/zenml">ZenML</a>, an open-source MLOps framework for reproducible machine learning - and leave a star while youâ€™re there.</p>

This makes Windows servers the top choice for remote desktop connections.</p><p>To run GUI applications, you may have tried VNC (Virtual Network Computing) or xRDP to remotely connect with your Ubuntu server just to realize that it’s not the smooth computing experience you came for!</p><p>A great alternative to the typical VNC network is X2Go.</p><p>In this article, we’ll discuss the step-by-step process of connecting to an Ubuntu 20.04 remote desktop using X2Go. We’ll also explain why X2Go is a much better option compared to other remote desktop solutions like VNC.</p><h2 id="what-is-x2go">What is X2Go?</h2><p>X2Go is a remote desktop solution that lets you connect with another computer and control it remotely. A few keys features of X2Go are:</p><ul><li>It supports all operating systems including, Linux, Ubuntu, Windows, CentOS, Fedora, and Mac OS.</li><li>It supports voice transmission to the connected systems.</li><li>Multiple users and individual desktop sessions can connect with a single X2Go server at the same time.</li><li>It provides a smooth experience even over low bandwidth.</li></ul><h2 id="when-and-how-is-x2go-helpful">When and How is X2Go Helpful?</h2><p>X2Go can prove to be useful in a variety of scenarios:</p><ul><li>You need to access a Linux-based operating system such as Ubuntu complete with a desktop environment and can’t install it locally.</li><li>You need more resources than your personal computer can provide. For instance, you want to compile a file that’ll take hours making your PC unavailable for long periods of time. Running it on a remote desktop will leave your PC to do whatever you want!</li><li>You want your team to be able to access the resources and benefit from a common computer.</li><li>You want to use the same desktop environment with the same setup, tools, file, and performance from anywhere in the world.</li></ul><h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2><p>Before setting up X2Go we recommend you have:</p><ul><li>A server running Ubuntu 20.04 with at least 2GB RAM.</li><li>A user with <code data-enlighter-language="raw">sudo privileges</code> and SSH key (you can either use SSH keys or set up a password). We recommend a&nbsp;<strong>non-root sudo user</strong> instead of acting as root. This is because when you’re loggen in as root you can do everything and the system won’t ask, so you won’t get to think twice. You could mistakenly run a command that would destroy your system and you’ll wish that the system asked you if you’re sure so you could’ve thought twice.</li></ul><p><strong>So, let’s begin.</strong></p><h2 id="step-1-install-x2go-on-the-server">Step 1 – Install X2Go on the Server</h2><p>The first step is to install <strong>X2Go on the server</strong>. X2Go basically comes with two components:</p><ol><li><strong>Server:</strong> start and manages the graphical session on the remote computer</li><li><strong>Client:</strong> installed on your local computer to view and control the remote desktop</li></ol><p>To install the X2Go server on Ubuntu 20.04, you’ll need to add the X2Go PPA (Personal Package Archive) repository for Ubuntu first. Your server may not have the <strong>add-apt-repository</strong> command available<strong>. </strong>To fix that, run the following command:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="shell">sudo apt install software-properties-common</pre><p>Next, add the X2Go’s PPA:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="shell">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:x2go/stable</pre><p>Now, update the software package database:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="shell">sudo apt update</pre><p>Finally you can install the X2Go server:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="shell">sudo apt install x2goserver x2goserver-xsession</pre><p>During the installation you’ll be asked to select your preferred Language and Keyboard Layout. Input the number corresponding to your preference and hit ENTER when you’re prompted to do so.</p><h2 id="step-2-install-your-preferred-desktop-environment">Step 2 – Install Your Preferred Desktop Environment</h2><p>In this tutorial, we’ll be installing the XFCE, LXDE and MATE minimal desktop environments for X2Go.</p><p>We’ve also mentioned how to install <strong>GNOME</strong>, even though we haven’t gotten it to work with X2Go.</p><p>XFCE doesn’t use fancy graphical effects like composting which makes it light-weight, hence more compatible with X2Go. LXDE and MATE also work well with composting disabled.</p><p><strong>Display Manager</strong><br> At some point during the install you may also be prompted to choose what default <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/display_manager#Graphical" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" title="Display Manager - ArchWiki" data-wpel-link="external">Graphical Display Manager<span></span></a> you want to install.

    <div>
        <p>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has completed a regulation permitting low volume motor vehicle manufacturers to begin selling replica cars that resemble vehicles produced at least 25 years ago. Congress enacted a DeLorean Motor Company-backed bill backed by the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) DeLorean Motor Company, and others into law in 2015, which streamlined requirements for small automakers, but implementation was delayed while awaiting the NHTSA regulations. Companies like DeLorean will now be able to apply for authorization to produce and sell vehicles under this program.</p>
<p>The recent release of the final rule document was unexpected, and we’re very pleased to see it finally happen. Still, four years overdue with no clear idea of when (or if!) these would ever be released did certainly keep us from putting too many eggs in that stainless steel basket, so to speak.</p>
<p>Some previous suppliers that we had lined up have gone out of business during the pandemic, others have been absorbed by larger companies that have made it clear low volume component production is not something they’re interested in pursuing. In that regard there will be a fair amount of work to be re-done. Perhaps worse, some “champions” we had at various suppliers have retired or moved on. In some cases this has left a void, where before there was a DeLorean fan, who rallied for us within their company and management.</p>
<p>Additionally, certain staffing candidates that were on our short-list have long since moved on in and while unemployment has increased during 2020, many of the specialized roles that we require are still hard to fill.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, in 2015 our planned engine had a life-cycle of emissions compliance through 2022. We had hoped to get into production by 2017 and get 3-4 years out of it before having to take on the engineering for a new powertrain. It’s believed that this engine has been extended through perhaps 2024 now, but it doesn’t seem like a good idea to plan around an engine so near its end-of-life.</p>
<p>That said, with EV’s becoming more mainstream, we’ve been considering switching to an all-electric as the future. It certainly makes for an easier path through emissions maze which still looms large over any internal combustion engine. While an electric Cobra or Morgan may be a little extreme for their potential market, we’ve already seen that an EV DeLorean – as we displayed at the 2012 New York International Auto Show – is not such an “out there” idea.</p>
<p>Most critically, financial markets have changed, and will change even more as the world navigates the continuing COVID crisis during the Biden administration. Will the financial support that we had lined up a few years ago to carry us through the final development and into production still be available?</p>
<p>As the automotive brand with likely the highest name recognition across all demographics in spite of not having a new product in 40 years, we still believe that none of the above is insurmountable and believe that others will see value in it, as well.</p>
<p>Stay tuned…</p>

		<p><span>As branding strategies evolve, tech companies continue to find ways to use white-labeling to create profitable apps. White-labeling refers to creating a foundational product or service that can be rebranded and further customized by other companies. This model </span><span>provides a way to service many brands with one product that still looks unique to end users. </span><span>In a previous blog post on </span><a href="https://www.inspiringapps.com/blog/mobile-industry/fintech-and-mobile-app-development/"><span>fintech and mobile app development</span></a><span>, we discussed the capacity of white-labeling to improve app integration and deliver data-driven tools. While there are many advantages associated with the decision to white-label a product, it is not without its challenges. We share our insights on the topic below. Learn how to use white-labeling to create profitable apps given the inherent strengths and limitations of the model.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Although the practice of white-labeling apps exists across various industries, the business model for all brands is the same. Suppose you want to create a white-labeled “all resorts” app to service property management companies. This app would need to include features that appeal to virtually all resort managers. For example, the app could include the ability to view specific amenities of a resort upon selection. Property managers could further customize the app each time a resort is added to the product.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Although creating one product that services multiples resorts is </span>more efficient, this technique has its limitations. A significant con to white-labeling is the appearance of a lack of uniqueness. Using the all resorts app as an example, this product may be less appealing to individual resorts since they don’t want to be listed side-by-side in the same app with their competitors. Resorts would prefer to own their customer relationship and create the impression that they’ve done something unique to serve them.</p>
<p><span>On the other hand, the model benefits property managers because it is more efficient to maintain one app. It also simplifies things for users since they only need one app to access information about multiple resorts. White-labeled products also cut out the time and expense required to build users’ trust. Instead, companies deliver customized products to their existing loyal customer base. A customer who is familiar with a particular property management company is more likely to book a resort from its app. For this reason, white-labeling is especially useful to industries in which trust is paramount. This is why financial and medical institutions rely heavily on white-labeling.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Considerations for Developing a Profitable White-labeled Product&nbsp;</b></h3>
<h4><b>Limitations on brand-specific features&nbsp;</b><b>&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>Limitations on brand-specific features substantially impact how producers use white-labeling to create profitable apps. Brands invariably request new features that may only be relevant to them. Offering no brand-specific customization is easiest for white-label providers. The more brand-specific features added to an app, the more difficult it is to maintain the app over time. It is tempting to individualize features in order to appease customers. The temptation is especially strong when a business is starting and revenue is especially critical. However, restricting the number of brand-specific features is key to profitability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The cost to develop a white-labeled product is relatively low at the start. Expenses grow over time as more brands (with more needs) are added to the platform. Ideally developers should strive to flatten out the expense curve so that the cost to add a new brand to the app is small. Setting limits on brand-specific customization is key to reaching this goal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>Publishing Requirements&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>The adoption of white-labeled products by multiple companies results in the availability of similar looking products that market themselves as being unique to a specific brand. This outcome inevitably presents a challenge to using white-labeling to create profitable digital products.&nbsp; It has also contributed to some pushback from Apple. Initially Apple chose to reject&nbsp; submissions from white-label providers</span><span>. Apple later relaxed its policy to allow white-labeled products to be created so long as each brand creates its own developer account and publishes its rebranded app through that account. This stipulation aims to strike a balance between Apple’s interest in an “app store cleanup” and the growing popularity of white-labeled products.&nbsp; Developers interested in creating profitable white-labeled products need to stay informed of these evolving restrictions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>Adequate Specificity&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>The design of white-labeled products needs to be general enough to be adopted by multiple brands yet specific enough to capitalize on niche markets and their goals. For example, </span><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-s-first-white-label-gaming-laptop-now-available-for-2200-will-be-adapted-by-resellers-like-Maingear-Schenker-and-Eluktronics.434609.0.html"><span>Intel used white-labeling to create a gaming laptop</span></a><span> that’s similar to a lot of other laptops but also has qualities that appeal to a specific market. The new product for gaming enthusiasts is conducive to white-labeling due to features including “</span><span>an advanced cooling system, excellent performance, great build quality, a light chassis, and shockingly good battery life.” The same connection between profitability and embodiment of a middle ground between generic and targeted features exists for white-labeled apps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>Alignment with Emerging Trends&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>The most profitable white-labeled products provide services that are becoming increasingly popular. If relabeled products don’t reflect relevant trends, then they are unlikely to provide a launching point from which multiple brands can service a growing need. White-labeled products that are at the forefront of new trends are also able to acquire data that will become increasingly valuable over time. An example of a timely white-labeled product is<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fintech-junior-focus/cash-cards-for-kids-digital-banks-race-to-capture-the-next-generation-idINKBN27Y0RY"> Greenlight</a>, a debit card for kids that was recently white-labeled by Chase</span><span>. Fintech is now essential to personal banking. Therefore, apps that capitalize on this growing trend will be highly valuable to top brands.&nbsp;</span></p>

January 20, 2021 | https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/post/task-management-assumptions/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/post/task-management-assumptions/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Most task managers make two assumptions. Do you make them too?</p>
<ol>
<li><em>A task manager needs to remember all of your tasks</em> <br>(Would you buy a task manager that lost data?)</li>
<li><em>All tasks can use a similar creation workflow</em> <br>(You hit the ‘create issue’ button, and fill in some fields. Simple, obvious, how could it be better?)</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s not obvious that they’re wrong—they actually seem <em>useful</em>. But both at work, and at home, making these assumptions will reduce your effectiveness.</p>
<p>And if you have trouble context-switching, procrastinate tasks, or have an ever-growing task backlog that looms over your head, these assumptions have likely caused you unnecessary pain.</p>
<p>Here’s how they hurt us, and how to stop it from happening.</p>
<h2 id="permanent-tasks-cause-fatigue">Permanent tasks cause fatigue</h2>
<p>Before starting Tandem, my manager Tim previously co-founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/01/yahoo-acquires-to-do-app-astrid/">Astrid</a>, a personal task manager, which he later sold to Yahoo.</p>
<p>At Astrid, Tim tried an interesting re-engagement email. Users who had been inactive for 6 weeks were asked: “want to delete all your tasks and start fresh?”</p>
<p>The hypothesis was that these inactive users had tasks that overwhelmed them. Either the amount, the complexity, or the low importance of backlogged tasks, caused users to put tasks off. So every time these users visited Astrid, they saw tasks they couldn’t do, felt bad, and eventually stopped visiting—procrastination in action. Astrid’s re-engagement email offered the users a chance to start fresh.</p>
<p>It was impressively compelling. Most re-engagement emails get a 1% response rate. This email had about 5%.</p>
<p>I imagine those users had the same feeling you get when you move from one browser to another, or from one task manager to another, and leave your bookmarks, open tabs, backlogged tasks, to start fresh in the name of increased productivity.</p>
<p>But simply deleting the backlog doesn’t end the cycle.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nowadays, Tim uses a simpler task manager—a notebook. He uses a page a day, adds some tasks from JIRA, and when tasks come in during the day, he writes them down and works on them when he’s available. These are mostly small tasks, things that are easy to forget. If he gets a bug (important to track) or a task he can delegate, he puts it in JIRA.</p>
<p>The notebook isn’t meant to store issues forever. The pages get turned, and previous information becomes less accessible. So the next day, if he needs to carry over something that hasn’t been completed, he needs to make the conscious decision to do so.</p>
<p>This solution solves task-management fatigue. And incidentally, it solves another problem:</p>
<h2 id="not-all-tasks-are-created-the-same">Not all tasks are created the same</h2>
<p>There is a gap in task management. When we look at the tools used for tracking tasks and goals, there’s something for every level of the company:</p>
<br>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Level</th>
<th>Goal</th>
<th>Tool</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Company quarter-level</td>
<td>Quarterly Goals</td>
<td>Notion/Gdocs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Org quarter-level</td>
<td>KPIs</td>
<td>Notion/Gdocs, JIRA Epics</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Team sprint-level</td>
<td>Tickets</td>
<td>JIRA Tasks/Bugs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Personal day-level</td>
<td>???</td>
<td>???</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Except at the personal day-level, where you’re working on tickets, getting requests for feature updates from your PM, bug discoveries from QA, and breaking down your actual tickets into different tasks, which may require subtasks that weren’t anticipated.</p>
<p>One proposal is that you should track all of these tasks, no matter how small, in JIRA. But the teams I see successful at implementing this are those that can afford to work at a slower, more “enterprise” pace. Which isn’t a problem—at least for engineering—but it’s often not an option at smaller startups, when learning cycles must be fast.</p>
<p><em>Even if you work at a larger company, at a slower pace, you may relate when it comes to personal life: tasks come from a variety of directions, at all times. You can’t toss every minor task in a task manager.</em></p>
<p>You can’t fix every task before the next one comes in. If you only use JIRA, you choose between possibly forgetting these small tasks, or breaking your train of thought to search, categorize, and fill out a form every time you get a small task.</p>
<p>On the flip side, quickly writing these down in a temporary place means that <strong>you don’t need to</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend mental effort remembering minor tasks,</li>
<li>or take significant time to file minor issues.</li>
<li>Have your task manager filled with minor issues you’ve forgotten to close,</li>
<li>or leave hastily-written issues for later, when you forget what the vaguely titled issue is for.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="correcting-for-the-mistakes">Correcting for the mistakes</h2>
<p>The solution is not complicated: use a temporary, personal task manager.</p>
<p>Don’t go out and buy something new. You already have something you can use at home. Tim’s notebook is a good example. I personally message myself on Slack (and iMessage, for personal use).</p>
<details zgotmplz="">
<summary>An example of how I Slack myself</summary>
<div>
<h4 id="using-slack-for-daily-personal-tasks">Using Slack for daily personal tasks</h4>
<p>When I’m working, and get a non-urgent task that would otherwise interrupt me, it goes in my Slack DMs. This is what it looks like:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/IMG_7647.jpg">
</p>
<p>Some days are quiet</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/IMG_7644.jpg">
</p>
<p>And some are hectic</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the morning, to re-build yesterday’s context, I just look at yesterday’s list. If there are unfinished items, I can carry them over. But it’s a conscious decision. I don’t need to carry over optional, low-priority tasks.</p>
<p>And if you’ve got a bad memory, there’s a huge benefit for team stand-ups. I used to write JQL filters to search JIRA (doesn’t work—and misses tasks), now I just take a look at Slack.</p>
</div>
</details>
<p>The important requirements are just that your task manager:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requires effort to carry over old tasks.</li>
<li>Makes writing down tasks quick.</li>
<li>Isn’t used for notes <em>(anecdotally, this adds noise, and forces you to parse notes from tasks)</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a task is critical, long term, or requires cooperation, file it in your normal issue tracker. Otherwise, it’s probably a daily, personal task, and you can file it in here.</p>
<p>So take out a notebook, open Slack, pick what works for you. And see if you don’t feel calmer and more in control of your tasks.</p>
<hr>


<p>I think these tools have interesting ideas to help individuals manage tasks.</p>
<h3 id="amna">Amna</h3>
<p>Ravi, my old college roommate and friend since high school, left Microsoft to build <a href="https://www.getamna.com/">Amna</a>, a personal task manager with tight browser integration.</p>
<p>I resonate with the thesis: recently I switched away from Firefox Tree Style Tabs, because I noticed that by organizing my tabs (which were part of tasks), it inadvertently became a de-facto task manager. But it wasn’t built for that!</p>
<p>Amna solves that exact problem: each task you do spawns a browser that keeps all of your relevant tabs.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/amna1.jpg">
</p>
<p>All the tabs in this browser window are related to the same task, and Amna keeps their state when I close the browser.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/amna2.jpg">
</p>
<p>After I'm done with a task, I can go back and look at the tabs I had open.</p>
</div>
<p>It helps prevent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muscle-memory opening HN, clicking an interesting blog post, and leaving it open “to read later” for several weeks</li>
<li>The pain of trawling through bookmarks and browser history, when you realize you forgot something</li>
<li>The clutter of leaving tabs open to prevent forgetting something</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve forgotten a time when you had less than five tabs open, <a href="https://www.getamna.com/">try using Amna</a>.</p>
<h3 id="jam">Jam</h3>
<p>Two of my ex-Cloudflare friends, Dani and Irtefa, started <a href="https://jam.dev/">Jam</a>. It’s probably the fastest way for PMs/designers to directly make comments on a website. So you get less minor interruptions, and more clarity on the requested change.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/jam2.jpg">
</p>
<p>All you do is type `jam` on the page, click an element, and type the comment</p>
</div>
<p>But I don’t include Jam here just for that. Jam also allows you to <a href="https://words.jam.dev/introducing-jam-wand/">offload the actual copy changes</a> to your PM, which flat-out decreases your minor tasks. If this sounds exciting, get on the waitlist <a href="https://jam.dev/">here</a>.</p>

In this article, I'll be discussing some of the studies that have covered this subject along with some of the solutions to reduce the amount of blue light you're being subjected to.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-cpun"><span>What is Blue Light?</span></h2><p id="viewer-bj5bp"><span>Sunlight is composed of red, yellow, orange, green, and blue light rays and many shades of each of these colours, depending on the energy and wavelength of the individual rays (otherwise known as <!-- -->electromagnetic radiation<!-- -->). Combined, this spectrum of coloured light rays creates sunlight called “white light”.</span></p><p id="viewer-bc2fl"><span>Without getting into the details, there is an inverse relationship between the wavelength of light rays and the amount of energy they contain.</span></p><p id="viewer-825iu"><span>This means that the rays on the red end of the visible light spectrum have longer wavelengths and, therefore, less energy. On the other hand, rays on the blue end of the spectrum have shorter wavelengths and more energy.</span></p><p id="viewer-15gnj"><span>Not all colours of light have the same effect. Blue wavelengths are beneficial during daylight hours because they boost your mood, attention and reaction times, however, studies suggest they're more disruptive at night.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-65vu6"><span>What exposes you to Blue Light?</span></h2><p id="viewer-bi01v"><span>Although sunlight is the biggest source of Blue Light that you'll be subjected too, here are some of the others:</span></p><ul><li id="viewer-cugnd"><p>LED light</p></li><li id="viewer-di5pk"><p>Fluorescent light</p></li><li id="viewer-ads93"><p>Flat-screen LED televisions</p></li><li id="viewer-7b2ak"><p>Computer monitors</p></li><li id="viewer-ep37g"><p>Smartphones and tablet screens</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-5valn"><span>Although you receive a lot less Blue Light from these sources than from the sun, it's the fact that we tend to use them more and more before going to bed that is of concern.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-qt2o"><span><strong><span>Suggested Articles:</span></strong></span></h3><ul><li id="viewer-apq6a"><p><strong>🚄 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/hyperloop-the-future-of-travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Hyperloop, the future of travel?</u></strong></a><strong>

After exposing mice to lights that were different in hue but equal brightness and assessing their subsequent activity, the researchers concluded that yellow light actually seems to disturb sleep more than blue.

For the last 2 years I’ve been working on a web browser that now cannot be completed because Google, the creators of the <em>open source</em> browser Chrome, won’t allow DRM in an <em>open source</em> project.</p><p>The browser I’m building, called <a href="https://github.com/samuelmaddock/metastream">Metastream</a>, is an Electron-based (Chromium derived), MIT-licensed browser hosted on GitHub. Its main feature is the ability to playback videos on the web, synchronized with other peers. Each client runs its own instance of the Metastream browser and transmits playback information to keep them in sync—no audio or video content is sent.</p><p>If someone is creating a browser that wants to playback media, they’ll soon discover the requirement of DRM for larger web media services such as Netflix and Hulu. There are a few DRM providers for the web including Widevine, PlayReady, and FairPlay.</p><p>As far as I’m aware, Widevine is the only available DRM for a Chromium-based browser, especially so for Electron. Chromium accounts for roughly <strong>70% market share</strong> of all web browsers, soon to include <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-building-chromium-powered-web-browser-windows-10">Microsoft’s upcoming Edge browser rewrite</a>. Waiting 4 months for a minimal response from a vendor with such a large percentage of the market is unacceptable.</p><p>This isn’t something I’m alone in either, <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/12427">several Electron users</a> have waited months for a response. More prominently, the creators of Brave Browser also had <a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/issues/10449#issuecomment-323800130">issues waiting for replies from Google Widevine</a>.</p><blockquote><p>“This is a prime example for why free as in beer is not enough. Small share browsers are at the mercy of Google, and Google is stalling us for no communicated-to-us reason.”<br>- Brian Bondy, Co-founder &amp; CTO of Brave</p></blockquote><p>I’m now only left with two options regarding the fate of Metastream: stop development of a desktop browser version, or pivot my project to a browser extension with reduced features. The latter requiring publishing to the Google Chrome Web Store which would further entrench the project into a Google walled garden.</p><p>If you know of any way to help out, <a href="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/contact">please get in touch</a>.</p><p><strong>April 4th edit:</strong> No response from Google Widevine yet. Because a few folks asked, here is the <a href="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/widevine/gmail-thread.html">full email exchange I had with Widevine</a>.

<p>The downloads of open-source and commercial packages are done from different systems, despite using the same installer application.

    <div>
        <div>
            
            <p>In June of 1812 Napoleon assembled the largest European army in history and invaded Russia. After months of bloody fighting, the French finally arrived in Moscow in September, surprised to find that the city mostly abandoned. That night, remaining Russians set fires across the city, eventually burning most of it to the ground. After camping in the ruins for a month, Napoleon realized that the Russians had no intention to sue for peace, supplies were dwindling, and their prospects over the winter were bleak without a living city to sustain them. In October, the French retreated, eventually leaving Russia in defeat in December.</p>

<p>It turns out that the body fights viruses using a similar tactic.</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard that T-cells are important to immunity to COVID-19. But what exactly do T-cells do? How do you get immunity? What’s the difference in what happens after exposure to the virus in an immune person?</p>

<p>It’s debated if the Russians intended to completely destroy Moscow, but never mind. Imagine you wanted to implement “destroy our cities ahead of the French” as a deliberate strategy. If so, you’d want to be <em>very careful</em> that the French were actually coming before burning one down.  Information moves slowly, scouts can be unreliable, and you aren’t totally sure what the French army looks like from a distance. You’d probably require the city authorities vote unanimously before going ahead. It’s better to risk the French capturing a city than to risk a false alarm.</p>

<p>But suppose you have a unit that fought the French for a month and captured some uniforms and equipment. You could distribute these soldiers and detritus to different cities, with orders that cities be immediately burned when they say so. Since they are familiar with the French they will burn a city only when needed.</p>

<p>That’s kind of how the immune system works. All our cells are built with a “self-destruct” mechanism built in. When there is a viral infection, our T-cells activate this mechanism on all the nearby cells to deny the virus any place to replicate. The body doesn’t want this to happen by mistake. (That’s how you get autoimmune disease.) For that reason, T-cells require a lot of signal that there’s an invasion before they activate, meaning a long ramp-up period. However, when activated, some T-cells will store specific patterns from the virus, become “memory” T-cells. These move around the body and are programmed to activate very quickly, but <em>only when they see the specific pattern they have stored</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p>I came to this strange analogy after pestering my biologist friends to explain COVID-19 to me. My logic was that articles for experts assume a Biologist Mental Toolkit that I lack, but it should be possible to give more detail to someone like me with a Generic Science Background. With their <em>enormous</em> forbearance, I was able to extract an explanation that could fit into my tiny non-biologist brain. This post gives that explanation in the form of a fictional interview.</p>

<p>Here are some of the other most surprising things I learned:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>So much signaling.</strong> The immune system is mostly a madhouse of everything signaling everything else, and rarely “doing” anything. Maybe this is a deep strategy to counter autoiommune disorders or parasites or cancer? It’s hard to say.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A machine that makes a machine make a machine that makes a machine.</strong> Everyone knows that viruses use cells to make proteins. But the COVID-19 virus is a bunch of proteins, <em>plus RNA that says how to make all the proteins</em>. How does the virus make copies of the RNA itself? The virus builds an enzyme inside the cell that makes copies the RNA.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Immunity and memory cells.</strong>  Immunity isn’t really about antibodies. It’s about memory B-cells which make antibodies (and do other stuff) and memory T-cells which trigger other cells’ suicide program (and do other stuff).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Why we need memory cells.</strong> Memory B-cells remember how to make virus-specific antibodies. But T-cells just sort of kill everything nearby. Regular T-cells can already sense foreign proteins and can already do their job, so why do we need memory T-cells? It seems to be an issue of <em>tuning</em>. Regular T-cells need a lot of signals to activate. (It’s a good idea to be sure before handing out suicide orders.) Memory T-cells activate faster, but only for specific patterns they remember.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Immunity and cell death.</strong> It’s well-known that RNA vaccines use your cells to make proteins and thus stimulate an immune response. But how do those proteins get out of the cells? You basically just wait until these cells die and break apart.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Two notes about the content below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I focus on the rare cases where something actually does any “work”. The biologists agree the explanation below is correct, but are <em>pained</em> by the details not included. (“Interferon types (I/II/III) are the foundation of the entire immune system!”)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a few things the biologists seem to believe, but were unwilling to endorse. I give them as clearly marked asides.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How does COVID-19 work?</strong></p>

<p>COVID-19 is a single-stranded RNA virus. This means it enters a cell and then releases the RNA inside the virus into the cytoplasm of the cell <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>How does it get into the cell?</strong></p>

<p>Cells have many receptors that bind to specific molecules and transport them inside the cell. COVID-19 has a “spike” protein on its surface that binds predominantly to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme_2">ACE2</a> receptor. Cells that have higher density of ACE2 receptors seem to be more susceptible to the virus. There may be other receptors or mechanism that may be involved, but ACE2 seems to be the biggest factor <sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Why is this called a “spike” protein?</strong></p>

<p>It protrudes from the surface of the virus like a spike.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/subtopic/images.htm">
<img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/covid/covid_spikes.jpg" alt="covid spikes">
</a></p>

<p><strong>OK, the viral RNA is now in the cytoplasm of the cell. What happens next?</strong></p>

<p>The infected cell’s machinery will generate viral proteins. Amino acids are floating around in the cytoplasm. The cell’s ribosome first attaches to one end of the viral RNA. The first amino acid coded by the RNA arrives and is attached. The ribosome moves on to the next RNA code and again attaches the corresponding amino acid. This continues until the ribosome reaches the termination code, at which point it’s done making one protein <sup id="fnref:1:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>How many different proteins does COVID-19 make?</strong></p>

<p>A bunch. The virus injects multiple strands of RNA and gets multiple proteins at the end. There are four key proteins: Those that make the spike, the envelope, the membrane and RNA-polymerase.</p>

<p><strong>So the virus is trying to make new copies of itself. Doesn’t it need to also make new RNA to go inside the viruses, so the whole process can be repeated at other cells?</strong></p>

<p>Oh, yes. The RNA polymerase is an enzyme that makes copies of the viral RNA inside the cell.</p>

<p><strong>After the proteins and new RNA are made, what happens next?</strong></p>

<p>They assemble together into new viruses. The proteins and RNA are formed so that this assembly happens naturally. Eventually, they will get out of the cell. For some viruses this can happen by breaking the cell apart, or exhausting the resources of the cell and waiting for it to die. COVID-19 seems to be an <em>envelope virus</em> that is able to get through the cell membrane without killing the cell. This exit can happen in numerous ways. Eventually the cell does die because the resources are exhausted but the virus can escape and replicate before that <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>How many viruses result from a single cell being infected?</strong></p>

<p>I don’t know. For other viruses this can be as low as around 40 or as high as 50,000. For viruses related to COVID-19, this is typically on the order of a few hundred.</p>

<p><strong>Why does COVID-19 make people sick?</strong></p>

<p>Most of the symptoms (cough, fever, etc.) are caused by the activated immune system, not directly by the virus. We still don’t fully understand why COVID-19 makes some people <em>so</em> sick. There are several factors that contribute to severity, such as the person’s age, how many virus particles they inhaled, and if they have pre-existing chronic conditions. A recent paper suggested that variations in genes affect how the immune system behaves also impact severity. As COVID-19 enters through our respiratory pathways, some people suffer from complications due to a hyper-inflammatory response that severely affects the cells in our lungs, impairing breathing and so on <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>How does the immune system kill viruses?</strong></p>

<p>There are three fundamental strategies. The first is to make it harder for viruses to enter cells. The second is to cause infected cells to die. The third is to make it harder for viruses to replicate inside of cells. The third of these is less understood. Currently, immunity seems to be more about the first two mechanisms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The biologists refused to say which of these is most important, I think because it’s heretical in the biology belief system to ever say that anything is more “important” than anything else. I also get hints that the third mechanism is a little neglected because it isn’t a sexy research topic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How does the body make it harder for viruses to enter cells?</strong></p>

<p>The body has immune cells called B-cells. Some of these make and secrete proteins called antibodies that bind to viruses freely-floating between cells. These will nearly “cover” the virus. In the case of COVID-19, this hides the spike protein, meaning it can’t get inside of cells. Eventually macrophages will come and eat the antibody-covered viruses. (The macrophages don’t usually eat the antibodies themselves.)</p>

<p><strong>How does the body cause infected cells to die?</strong></p>

<p>There are basically two ways. First, there are specialized immune cells called natural killer cells that will kill virally infected cells. Second, our cells are built to essentially “commit suicide” when signaled to do so. This is called “apoptosis”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>This</em> is how we fight viruses? By killing parts of ourselves before the virus can? The biologists stubbornly refused to make any comparison of the importance of apoptosis relative to other parts …</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div>

      <p>If you've been following me awhile, you know that I was <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2016/6/3/ruby-fellow-hired">hired by AppFolio</a> years ago to measure Ruby 3's performance, especially on Rails. This has been a long trip. And that very first project is finally over: Ruby 3 exists and I can check its final, released Rails performance.</p>

<p>If you <strong><em>have</em></strong> been following along, the numbers in this post won't surprise you. But it's important to do the final measurement. If you haven't been following, this will bring you up to date.</p>

<h2>What Am I Measuring?</h2>

<p>In concept, I'm measuring "how fast is Ruby 3 versus Ruby 2.6 or 2.7 for a typical real-world Rails workload?"</p>

<p>"Typical real-world workload" is a vague, hand-wavy concept. But there are a lot of specifics that can back it up. I used <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2018/4/2/rails-ruby-bench-what-and-why">Rails Ruby Bench</a>, something I've written for this purpose and used for years now.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/noahgibbs/rails_ruby_bench">Rails Ruby Bench</a> runs a copy of <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse">Discourse</a>, a common and popular Rails app to host internet forums. It's one of the biggest available "real" open-source Rails apps, making it a fine choice for "real world" benchmarking. RRB runs a set of simulated pseudorandom user requests against the running Rails app, and times how long they all take to finish. So it's a throughput test. <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2019/11/28/how-do-i-use-rails-ruby-bench">You can run it yourself if you like</a>, though it's a bit complex and finicky. The dark side of using real-world software is hitting real-world complexity and bugs.</p>

<p>The Ruby versions I measured were my hacked Ruby 3.0 versus 2.6.6 and 2.7.1.</p>

<p>RRB has run against AWS m4.2xlarge instances for nearly its whole existence. That's what I'm doing again. For now: m4.2xlarge instances, 10 processes, 6 threads/process, the same as I've been <a href="https://rubykaigi.org/2017/presentations/codefolio.html">using for over 3 years</a> for this purpose. With this post, it has fulfilled its purpose: to measure the total speedup from 2.0 to 3.0 of a typical real-world Ruby on Rails application.</p>

<p>And I can finally stop supporting some hideous old hacks to make that possible.</p>

<p>These results are running 90 batches per Ruby version of 15,000 requests each. That's enough to get pretty solid results, but not to detect the tiniest differences. If you need to detect the tiniest differences in speed, you should probably be analysing your own workload more carefully instead. Anything below about half a percent in speed is going to be dwarfed by differences for your own specific operations. It kinda breaks the abstraction of asking "how fast is Ruby 2.X?" — at some point you don't care about the language generally, you care about the parts of it that you specifically use a lot.</p>

<h2>Methodology and Extra Pitfalls</h2>

<p>This post <a href="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/rails/performance/ruby/hows-the-performance-of-ruby-3.0.0-preview1.html">clearly follows the methodology of my 3.0.0-preview1 review</a>, of course. The main difference is that the Ruby branch was updated to the final release of 3.0.</p>

<p>Since I'm benchmarking with very old code for compatibility reasons, I hacked together <a href="https://github.com/noahgibbs/ruby/tree/new_fake_2_8">a fake branch of Ruby 3</a> that doesn't remove some of the deprecated features and reports its version number as 2.8 instead of 3.0. The branch includes all the new Ruby 3 code except for <a href="https://github.com/noahgibbs/ruby/commit/17f4f604254b50cdc2c43eb8264f8cbf42c4ce59">a recently-added per-thread deadlock detection feature</a> that replaced a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bit</a> I still needed for a deprecated feature. The per-thread deadlock detection feature isn't be used in my benchmark, especially because it didn't exist until after Ruby 2.7.</p>

<p>Here are those reverted features:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/assets/images/ruby_30_deprec.png" alt="A variety of Ruby 3.0.0 deprecations-turned-errors I Reverted - you can find them in the commits list on GitHub, too."></p>

<p>Using a hacked version of the latest Ruby with Rails 4.2 means there were several incompatible code chunks in ancient dependencies. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>I had to change tzinfo-1.2.3/lib/tzinfo/ruby<em>core</em>support.rb in its one-liner for "open_file". It was passing the options as a hash, not keywords. Ruby 3.0 keyword-passing changes broke this.</li>
<li>Discourse uses discourse/lib/freedom<em>patches/ams</em>include<em>without</em>root.rb, a horrible old monkeypatch for ActionModel 0.8/0.9, and it causes an infinite recursion. I made discourse/app/serializers/topic<em>list</em>item<em>serializer.rb's method last</em>poster_username return a static string, sidestepping the problem. Sigh.</li>
</ul>

<p>And a new hack, apparently due to something about my hideously-hacked Ruby 3.0 branch that lies about its version number:</p>

<ul>
<li>I had to rebuild BigDecimal 1.3.5 to remove three instances of rb<em>check</em>safe_obj() from the C extension code. Since safe mode isn't being used, it does nothing. But it also doesn't link correctly to the (no-op, only a warning) code.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are pretty trivial changes, so I shouldn't be unfairly benefiting or penalizing Ruby 3.0 compared to 2.6 or 2.7. The discourse change (probably the biggest for performance) was also made where it would affect every Ruby version, not just 3.0.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>First off, I <strong><em>did not</em></strong> see the occasional crashes with high numbers of threads, that <a href="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/rails/performance/ruby/hows-the-performance-of-ruby-3.0.0-preview1.html">I saw in Ruby 3.0.0-preview1</a>. I was worried they were because of my changes to the Ruby code, but apparently it was just that 3.0.0-preview1 wasn't the most stable prerelease. The final released Ruby 3.0 seems to be fine.</p>

<p>Second, when I initially ran 30 batches of 15,000 HTTP requests per batch... The performance numbers were nearly identical. 169.1 reqs/sec, 171.4 reqs/sec and 170.8 reqs/sec. Particularly for version 2.7 versus 3.0, that's well within the noise threshold, where the test is just saying "these look pretty much the same to me." They were within 0.6 requests/second of each other with a standard deviation of 1.39. That's basically identical.</p>

<p>So: Ruby 3.0.0-preview1 had been a few percentage points slower than 2.7. Tested to the same tolerances, Ruby 3.0.0's release version was <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> the same speed as 2.7.</p>

<p>I'm a glutton for punishment, so I started another VM instance and ran another 60 batches of 15,000 requests for each Ruby version.</p>

<p>Let's have a table for at least <em>some</em> visual variation, shall we?</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><td></td><th>Ruby 2.6.6</th><th>Ruby 2.7.1</th><th>Ruby 3.0.0</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Median Throughput</th><td>171.1</td><td>173.0</td><td>172.8</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Fastest Run of 60</th><td>174.5</td><td>175.5</td><td>176.4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Slowest Run of 60</th><td>168.6</td><td>171.3</td><td>169.2</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>This is once again well within the noise threshold. Ruby 3.0 has a <strong><em>tiny</em></strong> bit more variance than 2.7, but by so little that it could easily just be random. And none of these have <strong><em>much</em></strong> variance — nothing that would suggest the test is unstable or that it's getting lots of outliers and averaging them out. The 2.7 and 3.0 results are basically identical.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Ruby 3.0.0-preview1 was a tiny bit slower than 2.7. The release 3.0 is exactly the same speed as 2.7. Preview1 would also occasionally crash for me in a way that might have been the hackiness of my testing... But apparently wasn't. The release version of 3.0 had zero crashes during any of my testing. So I think preview1 was a bit unstable — it happens with prerelease versions sometimes.</p>

<p>Does that mean Ruby 3 failed in its promises? <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/is-ruby-3-actually-three-times-faster/">I don't think so, personally</a>. But that's not what this article is about.</p>

<p>This article is asking "how is the Rails performance of Ruby 3.0.0?" And the answer is "exactly the same as Ruby 2.7.1, which is about two percent better than 2.6.6." You can <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2019/3/7/ruby-speed-roundup-20-through-26">get more historical perspective on that here</a>. The total comes to 1.75x the speed of (75% faster than) Ruby 2.0.0-p0.</p>

  <p><img src="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/images/en/guides/children.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If you read our other blog posts you might already know that around 90% of the people on our planet are breathing dirty air, and that an estimate of 7 million people die every year due to it <span data-cites="world_health_organization_2018">[1]</span>. You might also know that nearly half a million babies died in 2019 due to dirty air <span data-cites="state_of_global_air">[2]</span>.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that dirty air is bad for both children and adults, but all this might be a bit abstract for a parent. This blog post will mainly look at how the air can impact the development of children and how the air quality relates to absenteeism in school, for both children and teachers.</p>
<h2 id="impact-on-childrens-cognitive-development">Impact on Children’s Cognitive Development</h2>
<p>There are multiple studies indicating that poor air quality can have an negative impact on a child’s cognitive development.</p>
<p>In a study <span data-cites="wang_2017">[3]</span> carried out in Los Angeles and surrounding counties, it was found that for every increase 2.5µg/m<sup>3</sup> PM<sub>2.5</sub> during the pre-teen and teen years, one performance IQ point was lost. Performance IQ is related to ones ability to solve new problems, and it is to a greater extent controlled by brain function, as opposed to something you can learn <span data-cites="boyd-barrett_2018">[4]</span>.</p>
<p>In a report by Unicef <span data-cites="rees_2017">[5]</span> it is mentioned how air pollution can impact memory and verbal and non-verbal IQ. Furthermore, it is mentioned that test scores and average grades (GPA) have been shown to be negatively impacted by air pollution exposure. Also prenatal exposure is discussed. A study they mention showed that prenatal exposure to air pollution resulted in a four-point drop in IQ by the age of 5. In addition to this study, also <span data-cites="monica_2018">[6]</span> shows that exposure during fetal life can have negative consequences on brain development. Air pollution seems to haunt us throughout our whole lives, from foetus to when old (especially if you are male) <span data-cites="un_environment_2018">[7]</span>.</p>
One of the studies referenced in the Unicef report looked at 2,715 children between 7 and 10 years old in schools in Barcelona <span data-cites="sunyer_2015">[8]</span>. The study concludes <q>Children attending schools with higher traffic-related air pollution had a smaller improvement in cognitive development.</q>. However, the editor comments:
<blockquote>
Importantly, these findings do not prove that traffic-related air pollution causes impairment of cognitive development. Rather, they suggest that the developing brain may be vulnerable to traffic-related air pollution well into middle childhood, a conclusion that has implications for the design of air pollution regulations and for the location of new schools. <span data-cites="sunyer_2015">[8]</span>
</blockquote>
<p>In <span data-cites="emily_2018">[9]</span> researchers looked at children when they were 9 months old and then 3 years old. They observed that exposure to high levels of NO<sub>2</sub> was associated with lower verbal ability at the age of 3. They also looked at indoor damp or condensation (which can be a hint for poor ventilation), and observed that it was associated with reduced verbal ability. Furthermore, they looked at exposure to second hand smoking, which perhaps unsurprisingly was also associated with lower verbal ability at the age of 3 years.</p>
<p>Researchers have also looked at the commute to school and found that PM<sub>2.5</sub> and black carbon (BC) exposure was associated with diminished growth of working memory <span data-cites="alvarez_2017">[10]</span>.</p>
<p>The findings seem fairly consistent - dirty air is harmful. We therefore believe it is worth paying attention to the air quality in the environments where our children spend a large portion of their early lives. We can not eliminate air pollution exposure, but at least it can be reduced thorugh awareness and taking actions if needed.</p>
<p>Also IQAir has looked at this topic and written an article <q><a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/lp/blog/new-parents/can-clean-air-increase-child-iq">Can clean air increase child IQ?</a></q>. They found some of the same references as we, but also some others. We recommend you to have a look if you are curious about this topic.</p>
<h2 id="cleaner-air-leads-to-fewer-sick-days">Cleaner Air Leads to Fewer Sick Days</h2>
<p>Perhaps more concrete than air pollution’s impact on cognitive development is how it affect the number of sick days. This can naturally also in turn impact a child’s development, since day care (or school) is supposed to be a place where children both have fun and learn new things.</p>
<p>One study <span data-cites="rosen_1999">[11]</span> found that with air purification non-attendance was decreased by 55% in a preschool. Another experiment, also in a Swedish preschool, showed a reduced sick-leave of at least 22.5% <span data-cites="jagemo_2019">[12]</span>.</p>
<p>A school in Finland also observed reduced sick leave <span data-cites="genano">[13]</span>, as well as improved concentration, after installing air purifiers. However, we couldn’t find any numbers for how much.</p>
<p>In London, following the release of The Mayor’s School Air Quality Audit Programme <span data-cites="london">[14]</span>, a number of schools followed the recommendation to get air purifiers. 56 teachers were surveyed after getting air purifiers, and more than half of them reported having noticed a decrease in sick leave among themselves and children <span data-cites="blueair_2019">[15]</span>.</p>
<p>There is also some support for reduced absenteeism among teachers with better air quality, for instance <span data-cites="ervasti_2012">[16]</span> found such a connection. We will in the future look into absenteeism at workplaces and its relation to air quality. We suspect there will be more research about that than teachers specifically.</p>
<p>The Västra Götaland Regional Council in Sweden has observed large variations in sick leave among preschools and theorize that this might be due to differences in indoor air quality <span data-cites="vg_2017">[17]</span>. This is expanded on <span data-cites="gustafsson_2017">[18]</span> in Läkartidningen, the official Journal of the Swedish medical association. The doctors point out that the indoor air often has more particles than the outdoor air (in Sweden), both because of indoor activities and that small particles from traffic get in. Children are said to be especially vulnerable to air pollution. The doctors theorize that indoor pollution act as an additional burden on children’s immune system, which risks making it less able to cope with viruses.</p>
<p>Important to note is that many of the above references have links to companies with commercial interests. Sadly, it is hard to find studies without any ties to industry. We found at least two double-blind studies <span data-cites="reisman_1990">[19]</span> <span data-cites="weichenthal_2013">[20]</span> supporting health benefits of air pollution reduction through the usage of air purifiers though. Note that also the European Commission did a research project called SINPHONIE looking at improving air quality in schools and kindergartens. See the <a href="https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC91160/lbna26738enn.pdf">final report</a> for a deep dive into this topic. They also cover absenteeism, and on top of <span data-cites="rosen_1999">[11]</span>, they reference <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47620251_Association_between_substandard_classroom_ventilation_rates_and_students'_academic_achievement">Association between substandard classroom ventilation rates and students’ academic achievement</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11146405_Indoor_air_microbes_and_respiratory_symptoms_of_children_in_moisture_damaged_and_reference_schools">Indoor air microbes and respiratory symptoms of children in moisture damaged and reference schools</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45200045_The_Impact_of_School_Building_Conditions_on_Student_Absenteeism_in_Upstate_New_York">The Impact of School Building Conditions on Student Absenteeism in Upstate New York</a>. All in support for that there’s a link between air quality and absenteeism.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We believe there’s enough supportive evidence for it being worth to make sure that the indoor air quality is good (below <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health">WHO limits</a>), and if not, take action. We’ll try to write a new post in the future more focused on what one can do, but meanwhile, some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Especially if you are pregnant, have a baby or young child, pay attention to outdoor air pollution and consider an air purifier if pollution is high. It appears that air pollution may be more harmful the younger the child is.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider asking your preschool to get an air purifier if it is located close to heavy traffic or the air quality seems low. Some preschools are already aware of this, for instance <a href="http://eduwingskids.com/air-quality-in-eduwings-kindergarten/">Eduwings</a> have a strategy in place. Sadly it appears that mainly private expensive preschools are using air purifiers, at least in China <span data-cites="dandan_2016">[21]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce indoor activities that can lead to increased air pollution. For instance high temperature cooking, usage of candles or other indoor combustion. A well maintained kitchen hood and ventilation system can mitigate air pollution build-up. But you can also just open your window when cooking with high temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>Prefer walking in the forest or through a park rather than along roads with high traffic.</p></li>
<li><p>Install an app, such as <a href="https://www.iqair.com/air-quality-app">IQAir’s Air Visual</a>. It can help you to know when air pollution is high, so that you can reduce air pollution exposure. For instance by staying indoors the worst days, preferably in a room with an air purifier. Or at least avoiding heavy outdoor exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize second hand smoking, especially if you are pregnant, have a baby or young children.</p></li>
</ul>

someone who knows him) isn’t a genius and he definitely isn’t crazed.<span></span> He didn’t analyze any ten-dimensional gauge theory or predict any chiral
axigluons.<span></span> He’s just an entrepreneur, i.e., a natural leader, a
commodity which especially in our present dire straits is or at least
ought to be worth a whole Bolivian prison full of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/magazine/the-professor-the-bikini-model-and-the-suitcase-full-of-trouble.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cocaine-tooting particle physicists</a>.</p>
<p>What I find exceptionally terrifying is that Altman’s blithering idiocy
looks and sounds <em>exactly like sober good sense</em>.<span></span> <a href="https://samaltman.posthaven.com/growth-and-government" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read it.</a><span></span> You’ll agree.</p>
<p>The basic problem with our society is a disconnect between consensus
reality and actual reality.<span></span> We actually have no shortage of natural
leaders.<span></span> But they cannot actually lead us anywhere.<span></span> They are operating
in consensus reality rather than actual reality.<span></span> Their joysticks are
not plugged in.<span></span> When the consensus is nonsense, sober good sense is
nonsense.<span></span> Nonsense is no use to anyone.</p>
<p>Really?<span></span> Can blithering idiocy sound like sober good sense?<span></span> Let’s try
some:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>All of that said, in absolute sense I’d much rather live in the
world of today than 1950—it’s tough for me to imagine living in a
world without the Internet.<span></span> However, in the same way that one can feel
acceleration but not velocity, people seem more sensitive to the annual
rate of improvement than the absolute quality of life.<span></span> So even though
people should be happier in an absolutely better world, no one wants to
stand still on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hedonic
treadmill</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Most of us want our lives to get better every year—the hedonic
treadmill is a pain that way.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The world of 1950!<span></span> Oh, honey.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s apply a <em>gross</em> reality check.<span></span> You’re an alien.<span></span> You’re
observing Earth with an infinitely powerful telescope from Alpha
Centauri.<span></span> You have a simple question.<span></span> Since 1950, has human
civilization—or American civilization, which amounts to pretty much
the same these days—advanced or declined?</p>
<p>Apparently the easiest way for Sam Altman to answer the question is to
trade it for a different one.<span></span> He is not alone in this.<span></span> He asks: since
1950, has human <em>technology</em> advanced or declined?<span></span> Clearly, the
alien, you, I, and Sam Altman all have the same answer to this question.</p>
<p>Any question with an obvious answer is a stupid question.<span></span> “Is an iPad
more advanced than a Smith-Corona?” is a stupid question.<span></span> Who asks
stupid questions?<span></span> Obviously, blithering idiots.</p>
<p>But we can compose an interesting question by <em>factoring out</em> the
stupid question.<span></span> Which world would Sam Altman rather live in?<span></span> 2013,
with iPads and teh Internet?<span></span> Or 1950—with iPads and teh Internet?</p>
<p>In a sense, this 1950 is just as real as the “real” 1950.<span></span> Neither
exists.<span></span> Sam Altman cannot pack his bags and move to either the real
1950 or my imaginary super-1950.<span></span> Both exist only as thought
experiments.<span></span> It is not hard to construct or define the super-1950,
though—one run of a time machine, with a printout of Wikipedia, would
be pretty much all the real 1950 needed.<span></span> Send the technology back to
1945, and you’ll have iPads by ’55 at the latest.<span></span> Those guys got things
done.</p>
<p>The interesting (and scary) question this thought-experiment asks is
whether, <em>aside from technical progress</em>, human civilization has
advanced or declined since 1950.<span></span> In actual reality, this too is a
stupid question.<span></span> The answer is no less obvious—I assert.<span></span> But
consensus reality thinks I’m crazy.<span></span> So with stupid we must begin.</p>
<p>Aside from technical progress, has human civilization advanced or
declined since 1950?<span></span> By what criterion?<span></span> If Moore’s Law is not our
benchmark of a successful civilization—what is?</p>
<p>Sam Altman has his answer.<span></span> The hedonic treadmill!<span></span> Never having sold a startup for <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120309/green-dot-buys-location-app-loopt-for-43-4m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$43 mil</a>, there are many subtle, refined and delicious forms
of hedonism of which I am as innocent as a cat of tennis.<span></span> But allowing
(for a moment) this implicit assumption that the purpose of civilization
is the <em>satisfaction of human desires</em>, we can refer only to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maslow’s
pyramid of needs</a>.</p>
<p>At the base of the pyramid are air, water and food.<span></span> How does 2013 do at
supplying oxygen, hydration and nutrition?<span></span> How did 1950 do?<span></span> Just
fine.<span></span> Gentlemen, a draw.<span></span> (The food of 2013 is certainly <em>tastier</em>
than that of 1950, at least in America.<span></span> But this is not the base of the
pyramid.)</p>
<p>Next up: safety and security.<span></span> All right, gentlemen.<span></span> Let’s have another
thought-experiment.</p>
<p>Picture the Earth—our beautiful, blue, spinning globe.<span></span> Take all the
habitable land area and color it white—as a neutral background for our
thought experiment.</p>
<p>Now, select the subset of this beautiful planet on which a sober,
sensible, civilized person, such as Sam Altman, would consider it
prudent and safe to wander,
“<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=1iEiAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA481&amp;lpg=PA481&amp;dq=luke+owen+pike+on+foot+and+alone&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FTElxDwO_o&amp;sig=rldp7D6O6fBNUp_gfvEGyD-V3YQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kek9UZKVGsGzyQGRt4HADQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=luke%20owen%20pike%20on%20foot%20and%20alone&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on
foot and alone</a>,” carrying his iPad, at night.<span></span> Leave that part white.<span></span> Color the other part brown.<span></span> Then, from the brown subset, select the
further subset in which Sam Altman, carrying his iPad, would not
consider it prudent and safe to wander <em>in the daytime</em>.<span></span> Color
that part <em>black</em>.<span></span> (Why can’t Google Maps do this?)</p>
<p>Then do the same for Sam Altman’s grandfather, in 1950, with his
portable Smith-Corona.<span></span> Then, repeat the exercise for 1900.<span></span> (Part of
the reason this is such a useful mental exercise, and unfortunately such
a difficult one, is that it requires you to actually <em>know</em> what
the world was like in 1950 or 1900.<span></span> If your way of getting this
information starts with statistical tables, ur doin it rong.<span></span> There are
these things called “books” which will help you out.)</p>
<p>If you perform this exercise accurately, or at least if you get the same
results as me, you’ll see a 20C quite indistinguishable from Stage III
melanoma.<span></span> And this progress continues, to rousing applause and general
self-congratulation, right up into our own dear official NYT-approved
2013.<span></span> Hey, been to Egypt lately?<span></span> What’s that <a href="http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2047006,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google guy</a> up to these
days?<span></span> Is he still tweeting?</p>
<p>Speaking of Twitter, I experience this reality check in person every
day.<span></span> My daughter’s preschool is at 10th and Howard, two blocks from
Twitter HQ.<span></span> It’s actually not too hard to park at 10th and Howard.<span></span> So
the average number of what my daughter calls “dangerous persons,” and what to an
ordinary grownup are basically indistinguishable from zombies, that I
and my bubbly daughter have to navigate around between the car door and
the security guard is… I don’t know… 1.3?<span></span> 1.7?<span></span> It can’t
be much more than&nbsp;2.</p>
<p>They’re just zombies and really they’re not that dangerous.<span></span> (I think
even zombies can sense that when I’m with a child, I am more dangerous
to them than the converse.)<span></span> On the other hand, a couple months ago a
techie (not a Twitter employee) was hit on the head and killed,
presumably by zombie or zombies unknown,
<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/SoMa-assault-victim-dies-4229551.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at
11th and Mission</a>.<span></span> Right around the corner from Tweet Central.<span></span> Besides
a couple of perfunctory boilerplate stories, and of course the victim’s
wife, no one noticed.<span></span> No one cared.<span></span> Why would they?<span></span> Their iPads have
<em>4.7 million pixels</em>.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that if you don’t know how 1950 would have reacted to
exactly the same event, in exactly the same place, you don’t know
anything about 1950.</p>
<p>Actually, my daughter’s preschool is <em>literally in a ruin</em>—that
is, a (nicely renovated) space which used to be part of a Catholic
church.<span></span> (The preschool is the former convent.<span></span> The rest of the church
remains a
<a href="http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM5QC2_St_Josephs_Church_and_Complex_San_Francisco_CA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruin</a>
proper.)<span></span> Where are the people who used to pray in this church?<span></span> They
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>fled</em></a>.<span></span> Why?<span></span> Because they were
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>afraid for
their physical safety</em></a>.</p>
<p>I know, I know.<span></span> It’s
<a href="http://www.phillymag.com/articles/white-philly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gauche</a> to even
bring this kind of stuff up.<span></span> It’s not part of our consensus reality.<span></span> It’s not part of our consensus <em>history</em>.<span></span> When it comes to
<em>actual</em> history, however, the global decline of security in the
second half of the 20th century is (I assert) the salient phenomenon of
our era.<span></span> Much as the fall of the Roman Empire is the salient phenomenon
of 4th-century AD Europe.<span></span> (Note that while our historians would
desperately love to find one, just one, member of the exquisitely
literate 4th-century AD European culture who would even <em>mention</em>
that the Roman Empire was falling apart, no such luck.<span></span> It’s all
wall-to-wall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudentius" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prudentius</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidonius_Apollinaris" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sidonius</a>.)</p>
<p>Consider our alien in Alpha Centauri.<span></span> His telescope is just a
telescope.<span></span> He no speaka the English.<span></span> He is absolutely invulnerable to
our most respected propaganda authorities and in particular has no way
to read the great Harvard scholar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pinker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steven Pinker</a>—truly a Prudentius for
our age—who has <a href="http://stevenpinker.com/publications/better-angels-our-nature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> through elaborate statistical models that
the 20C was not, in fact, the golden age of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Communism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">titanic
mass murder</a> and
<a href="http://blog.priceonomics.com/post/43688725792/how-do-you-steal-a-bike-asking-for-a-friend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brazen
petty crime</a>, but the dawning of a new age of Aquarius in which all will
have peace and prosperity.<span></span> (Even Pinker is a piker next to the Times,
which has published at least 547 stories about NYC’s miraculous conquest
of its
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/nyregion/new-york-police-department-manipulates-crime-reports-study-finds.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blatantly
managed</a> crime statistics, and precisely 2 about the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/28/nyregion/28crime.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hospital
statistics</a> which show a parallel doubling in actual assault victims.<span></span> It’s always so easy to lie to those who want to be lied to—you hardly
even <em>need</em> statistics.)</p>
<p>But his is an excellent telescope.<span></span> So our alien can <em>see</em> the fact
that many parts of all, and all parts of some, American cities that were
thriving in 1950, have now fallen into chaos and ruin.<span></span> On the other
hand, he can gaze admiringly at the thriving cafes of University Avenue
in Palo Alto, Ausonius’
<a href="https://archive.org/stream/deciausonius01ausouoft#page/n5/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moselle</a>
born anew, full of beautiful young people adoring the perfectly
antialiased individual subpixels of their new Retina iPads.<span></span> Which of
these phenomena will he find more relevant?<span></span> Which is the narrative,
which the distraction?</p>
<p>Continuing the comparison to the fall of Rome, one of the interesting
features we see is that while technological competence is certainly an
indicator of a successful civilization, it is also a <em>lagging</em>
indicator.<span></span> Civilization produces technology, not the other way around.<span></span> When civilization falls, technology is not the first but the last thing
to fall.<span></span> Yes, technology …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Within the web development community, there has been a clear shift towards frameworks that implement incremental view maintenance and for good reason. When state is updated incrementally, applications perform better and require fewer resources. Using Materialize, developers and data analysts can adopt the same, event driven techniques in their data processing pipelines, leveraging existing SQL know-how. In this blog post, we will build an application to demonstrate how developers can create real-time, event-driven experiences for their users, powered by Materialize.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:<br>
This post is the fulfillment of the goals that I had when writing <a href="https://materialize.com/streaming-tail-to-the-browser-a-one-day-project/">Streaming TAIL to the Browser</a>. That post is not required to understand this post but familiarizing yourself with the <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/sql/tail/#main">TAIL command</a> is recommended.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Demonstration of What We Will Be Building</h3>
<p>In this post, we are going to use the demo from our documentation’s <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/get-started/">Get Started tutorial</a> as the basis for building a minimal web application. The application allows users to see the total number of edits made to Wikipedia, as well as a bar chart of the top 10 editors. Here is an animation that shows the final result:</p>
<p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201766%201296%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/top10-live-1.gif" alt="" width="1766" height="1296"></p>
<hr>
<p>Want to run this demo yourself? Awesome! Clone our <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize">repository</a> and follow the instructions for <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/tree/ea5a6f0603875b752745838eb1228a90fc7e8476/play/wikirecent#running-it-yourself">Running it Yourself</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Desired Properties of the Solution</h3>
<p>Before jumping into how to build this, let’s outline the desired properties for our solution. The final solution should be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Push-Based</strong> – Instead of having the client poll for updates, updates should be initiated by the server and only when the client state is outdated.</li>
<li><strong>Complete</strong> – Clients should present both a consistent and complete view of the data, regardless of when the application is loaded.</li>
<li><strong>Unbuffered</strong> – Clients should receive updates as soon as changes are made to the underlying datasets, without arbitrary delays in the data pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>Economic</strong> – Size of updates should be a function of the difference between the current state and the desired state. Additionally, clients should not be required to replay state from the start of history.</li>
<li><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong> – Applications modifying the source data (writers) should not need to know anything about the applications consuming the data (readers).</li>
</ul>
<p>While it is possible for other applications to meet several of these properties, I hope that this application will demonstrate why the solution presented is ideal for this scenario. A discussion of why this application meets the above properties, and why other solutions likely do not, is presented further down in this post.</p>
<h3>Overall Architecture</h3>
<p>For those unfamiliar with our getting started demo, here is the flow of data in our pipeline:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Wikirecent-Dataflow-e1611101124886.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Wikirecent-Dataflow-e1611101124886.png" alt="" width="1404" height="1872"></p>
<p>Looking at the system diagram below, we see that the entire data pipeline is contained within a single materialized instance:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-sheets-page-17.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Quick-sheets-page-17.png" alt="" width="1404" height="1872"></p>
<p>Let’s discuss the role of each service in the diagram above.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you started the application, you can run <code>mzcompose ps</code> to see the containers started.</p>
<hr>
<h4>curl — wikirecent_stream_1</h4>
<p>This container runs <code>curl</code> to stream Wikimedia’s recent changelog to a file called <code>recentchanges</code> within a Docker volume shared with our materialized instance.</p>
<h4>materialized — wikirecent_materialized_1</h4>
<p>This container runs an instance of <code>materialized</code>, configured to tail the <code>recentchanges</code> file and maintain our two materialized views: <code>counter</code> and <code>top10</code>. The views in this instance are configured exactly as documented in <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/get-started/#create-a-real-time-stream%22">Getting Started – Create a real-time Stream</a>.</p>
<h4>Python web server — wikirecent_app_1</h4>
<p>This container runs a Python web server that hosts the code for our JavaScript application and converts the row-oriented results from <code>TAIL</code> to the batch-oriented results expected by our application.</p>
<h2>Building Our Application</h2>
<p>Our example application is an asynchronous Python web server built using two libraries: <a href="https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/index.html">Tornado</a> and <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/">psycopg3</a>. There are three components to our application that I would like to call out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python code to subscribe to materialized view updates using the <code>TAIL</code> command and&nbsp;convert the row-oriented results into batches.</li>
<li>Python code to broadcast batches to listeners.</li>
<li>JavaScript code to apply batch updates for efficient browser updates.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Materialize uses the word <em>batch</em> to refer to a data structure that expresses the difference between prior state and desired state. You can think of a batch as a “data diff”.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Output for Our JavaScript Code</h3>
<p>To efficiently update our client view state, we wish to present a stream of batches over a websocket to any configured listeners. We define a batch as the following:</p>
<pre><code>batch = {"inserted": [ // array of rows to add to our dataset
],
"deleted": [ // array of rows to remove from our dataset
],
"timestamp": 0 // Materialize-defined timestamp
}
</code></pre>
<p>When a client first connects, we send a compacted view of all batches from the beginning of history:</p>
<pre><code>def add_listener(self, conn):
    """Insert this connection into the list that will be notified on new messages."""
    # Write the most recent view state to catch this listener up to the current state of the world
    conn.write_message(
        {
            "deleted": [],
            "inserted": self.current_rows,
            "timestamp": self.current_timestamp,
        }
    )
    self.listeners.add(conn) # subscribe to the stream of batches
</code></pre>
<p>How can listeners bootstrap their state using a batch object? If there is one property that I find particularly beautiful about this solution, it’s that first batch applied to an empty list <em>is</em> our initial state. This means that initializing and updating are the same operation. This batch object is so useful that D3’s <a href="https://d3js.org/#enter-exit">update</a> and Vega’s <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/#view_change">change</a> APIs expect updates to come in a similar form.</p>
<p>However, results from tail are row-oriented. We need a little bit of code to convert from rows to batches; here is an example of the desired conversion:</p>
<pre><code># We need to convert this stream of rows...
1608081358001 f -1 ['Lockal', '4590']
1608081358001 f 1 ['Epidosis', '4595']
1608081358001 f -1 ['Matlin', '5220']
1608081358001 f 1 ['Matlin', '5221']
1608081359001 t \N ['\\N', '\\N']

# ...to this data structure.
timestamp = 1608081358001
inserted = [('Epidosis', '4595'), ('Matlin', '5221')]
deleted = [('Lockal', '4590'), ('Matlin', '5220')]
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s look at the code to subscribe to view updates and transform rows into batches.</p>
<h3>Subscribing to TAIL</h3>
<p>To process rows from <code>TAIL</code>, we must first declare a cursor object that will be used to indefinitely iterate over rows. To help with our code know when to broadcast an update, we ask for progress markers in the response:</p>
<pre><code>async def tail_view(self):
    """Spawn a coroutine that sets up a coroutine to process changes from TAIL."""
    async with await self.mzql_connection() as conn:
        async with await conn.cursor() as cursor:
            query = f"DECLARE cur CURSOR FOR TAIL {self.view_name} WITH (PROGRESS)"
            await cursor.execute(query)
            await self.tail_view_inner(cursor)
</code></pre>
<h3>Converting Rows to Batches</h3>
<p>We’ve now created a communication channel which can be used to await results from the tail query. Whenever our view changes, our application will be notified immediately and we can read the rows from our cursor object. <code>tail_view_inner</code> implements the logic to process rows and convert them to batches:</p>
<pre><code>async def tail_view_inner(self, cursor):
    """Read rows from TAIL, converting them to updates and broadcasting them."""
    inserted = []
    deleted = []
    while True:
        # Block until there are new results (FETCH is not buffered)
        await cursor.execute(f"FETCH ALL cur")

        async for (timestamp, progressed, diff, *columns) in cursor:
            # The progressed column serves as a synchronization primitive indicating that all
            # rows for an update have been read. We should publish this update.
            if progressed:
                self.update(deleted, inserted, timestamp)
                inserted = []
                deleted = []
                continue

            # Simplify our implementation by creating "diff" copies of each row instead
            # of tracking counts per row
            if diff &lt; 0: deleted.extend([columns] * abs(diff)) elif diff &gt; 0:
                inserted.extend([columns] * diff)
            else:
                raise ValueError(f"Bad data from TAIL: {row}")
</code></pre>
<h3>Updating Internal State and Broadcasting to Listeners</h3>
<p>Now that we have a batch object, we apply this change to our own internal <code>VIEW</code> and broadcast the change to all listeners:</p>
<pre><code>def update(self, deleted, inserted, timestamp):
    """Update our internal view based on this diff."""
    self.current_timestamp = timestamp￼

    # Remove any rows that have been deleted
    for r in deleted:
        self.current_rows.remove(r)

    # And add any rows that have been inserted
    self.current_rows.extend(inserted)

    # If we have listeners configured, broadcast this diff
    if self.listeners:
        payload = {"deleted": deleted, "inserted": inserted, "timestamp": timestamp}
        self.broadcast(payload)
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p><strong>Design Decision</strong>:<br>
Experienced readers will note that by maintaining an internal copy of the view in our Python web server, we can reduce the number of connections to the materialize instance. This is a strictly optional design decision that I made when writing this code — materialized connections are very light-weight when compared to other databases. We expect that there will be use cases where you will want one or more materialized connection per user. Consider temporary materialized views feeding dashboards personalized to each user, for example.</p>
<p>In the case of this application, I opted to reduce the connections out of habit rather than necessity. It does also enable a larger degree of fan-out, if we wanted to serve millions of clients, for example.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Updating User Views</h3>
<p>Now that we have looked at the code for broadcasting an update, let’s show how our <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/blob/main/play/wikirecent/app/src/templates/index.html">JavaScript code</a> consumes these batches. Our application is showing two things: a <em>total edits counter</em> and a <em>top 10 chart</em>:</p>

                <p>In computer programming, Flow-Based Programming (FBP) is a programming paradigm, discovered/invented by <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/index.html">J. Paul Rodker Morrison</a> in the late '60s, that uses a "data processing factory" metaphor for designing and building applications.  FBP defines applications as networks of "black box" processes, which communicate via data chunks (called Information Packets) travelling across predefined connections (think "conveyor belts"), where the connections are specified externally to the processes. These black box processes can be reconnected endlessly to form different applications without having to be changed internally. FBP is thus naturally component-oriented.</p>
                <p>FBP is a special case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow">dataflow</a> programming characterized by asynchronous, concurrent processes "under the covers", Information Packets with defined lifetimes, named ports, "bounded buffer" connections, and definition of connections external to the components - it has been found to support improved development time and maintainability, reusability, rapid prototyping, simulation, improved performance, and good communication among developers,  maintenance staff, users, systems people, and management - not to mention that FBP naturally takes advantage of multiple cores... without the programmer having to struggle with the intricacies of multitasking!</p>
               <p>FBP exhibits "data coupling", described in the article on coupling as the loosest type of coupling between components. The concept of loose coupling is in turn related to that of service-oriented architectures, and FBP fits a number of the criteria for such an architecture, albeit at a more fine-grained level than most examples of this architecture.</p>
					<p>FBP promotes high-level, functional style of specifications that simplify reasoning about system behavior. An example of this is the distributed data flow model for constructively specifying and analyzing the semantics of distributed multi-party protocols.</p>
                <p><img src="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/bottling_factory.png" alt="Bottling factory" height="400"> </p>
                
                <p>
                    FBP involves a significant "paradigm shift" from conventional programming, as it uses an "assembly line" image of data processing, which really has to be used to experience its advantages.  Not surprisingly given the hold that the so-called "von Neumann" paradigm has over programming technology, over the last 40+ years a number of companies have come out with FBP-like or "FBP-inspired" systems (to borrow a term coined by Joe Witt of Cloudera), which do not involve this paradigm shift, including some of the biggest and most successful companies in the industry, such as IBM, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and the New York Times (see <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/links_external.html">FBP External References</a>).  Unfortunately, without the FBP paradigm shift, these systems cannot fully achieve the advantages listed above, although most of them combine a visual notation with some degree of componentry.  We have therefore been forced to use the term "classical FBP" to refer to the FBP architecture described in this web site.  It is hard for someone reading documentation to tell whether a given product calling itself "FBP- like" is "classical" or not,  but, roughly, multiple input ports, "back pressure", and asynchronism, constitute a sort of litmus test to check whether systems should be classed as "classical" FBP systems. While the FBP paradigm shift may cause some trouble at first, given the prevalence of the older programming approaches, in fact it embodies a simple mental model (not "simple" as in easy but "simple" as in elegant, to quote Joe Witt), and has proven over several decades to result in applications that are more understandable and maintainable than those built using the conventional (von Neumann) paradigm.
                </p>
	    <p>If you <i>have</i> come across Flow-Based Programming by way of NoFlo, Flowhub, Node-RED, or similar packages, it is recommended that you read <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/fbp-inspired-vs-real-fbp.html"><i>FBP vs. FBP-inspired Systems</i></a>, which attempts to highlight the differences and similarities between FBP proper, or "classical" FBP, (the subject of this web site) on the one hand, and NoFlo and other similar "FBP-inspired" systems on the other. </p>
                <p>FBP is described in J. Paul Morrison's book, <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/book.html">Flow-Based Programming: A New Approach to Application Development"</a>, now in its 2nd edition, which can be obtained in paperback form from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Based-Programming-2nd-Application-Development/dp/1451542321">Amazon</a>, or in 2 e-book formats: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Based-Programming-J-Paul-Morrison-ebook/dp/B004PLO66O">Kindle</a> and <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/j-paul-morrison/flow-based-programming-2nd-edition/ebook/product-21172063.html">epub</a>.</p>
                <p>Further down on this web page you will find a bunch of useful links, including some videos demonstrating the use of the FBP diagramming tool, <a href="https://github.com/jpaulm/drawfbp/blob/master/README.md">DrawFBP</a>.  During FBP's early days, networks were coded by hand, and initially we used pencil and paper, followed by more sophisticated graphical tools, whether or not they played well with FBP software.  However, with the advent of good graphical support, we now have a powerful graphical tool (<a href="https://github.com/jpaulm/drawfbp">DrawFBP</a>), and in recent years the emphasis has been shifting to doing the diagramming on-line, and then generating the network code (we can see this progression with other flow tools on the market).  Now that compile and run functions (for Java and C#) have been added to DrawFBP, the developer can do much of the development graphically, and on-line.
                </p>    
                <p>We are in the process of "growing" a <a href="https://github.com/jpaulm/fbp-tutorial-filter-file">tutorial</a> which will introduce the reader to the basic concepts of FBP by means of a series of "steps", which use the diagramming tool DrawFBP to progressively expand an application diagram and generate and run code at many of those steps.  </p>            
            <p>There is a Google group on FBP, with almost 800 members, and a Slack channel has recently been set up - here is the invitation link, if you are interested in joining: <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/fbphq/shared_invite/enQtOTM4ODkzMTYyODE3LTJiMmNlZjhiMWY1MDY1ODA4Y2YzNDBlNDZlMTBkMDNlMjcwNzg2MGZhZjA2NjJjYTliYTM0OTIyYmM0Yzk0MDQ">Slack invitation</a>.</p>

                <!--<p>We know you are tired of Powerpoint presentations, but <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/FBPnew.ppt">this one</a> (from 2007) gives quite a good overview of FBP - as it was at that time.  There is also a <a href="http://player.vimeo.com/video/79329015">video</a> (not very professional, I'm afraid!), where I present this at a Meetup in Toronto in Sept. 2013 organized by Paul Tarvydas, CEO of Tarvydas-Sanford Controls Inc., and Dann Toliver. It has a few jokes and reminiscences, and may be more accessible than the straight Powerpoint presentation!   The Paul referred to in the video is Paul Tarvydas. Towards the end (at 40:12) there is a brief demo of the FBP diagramming tool, <a href="..\graphicsstuff\index.shtml">DrawFBP</a>.</p>-->

                    In addition, there are six Youtube videos about DrawFBP, illustrating a number of basic ("classical") FBP concepts (what we are now calling "FBP-inspired" or "FBP-like" systems do not necessarily contain all of these, although DrawFBP should be able to support most of these systems):

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>When Darwin introduced evolution with <em>The Origin of Species</em>, not only did it change how we saw life on earth, but it turned out to be much more general than we thought. We see it everywhere: from how innovation happens, how languages and cultures form, to how markets operate. </p><p>When you look at the world through the lens of evolution, what’s opaque becomes common sense and your vision of the world changes in kind.</p><p>The same, I think, can be said with Nassim Taleb’s <em>Incerto</em>. Yes, I have just compared him with Darwin.</p><p>Time will tell, but I think it’s merited. I’ve re-read Taleb’s work at least four times now, and each time I come out with new realizations. Similar to evolution, his ideas of Black Swans and Antifragility sprout up all around us. It can change everything from how you eat, how you work, how you build friendships, how you invest, how you innovate, and much more.</p><p>I wanted to share the most impactful idea that I got out of it with you. This is my own words, and it is nowhere near enough to capture his work’s complete implication. I hope it gives you an exciting lens and piques your curiosity enough to read Taleb’s books.</p><p>The place to start is with the question: <em>how does the future happen</em>? </p><p>We often think that it’s an unfolding of predictable events. It certainly seems that way when you read history. For example, we learn that World War I was an obvious consequence: countries were arming and had all these pacts, so of course, the war was a foregone conclusion. </p><p>But this is one of the most incredible illusions of all. With World War I, for example, we went from assassination in Austria-Hungary to an all-out war between superpowers in a matter of…<em>one week</em>. </p><p>No one predicted that. It would be analogous to China and America declaring hostilities next Friday. </p><p>This idea would have been hard to swallow before 2019, but I think enough has happened for us to reflect. No one predicted the exact consequences of COVID. No one expected that protesters would storm into the capitol building in January.</p><p>If breathtaking changes can happen in a matter of days, we need to revise our beliefs about how the future unfolds. </p><p>It’s not predictable. Instead, what Taleb calls “Black Swans” drive the future. These are events that are so unlikely that they’re unpredictable and so consequential that they change reality as we know it.</p><p>And that puts us in an uncomfortable situation — in a world dominated by events you can’t predict, how do you live your life?</p><p>Here comes, I think, one of Taleb’s most meaningful insights. You can’t know the future, but you <em>can</em> know how well you could handle it.</p><p>Here’s what I mean. Take anything, and ask yourself: how would this react if something <em>out of the ordinary</em> happened? </p><p>For example, think about a piece of expensive china. Just about anything out of the ordinary would break it. At best, nothing terrible will happen. At worst, it will disintegrate. You could say that this piece of china is <em>fragile</em> towards the unexpected.</p><p>Now let’s look at a kettlebell. Up to a point, just about anything out of the ordinary would do <em>little harm</em> to the kettlebell. In most cases, nothing terrible will happen. It won’t suddenly become any better, but at least it won’t break. We could say that this kettlebell is <em>robust</em> towards the unexpected.</p><p>Now, consider this essay itself. If someone reads it and sees that it’s wrong, that person could let me know, and I would fix it. If they’re furious and make a fuss on the internet, it only gets more people reading it. And of course, if people love it, again more would read it. At <em>worse,</em> this essay will stay the same. In many cases, it will benefit. You could say that this essay is <em>antifragile</em> towards the unexpected <sup>1</sup>. </p><p>Nassim calls this the “triad” — fragile, robust, antifragile — and you can start to identify just about all aspects of life within it.</p><p>Just exploring this triad can fill you with insights. For example, tinkering is antifragile. Banks are fragile. Gold is robust. Dollars are fragile. Individuals are fragile at the expense of the collective, which is antifragile. Why, and what does it mean? Expounding on the consequences would take a series of books… so you can appreciate the beauty and breadth of Nassim’s work. </p><p>For this essay, I’ll focus on just one slice of one thing. What can you do with this triad in your own life? </p><p>Well, you can learn to <em>love</em> the future. If you can organize your life so that you remove your fragility and add antifragility, you can, as Nassim says, <em>“be the fire and wish for the wind.”</em> </p><p>Here’s how. Look over your life, and start to catalogue your exposure. </p><p>Is your work fragile, robust, or antifragile?
Are your finances fragile, robust, or antifragile? 
Are your attachments fragile, robust, or antifragile?</p><p>Now, take all that is fragile, and try to move them towards robust. </p><p>Here’s an example. Say you have most of your net worth invested in stocks. Are your fragile, robust, or antifragile? </p><p>Well, imagine if your portfolio increases by 20%. You’ll be happy for sure. But, imagine if your portfolio <em>decreases</em> by 20%. Likely, you’ll be devastated. You have more to lose than to gain from the unexpected here. This means that you are <em>fragile</em> in your investments. </p><p>How can you move this towards robust? Two ways. </p><p>The first is philosophical. Just write off a large part of your investment mentally. Maybe 50% <sup>2</sup>. Now, even if a 50% downturn happens, you only got what you expected. Arguably, you are robust towards the unexpected. </p><p>The second is practical. Move to more robust investments: stuff like gold, very cheap real estate in a small, resilient country, etc. </p><p>At this point, you may ask — you don’t <em>just</em> want robust. How can you <em>win</em>? </p><p>Well, now it’s time to add antifragility. </p><p>Can you set aside some amount for crazy risks? You can write this portion off completely, so at worst, what happens is what you expected: you lose it all. However, at best, you have upside. </p><p>The key is to choose the kind of activities that have a profound upside. If one win pays for a thousand losses, you are in a good place. How does this look? </p><p>Here’s a basket of ideas: start a company, invest in highly speculative ideas, make a youtube video, write a book, move to a city that excites you, learn to program, tinker, share. If you do that, suddenly, you can’t wait to see what the future holds. </p><p>Nassim calls this the “Barbell Strategy” — change your exposure to 90% robust, 10% antifragile. </p><p>Here’s one more example. Say you have a slight headache. There’s a new medication that could fix it. Should you take it? </p><p>Well, in the best case, your headache is gone. But since it’s slight, this is not such a big deal. At worst, who knows what can happen? Here, you are <em>fragile</em> towards this medication.</p><p>Now, imagine you are about to die, but a new, experimental medication can save you. At worst, you die, which is what you expect to happen. But, in the best case, you survive. Here, you are <em>antifragile</em> to this medication. </p><p>Wow. We've just used the triad as a compass for our life. Note the beauty here: at no point have we talked about specific risk modeling. It’s so simple that you don’t need any math. That’s pretty darn beautiful.</p><p>And with that, we learn one of the most interesting ideas: it’s not about predicting the future; it’s about not having to predict the future. </p><p>You know what books to check out for a much deeper, broader, and sometimes hilarious view. </p><p>Fair warning, though: the biggest complaint with Taleb is that he comes off as arrogant. I honestly think this is a misunderstanding in tone. Imagine whenever you read him that you’re talking with an animated elder, under a sunlit garden in Lebanon, with a good bottle of arak. You’ll see humor where there was arrogance.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Alex Reichert, Joe Averbukh, Mark Shlick, Jacky Wang, Alexey Gurevich, for reviewing drafts of this essay</em> </p></span></p></div></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>Even before the World Heath Organization (WHO) assigned Coronavirus pandemic status, people were already coming up with “creative” ways of avoiding infection, some more effective <a href="https://www.gatechecked.com/some-nervous-travelers-are-wearing-water-jugs-to-protect-themselves-against-coronavirus-2440" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than others</a>.</p>
<p>Masks and face shields are still selling like hot cakes as hundreds of thousands of cases are recorded daily globally. Some companies have turned to more creative ways of capitalizing on the sudden demand for safety wear. <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/biovyzr-venture-out-breathe-easy#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioVYZR</a>, for instance, is developing a consumer grade Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) and plans to introduce it to the market starting at $249. For reference, industrial PAPRs sell for well over $1,500.</p>
<p>For those who may not want to look like they’re suited up for a trip to the International Space Station, another startup company called MicroClimate has also developed their own smaller protective helmet, called the <a href="https://microclimate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AIR by MicroClimate</a>, which honestly looks like something from the dystopian future.</p>

<p>The AIR helmet tries to solve some of the problems faced when wearing masks. For starters, the unit features HEPA-filtered inlets and outlets, and has high-powered fans to keep air moving through the helmet, preventing stale air from collecting and fogging up the glass. According to the website, the battery provides the fans over 4 hours of life, and can be charged via the provided 6 foot long USB-C cable.</p>
<p>The big benefit here is the clear acrylic visor, taking away some of the “annoyances” of wearing traditional masks, like actually being able to see the person’s entire face and not having to struggle understanding what people say through those thicker cloth masks. Finally, the lower section has a washable cushion liner, making it comfortable to wear for extended periods.</p>

<p>With no mention about how sound travels through the device (maybe through the cloth lining at the back), I’m guessing the wearer would have to constantly be on the verge of a shouting match in order to be heard. Even though it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2XF4AsTtuo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks relatively easy</a> to take off, I’m sorry for the folks out there who suffer from the regular runny nose.</p>
<p>Opinions about the helmet have been mixed, with some in favor and others out right mocking its design.</p>

              <p>You’re a software engineering leader, and you’re great at your job. You know that the optimal path for software development lies in figuring out which components of your design to implement from scratch and which have already been implemented by specialists and can be reused.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>You also know that these aren’t decisions that you can only make once – you have to keep reevaluating based on environment changes and the needs of new products.</p>

<p>Authentication is one of those components that you deal with all the time. Auth is a necessary part of any software product, but how you implement auth is not necessarily always the same. Careful consideration is needed, because your decision to outsource will not only impact speed of development, but also long-term product maintenance – you don’t want to slow down time to market because you re-implemented an entire auth system unnecessarily, but you also don’t want to use an auth system that is going to cause problems down the road.</p>

<p>So what are the primary considerations when making your decision?</p>

<h2 id="speed-to-market">Speed to market</h2>

<p>This is the most obvious consideration. Depending on the features you need, it could literally take months to implement auth in-house, whereas it could take less than a day to incorporate an outsourced solution.</p>

<p>You could say “but what if we only need a bare-bones implementation? Some salted hashes in a database and we’re good to go!” That’s a totally valid point, and if you don’t anticipate needing sophisticated auth features then your best bet might be to do a quick in-house implementation and move on.</p>

<p>However, time and time again I’ve seen product developers underestimate the sophistication of features that will be required when their userbases grow. Most of the time development organizations then fall prey to the sunk costs fallacy and double down on augmenting their in-house solution, even when it may be more efficient to abandon the home-grown effort and replace it with an outsourced solution. This will cause huge issues for maintainability, which I’ll talk about further below.</p>

<h2 id="consequences-of-an-auth-breach">Consequences of an auth breach</h2>

<p>Planning for the worst possible case can prevent total financial ruin for your company or division. If a breach of security happens and PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is leaked from your in-house auth system, it can not only cause your company reputational damage but also significant financial penalties (not to mention potential jail time if you try to cover up the breach).</p>

<p>If you outsource your auth system you can limit your liability, and also protect your reputation – if there is a breach on your auth provider’s side, it’s likely that the breach will extend beyond your company. A breach in an outsourced auth provider that is used by many different companies will be big news, and customers will be more likely to forgive you for making a mistake in your choice of auth provider than for implementing a poor auth system yourself.</p>

<p>A not-insignificant addendum is that I believe your in-house system is much more likely to suffer a breach than an outsourced provider who is an expert in security. I have no studies to support this claim, but I have never seen a major auth provider compromised, and I’ve definitely seen companies suffer breaches due to their own in-house auth implementations – <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/hacked-and-dumped-online-773-million-records-with-plaintext-passwords/">this article discusses a compilation of 21 million plaintext passwords collected from various breaches</a> wherein passwords were not hashed and salted by auth systems.</p>

<p>Properly storing passwords is an incredibly low bar, and yet companies that manage their own auth still do it incorrectly all the time.</p>

<h2 id="consequences-of-an-auth-outage">Consequences of an auth outage</h2>

<p>While less damaging than breaches, outages can still cause reputational damage and liability issues if your SLAs make uptime guarantees. Similarly to breaches, if you outsource your auth system it’s likely that any auth outage will extend beyond your company.</p>

<p>As an example, when Microsoft’s Azure Active Directory (AAD) <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-azure-ad-authentication-outage-what-went-wrong/">went down for a good portion of the afternoon late last year</a>, logins for applications across the internet stopped working.</p>

<p>When your competitors’ authorization systems are down at the same time yours are, nobody blames you for it, but when you’re the only company having issues, you suffer reputationally. No matter what your outsourced auth system is (FusionAuth, Cognito, AAD, etc), you can be almost certain that you won’t be alone in the event of an outage.</p>

<h2 id="maintainability">Maintainability</h2>

<p>There are trade-offs here. The benefits to an in-house system include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your engineers can design the exact system to fit your needs, and you’ll have unrestricted ability to add very specific features if requirements change over time.</li>
  <li>If the same engineers who built the system are maintaining it, then they’ll have the context required to anticipate issues as they add features.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the drawbacks can be large:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complex new features can take significant time to build. Outsourced auth systems likely have these features already built (things like multi-factor authentication, user management interfaces, analytics and audit logs, and brute force hack detection, among others).</li>
  <li>With an in-house solution, you’ll have to budget time to monitor new security threats and patch your system in a rapidly evolving threat landscape.</li>
  <li>You won’t get the benefits of a dedicated team that are constantly improving your auth system. This is actually a bigger deal than it seems, because if you outsource auth then other companies will also be filing issue reports and feature requests on your behalf, so you reap the benefits of those extra eyes as well.</li>
  <li>In the case of mergers or acquisitions, an in-house solution is likely to be terrible at combining different databases of users and managing things like duplicates or incomplete data. Such enterprise identity unification efforts can founder on internal auth systems. FusionAuth, on the other hand, supports modeling different user bases with tenants.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cost-of-in-house-vs-outsourced-auth">Cost of in-house vs outsourced auth</h2>

<p>When building an in-house auth system your costs are all ostensibly sunk (engineer salaries). However, if building your system in-house delays time to market or prevents creation of other features, the build could cost you a significant amount of real income. There will also be on-going maintenance costs with an in-house solution.</p>

<p>When making cost calculations, you should compare:</p>

<p><strong>Revenue lost by slower time-to-market PLUS engineering cost to implement in-house solution PLUS on-going maintenance costs of in-house solution PLUS increased risk of data breach PLUS increased risk of outage PLUS increased risk during a merger or acquisition</strong></p>

<p>vs</p>

<p><strong>The monthly cost incurred by an outsourced provider PLUS the lack of complete control</strong></p>

<p>When evaluating different auth providers, you’ll also want to consider whether an outsourced provider charges on a sliding scale based on number of users or if the cost is fixed. AWS Cognito, for instance, will continue to charge more as your application gains more users. FusionAuth, in contrast, has options that charge a single rate for unlimited users. If your app is small and you don’t expect it to grow much, a sliding scale may be better for you. If you don’t want a large unexpected bill as you gain more users, a provider that allows for fixed costs may be more appealing.</p>



<p>As a final consideration, you may want to evaluate if your engineers even have the ability to implement a secure in-house auth system without a significant investment in education. This is something that many leaders dismiss, since they have great faith in the intelligence and skill of their people.</p>

<p>However, knowledge and intelligence aren’t the same, and just because your engineers are capable of becoming auth experts doesn’t mean you want them to spend the time to do so.</p>

<p>As an engineering leader, you have a responsibility to ensure that your engineers are spending their time on efforts that will optimally contribute to the long-term success of your organization. Auth is a necessary component, but is it really a differentiator for your application?</p>

<p>Only you have the context to make the best decisions for your company, but I hope this article has helped you think through some of the considerations involved in outsourcing your auth.</p>

  <p>Jan 20, 2021</p>




&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<p>I moved this website “worldofmatthew.com” away from CloudFlare back in August 2020.</p>
<p>That should have been the end of the relation with CloudFlare for my website.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while I was moving the L7 Anti-DDOS protection to path.net (via a reseller), I checked the SSL Transparency and noticed that CloudFlare still had a <a href="https://crt.sh/?id=3006080109&amp;opt=ocsp">vaild SSL certificate for this website</a>.</p>
<p>Even worse, this CloudFlare certificate lasts for a year, meaning they have a SSL certificate for this website, until June 2021.</p>
<h2 id="irrevocable-ssl-certificates-by-cloudflare">Irrevocable SSL Certificates by CloudFlare</h2>
<p>This website currently uses path.net for DDOS migration. Just like CloudFlare, they have their own SSL certificate for this website. As they require it to MITM website requests to block anyone trying to perform an L7 attack.</p>
<p>The difference is that path.net uses Let’s Encrypt, which would allow me to revoke their SSL certificate for this website. All I would have to do is to download the public key and present that with an Acme challenge and then I can revoke it.</p>
<p><strong>You would think that it would be possible to get a CloudFlare SSL certificate revoked?</strong></p>
<p>How about No?</p>


<center>
<picture>
	<img src="https://worldofmatthew.com/img/2021/01/cfupgrade.png" alt="Cloudflare charging $10 for a web master to have control over SSL.">
</picture>
</center>

<p>Well. Unless you want to pay CloudFlare $10 per month to gain access to the “<a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/advanced-certificate-manager">Advanced Certificate Manager</a>”.</p>
<p>This would give access to use a custom Let’s Encrypt. This would also allow you to set your SSL certificate validity period to as low as 14 days, rather than a year on the free “Universal SSL”.</p>
<p>Basically, it is a case of pay CloudFlare $10 per month or they get 100% control over your SSL certificate and will deny your requests to revoke.</p>
<p>In fact, the official stance of the SSL team at CloudFlare is that they won’t revoke unless the team has “<a href="https://community.cloudflare.com/t/revoke-and-prevent-the-issuing-of-certificates/235478/28">determined the private key was compromised</a>.”</p>
<p><strong>Isn’t this sounding pretty corrupt?</strong></p>
<p>Yes….</p>
<p>You blindly trust that CloudFlare will delete the SSL certificate upon leaving. They will provide you zero evidence of them of actually deleting the certificate.</p>
<p>This is from a CDN who has a level of access unmatched by their rivals. CloudFlare are becoming the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/02/25/firefox-continues-push-to-bring-dns-over-https-by-default-for-us-users/">defualt DNS for browsers</a> and have a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/1111-warp-better-vpn/">VPN service</a>.</p>
<p>You have to trust them to never abuse that power.</p>
<p>Even worse, as they forcibly keep a working SSL certificate, they don’t even have to generate a new one. Meaning, SSL transparency <strong>WILL NOT</strong> show anything if CloudFlare ever decide to hijack and MITM traffic to your website.</p>
<p>If someone asks that a SSL certificate is revoked after leaving it, revoke it. The webmaster is no longer giving them permission to have a SSL certificate for their domain.</p>
<p>By not allowing for SSL certificates to be revoked, CloudFlare is in effect holding them hostage. It must not be the job of a Certificate authority to refuse such requests.</p>
<p>Most Certificate authorities would never lock a webmaster out of control of a SSL certificate for their domain.</p>
<p>They also would not tell people to pay of $10/month for get rights to revoke a Certificate.</p>
<p>This comes to a question of whether CloudFlare should even be in SSL chain-of-trust.</p>
<p>I requested for them to revoke, by not revoking Cloudflare are keeping an active SSL Certificate without my permission. I think such behavior should make browsers question if they can keep Cloudflare in their chain-of-trust.</p>

									<p>The German government is “keen to enter into talks” with the new U.S. administration to agree changes to the U.S. policy that prioritizes local coronavirus vaccine supply at U.S. production facilities, according to a document from the German health ministry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a lengthy document published Tuesday that responded to questions from Germany’s Social Democrats, the health ministry sets out why the U.S. was able to secure additional supply of BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines for specific dates, whereas the EU's increase in supply is set to come “in 2021.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The health ministry states that an executive order from the U.S. president meant that production facilities in the country are “encouraged to initially make vaccine available for supply in the USA.” This meant that European production sites of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, as well as the Moderna vaccine, need to supply the rest of the world, in addition to Europe. </p>

<p>“The companies as well as the federal government are keen to enter into talks with the new U.S. administration in order to reach adjustments,” wrote the health ministry.</p>
<p>The document also discussed the bilateral deal Germany has with BioNTech/Pfizer — something that the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germanys-coronavirus-vaccine-side-deal-at-odds-with-legally-binding-eu-pact/">Commission has let Germany off the hook for</a>, even though it appears to go against the bloc’s effort to craft a united vaccine strategy. </p>
<p>At issue, the health ministry explained, is the funding received by BioNTech from Germany’s education and research ministry. This cash meant that BioNTech had to provide a portion of vaccines to Germany. As a result, the health ministry had to issue a pre-contractual letter of intent in the form of a memorandum of understanding on September 8 for 30 million additional doses of the vaccine, wrote the health ministry.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>There’s no better time than now to dedicate effort to reliable software</em>.</p><p>If it wasn’t apparent before, this past year has made it more evident than ever: People expect their software tools to work every time, all the time.
The shift in the way end-users think about software was as inevitable as our daily applications entered our lives, almost like water and electricity entered our homes. A global pandemic accelerated that expectation as our livelihoods adjusted to be dominantly online for entertainment, saying hello to loved ones, and doing our jobs.</p><h2>Customers want reliable software.</h2><p>If you’re reading this, there’s a great chance an outage disrupted your life in one way or another. It could be the hours-long Slack, Gmail, or Zoom outages. Or it could be trying to watch a show on Disney+ or Hulu. Or when market volume skyrocketed, sending several brokerages down like TDAmeritrade and Robinhood.</p><p>Website blips and outages had a level of empathy associated with them in the internet’s early days. Dial-up connections would be disconnected by someone merely picking up the phone. Servers would get turned off on weekends for government websites. Restarting our computers was a common remedy that was largely tolerated. Those days are behind us, and ahead is a new expectation from people using our services: they expect them to be reliable.</p><p>The software industry is wising up to the fact that incident response already has precedents. Google’s incident response is based mainly on the United States FEMA disaster recovery processes. Remediation runbooks to restart servers take cues from the airline industry with quick actions that operators can perform. Software teams perform incident retrospectives and publicize their findings to their customers and the world, much like how the investigation of airline disasters has happened for years.</p><p>Customer trust is sacred, and poor reliability is one of the top ways to erode that trust.</p><h2>Operators want reliable software.</h2><p>I’ve never been paged in my career and been excited to open my laptop at a restaurant, even though I have several times. Reliable software means that software engineers can stay focused on company initiatives such as shipping new products or improving internal development processes. When reliability becomes an afterthought of software, it has wide-reaching implications. For example, software engineers can easily fall into the trap of happy-path only development, ignoring the possibility of failure entirely.</p><p>Over time, disruptions caused by a lack of reliable software causes an engineering team to enter into a brutal interrupt-driven development phase. Interrupt driven development is also the easiest way to burn out an entire engineering team. When you have burned out engineers that suddenly depart, it can cause an organization to overhire to cover ground. Hiring at a breakneck pace can also cause a cultural shift in the company, potentially generating more employees to leave. It’s a vicious cycle.</p><p>If you write software or manage a team that writes software, try performing proactive reviews of software that is planning on being deployed. Ask questions like “how can this potentially break?” and “what is a potential side effect of this change?“. Ask engineers to add it to their pull requests, design docs, and release notes. Incident retrospectives are a lagging indicator of how people thought the system would behave when a few questions can often reveal problems before they’re problems.</p><h2>How do we achieve reliable reliability?</h2><p>Reliability is an infinite game. There’s no agreed-upon rules, no time limit, no teams to play against. Reliability is what you want it to be, and it’s up to your team and leadership to decide the level of reliability you want to achieve. There’s no panacea to software reliability; it’s what you do every day, week, and month that creates reliability. It’s the simple consistency of caring drives reliability.</p><p>With that said, here are a few ways to put a team into first gear towards destination site reliability.</p><h3>Leverage your incident retrospectives and put your learnings into action</h3><p>As a starting point, you can start by analyzing and learning from incidents through retrospectives (p.s. drop the term “postmortem,” no one died). Take the time to understand what everyone was doing to resolve the incident, why they were doing it, and under no circumstances blame anyone for an outage. Primarily, you’re trying to understand how an incident came to be. By identifying multiple contributing factors, no singular root cause, you can spend time in each of the identified areas and plan actions accordingly.</p><p>While retrospectives are a great way to understand why something failed, it’s almost more important to know why things work at all. If our SLAs designate we’re available 99.99% of the time, why are we spending time looking at 0.01% of the time for ways to be more reliable? Read the paper on  <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/signuptosafety/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2015/10/safety-1-safety-2-whte-papr.pdf">Safety-II</a>  for more information on this idea. I also loved being in the audience for  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-2jMlsPqc8&amp;feature=emb_title">this talk</a>  by Ryan Kitchens.</p><h3>Push the limits with Chaos engineering</h3><p>Trying to “break things on purpose,”  <a href="https://gremlin.com/">a Gremlin mantra</a> , is a great way to build resilience and reliability. The vaccine of outages is causing them intentionally so your team can react and build better software. Chaos engineering is one of my favorite ways to engineer better systems.</p><p>I also believe chaos engineering practices apply to more than just breaking software; it should include breaking processes, too.
Watch  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2sf2lb2-4I">Incident Ready: How to Chaos Engineering Your Incident Response Process</a>  to see what I mean.</p><h3>Enable your teams to quickly turn things on and off with release &amp; feature flags</h3><p>Feature flags aren’t a new idea, but there are more reasons than ever to start using them in your software stack. Complex systems and deploys sometimes need a light switch to make something go dark in the event of a failure. I suspect this is why LaunchDarkly chose the name they did. FireHydrant uses  <a href="https://launchdarkly.com/">LaunchDarkly</a>  extensively in nearly every new feature we build to roll them out to our customers slowly.</p><p>I’ll give you an example of a real-life feature flag: airplane spar valves. If an engine shutdown fails, pilots will shut a spar valve completely, cutting off fuel to the engine, allowing it to starve and shutdown. I imagine we’ll start seeing feature flags and release flags used more frequently for circuit breakers in complex applications in the same way pilots use spar valves for turning off engines in dire situations.</p><h3>Know what’s in your complex system by cataloging your service</h3><p>In any sufficiently complex system, the number of running applications will surpass an individual’s cognitive ability to keep track of them all. The inner workings of dozens, hundreds, and thousands of microservices exceed our brainpower. It’s essential to have an “address book” of all of the services you rely on. YellowPages (remember those?), if you will, so we know where the service is, who to call when it degrades, and its purpose. It would be best if you documented what is out there, what the service does, who owns it, and who knows the most about it (hint: these are commonly not the same people).</p><p> <a href="https://firerescuemagazine.firefighternation.com/2013/07/14/understanding-the-dispatcher-s-job/">Dispatchers are a critical part</a>  of the response process for getting the right fire station to the emergency as fast as possible. Dispatchers have a catalog of battalions, fire stations, and the neighborhoods they serve. Without knowing who is where and where emergencies are, dispatching emergency services would be significantly less efficient.</p><h3>Have a plan and a central knowledge base with simple runbooks</h3><p>I’ve seen nearly every company I’ve worked for have an alert fire when a database starts to approach its max disk capacity. After some time, the alert inevitably fires, and then a collective “ok, what now?” face trades between everyone. Simple runbooks are an excellent way for a team to develop the beginnings of shared knowledge, breaking down the tribal knowledge that likely exists, which is only revealed in crisis.</p><p>Runbooks are nothing more than a checklist, which Atul Gawande’s book  <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-checklist-manifesto-how-to-get-things-right/9780312430009">The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right</a>  covers extensively. With simple checklists, ICU units in Michigan saw a reduction of 66% in infection rates. Within 18 months, the simple checklists saved an estimated 1500 lives.</p><p>These simple lists work, and we can achieve even more reliable software with them.</p><h2>SLOs</h2><p>Reliability is hard to measure, but implementing service level objectives is a great way to start. My recommendation here is to create SLOs that don’t measure CPU or Memory usage but instead measure customer happiness. I fear most on-call engineers have been paged in the past for benign problems such as “memory is at 80%“.  <a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/alerting-on-slos">By alerting on SLOs</a> that measure customer experience, not computer vitals, we’re targeting a better sense of what reliability in our system truly means.</p><p>As for a book recommendation on implementing practical service level objectives, I highly recommend  <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/implementing-service-level-objectives-a-practical-guide-to-slis-slos-and-error-budgets/9781492076810">Implementing Service Level Objectives</a>  by Alex Hidalgo.</p><h2>Every day is a chance to be more reliable.</h2><p>When striving for reliable systems, I urge you to remember that shavings make a pile.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <hr> 
<p>Is it better to have no facts about a topic and thus no opinion, or have access to a few â€œout of contextâ€� facts and thus a misinformed opinion?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: Either start learning about issues you care about, or stop caring about them so much. Itâ€™s more honest, less mental effort, and is less likely to ruin Thanksgiving.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You canâ€™t be well-informed on every topic; Itâ€™s just not possible. Thatâ€™s why world leaders have advisers. Yet somehow, if you look at anyoneâ€™s Facebook account, you donâ€™t have to try too hard to figure out their view on any political issue.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Iâ€™ve started to realize how much nuance there is to the headlines we see. When I read an article that ruins the image of a company or individual, I always wonder: What information could the author be omitting? What view could the other side have? What outside information is the author conveniently using to make a point?</p>
<p>I try to avoid getting emotional until these questions are answered. Iâ€™m guilty of having basic gut feelings on unfamiliar topics, but these feelings arenâ€™t strong enough to start an argument. I talk about issues Iâ€™m informed about, and listen (with a grain of salt) to others talk about issues Iâ€™m not.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this isnâ€™t the case for lots of us. Instead of admitting we are uninformed, many of us form an opinion after we read the headline, and most likely donâ€™t update it after skimming the article with said headline. We are even less likely to look for an opposing take, as that requires we scroll outside of whatever feed we are browsing through. Some people donâ€™t even use the news to form opinions: They just accept the opinions of their friends or family as â€œobviousâ€�. As someone who accepted the outcome of the 2020 presidential election without looking into the claims of fraud, Iâ€™m guilty of this too.</p>
<p>We then take this opinion that a) isnâ€™t ours and b) took less than 10 seconds to form, and carry it into the foreseeable future, not even considering the idea that there might be more we donâ€™t know.</p>
<p>Whatâ€™s wrong with admitting that we donâ€™t know enough to judge a topic or event? Do we really think we have enough context and facts to make sound judgements on all our beliefs? Do we really need to hold an opinion after every scandal? Why canâ€™t we just say â€œThis is a side of a storyâ€� and move on?</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/03/timnit-gebru-google-fired/">Googleâ€™s firing of Timnit Gebru</a> for example:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I read a headline about Google firing a researcher that criticized the company on a mailing list. I didnâ€™t need about any more drama in my life, so I didnâ€™t read further, tucking this away in my mind as â€œresearcher fired from Googleâ€�.</li>
<li>Google responded with something along the lines of â€œshe was using an email list in such a way that was improper for her positionâ€�. I still didnâ€™t need the drama, so I kept it in my mind as â€œresearcher fired from Googleâ€�.</li>
<li>I still hold no strong positions on this specific topic and donâ€™t plan on learning more about it. Like in most â€œscandalsâ€�, thereâ€™s a lot of â€œhe said, she saidâ€� going on, and I donâ€™t need to spend time figuring out who is right.</li>
</ol>
<p>If I wanted to hold an opinion on this event, Iâ€™d need the following details to start:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code of conduct for Gebruâ€™s position</li>
<li>Other alternative methods Gebru could have used not in violation of the Code of Conduct if her actions violated it</li>
<li>The contents of the email</li>
<li>Verbose arguments from both sides refuting each otherâ€™s points if possible</li>
<li>Evidence of Gebruâ€™s claims</li>
</ul>
<p>As someone who does not work at nor plans to work at Google, this just isnâ€™t worth my time, so I donâ€™t form an opinion. There are other things to worry about.</p>
<p>TL;DR (again): Either start learning about issues you care about, or stop caring about them so much. Itâ€™s more honest, less mental effort, and is less likely to ruin Thanksgiving.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><em>This post talks about <a href="https://www.eduflow.com/">Eduflow</a> and <a href="https://www.peergrade.io/">Peergrade</a> – our two main products.</em></p>

<p>Let’s take a look at two fairly similar scenarios:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m signing up for some service and my card is declined</li>
  <li>I’m signing up for some service and I fail the 3DSecure check</li>
</ul>

<p>As a programmer – I know what you’re saying – under the hood these two are of course very different.</p>

<p>But from the user’s perspective, they were trying to pay and they failed to do so: potato, <em>potato3DSecure</em>. Unfortunately, if you’re using Stripe, the outcome of these two failures are very different:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If I’m creating a subscription in Stripe and I get a normal card decline, nothing happens. The user goes back to square one. No subscription, no nothing – as expected.</li>
  <li>If I’m creating a subscription in Stripe and I fail the 3DSecure verification – maybe I figured out that I didn’t want to buy anyways, once I saw that scary verification screen [1]. In this case, Stripe will have created the subscription and is basically expecting the user to pay for it within the next 23 hours. Basically, there’s a bunch of state, that both the user and the developer would expect to only have been created once the payment succeeded. (<a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-lifecycle">Stripe docs</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, that’s a leaky abstraction if I ever saw one.</p>

<p>In the olden days (for us that was Stripe Checkout Legacy along with Stripe Billing), the payment flow between a web app and Stripe would be this:</p>

<p>Web app → Stripe → Web app</p>

<p>Principally, this is still possible if you use the new Stripe Checkout. But if you have anything but the most vanilla of setups – that will not work for you: tiered pricing, per-seat pricing, and metered billing are not available in Stripe Checkout as of Jan 14th 2021. Like many other SAAS businesses, we use tiered per-seat pricing in Eduflow.</p>

<p>So we need to use Stripe Elements, build our own form, and write a ton of Javascript boilerplate that is probably 90-95% identical to what other users of Stripe Elements are writing.</p>

<p>The flow now looks roughly like this:</p>

<p>Web app → Stripe → Web app → Stripe → Web app</p>

<p>Bear in mind that this is the flow in the frontend. There has always been a bit of backend setup, but the amount of code and complexity there has roughly stayed the same when comparing with the old setup.</p>

<p>The extra added round-trip to Stripe here is related to 3DSecure. The idea is – if you after the first round-trip have a PaymentIntent with <code>status == "requires_action"</code> it means 3DSecure is required for the payment. You should then call <code>stripe.confirmCardSetup()</code> in the frontend which initiates the second round-trip to Stripe.</p>

<p>As far as I can see from <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/overview#requires-action">the Stripe documentation</a> there is no other option than <code>stripe.confirmCardSetup()</code> when this happens, so why do I even have the choice to initiate it? If Stripe just called <code>stripe.confirmCardSetup()</code> itself we’d be back to good old happy-path:</p>

<p>Web app → Stripe → Web app (but still with a lot of extra boilerplate)</p>

<p>Yes, initiating 3DSecure myself allows me to warn the user about it first. But as a European I’m getting 3DSecure everywhere these days (probably because we’ve just entered 2021) – with no warning beforehand – so I think it would make more sense for Stripe to allow developers to stay on the happy-path instead of defaulting to a more complicated special-case with no opt-out.</p>

<p>That was the original value proposition of Stripe. The frontend code we have in Peergrade is these <strong>23 lines of code</strong> and it does tiered, per-seat pricing:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>StripeCheckout</span>
  <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"Peergrade"</span>
  <span>description</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>plan</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>}</span>
  <span>amount</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>billedNow</span> <span>*</span> <span>100</span><span>}</span> <span>// amount is in cents</span>
  <span>email</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>email</span><span>}</span>
  <span>stripeKey</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>publicKey</span><span>}</span>
  <span>billingAddress</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>true</span><span>}</span>
  <span>zipCode</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>true</span><span>}</span>
  <span>token</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>({</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>email</span> <span>})</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    <span>createSubscription</span><span>({</span>
      <span>stripeToken</span><span>:</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>stripeEmail</span><span>:</span> <span>email</span><span>,</span>
      <span>planType</span><span>:</span> <span>plan</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>quantity</span><span>,</span>
    <span>})</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span>input</span>
    <span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"hidden"</span>
    <span>ref</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>_input</span> <span>=</span> <span>input</span>
    <span>}</span><span>}</span>
  <span>/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>StripeCheckout</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Granted, this uses <code>react-stripe-checkout</code>, but that’s just a very thin wrapper around <code>https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js</code>.</p>

<p>In Eduflow, because we’re forced to use Stripe Elements and it’s interweaved throughout our subscriptions page, with <code>&lt;CardNumberElement&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;CardExpiryElement&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;CardCvcElement&gt;</code>
and calls to <code>stripe.createPaymentMethod()</code> and <code>stripe.confirmCardPayment()</code>.</p>

<p>Technically we should do that in Peergrade as well due to PSD2, but for now we will just let those payments fail and ask the customers to switch to Eduflow. It’s too much hassle.</p>

<p>That old script – <code>checkout.js</code> – is really a one-line payment integration. Just include the script and you get the payment button! What happened Stripe?</p>

<p>I know what you’re gonna say – PSD2/SCA/3DSecure happened. Yes, it did. But Stripe already needed to ask the bank whether to allow the transaction (going through VISA/Mastercard and a bunch of other steps behind the scenes). Now Stripe also needs to ask the customer as well through something like 3DSecure. <code>checkout.js</code> already shows a modal with a form for inputting name, address and credit card, so they can just reuse that modal to let the user input the 3DSecure verification as well.</p>

<p>Interestingly, if you’re not creating a new subscription but rather upgrading an existing one you can use “<a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates">Pending updates</a>” to not have the subscription update until the transaction is fully confirmed with 3DSecure and everything. Why isn’t that the default, and why isn’t it available when the subscription is initially created?</p>

<p>[1] Everybody, <a href="https://stripe.com/en-gb-dk/guides/strong-customer-authentication">including Stripe</a>, expects 3DSecure to lower conversion rates, both because the extra step increases friction, but also because it will be unfamiliar and scary to some users. On a personal note, the first time I was asked to do 3DSecure probably 10 years ago or more, I declined. I never saw a 3DSecure prompt again until about 6 months ago. It just wasn’t something I had heard about, and so it seemed scary that I need to receive a text message in order to do a credit card purchase. Over time, I expect customers will get used to it and conversion rates will normalize.</p>

<!--
Card declines were already expected to be async in Stripe. The recommendation was to only provisioning whatever the user was paying for once your webhook was hit.

~~So here's my suggestion: The customer inputs their personal details and card details, and the web app sends that off to Stripe. Stripe checks with the bank whether the transaction is good to go. If the bank or some other security system replies "You need to do 3DSecure" – just do that – show the customer a spinner until the transaction (including 3DSecure) is finished. As a store/service/paid web app, I don't need to know about all that – it's part of the transaction.~~

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Problems emerging from data are common in research as well as in the industry. Those problems are dealt with as part of our project, but we usually don't bother solving them at their origin. We fix the data locally once, and we go on with our project. This is certainly a valid method in some cases, but as we share data more and more between projects, we are finding ourselves repeating the same processes over time and across teams. This issue is particularly true for public datasets shared by many people to train many machine learning models. I will show you how to create, maintain, and contribute to a long-living dataset that will update itself automatically across projects, using git and DVC as versioning systems, and DAGsHub as a host for the datasets.</p><h2 id="changing-datasets-is-a-common-process">Changing datasets is a common process</h2><p>I remember that during my undergraduate studies, I had to generate an instance segmentation model for cucumber plant parts, using a custom dataset of segmented leaves, cucumbers, and flowers. At a very early stage, I discovered I couldn't get reasonable results with the data given initially. I decided I would fix the annotations myself on about a dozen pictures. As expected, this solved 80 percent of the issues I was having. This is a good opportunity to say that manual data labor is underrated. Investing a few hours in fixing the data was the best thing I could do for the project. Then, of course, I went on with my life, leaving the fixed dataset on the lab computer, but knowing that eventually, my fixes were going to vanish.</p><p>Naturally, this process was gradual. I started with the original dataset, then I fixed a part of the annotations. At some point, I added completely new pictures, decided to redo some of them. I iterated over the data with multiple manipulations over time. Many of them I treated as "Debug trial-and-errors", naturally not keeping track of my working directory rigorously. During those iterations, I ran training sessions, while doing my best to keep a detailed record of my "experience". If you are still reading, you probably understand exactly what I am talking about. Well, the world has changed since then, and many data versioning tools have evolved to help. This is a good opportunity to recommend this <a href="https://dagshub.com/blog/data-version-control-tools/">comparison between data version control tools</a> we published at the end of 2020.</p><h2 id="what-is-data-versioning">What is data versioning?</h2><p>While my project was a total mess data-wise, its code was very well tracked by git. The reason is that I could just run the following magical commands that everyone knows:</p><pre><code>git add .
git commit -m "fixed training input directory"
</code></pre><p>Back then I wasn't able to do any magical command of that sort for my data. Now, with <a href="https://dvc.org/">DVC</a> and DAGsHub in the world, this is no longer the case. There is no reason on earth why you should not at least have a simple code and data versioning system set in place. If you are not familiar with DVC, I recommend you go through <a href="https://dagshub.com/docs/experiment-tutorial/2-data-versioning/">this basic data versioning tutorial</a>, but it is <strong><em>not</em></strong> a prerequisite to understand the rest of this post. All you really need to know is that now we have a new, magical command:</p><pre><code>dvc commit
</code></pre><p>That will create a snapshot of the tracked data, without inflating your git repository.</p><p>While data versioning solves the problem of managing data in the context of your machine learning project, it brings with it a new approach to managing <strong>datasets</strong>. This approach, also described as data registries <a href="https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases/data-registries">here</a>, consists of creating <strong>a git repository entirely dedicated to managing a dataset</strong>. This means that instead of training models on frozen datasets - something researchers, students, kagglers, and open source machine learning contributors often do - you could link your project to a dataset (or to any file for that matter), and treat it as a dependency. After all, <strong>data can and should be treated as code</strong>, and follow through a review process. You can read more about that in another post about <a href="https://dagshub.com/blog/data-bugs-how-to-fix-them/">data bugs and how to fix them</a>.</p><p><strong>Warning - Don't continue reading if you feel threatened by knowledge!</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6gDSdED1B5wjC2Gc/giphy.gif"><p><small><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/arielle-m-star-trek-information-overload-3o6gDSdED1B5wjC2Gc">via GIPHY</a></small></p></center><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>I am joking, of course, this isn't going to be rocket science at all. In fact, I will demonstrate how to use such a living-dataset in a project similar to my university project.</p><h2 id="creating-a-data-registry-to-use-it-as-a-living-dataset">Creating a data registry to use it as a living-dataset</h2><p>In order to demonstrate this new concept of living-datasets, I have set one up myself, as well as a machine learning model using it as a dependency.</p><p><strong><a href="https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentation-dataset">Repository A</a></strong> - AKA the living dataset, is going to be a simple project, with magical metadata files that point to real big files stored in a dedicated storage. I can organize the dataset files into directories, add code files with <code>utils</code> functions to work with it, or whatever I see fit to store and present my dataset to whoever might want to consume it.</p><p><strong><a href="https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentor">Repository B</a></strong> - AKA the machine learning project, is where I want to use the files stored in my living-dataset. This repository will import a directory from Repository A using DVC, and this will do the trick of having that directory manageable and updatable.</p><p>To create a data registry, just create a git + DVC directory.</p><pre><code>mkdir my-dataset &amp;&amp; cd my-dataset
git init
dvc init
</code></pre><p>Congrats! Your living-dataset is alive. Now we need to add some files to it.</p><figure><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YEL7FJP6ed008/giphy.gif" alt="https://media.giphy.com/media/YEL7FJP6ed008/giphy.gif"></figure><p>In my case, I took a handful of screenshots from a beloved TV Show, and annotated my favorite character in it, using the awesome open source <a href="https://github.com/jsbroks/coco-annotator">COCO annotator project</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/annotator-demo2_1.gif" alt=""></figure><p>After annotating around 40 pictures, I knew it was going to be enough for a pre-trained Mask-RCNN with a ResNet50 backbone, to give decent results (15 would have probably been enough too, but it was too fun to stop). I exported a <code>.json</code> annotation file, put it in my repository along with the screenshots I took. At this point my working directory looked like this:</p><pre><code>.
├── annotations
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── grogu.json
└── images
 &nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 000.png
 &nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 001.png
    .
    .
    .
 &nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 206.png
 &nbsp;&nbsp; └── 208.png
</code></pre><p>Then I ran the magic commands to start tracking the data files.</p><pre><code>dvc add annotations
dvc add images
git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m "Starting to manage my dataset"
</code></pre><p>Since I like visualizations I wrote a script in <a href="https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentation-dataset/src/master/Playground.ipynb">this python notebook</a> to render previews of my dataset into a <a href="https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentation-dataset/src/master/preview">preview directory</a>, which will also be tracked by DVC. Then I just push my code and data to my remote repository, so that I can access it from everywhere, and share it with my collaborators.</p><pre><code>git push origin master
dvc push -r origin
</code></pre><p>Note: I skipped the part of opening a repository on GitHub / DAGsHub and setting up the remote storage, <a href="https://dagshub.com/docs/experiment-tutorial/2-data-versioning/#pushing-code-data-and-models-to-dagshub">the tutorial</a> should cover that.</p><h2 id="using-a-living-dataset-in-a-machine-learning-project">Using a living-dataset in a machine learning project</h2><p>Now it is time to use my dataset as a dependency in my machine learning project. I will not be able to recreate my cucumber project from school, since I do not have access to the data, so I will substitute the cucumbers with the beloved fictional character from above.</p><p>I want my project directory to look like the following:</p><pre><code>.
├── data
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── preprocessed
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── raw
└── src
</code></pre><p>I want to import a directory from my dataset and treat it as <code>raw</code> files. I can do it by running from inside my repository:</p><pre><code>mkdir -p data/raw

dvc import -o data/raw/images \
https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentation-dataset \
data/images

dvc import -o data/raw/annotations \
https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentation-dataset \
data/annotations</code></pre><p>This will specifically download the directories <code>images</code> and <code>annotations</code> from inside my dataset repository, and keep information on how to continue tracking the changes made in it. More on tracking the changes will be explained later, but this is pretty much it.</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/data-repo--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/data-repo--1-.png 600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/data-repo--1-.png 921w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In the chart above you can see a representation of how it works. The arrows go in the direction of dependencies. Every time I know the dataset has changed, I just run the command</p><pre><code>dvc update
</code></pre><p>The <a href="https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/update">command above</a> will check for changes in the tracked ref of the repository, and pull them to my local directories. Then I re-run my pipeline from scratch - Train my model, save the best one, and commit my results. Notice that we can use this method of <code>dvc import</code> + <code>dvc update</code> to get the output model as a dependency in another project if we wanted to.</p><p>First, I want to thank you for reading along, I hope you enjoyed it. The project is still a work in progress (but what project isn't?). So if you find mistakes, or improvements to make, either in the dataset or the model, then just contribute to them! It's fairly easy to fork repositories, pull the data, push it, and merge it. Especially with <a href="https://dagshub.com/blog/data-science-pull-requests/">data-science pull requests</a>. The process can easily be adapted to any segmentation dataset, so feel free to do so as well.</p><p>Special thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asher-yartsev/">Asher</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/or-shemesh-4a99a7101/">Or</a>, my fellow students from the original segmentation project that gave me inspiration for this mini-project.</p><p>Here are some results just for fun!</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/grogus.png" alt="" srcset="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/grogus.png 600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/grogus.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>

<p>For the last two years, Mala Jadwani, a 31-year-old teacher, has received daily messages from her 60-year-old <em>chachi</em>. On their family WhatsApp group, her aunt, who started using a smartphone a few years ago, posts classic older-relative content: garden-variety motivational quotes, prayer emojis, home remedies for body aches, and “good morning,” “good afternoon,” and “good evening” greetings accompanied by pictures of babies and roses. On days when her chachi’s messages were particularly prolific, Jadwani’s phone would freeze, forcing her to disable WhatsApp’s automatic photo download setting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But last week, her chachi’s<em> </em>WhatsApp messages suddenly stopped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Worried, Jadwani called her aunt. It turned out that she had read a chain of viral messages on WhatsApp, which falsely said the platform’s messaging system was no longer private. She was one of millions of users who received a push notification from WhatsApp earlier this month, explaining that the company was updating its privacy policy, mostly in superficial ways. After February 8, 2021, “you’ll need to accept these changes to continue using WhatsApp,” <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/whatsapp_new_privacy_policy_facebook-news-47077.php">the update read</a>. The thought of her WhatsApp messages being exposed frightened Jadwani’s aunt so much, she said, that she stopped sending messages on WhatsApp altogether.&nbsp;</p>



<p>India is WhatsApp’s largest consumer market by many measures, but backlash against the recent privacy policy change is now threatening its future in the country. Many people have debated the update with their friends and family, and it’s also been featured in nightly news shows and on the front page of local newspapers. Last week, Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, took <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90593913/whatsapp-facebook-privacy-outrage-newspaper-ads">out full-page advertisements</a> and plugged interviews <a href="https://twitter.com/digbijaymishra1/status/1349562056429641735?s=20">with the heads of WhatsApp</a> in newspapers, in an effort to mitigate the fallout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The change isn’t actually a departure from how WhatsApp has treated user data for years. The platform has shared metadata — phone numbers, how often the app is opened, and operating system information —&nbsp;with Facebook since <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/08/whatsapp-privacy-facebook/">2016</a>. The pop-up notification millions of users received on January 8 sought explicit permission to continue these existing practices. But unlike four years ago, “there was no opt-out option to refuse sharing information with Facebook companies,” said Apar Gupta, executive director of the nonprofit Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF).</p>



<p>The new changes are related to how businesses communicate with WhatsApp users. The update made it clearer that commercial activity on the messaging platform has the potential to spill over into other Facebook apps: “a handbag you browse on WhatsApp could pop up later in your Instagram app,” as <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/technology/whatsapp-data.html">explained</a>. Over <a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1347660772483104769?s=20">175 million</a> people already message companies on WhatsApp, and the updated terms of service would make it “easier to chat with businesses who may use Facebook business products,” <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/about-new-business-features-and-whatsapps-privacy-policy-update">reads a blog post</a> from WhatsApp’s communications team. The post claims that the update would enable customer service features like purchase receipts.</p>



<p>The confusing change triggered a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/signals-downloads-skyrocketed-4200-after-whatsapp-announced-it-would-force-users-to-share-personal-data-with-facebook/articleshow/80232029.cms">mass exodus</a> of WhatsApp users, who moved to other messaging platforms like Signal and <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/terror-on-telegram/">Telegram</a>. After the disastrous rollout, Facebook later announced it was delaying updating its privacy policy by three months, but for loyal WhatsApp users, the damage has already been done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Facebook’s privacy practices and <a href="https://thewire.in/business/facebook-is-misleading-indians-with-its-full-page-ads-about-free-basics">policy decisions</a> in India have long been criticized. What’s different this time are the demographics of the people who are outraged: uncles and aunties. For the first time, India’s most loyal and engaged users are questioning the intentions of an app that has grown to encompass nearly every aspect of their daily lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WhatsApp groups are an indispensable part of South Asian families: they’re a forum for gossip, dodgy forwarded messages, boisterous political debates, and generally the primary way for relatives to stay in touch. Many of these WhatsApp family groups — including my own — erupted with anger and confusion in the days after the platform sent the pop-up message announcing its new policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sheshadri Narayanane, a friend from high school, is a part of two family groups. He said his 70-year-old aunt falsely believed WhatsApp had been granted access to her bank accounts. <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/whatsapp-pay-enters-india/">WhatsApp recently launched payments</a> in India, allowing users to send and receive money by connecting their bank accounts to the messaging app. The privacy update came shortly after WhatsApp Pay was launched, which might have caused some of the confusion. “Bad timing is my theory,” Narayanane speculated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On prime-time talk shows, news hosts likened the update to <em>digital dadagiri</em>, or “digital bullying,” by WhatsApp. “They want to sell your chats — your data from WhatsApp private chats — to business enterprises,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0F5T1Q0z5Y">declared</a> one news anchor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The debates often took on a political tone. Some TV hosts asked questions about the government’s ability to protect India’s sovereignty. Gaurav Bhatia, the national spokesperson of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2hTa_Bhd_o">weighed in</a>, saying his party would go to any lengths necessary to protect the privacy of its citizens. On January 19, the Ministry of Electronics and Communication Technology (MeitY) sent a request to Facebook to <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/govt-tells-whatsapp-to-respect-privacy-of-indians-withdraw-new-policy/articleshow/80344964.cms?from=mdr">withdraw the new changes made to its privacy policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Why is it that these social media giants, who need the India market, are having two different policies for different countries?” Bhatia said on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2hTa_Bhd_o">nightly news show,</a> referencing the fact that WhatsApp’s policy update <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/why-whatsapp-s-privacy-rules-sparked-moves-to-rivals-quicktake">does not apply to the European Union</a>. Some accused WhatsApp of treating Indians as “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S18of5M6g2M&amp;t=1625s">second-rate citizens</a>.” Local technology entrepreneurs who compete with Big Tech companies like Facebook soon <a href="https://twitter.com/vijayshekhar/status/1349186007007023104?s=20">piled on</a>.</p>



<p>Facebook has repeatedly emphasized that WhatsApp can’t see the content of end-to-end encrypted messages, which can be viewed by only the sender and receiver. Alternatives like <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2021/01/11/whatsapp-telegram-signal-privacy-security-comparison/">Telegram don’t necessarily offer</a> the same protections as WhatsApp. Digital liberties activists and advocacy groups like IFF <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/661313394906161152?s=20">recommend</a> using Signal instead for sensitive communications, and the app quickly became the number one downloaded app in India earlier this month. Signal commemorated its victory on Twitter. “Look at what you’ve done,” read a <a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1347693761044701186?s=20">tweet</a> from the app’s official account, accompanied by an emoji of the Indian flag.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though users are downloading Signal and other encrypted alternatives in high numbers, switching might not be as simple for aunties and uncles who spent years becoming proficient in using WhatsApp. Vivek K, a 28-year-old tech entrepreneur, tried making the case to his mother that she should switch over to Signal and was met with an unenthusiastic response: “She said, ‘Now, you’re making me learn one more app? I can’t do it; I’m too old for this<em>,</em>’” explained Vivek.</p>



<p>For now, with the privacy update postponed until at least May, WhatsApp is working to mitigate the backlash. But people like Jadwani’s chachi are still staying away from the messaging app. Jadwani said she hasn’t missed the lack of daily greetings. “No wonder my phone hasn’t had issues,” she said with a laugh.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><blockquote><p>This is an in-depth review of how Synyx GmbH &amp; Co building is using Turing Pi board in combination with GitLab CI and Ansible for their CI/CD needs</p><cite>Author: Karl-Ludwig Reinhard</cite></blockquote></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>In my previous&nbsp;article,&nbsp;I explained some cloudy statements about Ansible and Gitlab CI and that we’re going to work with a Turing Pi for that purpose. I already talked about the capabilities of this amazing board and the first steps it takes to get it up and running. Today I’ll go a little bit into details on what benefits we are having when running Ansible scripts in a CI environment and most important where the Turing Pi helps us.</p><h3>What we’re going to build with it?</h3><p>In our project, we have a lot of Raspis and configure them all with Ansible. From time to time we are adding new features and fixing bugs in our Ansible scripts and that makes them more complex. We are using GitLab to review our code, but what is missing is a validation of the syntax and that the code will actually work on production’s hardware. Considering that our team continues to grow, this adds more complexity. So we put 4 Raspberry Pis into a rack and integrated them as a deploy target for our merge requests.</p><h4>When a user opens a merge request, we reboot the machine and run the OS via the network. With that, we can flash the SD card with a fresh Raspbian. After a reboot, we can start our Ansible scripts to test if the merge request is sane.</h4><figure><img src="https://synyx.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rack2-768x534.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://synyx.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rack2-768x534.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure><p>With just running an Ansible Playbook for setting up hosts from 0 to 100 we get the following benefits:</p><ol><li>Check if the syntax is correct</li><li>Ensure that all needed files are committed</li><li>Can different configuration flavors still be applied?</li></ol><h2>Why do we need netboot at all?</h2><p>Our goal is to run our Ansible script against a freshly installed Raspbian. We cannot be sure, that the last tested merge request was flawless. The idea is to reboot the node into an NFS based root file system. From there we can flash a Raspbian and reboot into a clean OS. After that, we can apply &amp; test our Ansible scripts. Following this process guarantees, that every merge request gets a clean system without any leftovers from a previous run.</p><h2>Setting up Gitlab CI/runner</h2><p>To be honest&nbsp; – we’re currently stuck with a shell runner. We weren’t able to find a proper working docker image with ansible that doesn’t lack some tooling/libs that are currently required. Building a custom docker image would be possible but for the sake of simplicity, we use a simple shell runner.</p><p>First of all, we need to set up one node as a DHCP/TFTP boot server. Here is a good <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net_tutorial.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tutorial</a> on how to do this. We recommend to run one of the Turing Pi nodes as a DHCP/TFTP boot server – it’s more reliable than a server placed outside of the board.</p><p>One thing to note: The DHCP server is located behind a NAT router so it does not interfere with DHCP servers in our company network.</p><p>When the server is up and running, we need to set up the Gitlab runner.</p><ol><li>Due to the fact we rely on a shell runner Ansible has to be installed by hand. This can be done with your package manger. Also, install all dependencies that are needed for a successful Ansible run.</li><li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net_tutorial.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Install</a> GitLab CI runner. When asked which kind of runner, choose shell runner.</li><li>Add a custom inventory.<br>You can use your regular inventory and add there your ci host. Then you have to limit your Ansible run with <code><mark>–limit</mark></code> option. If omitted you’ll most probably deploy your prod system with every merge request 🙂</li><li>Add or change <code><mark>.gitlab-ci.yml</mark></code> accordingly:</li></ol><pre data-enlighter-language="yaml" data-enlighter-theme="atomic" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">stages:
  - test-on-pis
  
test-on-turing-pi:
  stage: test-on-pis 
  script:
    - export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
    - mkdir $HOME/.ssh || true 
    - echo -e "Host 192.168.2.*\nStrictHostKeyChecking no\nUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" &gt; $HOME/.ssh/config
    - ansible-playbook reflash.yml -i hostsCI.yml -e "ansible_ssh_pass=Bai9iZaetheeSee5"

    - ansible-playbook site.yml -i hostsCI.yml -e "ansible_ssh_pass=Bai9iZaetheeSee5" -e "http_proxy="
  except:
    - master</pre><p>We do some „dirty“ SSH tricks at the beginning. This ensures that Ansible can connect to the systems even when the host keys have changed. That will happen with our setup after we reflashed the system. We tried to do this during an ansible run but weren’t successful.</p><p>Reflashing your Pi is really straightforward when the PXE server is setup. Let’s have a look at some excerpt:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="yaml" data-enlighter-theme="atomic" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">--

    delay: 60
    timeout: 120
  connection: local</pre><ul><li>• First of all, we check if the current system is already running on an NFS root filesystem. If so we can skip the next two steps. If not we destroy the current boot partition – just write some rubbish on the raw device.</li><li>• Next, we reboot the system.</li><li>• Then we flash the sd card/eMMC with the help of Zcat. We compress our images to save some HD space and be able to transfer them via a wan connection(if needed). The performance impact is negligible. One reboot later and that’s it. We have a freshly installed Raspbian and can apply our Ansible scripts to a fresh system.</li></ul><h3>Two things to note:</h3><ul><li>• We ignore errors when flashing. When the image is missing or similar, we just continue and reboot the system. In most cases, the system will be still accessible</li><li>• I couldn’t get the reboot module working properly. I think the newly flashed system does not have the same remote user and password as when we started the role. With this ugly part, it’s working 🙂</li></ul><p>Be aware that the above script is an excerpt from the main.yml of the corresponding role and is not complete!</p><h3>What we also do</h3><p>After a successful run, we apply some smoke tests. One flavor of our RPis is kiosk systems that start X11 and opens a chromium browser in fullscreen mode. With some „technical creativity“(aka mocking) we ensure that the browser is running. When this is not going to happen, the build fails. Another flavor is used for controlling an industrial actor and its basic functionality is also tested at the end. We do not test every aspect, it’s more of a kind of smoke tests or checks if certain TCP ports are open.</p><p>What we also want to know how our Ansible scripts affect a running system that is not flattened or rebooted on every run. We deploy two node continuously when a merge to master happens. With that, we can also monitor the memory usage on these systems and can identify possible memory leaks or stability issues when running a system longer time. It has served us well as an additional safety net.</p><h2>Why the Turing Pi is ideal for us</h2><p>Compared to our old setup we gained speed and stability of our builds. In the past, we had problems when booting multiple pis in parallel from the network. PIs were stuck in the boot process and didn’t get their kernel via TFTP or couldn’t mount the NFS root reliably. To this day, I’m not sure where I went wrong – I fixed it by throttling the reboots so that the Pis are booted one by one. That slowed down the „build“ significantly.</p><h4>With the Turing Pi we did not encounter any problems booting pis in parallel from the network at the same time. So after testing it a bit I removed the throttle and reduced the build time significantly</h4><p>Another thing we see a lot less stuck Ansible jobs because the network connection is flaky. I got the impression, that working with the network on the PCB is a lot more reliant. We use Turing Pi for two weeks as a replacement for our old „test cluster“ – can’t remember that I had to reset the cluster manually caused by a frozen job.</p><p>Currently, we work most of the time from home –&nbsp; Covid19 case numbers are rising in Germany and it looks like we’ll stay at home for some time. With some VPN and network magic, we can use some nodes as test devices from the remote. In the past, everybody got his „personal“ test pi, had to ensure proper network connection, flash the sd card manually, etc. Yes, you can use Raspbian X86 but some things like accessing Bluetooth or GPIOs cannot properly be tested in a virtual environment.</p><h2>What we’ve learned as a team?</h2><p>In our last review and retro, we talked also about our CI setup. We’ve agreed, that it helps us a lot in our day-to-day business and adds to the quality of our merge requests. For me personally, it is a very good incentive to use more merge requests so the CI pipeline is triggered and I am forced to work more in a clean way. But it takes time to set it up, stabilize some (ugly) parts – but after all the time investment is worth it. Additional tests and reviews improve the quality even in the context of configuring an OS and reduces the number of errors.</p><h2>What we miss with Turing Pi</h2><p>Not much to be honest. Two things would be really awesome:</p><ol><li>Switching the HDMI output from the first node to a different node via i2c</li><li>For flashing EMMc the first slot only can be used. It would be great if you could also use the other slots for flashing as well.</li></ol><p>I think achieving these two points isn’t easy and for us not really pain points 🙂</p><h2>Where we (maybe) want to go</h2><p>Currently, we are deploying our prod systems still from our workstations. Continuos delivery will be a topic for us. But something like „merge on master“ and deploy the prod system instantly is too risky for us. Our Pis are an integral part of our customers. And that’s not the definition for CD(for me :)). Our pis are not easily …</p></div></div>

<p>Kubernetes is a great platform to deploy our microservices and applications to. One of the excellent features is that pods are restarted or removed from a service when they don’t work correctly. Kubernetes needs our help to understand if a pod is working or not. This is configured via Container Probes.</p>

<p>Any application can be in an unhealthy state due to bugs, missing dependencies on external resources, and so on. To make sure our traffic flows correctly, we need to make sure probes are configured.</p>

<h2 id="probes"><a href="#probes">#</a>Probes</h2>

<p>Probes are kubelet’s answer to the health checks, there are three handlers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/#execaction-v1-core">ExecAction</a></strong>: Command execution check, if the command’s exit status is 0, it is considered a success.</li>
<li><strong>TCPSocketAction</strong>: TCP check to determine if the port is open, if open, it is considered a success.</li>
<li><strong>HTTPGetAction</strong>: HTTP check to determine if the status code is equal to or above 200 and below 400.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each type of probe has common configurable fields:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>initialDelaySeconds</strong>: Probes start running after <code>initialDelaySeconds</code> after container is started (default: 0)</li>
<li><strong>periodSeconds</strong>: How often probe should run (default: 10)</li>
<li><strong>timeoutSeconds</strong>: Probe timeout (default: 1)</li>
<li><strong>successThreshold</strong>: Required number of successful probes to mark container healthy/ready (default: 1)</li>
<li><strong>failureThreshold</strong>: When a probe fails, it will try <code>failureThreshold</code> times before deeming unhealthy/not ready (default: 3)</li>
</ul>

<p>These parameters need to be configured per your application’s spec.</p>

<h3 id="exec-probe"><a href="#exec-probe">#</a>Exec Probe</h3>

<p>Exec action has only one field, and that is <code>command.</code> Exit status of the command is checked, and the status of zero (0) means it is healthy, and other value means it is unhealthy.</p>

<pre><code>        readinessProbe:
          initialDelaySeconds: 1
          periodSeconds: 5
          timeoutSeconds: 1
          successThreshold: 1
          failureThreshold: 1
          exec:
            command:
            - cat
            - /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
</code></pre>

<h3 id="tcp-probe"><a href="#tcp-probe">#</a>TCP Probe</h3>

<p>We need to define <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> parameters, <code>host</code> parameter defaults to the cluster-internal pod IP.</p>

<pre><code>        readinessProbe:
          initialDelaySeconds: 1
          periodSeconds: 5
          timeoutSeconds: 1
          successThreshold: 1
          failureThreshold: 1
          tcpSocket:
            host:
            port: 80
</code></pre>

<h3 id="http-probe"><a href="#http-probe">#</a>HTTP Probe</h3>

<p>HTTP Probe has additional options to configure.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>host</strong>: Host/IP to connect to (default: pod IP)</li>
<li><strong>scheme</strong>: Scheme to use when making the request (default: HTTP)</li>
<li><strong>path</strong>: Path</li>
<li><strong>httpHeaders</strong>: An array of headers defined as header/value map</li>
<li><strong>port</strong>: Port to connect to</li>
</ul>

<p>Tip: If you need to set the Host header of the HTTP, please do so on httpHeaders, instead of the host parameter.</p>

<pre><code>        readinessProbe:
          initialDelaySeconds: 1
          periodSeconds: 2
          timeoutSeconds: 1
          successThreshold: 1
          failureThreshold: 1
          httpGet:
            host:
            scheme: HTTP
            path: /
            httpHeaders:
            - name: Host
              value: myapplication1.com
            port: 80
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 5
</code></pre>

<h2 id="readiness-probes-in-kubernetes"><a href="#readiness-probes-in-kubernetes">#</a>Readiness Probes in Kubernetes</h2>

<p>Kubernetes runs readiness probes to understand when it can send traffic to a pod, i.e., to transition the pod to <code>Ready</code> state. For example, if a pod is used as a backend endpoint for a service, a readiness probe will determine if the pod will receive traffic or not. The readiness probe is executed throughout the pod’s lifetime; this means that readiness probes continue to be executed after reaching the <code>Ready</code> state. Also, our application can make itself unavailable for maintenance or for some background tasks as well by responding with different values to the probe.</p>

<p>A pod transitions the following states:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PodScheduled</strong>: Pod is scheduled on an available node</li>
<li><strong>ContainersReady</strong>: All containers in <code>Ready</code> state</li>
<li><strong>Initialized</strong>: All init containers are started</li>
<li><strong>Ready</strong>: Pod is ready to receive traffic (readiness probe)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="common-pitfalls-for-readiness-probes"><a href="#common-pitfalls-for-readiness-probes">#</a>Common Pitfalls for Readiness Probes</h2>

<p>Readiness probes check the configured action for the duration of the container’s lifetime; therefore, any disruption or delay in answering can cause service disruption. Sometimes the application needs to read a large amount of data experiencing latency issues or make an expensive calculation, which might prevent such an answer from being delivered. This behavior should be considered when configuring readiness probes. Testing thoroughly before going live with a readiness probe is highly recommended.</p>

<h3 id="cascading-failures"><a href="#cascading-failures">#</a>Cascading Failures</h3>

<p>Consider this, we have configured a readiness probe with HTTPGet, and our application checks the database connection before answering the probe. Let’s suggest there is a database problem; in this case, all pods will be unreachable unless the database is back. Do we want this behavior? Certainly no, we could feed the database error to the front end and notify the user of the unavailability; even if we increase <code>failureThreshold</code> we might not be able to avoid a cascading failure. Avoiding external dependencies on readiness probe answers is what I would recommend in any case.</p>

<h3 id="external-dependencies"><a href="#external-dependencies">#</a>External Dependencies</h3>

<p>Let’s assume that you have a key/value store used for caching, and your readiness probe endpoint checks this connection as well. The application is capable of running without the key/value store as it will only slow down but it will run a full database query every time it needs to access data. In this case, if the readiness probe fails because of the key/value store not being available, your whole application will be down for some time -until you fix the key/value store which is certainly not desirable.</p>

<p>You need to clearly design your probes considering how your application behaves and how the application responds when there is a failure. You might want to restart the pod (via liveness checks) or remove it from service with a readiness probe.</p>

<h2 id="example-sample-nginx-deployment"><a href="#example-sample-nginx-deployment">#</a>Example: Sample Nginx Deployment</h2>

<p>To see readiness probes in action, we can configure a sample app, a simple NGINX web server in this case. Here we have defined a simple deployment configuration:</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: k8s-probes
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        readinessProbe:
          initialDelaySeconds: 1
          periodSeconds: 2
          timeoutSeconds: 1
          successThreshold: 1
          failureThreshold: 1
          httpGet:
            host:
            scheme: HTTP
            path: /
            httpHeaders:
            - name: Host
              value: myapplication1.com
            port: 80
</code></pre>

<p>Save this configuration to a file called k8s-probes-deployment.yaml and apply it with <code>kubectl apply -f k8s-probes-deployment.yaml</code>.</p>

<pre><code>apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx
  name: nginx
  namespace: default
spec:
  ports:
  - name: nginx-http-port
    port: 80
  selector:
    app: nginx
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: NodePort
</code></pre>

<p>Save this configuration to a file called k8s-probes-svc.yaml and apply it with <code>kubectl apply -f k8s-probes-svc.yaml</code>.</p>

<p>There is no separate endpoint for readiness probes, but we can access events using the <code>kubectl describe pods &lt;POD_NAME&gt;</code> command, for example, to get the current status.</p>

<p>Use <code>kubectl get pods</code> command to see the pods’ status.</p>

<pre><code>kubectl get pods
</code></pre>

<p>Pods and their status and ready states will be displayed, our pod is running as expected.</p>

<pre><code>NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
k8s-probes-7d57f897dd-td2q2   1/1     Running   0          1m23s
</code></pre>

<p>With <code>kubectl describe pod &lt;POD_NAME&gt;</code></p>

<pre><code>kubectl describe pod k8s-probes-755b4bf57c-jgcqw
</code></pre>

<p>At the bottom of the output <code>Events</code> will be displayed:</p>

<pre><code>Events:
  Type    Reason     Age   From               Message
  ----    ------     ----  ----               -------
  Normal  Scheduled  15m   default-scheduler  Successfully assigned default/k8s-probes-755b4bf57c-jgcqw to k8s-probes
  Normal  Pulling    15m   kubelet            Pulling image "nginx"
  Normal  Pulled     15m   kubelet            Successfully pulled image "nginx" in 1.418647753s
  Normal  Created    15m   kubelet            Created container nginx
  Normal  Started    15m   kubelet            Started container nginx
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s look at the endpoints with <code>kubectl get endpoints</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>kubectl get endpoints
</code></pre>

<p>We can see Nginx service has an endpoint.</p>

<pre><code>NAME         ENDPOINTS           AGE
kubernetes   10.132.0.42:16443   8h
nginx        10.1.85.203:80      6m11s
</code></pre>

<p>To see more detail we can use <code>kubectl describe endpoints nginx</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>Name:         nginx
Namespace:    default
Labels:       app=nginx
Annotations:  endpoints.kubernetes.io/last-change-trigger-time: 2020-11-13T20:34:13Z
Subsets:
  Addresses:          10.1.85.203
  NotReadyAddresses:  &lt;none&gt;
  Ports:
    Name             Port  Protocol
    ----             ----  --------
    nginx-http-port  80    TCP
</code></pre>

<p>Configure the readiness probe’s <code>port</code> parameter to 81 and apply the configuration.</p>

<p>Again let’s check the pods status</p>

<pre><code>kubectl get pods
</code></pre>

<p>As we have updated our deployment by default, a new pod is created, and as you can see, it is not in the ready state.</p>

<pre><code>NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
k8s-probes-755b4bf57c-jgcqw   1/1     Running   0          13m
k8s-probes-7d57f897dd-td2q2   0/1     Running   0          2m49s
</code></pre>

<p>Here status is running however <code>READY</code> state determines our pod is not ready yet. Let’s explore the status and events with <code>kubectl describe pods &lt;POD_NAME&gt;</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>kubectl describe pod k8s-probes-7d57f897dd-td2q2
</code></pre>

<p>We can see that the readiness probe failed due to the connection being refused therefore pod will not receive any traffic.</p>

<pre><code>Events:
  Type     Reason     Age                From               Message
  ----     ------     ----               ----               -------
  Normal   Scheduled  58s         …</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Once or twice a year I’ll go through a phase of extreme delegation to cope with the demands of startup life. I make long lists of my worries </span><b><i>—</i></b><span> responsibilities, systems, activities, even relationships </span><b><i>—</i></b><span> and ruthlessly brainstorm how to hand them off to someone else. Channeling Marie Kondo, I insist that I don’t have to do anything that doesn’t bring me joy. Unfortunately, that’s not how life works, and my master plan of delegation fails.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Still, delegation is crucial to </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2017/10/to-be-a-great-leader-you-have-to-learn-how-to-delegate-well"><span>managing well</span></a><span>. If I can’t get off of the hamster wheel of doing, I may miss the big picture. Here are the mistakes I’m trying not to repeat.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Delaying delegation too long</strong></h5>
<p><span>My responsibility purge is usually triggered by </span><a href="https://blog.prialto.com/i-know-i-should-be-delegating-to-save-me-time-but-i-am-just-too-busy-to-figure-it-out"><span>extreme overwhelm</span></a><span>. If I’m not careful, I will listen to the overwhelm telling me that delegating will be more work than doing the work myself. That may initially be true, but it will also mean that I can never get out from under my own task list to see better ways to do something or to grow. To determine whether a task may be a good handoff candidate, I’m asking the following:</span><i></i></p>
<ul>
<li><i><span>Does the task consume a disproportionate amount of energy</span></i><span>? Every Thursday, I need to duplicate and distribute a team presentation. It seems too insignificant to put on my to-do list every week, so I rely on myself to remember it unprompted each Thursday afternoon. I could put a calendar reminder for it, but then someone will schedule a meeting during that time, and I’ll miss the reminder. I clearly spend too much energy thinking about this and need to hand it off.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><span>Do I actively dread the task? </span></i><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/12/ill-do-it-later/578173/"><span>Laundry is my nemesis</span></a><span>, and I will strategically plan outfits to avoid doing it for as long as possible. It wasn’t until Dan suggested having someone else do it that I first glimpsed freedom. In fact, that someone else may even do a better job and get joy from it. I waited so long to consider delegating this one that I almost forgot that escape is possible.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><span>Does the task specifically require my voice, face, writing, or knowledge? </span></i><span>Some days at an early stage company can feel like everything is waiting on me. Truthfully, very few tasks probably do, but that’s not what my ego wants to hear. Vacation days are a great reminder that the company </span><i><span>can</span></i><span> survive without me. When I start to dread a day off, I know that I’m handling too much.</span></li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Handing off the wrong tasks</strong></h5>
<p><span>In a typical week, I check out five or so books from the library. When I first hired an assistant, I created an elaborate system for them to log into my accounts, pull books from my reading list, and send them to my Kindle or local library branch. My goal was an endless stream of interesting reading. The result was far from that.</span></p>
<p><span>I became overwhelmed by the pressure to read and unhappy with the mix of books being selected (even though they were pre-selected by me!). Reading became a chore rather than a relaxing pastime. I realized that I craved books related to the events of the week, and I missed perusing the shelves myself. I had handed off something I loved for the sake of creating more time to do the things I love.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Startups pull us in multiple directions, and it can be hard to remember what we love about our jobs. Be clear about why you’re delegating and </span><a href="https://marissabracke.com/dont-delegate-what-you-love-doing-delegate-what-supports-you-doing-it"><span>hold on to the activities that bring you joy</span></a><span>. A shorter to-do list is only wonderful if the remaining items don’t make you want to quit your job.</span></p>

<h5><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/04/30/delegate-outcomes-not-activities/"><span><strong>Dictating process rather than outcome</strong></span></a></h5>
<p><span>Another hard concept for my ego to grasp: my way isn’t the only way. So I let my assistant set up appointments for me however she deemed fit. When I looked back through my sent mail, I noticed that she had started each of her emails with “Good day to you.” Not what I would have said, but she still achieved the outcome.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://swipesapp.com/blog/delegation-and-trust-team-productivity"><span>Delegation requires trust</span></a><span>, and trust is earned. Start off with small outcomes and work towards higher stake assignments. You’ve made hires for a reason, so use their brainpower and past experience to figure out the “how” for themselves. Letting someone else think through a process and execute on it means the method may be different from mine, and we both end up learning something.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Put in the time to delegate the right tasks to the right people before you become overwhelmed. Then they can write articles like this for you. (Or so says my delegation fantasy.)</span></p>

So for this (overly protracted) essay, I thought I'd publish my notes on how I created my own Git server.</p><p>There are many open source projects like <a href="https://gitea.io/en-us/">GitTea</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> to make hosting your own git projects effortless; however I wanted a much more simple (read: old school) setup. I ended up with something that uses many of the same projects that the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">Linux Organization</a> uses to publish the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/">Linux Kernel</a></p><p>The server (as of this writing) uses <a href="http://www.releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/">Ubuntu's 20.04.1 LTS (Focal Fossa)</a> running on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean's</a> hardware (<a href="https://m.do.co/c/b0f6f650ad4e">referral-link</a>). I wholeheartedly support and recommend you chose a different setup. Diversity in people and in tech stack is always and will always be a great thing.</p><p>What lies below can be broken into 3 main topics:</p><ol><li><a href="#the-start">The Start</a> prepares a newly minted server for git hosting duties. Creating a new admin user, locking down the OpenSSH daemon, and installing fail2ban.</li><li><a href="#gitolite">Gitolite</a> installs and configures the server to allow us (and colleagues) to have more fine-grained control over who has access to <code>git push|fetch</code> on the server.</li><li>And <a href="#cgit">Cgit</a>, <a href="#fastcgi-wrapper">fcgiwrap</a>, and <a href="#nginx">Nginx</a> to create a web-server to view our published projects.</li></ol><div><p>In the end, you'll have a server much like <a href="https://git.bryanbrattlof.com/">this one</a>.</p><p><em>Enjoy!</em></p></div><div id="the-start"><h2>The Start</h2><p>I often find security <em>"best practices"</em> are a lot like driving down the highway. Some people speeding past you are <em>"obviously"</em> just moments away from a major data breach, while the others you're passing are <em>"clearly"</em> so worried about the entire data-center burning down, they couldn't possibly get anything else done. Everyone thinks everyone else has lost their marbles.</p><p>So with that in mind, here are a few steps I took to secure my newly minted server. Please feel free to use only the <em>"best practices"</em> you deem appropriate for your mission.</p><p>Or just <a href="#gitolite">skip to the "installing Gitolite"</a> part directly.</p><div id="admin-user"><h3>Admin User</h3><p>For whatever reason, be it for security or protecting the server from my stupidity, one of the first things I do when creating a new server is add a new user for my general admin tasks.</p><p>Adding a new user is remarkably easy to do on a Ubuntu system:</p><p>You'll be prompted to answer a few questions, including creating a new UNIX password. This will be the password you'll need to <code>sudo -i</code> and gain <code>root</code> permissions, so make it a good one, or use tools like <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">Pass</a>, or <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">BitWarden</a> to help you remember.</p><p>Then give our new <code>limb</code> user <code>sudo</code> permissions:</p><p>I've also largely eliminated all password based authentication when signing into servers, relying on open source smart cards like <a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/">NitroKey</a> for authentication. If interested, this requires we setup <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code> for our <code>limb</code> user:</p><p>Just replace <code>key</code> with your public ssh key:</p><div><pre><span></span>$ mkdir /home/limb/.ssh

<p><strong><span>The Short Answer: Tanks all day.</span></strong></p>



<p>We needed to replace our aging hot water tank in 2020, so I discussed the tankless option with several plumbing professionals and homeowners.  Over the last few years, I have experienced the transition from tank to tankless at my in-laws home. We confidently decided the tank was better.</p>



<h2>Functional</h2>



<p>Tankless solves a problem we don’t have (unlimited hot water) and creates two new problems: </p>



<p>1) <strong>Slightly longer delay in getting hot water</strong> at the taps, esp. remote taps.  This is annoying, but further it’s a waste of clean water.  On some small scale it increases your water cost because you’re just running it down the drain while you wait for warmer water.  </p>



<p>2) <strong>More prone to hot water “dips”</strong>.  If you’re in the shower and someone uses water elsewhere in the house, hot water disappears for a few seconds.  This is due to some sort of pressure regulation issue I suppose.  This behavior was part of life when I lived in dorms and cheap apartments, but I have no patience for it now.  According to plumbing pros this can be mitigated with additional tech but now you’re just spending more $$ to solve a previously nonexistent problem.</p>



<h2>Financial</h2>



<p>If the costs were comparable I might devote more energy to considering tankless, but a replacing a tank with tankless system will 2x or 3x your project cost around here.</p>



<p>Most of the people I talked to who had installed tankless were happy with it, but nobody could provide a solid financial argument.  The “cost savings over time” argument originates with tankless manufacturers and plumbing companies.  </p>



<p>After purchase, the operating costs of a tankless system are a bit less per year.  In my view, these savings are nominal and it would take 15+ years to make up the difference in the purchase price, assuming no additional maintenance is needed.  How long do you think a tankless system will last, without fiddling?</p>



<p>Everyone who was happy with their tankess system either repeated the “pays for itself” line without any kind of cost-per-year numbers, or admitted that they didn’t really worry about the costs involved. Some people like the idea of a tankless system, or enjoy having new and innovative technology in their homes. This is fine, too.</p>



<p>Our reputable brand 50-gallon tank was installed by a trustworthy company for $1,173.  As of this writing, we have 8 months of pandemic-at-home heavy use by our family of four.  No problems, and no regrets.    <br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-9898">

<div>
<blockquote><p><em>Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life — think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success…</em></p>
<p><cite></cite><cite><em>CW: Vol.1, Raja-Yoga, Pratyahara &amp; Dharana</em><br>
</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>In this quote, Swami Vivekananda tells us that the way to success is total immersion in a single idea – leaving all other ideas alone.</p>
<p>Why does he tell us this? How does immersion in a single idea lead us to success? In this note, we attempt to find answers to these questions.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, ideas are usually construed as mental representational images of some object. Ideas can also be abstract concepts that do not present as mental images. Ideas can also represent some methods or approaches (leading to innovations) or some formulations of thought (leading to some new arguments or theories).</p>
<p>If one were to abstract from these numerous definitions of ‘idea’, one could legitimately describe an idea as a well-defined “space of thought”.</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda says that the way to success is to plunge into a ‘space of thought’ – either a theory or frame, an innovation, a concept, or object – often connected with a mental representation – either clear or vague, in our minds.</p>

<p><em>What happens when we plunge in (dive deep) into a space of thought?</em></p>
<p>We encounter a hierarchy of consequences that we can describe in the following diagram:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://srinivasv.com/lionsroar/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/plungingintothought.png" alt="" width="700" height="472" srcset="https://srinivasv.com/lionsroar/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/plungingintothought.png 700w, https://srinivasv.com/lionsroar/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/plungingintothought-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></p>
<p><em><strong>Stage 1: Appreciation</strong></em><br>
<em>The first consequence we encounter when we plunge into an idea is that we begin to appreciate or discover the idea.</em> The more we think about the idea, the more we see the linkages of that idea to the world at large – we discover its potential value, and encounter its many possibilities of manifestation. We also discover the potential for economic, social, and other forms of value in the world.</p>
<p>Thus, we build conviction that the idea is valuable, and is worth pursuing in our lives.</p>
<p>We also see the value of the idea to ourselves personally. We begin to discover potential pathways to make that idea a reality. And we begin to see that the idea has the power to significantly impact our own and other people’s lives.</p>

<p><em><strong>Stage 2: Engagement</strong></em><br>
This conviction awakens in us the energy, the passion, to go deeper into the space of thought. Now the goal is not to discover the value and possibilities associated with the idea but to formulate a more vivid mental representation – a vision of what we are seeking.</p>
<p>This process or journey of visioning is joyful and creative. It may be an individual, personal process of visioning. It may also be a collective, co-created process of visioning. It may also be a process where we may want to test out and formulate various components of the vision and let the overall vision form itself as a result.</p>
<p>This visioning is not just a cognitive process, but a process involving energy, thought, the struggle with our own and others’ mental barriers, accompanied by sparks of discovery, innovation, and understanding.</p>
<p>It is thus, a process that is hardly smooth, but it is joyful, involving and creative.</p>
<p><em>As we engage deeply with the idea, what we get is not a mere representation or image of an idea, but a rigorous appreciation of what it means to live the idea. This difference is central to the whole process of ‘diving deep’ into an idea.</em></p>
<p>At this stage, the idea has moved from being an impersonal thought or concept, however valuable, to becoming a proposition to us, personally, on how to live or do things differently from how we act today.</p>

<p><em><strong>Stage 3: Practice</strong></em><br>
This personalization or individualization of the idea is what draws out of me, “commitment” and the “will to succeed”.</p>
<p>It is this ‘will to succeed’ that powers us and helps transform the ‘vision’ that we have, into real world products and accomplishments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <em>this ‘will to succeed’ is accompanied by the practice of all that it takes to realize the vision.</em></p>
<p>This integrated, and yet one pointed practice, leads to the development of all the necessary capabilities and components of success.</p>
<p>We become ‘success worthy’.</p>
<p>At this stage, as individual components of the overall vision or story come into being, we become ready to encounter the next stage – a larger synthesis.</p>

<p><em><strong>Stage 4: Realization</strong></em><br>
As the successes build up, as the components or elements of the overall idea start taking shape and are (i) accepted by oneself as consistent with the vision; and (ii) accepted by the world as valuable; our attention moves to an overall synthesis – as we test the totality of what we have accomplished with the totality of the idea that we have immersed ourselves in.</p>
<p><em>By this time, the idea as an objective entity may be mere words that we express, but the idea as a subjective entity has led to a total transformation of ourselves.</em></p>
<p>We see that the idea is no longer a mere vision but has transformed into a ‘living ideal’ – a mode of living.</p>
<p>We are one with the idea subjectively, and we are close to building the objective manifestation of the idea in the real world.</p>
<p>Our very words carry the living conviction that the idea is real leading to an intuitive recognition in the world that we embody the idea in ourselves, and that we are living/ playing out the possibilities and the value creation – both for ourselves and the world – inherent in the idea.</p>
<p>We have realized the idea. Realized its value. And realized its many possibilities.</p>
<p>Success is the product/ side-effect of the realization of this idea in our lives.</p>

    </span></p><p>Can marketing be ethical? Or is marketing nothing but a sharp-elbowed race for business growth?</p><p>I truly think it can be. In moral terms, healthy commercial competition needn’t mean a race to the bottom. And I find it sad that I should even have to say that. But I do.</p><p>So I’ve written a manifesto for ethical marketing practices. It started as something I wrote purely for my own benefit, to keep myself honest. But now I’m thinking – why not share it with the world? It’s the kind of manifesto I would have liked to read at the start of my career, and if others find it useful, then great.</p><p>I’m keen to point out that it’s not one of <a href="https://www.kimmok.com/the-manifesto-manifesto" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">those manifestos</a>. What I mean is, it’s not style over substance. It’s very much about the substance and values behind today’s marketing practices, and how we can do things better.</p><h3 id="why-do-we-glorify-growth-hacks">Why Do We Glorify Growth Hacks?</h3><p>It’s not so much that growth hacks are a problem per se. There’s nothing wrong with spotting new opportunities that make good use of data or customer behaviour and add a bit of technology to get the best possible outcome.  </p><p>But bad practices lurk in the most honourable of professions, and there’s a world of difference between a legal and ethical growth hack and scraping third-party websites for user data, or otherwise breaking the terms and conditions of those sites to exploit users and strip away their privacy. <a href="https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies/airbnb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Airbnb: The Growth Story You Didn’t Know</a> is a case in point here.</p><p>It saddens me to read articles that trumpet the growth of Uber, despite dubious tactics like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/technology/travis-kalanick-pushes-uber-and-himself-to-the-precipice.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">identifying and tagging iPhones even after the owner has deleted the Uber app app and erased the device</a>. Or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">deceiving authorities and blocking officials from the Uber service</a>.</p><p>It’s not just Uber. Marketers continued to praise Facebook’s growth even after revelations that the social media giant used tools like Onavo to pay kids as young as 13 to give them root access to their devices. And then made gross intrusions into their privacy by opening up personal messages, photos, videos, emails, and even Amazon order history, while publicly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onavo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">posing as a privacy-focused app</a>.</p><h3 id="marketing-and-the-social-dilemma">Marketing and The Social Dilemma</h3><p>I watched <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81254224" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Social Dilemma</a>, a fantastic documentary that should be mandatory viewing in schools. And it made me feel genuinely embarrassed for my profession.</p><p>In the film, we see a bunch of people who’ve made a killing by moving around from one unethical corporation to another. Then in the documentary we see their profound discomfort with the damage their features inflict on people who use them.</p><p>We all know about the negative consequences of the Instagram society – living for likes, and worse besides. My problem is, again, that we glorify these tricks because in marketing, growth is gold. The Social Dilemma unpeels the attention economy and reveals the rotten core that is ‘growth at all costs’ thinking. It shows the wilful ignorance at play here, with powerful people actively avoiding information that exposes uncomfortable truths.</p><p>None of these people are evil. But that’s precisely what is so dangerous, because they are actively contributing to a society-wide problem. As Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce once said, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-cigarettes-marc-benioff-salesforce-a9265756.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Facebook “is the new cigarettes for our society”</a>. Some think it made them look cool, but in 20 years it will look quite different. We stand to be judged by future generations.</p><h3 id="dark-patterns-and-sludges">Dark Patterns and Sludges</h3><p>I am deeply concerned about the proliferation of two disturbing trends in user interface design that are actively promoted as growth hacks by marketers:</p><ul><li><strong>Dark patterns:</strong> Features that coerce, steer or deceive users into unintended and potentially harmful actions</li><li><strong>Sludges:</strong> Processes that are made deliberately difficult to encourage users into a pathway that will go against their best interests.</li></ul><p>What is even more dubious than these dark patterns and sludges? Stand up Nir Eyal, and others like him, who, having played a big part in creating the problem, go on to make even more money by selling the solution. Eyal wrote Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products to teach founders how to build addictive products. He followed it up with Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life, which teaches consumers how to avoid the addictive design of the products he himself helped to shape.</p><h3 id="the-ethics-of-marketing-agencies">The Ethics of Marketing Agencies</h3><p>No, I’m not about to argue that marketing agencies are evil. But I do think their business model is flawed, and this can have unethical consequences. I’ve worked with agencies both as an employee and a client, and there are a number of reasons why I’ve resisted setting up my own traditional agency:</p><ul><li>The agent/principal problem – Most agencies sell time, and their business model only works if they take a cookie-cutter approach. The more copy and pasting they do, the better their returns. It is simply inefficient to be creative and do a ton of original research for every new client.</li><li>No skin in the game – Nassim Taleb explains this brilliantly in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Skin-Game-Hidden-Asymmetries-Daily/dp/0241247470" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Skin in the Game</a> but basically, regardless of the outcome of any project, an agency simply collects the fees and risks nothing. Famously, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/04/23/hertz_accenture_lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hertz had to sue Accenture</a> to recover $32m they paid for a website rebuild which was allegedly incomplete and poor quality. Accenture offered to fix the shortcomings for an extra $10m.</li><li>You might be a world-class marketer, but if you set up an agency and hire people, much of your day-to-day work will shift from marketing to running a business.</li><li>Agencies routinely assign high-skilled marketers to create a pitch, or play a prominent role in the early stages, only to pass the real work down to junior staff or even outsource it. If you’re lucky, you’ll get to see that talented individual again – when your contract comes up for renewal.</li></ul><p>If we widen our lens on the agency, we see that most clients are surprisingly okay with all that. And that’s because for them, hiring an agency is not about the deliverables; it’s about validation and even covering their own backside.</p><p>Here’s what I mean. When one of the Big Four is hired to tackle a complex issue, they are not hired primarily for their skills or capacity to solve that problem. It’s more that in the event of their failure to solve it, the CEO will be able to stand up to the Board and say: “Well, the problem turned out to be so difficult that even the Big Four were stumped.” In other words, the agency relationship is more about blame reduction than business outcomes.</p><p>Do all agencies suffer from these problems? Of course not. In fact, I’m currently working with an amazing agency that is truly ethical and, as far as I can see, always does the right thing for the client, even that eats into their profit margin. But it’s important to be aware of these issues and mitigate the risks.</p><p>Here are some Ethical Marketing Principles I stand by:</p><h4 id="dont-use-dark-patterns">Don’t use dark patterns</h4><p>This one’s pretty self-explanatory. Don’t use any deceptive tactics to trick your users into doing things they don’t want to.</p><h4 id="dont-fall-for-the-texas-sharpshooter-fallacy">Don’t fall for the Texas sharpshooter fallacy</h4><p>Good marketing involves experimentation. When you run an experiment, it will sometimes deliver positive outcomes that were unintended and outside scope. Don’t try to spin them into some sort of tactic you planned all along. Some things just happen for no particular reason.</p><h4 id="dont-fall-for-action-bias">Don’t fall for action bias</h4><p>Don’t fall for the illusion that doing something is always better than doing nothing.</p><h4 id="be-transparent">Be transparent</h4><p>Things can and do go wrong. The minute you notice something wrong on a joint problem, ‘fess up! Then give your full attention to solving the problem.</p><h4 id="be-direct">Be direct</h4><p>Being direct (though not to the point of rudeness) with people you work with is a sign of respect. It means you’re a responsible adult and you’re treating others as such. Focus on delivering the true message and not on repackaging it.</p><h4 id="use-ethically-sourced-data">Use ethically-sourced data</h4><p>Only use consumer data that the user willingly shared or that was captured with full consent in place. For Account-Based Marketing (ABM) campaigns the data can come from third parties, but it will always be data that the consumer shared knowingly.</p><h4 id="protect-your-users-privacy">Protect your users’ privacy</h4><p>Only capture and use data that it is absolutely necessary and wherever possible, avoid Personal Identifiable Information (PII).</p><h4 id="avoid-confirmation-bias">Avoid confirmation bias</h4><p>Don’t actively seek out and assign more weight to evidence that confirms your own hypothesis.</p><h4 id="be-sustainable">Be sustainable</h4><p>Don’t promote products or services that encourage wasteful or unhealthy behaviour.</p><h4 id="work-with-companies-that-add-value-to-society">Work with companies that add value to society</h4><p>Your organisation, its products and services should not exploit anyone. Instead, they should have a positive impact on other people and the world around you.</p><h4 id="dont-lie-with-statistics">Don’t lie with statistics</h4><p>Always present your findings in the most transparent manner. Don’t use flawed correlations, or cherry-pick data that suits your own interests. Share all your results regardless of the outcome; it’s scary how many studies end up unpublished when the results don’t favour the researcher.</p><h4 id="be-open-minded-and-dont-fall-for-reactive-devaluation">Be open-minded and don’t fall for reactive devaluation</h4><p>Evaluate all options and opinions available. Don’t rush to dismiss certain opinions just because they come from a source that you habitually disagree with.</p><h4 id="identify-and-point-out-sunk-cost-fallacies">Identify and point out sunk cost fallacies</h4><p>It’s not uncommon to see projects continuing simply because of the vast amount of money already spent on them, even though the outcomes won’t be those expected. Point out the problem when that happens and work constructively to save the project.</p><h4 id="dont-fall-for-information-bias">Don’t fall for information bias</h4><p>Sometimes you find teams searching for additional information even when it’s not going to affect the decision. Find ways to make the best decisions with the minimum amount of information.</p><h4 id="dont-be-seduced-by-groupthink">Don’t be seduced by groupthink</h4><p>If you truly believe something, then be prepared to stand by for your ideas and push back even if the majority disagrees</p><h4 id="dont-overlook-governance">Don’t overlook governance</h4><p>Work within governance mechanisms, and follow established processes where possible. Where no process is in place, create one.</p><h4 id="be-good">Be good</h4><p>Google famously had a ‘Don’t be …</p></div></div></div>

    <p>I know a number of folks use <strong>The Great Suspender</strong> to automatically suspend
inactive browser tabs in Chrome. Apparently recent versions of this extension
have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KyleTaylor/comments/jowlt2/open_source_development_the_great_suspender_saga/">taken over by a shady anonymous entity</a> and is now
<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/great-suspender-extension-now-flagged-malware-edge-has-built-replacement">flagged by Microsoft as malware</a>. Notably the most recent
version of the extension (v7.1.8) has added integrated analytics that can
track all of your browsing activity across all sites. Yikes.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations for users of The Great Suspender (7.1.8):</strong></p>

<h3>Temporary easy fix</h3>

<ul>
<li>Disable analytics tracking by opening the extension options for
The Great Suspender and checking the box
“Automatic deactivation of any kind of tracking”.</li>
<li>Pray that the shady developer doesn’t issue a malicious update to The Great Suspender later.
(There’s no sensible way to disable updates of an individual extension.)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Permanent harder fix <small>(👈 <strong>Recommended!</strong>)</small></h3>

<ul>
<li>Close as many unneeded tabs as you can.</li>
<li>Unsuspend all remaining tabs. ⏳</li>
<li>Uninstall The Great Suspender.</li>
<li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender/releases/tag/v7.1.6">latest good version</a> of The Great Suspender (7.1.6) from GitHub,
and move it to some permanent location outside your Downloads folder.
(It should be commit 9730c09.)</li>
<li>Load your downloaded copy as <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-you-can-still-download-chrome-extensions-without-us-1826796797">an unpacked extension</a>.
(This copy will not auto-update to future untrusted versions of the extension.)</li>
<li>All done! 🎉</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> My understanding is that installing an unpacked extension in this way
will cause Chrome to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25847171">issue a new kind of security prompt</a> every time it is
launched, which you’ll have to ignore. 😕</p>

<h3>Other options</h3>

<p>Other browser extensions for suspending tabs exist, as mentioned in the
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25846504">Hacker New discussion</a> for this article. However I have not conducted my own
security review on any of those other extensions, so buyer beware.</p>

      <article role="main">
        <p>In October, the popular and famous archivist tool <a href="https://youtube-dl.org/">youtube-dl</a> was taken down by GitHub due to a DMCA request by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America#Criticism">Recording Industry Association of America</a>. I posted a <a href="https://assassinate-you.net/posts/2020/10/youtube-dl-takedown/">detailed analysis</a> explaining the relation between international, US, EU and German law, and showing why this request was very different from what most people know as the “classic” DMCA takedown request. I felt this was necessary since there were a lot of rumor and wrong claims out on the Internet (not just in forums or on the (anti)social media, but also on media offerings), which did not help the discussion at all. The repository is back now, thanks to the EFF and its team. They <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/github-reinstates-youtube-dl-after-riaas-abuse-dmca">filed a counter-notice</a> on behalf of the youtube-dl maintainers, which allowed GitHub to reinstantiate the repository.</p>
<h2 id="eff-helps-out-by-writing-a-counter-notice">EFF helps out by writing a counter notice</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, a non-governmental organization based in the U.S. dedicated to defending civil liberties and especially digital rights, helped out the youtube-dl maintainers by filing a very informative <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2020/11/17/eff_letter_to_github_re_youtube-dl_11152020.pdf">counter notice</a> with GitHub. This notice explained why the request itself is an abuse of the DMCA and the takedown was not justified at all. It allowed GitHub to reinstantiate the repository and, more importantly, all the metadata (for example, issues and pull requests) that was posted on the platform by users, developers and maintainers. Such information is invaluable to a project, and a takedown of the <em>entire</em> repository with all this data can hurt a project very badly.</p>
<p>The takedown was widely regarded as abuse of the DMCA by the RIAA, given that the youtube-dl code repository did not contain any infringing material. The argumentation was made up by claiming that the primary purpose was to infringe copyright of some songs whose artists are apparently represented by the RIAA. They cited some automated unit tests for this, which do not download the entire songs, and would not be seen or executed by regular users. The EFF argues that these are likely a form of “fair use” and thus allowed legally.</p>
<p>The request also cited an obscure German court decision which considered YouTube’s “rolling cipher” an “effective technological measure”, whose bypassing would be prohibited by copyright laws around the world. The EFF explains that the decision was “wrongly decided and is not binding nor even persuasive under U.S. law”.</p>
<p>The EFF further questions the effectivity of the algorithm in general, given that YouTube delivers the code for decryption in a readable form (and also, the code can be executed outside browsers, too). On top of that, the streams are freely accessible once you have the URLs. YouTube only hides the URLs, but not in an effective way. Therefore, this algorithm cannot be considered a “technological measure”, and thus, the RIAA request is baseless.</p>
<p>In the context of this debate, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeCSS">DeCSS controversy</a> was mentioned a lot, as there’s been some similarities with how copyright holders reacted to the existence of software to bypass their (arguably not very secure) CSS protection. Their first actions focused on software hosting sites, pressurizing them to take down the software by threatening them with legal steps. This led to a mirroring campaign, due to what we call the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand effect</a> nowadays.
There’s been some litigation in the early 2000s, where judges ruled in favor of the copyright holders.
However, this has little relevance to the case of youtube-dl, as the EFF explains. Reverse-engineering YouTube’s code doesn’t enable users to save copies of the material, they already can do so in many other ways. Also, youtube-dl doesn’t bypass DRM technologies like Google’s Widevine. Also, there’s many resources under free licenses on the video platform, which users are explicitly allowed to download and share. And in the U.S., the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress">Library of Congress</a> may even <a href="https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2018/10/new-exemptions-dmca-section-1201-are-welcome-dont-go-far-enough">issue exemptions of Section 1201</a> of the DMCA, under which bypassing anti-circumvention is fine legally.</p>
<p>EFF’s notice summarizes the situation as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, youtube-dl does not violate either the Copyright Act or the DMCA. EFF  and  the  youtube-dl  maintainers  thank  GitHub  for  standing  up  for  the  rights  of developers whose projects it hosts. We hope this explanation will allow you to restore the youtube-dl repository so that GitHub can continue to be the home for development of this popular and important tool.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2020/11/17/eff_letter_to_github_re_youtube-dl_11152020.pdf">EFF letter to GitHub on youtube-dl takedown</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, EFF! You did not just helped a tool that is crucial to journalists, activists, lawyers and so many other people. You also destroyed the RIAA’s wrong claims, which will hopefully prevent similar attacks on other tools in the future.</p>
<h2 id="githubs-reactions">GitHub’s reactions</h2>
<p>Regarding GitHub, it is sad that they took down the repository at all. It’s a well-known pattern: platforms rather comply with such requests than risking litigation, requiring projects to invest time and money to fund lawyers themselves (or hope for an association such as the EFF to pick up their case). The moment they published the request and took down the repositories, many experts immediately raised concerns that the request itself is illegal. It remains questionable why GitHub’s legal team didn’t recognize this. They likely were not prepared well enough for such a situation. GitHub did not stand up for the community that made them the most popular hosting platform for software in the world.</p>
<p>Nat Friedman, CEO of GitHub, later apparently reached out to the youtube-dl team personally, expressing his sympathy, and offering some support. However, the damage was already done then. The team lost its primary communication channel to their users and each other, as well as the entire history.</p>
<p>It seems more likely that their PR department recognized they are criticised heavily for taking down the project in the first place, putting their (actually pretty good) relation to the open-source community at risk, and thus creating a serious threat to their business.</p>
<p>At least this case prompted them to rethink their strategy on future lawsuits. They posted a <a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">blog article</a>, excusing their takedown with compliance, as expected. They promised changes for the benefit of projects threatened by similar requests in the future at least, such as donating to a “developer defense fund” dedicated to helping out projects threatened by such anti-circumvention takedown requests.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they recognized that there is a strong need for maintainers to access the issues and pull requests. They promised to ensure that developers can export those after a takedown (even if requests are valid). The real question however is why they wouldn’t just keep showing them, and just hide the code repository. Introducing such an option globally for every repository would be an even bigger improvement, allowing developers to always create backups of those data.</p>
<p>As GitHub state themselves, among all DMCA takedown requests, these circumvention ones are quite rare. We will have to see whether it is going to have a lot of effect. It would be better if they just donated money to defend developers of projects for which they receive <em>any</em> kind of unwarranted takedown request, rather than limiting it to this edge case.</p>
<p>By the way: in the end, it’s up to the people to request better copyright laws from the politics. They tend to get worse, not better. Make sure your voice is heard. Call your representatives (that’s better than sending a mail, as a phone call can hardly be ignored). Go on the streets and protest against changes and for improvements <em>for you as a user</em>. Support campaigns of civil rights organizations trying to change the laws.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>
<p>Maintainers who host their projects on large proprietary platforms like GitHub or GitLab’s cloud offering should always have a strategy for such situations. They should set up mirrors of the code proactively. Backing up metadata is significantly harder (especially if platforms don’t provide import/export tools, which most of the big ones do not). Some people use the project import features in tools like <a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a>, but as those are one-off features, one would have to repeat the process every now and then. For the issues, there is an experimental tool called <a href="https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug">git-bug</a>, which allows offline backups and migrations, and comes with bridges to import and export to a variety of tools (and is <a href="https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug#help-needed">looking for contributors</a> to add new bridges and extend the functionality).</p>
<p>It looks like the free software community should prepare themselves better in the future. We should develop better tools to back up our metadata, also allowing us to move between platforms more easily.
If GitHub wants to remain the most popular hosting platform, they should consider adding such functionality out of the box (ideally in a standardized format). Offering such functionality doesn’t mean that projects would just leave for other platforms automatically. It would rather show that GitHub is really committed to the idea of open-source software, whose development can take place everywhere. After all, we are the ones who helped GitHub become the number one platform for software development in the world.</p>
<p>There is one thing that has been and is always going to be counterproductive, especially in such situations: blind actionism. Many people flooded the Internet (read: forums, Reddit, bug trackers of projects), inciting panic and suggesting to move to some other “free” hosted platform. This is clearly not a solution. Any hosting platform will sooner or later have to comply with such a request. It can become very expensive if you end up in court. The true solution, as we have seen in this situation, is to stay calm, analyze the situation, assess the threat to your own project and remove code and text that could be abused to justify such a request (e.g., if you are developing a similar project and also use such songs in a unit test, you can change your test to content under free licenses). Moving to another platform does not solve the root issue, and …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

      <article role="main">
        <p>On Oct 23, 2020, GitHub Inc. published a <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/commit/bccf7d0dbfec423c4a967f668be47b6339d15893">takedown notice</a> after taking down <a href="https://yt-dl.org/">youtube-dl</a>’s main repository as well as a number of its forks.</p>
<p>youtube-dl is a Python library which can be used to decode stream URLs of a large variety of services. This allows third-party video players to stream videos, legitimately download copies and much more. It has been used as the basis for many other applications, but also ships with a CLI front end targeting advanced users.</p>
<p>The takedown request is justified with so-called <em>anti-circumvention</em> laws, as well as a German court decision. There are plenty of rumors on the Internet around this case, but a lot of them are apparently wrong. Therefore, in this blog post, we’ll have a glance at the request as well as the German laws and the court decision. We also discuss several third-party responses.</p>
<p>There is one important fact that needs to be stressed: <strong>This text was not written by lawyers and does not provide any legal advice.</strong> It simply provides a third-party analysis of the situation.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-anti-circumvention-laws">What are anti-circumvention laws?</h2>
<p>To understand what “anti-circumvention” means and why such laws are implemented around the globe, we need to look into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIPO_Copyright_Treaty"><em>WIPO Copyright Treaty</em></a> of 1996. Its terms were implemented in laws in the countries which ratified it. For instance, in the US, the terms are codified via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act">DMCA</a>. In the EU, multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_(European_Union)">directives</a> were passed, which subsequently were implemented in national law by the participating countries, the most relevant being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Society_Directive#Technological_protection_measures">Information Society Directive</a> of 2001.</p>
<p>The treaty aimed to create a global framework around copyright as a consequence of the rise of information technology. It is one of the so-called “internet treaties”, a nickname also assigned to the <em>WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty</em>.</p>
<p>In this context, <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/WIPO_Copyright_Treaty#Article_11._Obligations_concerning_Technological_Measures">Article 11</a> is the most interesting one. It forbids the circumvention of “effective technological measures” designed to restrict access to works. This is what is commonly referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-circumvention">“anti-circumvention”</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contracting Parties shall provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures that are used by authors in connection with the exercise of their rights under this Treaty or the Berne Convention and that restrict acts, in respect of their works, which are not authorized by the authors concerned or permitted by law.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/WIPO_Copyright_Treaty#Article_11._Obligations_concerning_Technological_Measure">WIPO Copyright Treaty, Article 11</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concrete national implementations of such anti-circumvention laws are (non-exhaustively):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201-">Title 17 U.S. Code, Section 1201(a)(1)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/urhg/__95a.html">§ 95a UrhG</a> (Germany, <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_urhg/englisch_urhg.html#p0723">English translation</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In nearly any jurisdiction, you can assume that it is likely not legal to produce, e.g., algorithms which circumvent any kind of protective measure which is supposed to restrict access to copyrighted materials. This is showcased in the U.S. law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof, that—</p>
<ul>
<li>(A) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title;</li>
<li>(B) has only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title; or</li>
<li>(C) is marketed by that person or another acting in concert with that person with that person’s knowledge for use in circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title.</li>
</ul>
<p>– <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201">17 U.S.C. Section 1201(a)(2)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="effective-technological-measures">“Effective technological measures”</h2>
<p>The rules are pretty strict. Even just creating a tool circumventing such measures is apparently prohibited. But what on earth is an “effective technological measure”? To answer that question, we need to read a bit further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(3) As used in this subsection–</p>
<ul>
<li>(A) to “circumvent a technological measure” means to descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without the authority of the copyright owner; and</li>
<li>(B) a technological measure “effectively controls access to a work” if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, requires the application of information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of the copyright owner, to gain access to the work.</li>
</ul>
<p>– <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201">17 U.S.C. Section 1201(a)(3)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Established methods which are typically considered “circumvention” include tools which bypass software licensing (keygens, reverse-engineered passwords or serial numbers, tools which deactivate digital rights management (DRM), etc.).</p>
<p>The legally-inclined programmer could be tempted to interpret these words in a strict technological manner. But it is inadvisable to do so. If you want to know whether what you do (or your code does) is legal, consider consulting an actual lawyer. They’re the experts. They studied for many years to be able to provide you, the layman, with a competent answer.</p>
<p>Anyway, ultimately, it is the courts which are going to interpret the laws and decide whether a specific method qualifies as such a measure under that definition.</p>
<h2 id="german-court-judgement">German court judgement</h2>
<p>The complaint filed with GitHub specifically cited a <a href="http://www.landesrecht-hamburg.de/jportal/portal/page/bsharprod.psml?showdoccase=1&amp;doc.id=JURE180006255&amp;st=ent">decision made by a German court</a>, <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landgericht_Hamburg">Landgericht Hamburg</a> (LG Hamburg). The judgement was made in a case filed by an association representing artists in Germany against a web portal that allowed users to download MP3 files converted from videos on YouTube. The association obtained a restraining order against the company operating the service, whose owners had apparently signed multiple declarations to cease and desist from providing this service for specific music videos before, but continued to operate the service in general.</p>
<p>The complaint this time didn’t focus on concrete violations of the German Urheberrecht (UrhG) (Germany doesn’t have “copyright” like, e.g., the U.S., but “authors' rights” instead). It argued that operating such a service would bypass such “effective technological measures” implemented by YouTube, and this is supposedly not allowed per § 95a UrhG.</p>
<p>YouTube does not provide direct access to the streams. It provides the URLs in some obfuscated (encoded) form, which the JavaScript code in their web front end is capable of decoding. The URLs themselves are freely accessible once decoded – no sessions, cookies or logins required. The “protective technological measure”, if you want to call it that, is this obfuscation.</p>
<p>Naturally, it’s not difficult to reverse engineer this obfuscation. Actually, it is rather easy, as the code executed in the browser is directly readable to programmers. They can inspect the behavior easily. Once you understand how the decoding works, you’re able to implement it in other programming languages as well.</p>
<p>The court, however, considered the obfuscation a “technological measure”. It indicated that this is partially due to the fact that YouTube apparently intends users to use their own web client, and doesn’t provide the stream URLs freely. Thus, it decided that the service violated the anti-circumvention laws.</p>
<p>So, even though you may be allowed to <em>create a copy</em> of the material (for example when the work is licensed under a Creative Commons license, used in compliance with “fair use” rules, or the user is in a country like Germany where they can create a legal <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatkopie">“Privatkopie”</a>), downloading the original streams might not be legal. The anti-circumvention laws don’t take into account whether creating a copy would be legal. They criminalize the entire method.</p>
<h2 id="analyzing-the-complaint-sent-to-github">Analyzing the complaint sent to GitHub</h2>
<p>The complaint sent to GitHub is not a typical DMCA takedown request. Usually, those cite a specific violation, e.g., an unauthorized copy of copyrighted material. Here, however, the complaint targets a tool which <em>could</em> be used to commit violations by downloading protected works. They claim that the tool’s “clear purpose” was, on the one hand, to circumvent technological measures, and, on the other hand, to allow for copyright violations subsequently.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, the complaint cites three (potential) copyright violations in software tests, which actually download some media of artists the plaintiff appears to represent. These might be considered a “Privatkopie” in other jurisdictions, but both the plaintiff and GitHub are located in the US, so they probably focus on their national legislation, where they might be considered “fair use”.</p>
<p>One thing that remains unclear is whether GitHub would be required to take down such a project immediately upon such a notification. Most companies usually comply with the request to make sure they won’t run into issues themselves, then consult their own lawyers and assess whether it’s lawful.</p>
<p>What is certainly annoying is that neither the RIAA nor GitHub allowed youtube-dl to consult lawyers themselves, nor gave them the chance to remove the offending code (even if just temporarily). They deactivated the entire repository, so that not even the issues (which are valuable information, and are rather unlikely to offend anti-circumvention laws) are accessible anymore. But chances are that they did so in line with their terms of service. It wouldn’t be unusual to have a clause that allows them to disable a project entirely and not just selectively.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there is one interesting detail that should be highlighted: the parties in this complaint are the hosting service, GitHub, and the association representing the artists. YouTube apparently is not a participant in this case. This makes sense if you recall the wording of the laws mentioned before, but is indeed a bit awkward when you think about it.</p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>Many people on the Internet flooded forums like Reddit and Hacker News, as well as bug trackers and the (anti)social media with inaccurate statements, suggesting that the main issue here is that the tests cited use URLs of …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

    <h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>CoBox aims to encourage small- and medium-scale infrastructure as a service. This means non-technical people can plug in a small computer in their home and begin providing back-up services for their friends, neighbours and themselves.</p>
<p><a href="https://cobox.cloud/how-it-works/cobox-demo_v1.0.0.mp4">watch our demo</a></p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>The cloud we have become used to looks nothing like the many scattered fluffy light weight balls of water vapor floating in the Earth’s troposphere. Corporate cloud architectures are much more akin to a giant storm cloud, ever expanding, sucking in more and more electrical energy from its surrounding environment, with a singular giant eye sitting at their center observing all that passes through.</p>
<figure><img alt="Illustrated logos of open source software" src="https://cobox.cloud/media/pages/how-it-works/19173948-1594064678/logos-all.png" width="400"></figure>
<p>CoBox wants to facilitate a transition away from giant data centers, huge storm clouds, towards a vision of cloud infrastructure that is light, distributed, and importantly, is offline-first. Our team is fed up of using proprietary software that surveilles our behaviour and transmutes the way we act online, the friends we make and the interactions we have - our data - into corporate financial gain. CoBox is the beginning of a sovereign commons-based data infrastructure and a co-operative distributed cloud architecture.</p>
<p>Our team has worked with privacy tools and encryption for many years. We’ve tried our best to avoid using corporate architecture, and we understand, its hard. Corporate tools can be high quality and accessible - they have the money to pay for beautiful and intuitive user interfaces and enough servers to maintain a high speed service. But by having no alternatives to corporate tools, corporations get to determine how we use them and shape our very behaviour. By continuously using their tools, we’re letting them shape and change how we think. And while they apparently provide these tools for ‘free’, they’re making a tidy profit monetising the way we act on their platforms.</p>
<p>We want to use software built and maintained by our peers, by people we trust, that centers both our personal sovereignty and a common recognition that assets and wealth should be shared, not concentrated. Our vision sees friends, freelancers, small businesses and co-operatives, providing mutual assistance for each other, guaranteeing remote backup of their data and ensuring that they need not rely on giant corporations or flimsy hard drives to secure their memories. That’s why we built CoBox.</p>
<h2>How?</h2>
<p>CoBox is an innovative suite of open hardware and software providing accessible governance tools for organisations and networks. </p>

<p>CoBox is built on <a href="https://dat.foundation/">Dat</a>. Dat is a modular peer-to-peer technology stack.  You can find a good explanation of how it works in the guide <a href="https://datprotocol.github.io/how-dat-works/">‘how Dat works’</a>, and you can find out how we’ve made use of Dat in <a href="https://gitlab.com/coboxcoop/readme/-/wikis/Core-Technologies">our wiki</a>. At CoBox, we’ve used Dat to build fully encrypted private spaces that synchronise seamlessly across multiple devices. This means you, your friends and colleagues no longer have to rely on corporate servers to store your files, you can hold onto them for each-other.</p>

<p>While playing with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/eventpipe">EventPipes</a>, I wanted to better understand the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/diagnostics/blob/master/documentation/design-docs/ipc-protocol.md">Diagnostic IPC Protocol</a>. This protocol is used to transfer diagnostic data between the .NET runtime and a diagnostic client, such as, for example, dotnet-trace. When a .NET process starts, the runtime creates the diagnostic endpoint. On Windows, the endpoint is a <strong>named pipe</strong>, and on Unix, it’s a <strong>Unix domain socket</strong> created in the temp files folder. The endpoint name begins with a ‘dotnet-diagnostic-’ string and then contains the process ID to make it unique. The name also includes a timestamp and a ‘-socket’ suffix on Unix. Valid example names are <strong>dotnet-diagnostic-2675</strong> on Windows and <strong>dotnet-diagnostic-2675-2489049-socket</strong> on Unix. When you type the ps subcommand in any of the CLI diagnostics tools (for example, <code>dotnet-counters ps</code>), the tool internally lists the endpoints matching the pattern I just described. So, essentially, the following commands are a good approximation to this logic:</p>


<pre title=""># Linux
$ ls /tmp/dotnet-diagnostic-*
/tmp/dotnet-diagnostic-213-11057-socket /tmp/dotnet-diagnostic-2675-2489049-socket
</pre>

<pre title=""># Windows
PS me&gt; [System.IO.Directory]::GetFiles("\\.\pipe\", "dotnet-diagnostic-*")
\\.\pipe\dotnet-diagnostic-9272
\\.\pipe\dotnet-diagnostic-13372
</pre>


<p>The code for the .NET process listing is in the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/diagnostics/blob/master/src/Tools/Common/Commands/ProcessStatus.cs">ProcessStatus.cs</a> file. After extracting the process ID from the endpoint name, the diagnostics tool creates a Process class instance to retrieve the process name for printing. Armed with this knowledge, let’s try to intercept the communication between the tracer and the tracee.</p>



<p>Neither named pipes nor Unix domain sockets provide an API to do that easily. I started looking for the interceptors for either the kernel or user mode. I found a few interesting projects (for example, <a href="https://github.com/kobykahane/NpEtw">NpEtw</a>), but I also discovered that configuring them would take me lots of time. I then stumbled upon a post using socat to proxy the Unix domain socket traffic. I wondered if I could write a proxy too.</p>



<h3>Writing an EventPipes sniffer</h3>



<p>The only problem was how to convince the .NET CLI tools to use my proxy. I did some tests, and on Linux, it’s enough to create a Unix domain socket with the same process ID but with the timestamp set to, for example, 1.</p>



<p>Let’s take as an example a .NET process with ID equal to 2675. Its diagnostic endpoint is represented by the /tmp/dotnet-diagnostic-2675-2489049-socket file. In my proxy, I am creating a Unix domain socket with a path /tmp/dotnet-diagnostic-2675-1-socket. The file system will list it first, and dotnet-trace (or any other tool) will pick it up as the endpoint for the process with ID 2675:</p>

<p>The code to create the proxy socket looks as follows:</p>


<pre title="">private static async Task StartProxyUnix(int pid, CancellationToken ct)
{
    var tmp = Path.GetTempPath();
    var snoopedEndpointPath = Directory.GetFiles(tmp, $"dotnet-diagnostic-{pid}-*-socket").First();
    var snoopingEndpointPath = Path.Combine(tmp, $"dotnet-diagnostic-{pid}-1-socket");

    File.Delete(snoopingEndpointPath);

    var endpoint = new UnixDomainSocketEndPoint(snoopingEndpointPath);
    using var listenSocket = new Socket(endpoint.AddressFamily, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Unspecified);
    listenSocket.Bind(endpoint);

    using var r = ct.Register(() =&gt; listenSocket.Close());

    try
    {
        var id = 1;
        while (!ct.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            listenSocket.Listen();

            if (ct.IsCancellationRequested)
            {
                return;
            }

            var socket = await listenSocket.AcceptAsync();
            Console.WriteLine($"[{id}]: s1 connected");

            // random remote socket
            var senderSocket = new Socket(AddressFamily.Unix, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Unspecified);
            await senderSocket.ConnectAsync(new UnixDomainSocketEndPoint(snoopedEndpointPath));
            Console.WriteLine($"[{id}]: s2 connected");

            _ = SniffData(new NetworkStream(socket, true), new NetworkStream(senderSocket, true), id, ct);
            id += 1;
        }
    }
    catch (SocketException)
    {
        /* cancelled listen */
        Console.WriteLine($"Stopped ({snoopingEndpointPath})");
    }
    finally
    {
        File.Delete(snoopingEndpointPath);
    }
}
</pre>


<p>On Windows, it’s more complicated as there is no timestamp in the name. Thus, I decided to create a fake diagnostics endpoint that will look like an endpoint for a regular .NET process but, in reality, will be a proxy. Remember that CLI tools also call the Process.GetProcessById method, so the PID in my endpoint name must point to a valid process accessible to the current user. The process must be native, so the diagnostic endpoint name is not already taken. I picked explorer.exe 😊, and to record EventPipes traffic, I will use explorer as the target process in .NET CLI tools, as on the image below:</p>

<p>And the code for creating my proxy named pipe looks as follows:</p>


<pre title="">private static async Task StartProxyWindows(int pid, CancellationToken ct)
{
    var targetPipeName = $"dotnet-diagnostic-{pid}";
    var explorer = Process.GetProcessesByName("explorer").First();
    var pipeName = $"dotnet-diagnostic-{explorer.Id}";
    try
    {
        var id = 1;
        while (!ct.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            var listener = new NamedPipeServerStream(pipeName, PipeDirection.InOut, 10, PipeTransmissionMode.Byte,
                                    PipeOptions.Asynchronous, 0, 0);
            await listener.WaitForConnectionAsync(ct);
            Console.WriteLine($"[{id}]: s1 connected");

            if (ct.IsCancellationRequested)
            {
                return;
            }
            var sender = new NamedPipeClientStream(".", targetPipeName, PipeDirection.InOut, PipeOptions.Asynchronous);
            await sender.ConnectAsync();
            Console.WriteLine($"[{id}]: s2 connected");

            _ = SniffData(listener, sender, id, ct);
            id += 1;
        }
    }
    catch (TaskCanceledException)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Stopped ({pipeName})");
    }
}
</pre>


<p>The fake diagnostic endpoint would work on Linux too, but the timestamp is less confusing. And we can always use our proxy to send some funny trace messages to our colleagues 🤐.</p>



<p>What’s left in our implementation is the forwarding code:</p>


<pre title="">static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
    if (args.Length != 1 || !int.TryParse(args[0], out var pid))
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Usage: epsnoop &lt;pid&gt;");
        return;
    }

    using var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();

    Console.CancelKeyPress += (o, ev) =&gt; { ev.Cancel = true; cts.Cancel(); };

    if (RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(OSPlatform.Windows))
    {
        await StartProxyWindows(pid, cts.Token);
    }
    else
    {
        await StartProxyUnix(pid, cts.Token);
    }
}

private static async Task SniffData(Stream s1, Stream s2, int id, CancellationToken ct)
{
    var outstream = File.Create($"eventpipes.{id}.data");
    try
    {
        using var cts = CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource(ct);
        var tasks = new List&lt;Task&gt;() {
            Forward(s1, s2, outstream, $"{id}: s1 -&gt; s2", cts.Token),
            Forward(s2, s1, outstream, $"{id}: s2 -&gt; s1", cts.Token)
        };

        var t = await Task.WhenAny(tasks);

        var ind = tasks.IndexOf(t);
        Console.WriteLine($"[{id}]: s{ind + 1} disconnected");
        tasks.RemoveAt(ind);

        cts.Cancel();

        await Task.WhenAny(tasks);
        Console.WriteLine($"[{id}]: s{1 - ind + 1} disconnected");
    }
    catch (TaskCanceledException) { }
    finally
    {
        outstream.Close();
        s1.Dispose();
        s2.Dispose();
    }
}

private static async Task Forward(Stream sin, Stream sout, Stream snoop, string id, CancellationToken ct)
{
    var buffer = new byte[1024];
    while (true)
    {
        var read = await sin.ReadAsync(buffer, 0, buffer.Length, ct);
        if (read == 0)
        {
            break;
        }
        Console.WriteLine($"[{id}] read: {read}");
        snoop.Write(buffer, 0, read);
        await sout.WriteAsync(buffer, 0, read, ct);
    }
}
</pre>


<p>I’m saving the recorded traffic to the eventpipes.{stream-id}.data file in the current directory. The code of the application is also in the <a href="https://github.com/lowleveldesign/diagnostics-tools/tree/master/epsnoop">epsnoop</a> folder in my <a href="https://github.com/lowleveldesign/diagnostics-tools">diagnostics-tools</a> repository.</p>



<h3>Analyzing the EventPipes traffic</h3>



<p>I also started working on the <a href="https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/">010 Editor</a> template. At the moment, it only understands IPC messages, but, later, I would like to add parsers for some of the diagnostic sequences as well (feel free to create a PR if you work on them too!). The template is in the <a href="https://github.com/lowleveldesign/debug-recipes/blob/master/eventpipes/diagnostics-ipc-message.bt">debug-recipes</a> repository, and on a screenshot below, you can see the initial bytes sent by the <code>dotnet-counters monitor</code> command:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust has taken the programming language world by storm. Since its 1.0 release in 2015, it has been one of the most loved programming languages with a loyal following of developers and contributors.</p><p>To learn why this language is favored so much between developers, we have started a new series on Rust in production. In it, we’ll interview people that have used Rust for significant projects: apps, services, startup MVPs, and others.</p><p>For the first installment of the series, we interview Michael Fey, VP of Engineering at <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>. Read further to find out why they chose Rust for their product, the benefits of Rust for security-centered applications, and what cool libraries you should look into if you’re developing something similar in Rust.</p><h3 id="could-you-tell-us-a-little-about-your-company-and-your-role-there%3F">Could you tell us a little about your company and your role there?</h3><p>1Password is a password manager trusted by millions of people and 70,000 businesses to secure their sensitive data. It remembers all your passwords so you don’t have to, and comes with apps for all major browsers, plus desktop and mobile.</p><p>I am the VP of Engineering for Client Apps here at 1Password. If you have ever had the pleasure to use 1Password on your Mac, Windows PC, iPhone, iPad, Android phone, or tablet, or in your browser, then you’ve been lucky enough to use something my team has built. We’ve been around since 2004, and we take a lot of pride in building a well-crafted experience and keeping people safe online.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/xa/xarnasmy.111_(5).jpg" alt="Michael Fey" loading="lazy"></p><h3 id="can-you-talk-about-the-stack-of-1password%3F-how-big-a-part-of-your-codebase-is-written-in-rust%3F">Can you talk about the stack of 1Password? How big a part of your codebase is written in Rust?</h3><p>We’ve been using Rust in production at 1Password for a few years now. Our Windows team was the frontrunner on this effort to the point where about 70% of 1Password 7 for Windows is written in Rust. We also ported the 1Password Brain – the engine that powers our browser filling logic – from Go to Rust at the end of 2019 so that we could take advantage of the speed and performance of deploying Rust to WebAssembly in our browser extension.</p><p>These have been in production for the last few years and we’ve seen great success. So much so that we’re now in the midst of a complete rewrite of nearly our entire product lineup, and Rust is a major part of that story. We are using Rust to create a headless 1Password app that encompasses all of the business logic, cryptography, database access, server communication, and more wrapped in a thin UI layer that is native to the system on which we’re deploying.</p><h3 id="did-any-of-rust%E2%80%99s-advantages-like-speed-or-type%2Fmemory-safety-influence-the-choice-of-using-rust-for-1password%3F">Did any of Rust’s advantages like speed or type/memory-safety influence the choice of using Rust for 1Password?</h3><p>One of the main things that drew us to Rust initially was the memory safety; it definitely excites us knowing that Rust helps us maximize our confidence in the safety of our customers’ secrets. Beyond memory safety, though, there’s so much more we love about the Rust ecosystem. There is a significant performance benefit to the lack of a traditional runtime; we don’t have to worry about the overhead of a garbage collector, for instance. Rust offers a form of “program correctness” and many guarantees against undefined behaviour at runtime. The strong type system enforces these rules at compile-time. Carefully aligning application logic with Rust’s strong type rules makes APIs difficult to use incorrectly and results in simpler code that’s free from runtime checking of constraints and invariants; the compiler can guarantee there are no invalid runtime code paths that will lead your program astray before it executes. Having to perform less runtime state validation leads to cleaner, more efficient, more focused, and higher quality code. Rust requires very little runtime debugging compared to other languages. If it compiles, you can be fairly sure it won’t exhibit unexpected behaviour. It may not be what you <em>want</em> but it will be “correct”. 🙂</p><p>Another very powerful (and often overlooked) feature of Rust is its procedural macro system, which has allowed us to write a tool that automatically shares types defined in Rust with our client-side languages (Swift, Kotlin, and TypeScript). The output from this tool handles the serialization/deserialization process automatically, meaning our client-side devs can continue to work in their language of choice while interacting with the Rust library and can be free from the concerns of JSON parsing over the foreign function interface (FFI). We get all of this while enjoying the benefits of compile-time type checking in every one of our target languages. We’ve integrated this tool into our continuous integration server as well, meaning that changes to the Rust models can result in compilation failures in the client applications that are caught during our review process.</p><p>This tool has been an integral component in our development process, allowing us to move much more quickly than ever before. Once our types are defined in Rust, we are able to immediately generate equivalent types in our client-side languages. This allows our devs to focus on solving problems without having to hand-roll boilerplate code to communicate over the FFI.</p><h3 id="how-good-is-rust%E2%80%99s-support-(library-and-otherwise)-for-developing-security-centric-applications-like-1password%3F">How good is Rust’s support (library and otherwise) for developing security-centric applications like 1Password?</h3><p>There is more than enough to build a majority of the base that security-centered applications require. There are two large, prominent cryptography platforms (<em><a href="https://github.com/briansmith/ring">ring</a></em> and the <a href="https://github.com/RustCrypto">Rust Crypto</a> group) that together provide a wealth of functionality. As I mentioned above, writing with Rust itself gives you much greater confidence in your memory usage and makes it much harder to accidentally introduce a memory-related exploit into your application. There is also a wonderful system in place for keeping track of vulnerabilities that do show up from time to time in Rust crates: the <a href="https://rustsec.org/">RustSec</a> database, which is community-sourced by other Rust developers and is updated frequently with new information that can be consumed in CI audit scans. The batteries-included test framework that Rust and Cargo also include mean that you always have an easy way to write unit-test suites for correct behavior in critical code, like any cryptographic functions that you write.</p><p>While safe native Rust libraries for everything are the dream (and they will come in time), there is always the option to dip down and easily consume something in C or from native platform libraries. We use this to great effect in our Rust code for things like calling out to the native implementations of biometric unlock (Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello) and platform-specific settings implementations like NSUserDefaults on Apple platforms.</p><h3 id="any-particular-rust-libraries-that-you-want-to-feature%3F">Any particular Rust libraries that you want to feature?</h3><p>Absolutely.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>When the call came</strong> to say my mother had died, I was working on a jigsaw of Joan MirÃ³â€™s painting <em>The Tilled Field</em> (1923-24). Like many others, I turned to jigsaws at the start of the pandemic as a way to manage stress, and symbolically reimpose order on a chaotic world. We take our consolations where we can and, as I continued with the puzzle in the days after mumâ€™s death, its tactile qualities, the spicy smell of ink and card, and the small satisfactions of placing each piece where it belonged, grounded me when the world was in bits â€“ both outside and within.</p>
<p><em>The Tilled Field</em> is an elementally life-affirming painting. A view of MirÃ³â€™s family farm in Mont-roig del Camp in Catalonia, it conjures a surreal collection of human, animal and vegetable forms, deconstructed and stylised, and heavily symbolic. Drawing on references from medieval Spanish tapestry to Catalan ceramics and cave paintings, the image is earthy, visceral and definitively a rural scene. Still, thereâ€™s something disquieting about the painting, as if it had emerged from a dream or the recesses of an unquiet mind. A tree grows a human ear and an eye; a cloud formation is also a weathervane; a piebald mare swishes her tail as her foal suckles at her teat. At its heart sits a tumbledown farmhouse straight from a dark folk tale. The smoke from its chimney suggests occupation, but the plaster walls are cracked and crumbling back to earth.</p>
<p>Since her diagnosis of dementia <span>15 years</span> ago, my mother, too, had been disintegrating, as it were, piece by piece. At each of my fortnightly visits, some further part of her seemed to have newly dropped away, leaving gaps so raw and cruel that I sometimes had to remind myself to focus on what remained. <span>COVID-19</span> put a stop to my visiting the nursing home where she spent the final decade of her life. We tried FaceTime â€˜get togethersâ€™ but my mother was blind as well as in <span>late-stage</span> dementia, so these felt like <span>one-way</span> affairs â€“ mumâ€™s eyes <span>half-closed,</span> her face unresponsive, her body giving every impression of lifelessness. At the time of her death, I hadnâ€™t seen her for four months, and her image had begun to fade in my mind.</p>
<p>Having a meaningful exchange with my mother involved delving into our shared narrative archive even as it shrank. In this way, we relived and remade the story of our life. We dipped toffee apples for bonfire night, rode donkeys on Llandudno beach, searched for the screech owl in the forest near my childhood home. Sometimes, my mother added to these memories as if they were lucid dreams she could shape at will. Meeting her where she was meant I had to map out the changing landscape of her dementia. Only there could we truly be together.</p>
<p><span>Three-year-olds</span> work by trial and error, but <span>four-year-olds</span> use the information in the picture to help them complete the puzzle</p>
<p>If maps are representations of a larger reality, then jigsaws are maps too. Indeed, they began life this way, as â€˜dissected mapsâ€™. Invented by the British cartographer John Spilsbury in the 1760s, the earliest puzzles were designed to make geography lessons more fun for schoolchildren and, no doubt, inculcate them early into the cult of empire. They remained classroom aids until <span>the 1800s,</span> when their manufacture was made cheaper by lithographic printing techniques, the invention of plywood and the treadle jigsaw. Over the <span>19th century,</span> what began as hand-coloured maps became printed images of monarchs and biblical illustrations, and by the <em>fin de siÃ¨cle</em>, when the ideas of Freud, Darwin, Nietzsche and the â€˜New Womanâ€™ threatened to fragment the old reality entirely, jigsaws had become popular family entertainments.</p>
<p>Like childhood itself, the early dissected maps arrived without any paper picture to act as a guide. The puzzle historian Anne Williams notes that, in 1908, Parker Bros changed the game by adding a print of the complete image to the box. With uncertainty about the destination reduced, the path grew more enticing. By the early 1930s, with the Great Depression beginning to bite, sales of jigsaws in the United States topped <span>10 million</span> a week. Enthusiasts queued at newsagents for new deliveries, much as modern lockdown puzzlers scoured the internet and traded in secondhand puzzles.</p>
<p>While there is <a href="https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-017-2151-9" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">evidence</a> to suggest that jigsaws help older people retain visuospatial memory, a recent <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.13391" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> led by the psychologist Martin Doherty at the University of East Anglia in the UK is the first to investigate how children use their understanding of pictures to complete jigsaw puzzles. The study found that three-year-olds work by trial and error, but four-year-olds use the information in the picture to help them complete the puzzle. Such an understanding of the language of pictorial representation is the foundation of the uniquely human ability to draw and create art.</p>
<p><strong>Itâ€™s often said that</strong> old age is a second childhood. The similarity of the two states â€“ the child immersed in their magic kingdom, the old person in their memory palace â€“ isnâ€™t lost on artists, scientists and thinkers. As the child emerges from the void, accumulating experience, making connections between things and people, so the old person divests themselves, or has taken from them, those same connections, before they return to the emptiness of nonexistence.</p>
<p>When cracks first began to appear in my motherâ€™s memory, she frantically touched them up in a colour that never quite matched. Once <span>touch-ups</span> became insufficient, she began a programme of wholesale renovation in the form of confabulated memories, extending and reworking experiences that, had they been real, wouldnâ€™t have passed building regulations. Though by now immobile, sheâ€™d insist that she had taken a long walk by the seaside, or run across my brother in a pear orchard, or just returned from holiday. The further her disease advanced, the less robust her attempts at repair became, as the supply of materials with which to build them dwindled. She once told me that her mind was falling to bits, which is what happens to everything and everyone eventually. We live with entropy. Yet how hard we resist it. Much of the human project is taken up with holding together things that will, eventually and inevitably, fall apart. Witnessing my mother labouring to put her brain back together was intensely moving. Her courage and resistance were flags planted in the territory of the living, and they deepened my love for her as she grew more frail. The lesson I learned is that itâ€™s not memory that makes us human but meaning-making. Thatâ€™s where the beauty and poignancy of human life is played out.</p>
<p>Slotting a familiar piece into its rightful place can feel almost as rewarding as returning a lost child to her mother</p>
<p>Art is a system of meaning-making too and, in the months since mumâ€™s death, I have deepened my understanding of how it operates by â€˜dissectingâ€™ the map that is <em>The Tilled Field</em>. To complete the jigsaw of an artwork is to observe the artistâ€™s work in a way thatâ€™s almost impossible to do in a gallery. You get to know it intimately, becoming familiar with every turn of the brush, each minute gradation of colour and tone. You develop an eye for certain patterns. Particularly â€˜helpfulâ€™ or intriguing jigsaw pieces, that are vital sources of information, data points along the route to completion, take on the character of old friends. Slotting a familiar piece into its rightful place can feel almost as rewarding as returning a lost child to her mother. Over the weeks it takes me to complete <em>The Tilled Field</em>, its elements and some essence of the artist take up residence inside me, becoming, as the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein might have said, introjected internal objects.</p>
<p>This kind of dynamic encounter of projection and introjection with the world of people and objects is how Klein imagines the way an infant struggles to construct an integrated ego. If weâ€™re lucky, Klein suggests, we develop from fragments of desire and need, frustrated or met, into coherent selves able to meet our own desires and needs. Whispering seductively in our ears all the while is Thanatos, the death instinct, willing us back towards the comforting psychic disintegration of <span>not-feeling</span> and unbeing. For Klein, coming into being is an existential battle. For some of us the drama returns, as it did for my mother, in the long, slow process of leaving life behind.</p>
<p>Kleinâ€™s one-time disciple Donald Winnicott had something interesting to say about becoming that seems important to me, standing as I am in the shadow of my motherâ€™s death. For him, the mother is at the heart of everything â€“ her willingness to hold, handle and â€˜present objectsâ€™ to her baby, to lend him her ego for his own use, enabling him to see himself as a coherent being, separate from her (and thus able support a relationship with her). Only through her can he become whole and real. In the language of jigsaws, good-enough mothering is the guide-image that the infant requires to allow him to build an integrated self from the bits and pieces of his needs, his developing internal world and his body.</p>
<p>When, later, bereavement leaves us once more in pieces, when the mother who birthed us is no longer here, how do we put ourselves back together again? Where is the guide-picture to help us map loss when the world itself seems to be coming apart, exposing the insufficiency of the old rubrics for living?</p>
<p>The attachment theorist John Bowlby described mourning as a form of separation anxiety, akin to that felt by a child lost in a crowd. There is panic, disorientation, a shattering of reality. Freud thought that, in order to grieve healthily, we must sever our bonds with the dead, and establish new ones with the living. But even if that were desirable, cutting ties with the mother through whom one becomes a self seems to ask the impossible. Dennis Klass, an expert on bereavement, <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Continuing-Bonds-New-Understandings-of-Grief/Klass-Silverman-Nickman/p/book/9781560323396" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">suggests</a> a more compassionate model. In his view, thereâ€™s no …</p></div></div></div>

  <p>In previous <a href="https://www.wutsi.com/read/243/build-product-using-api-first-approach">article</a>, we have explained why REST API plays a key role in your strategy for building modern application. Now we are going to share 5 steps that you can follow for designing your next REST APIs.<br>As example, we are going to show we to design a simple Blog platform to illustrate in practice how to apply those steps.</p> 
  <h2>1. Identify your Object Model</h2> 
  <p>The first step for designing your API is to identify the objects that are represented your application. In the REST world, they are called Resources. A Resource is an typed object with data.&nbsp; It's similar to Object in Oriented Object Programming, or Entities in Database.</p> 
  <p>On a Blog platform where users read articles and comment articles, we can define the Object Model for the blog platform with the following resources:</p> 
  <ul>
   <li>Article</li>
   <li>Comment</li>
  </ul> 
  <h2>2. Identify the URIs</h2> 
  <p>Once the Object Model has been defined, the next step is to identify the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier" target="_new">URI</a> for each resource of your Object Model. A URI is a unique address assigned to resources, it's a way to identify Resources on the Internet.&nbsp; For each resource in your Object Model, you must define an URI for a collection and single resource.</p> 
  <p>In our Blog example, we have the following URIs for Articles</p> 
  <pre>/articles
/articles/{id}</pre> 
  <p>And for Comments</p> 
  <pre>/articles/{id}/comments
/articles/{id}/comments/{id}</pre> 
  <p>Where</p> 
  <ul>
   <li><code>/articles </code>is the URI for a collection of Articles.</li>
   <li><code>/articles/{id}</code> is the URI of a given Article ({id} being the identifier of the article).</li>
   <li><code>/articles/{id}/comments</code> is the URI of the collection of Comments of a given Article. This also shows the relationship where Articles have multiple Comments.</li>
   <li><code>/articles/{id}/comments/{id}</code><b>&nbsp;</b> is the URI of given Comment of a given Article.</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>There are some naming convention to respect when defining your Resource URIs</p> 
  <ul>
   <li>Use only nouns (usually the name of your resources), with plural and lower case</li>
   <li>Use hyphen (-) instead of underscore (_) to improve readability. <code>Example: /articles/{id}/file-location</code>.</li>
   <li>Do not use extensions. <i><code>/article/{id}/content.xml&nbsp;</code></i>is bad practice.</li>
  </ul> 
  <h2>3. Define the Representations</h2> 
  <p>Next step is to define the content and the format of your resources. The most common formats are <code>JSON</code>, <code>XML</code> or <code>Protobuf</code>. For each resource in your Object Model, you must define a representation for a collection and single resource.</p> 
  <h3>Representation of a Collection of Articles</h3> 
  <p>When returning a collection resource, include only the most important information about the resources. This will keep the size of payload small, and so will improve the performance of REST APIs.</p> 
  <p>For example for a Blog, the collection representation will not return the article content because it would inflate the size of the data.</p>

}</pre> 
  <h2>4. Assign HTTP Methods</h2> 
  <p>The next step is to define how to access your resources via HTTP. For that, you need to use the standard HTTP methods:</p> 
  <ul>
   <li><code>GET</code>&nbsp;to retrieve Resources</li>
   <li><code>POST</code> to create or update a Resource</li>
   <li><code>DELETE</code> to delete a Resource</li>
  </ul> 
  <h3>Browse all Articles.</h3> 
  <p>To return all the articles available</p> 
  <pre>GET /articles</pre> 
  <p>If your blog have 1 millions articles, you cannot return your whole collection of articles in one request. This is why API provide the ability to paginate collections using the parameter: <code>limit</code>&nbsp;(max number of resources to return) and <code>offset</code>(index of the 1st resource starting at 0).</p> 
  <pre>GET /articles?limit=100&amp;offset=0</pre> 
  <p>API also provide filtering parameter to filter collections. To search all the articles having the status <code>published</code> in the category <code>sport</code></p> 
  <pre>GET /articles?category=sport&amp;status=published&amp;limit=100&amp;offset=0</pre> 
  <h3>Create a new Article</h3> 
  <p>To create a new Article:</p> 
  <pre>POST /articles</pre> 
  <p>The payload sent to the creation of the article:</p> 
  <pre>{

  <p>Please note that request payload will not contain any&nbsp;<code>id</code>&nbsp;attribute, as its part the the URI of the article to update.</p> 
  <p>The response will return the&nbsp;<code>id</code>&nbsp;of the updated article:</p> 
  <pre>{
  "id": 9999
}</pre> 
  <h3>Delete an Article</h3> 
  <p>To delete an article:</p> 
  <pre>DELETE /articles/999</pre> 
  <p>Deleting resources do not return data.</p> 
  <h2>5. What about Errors</h2> 
  <p>Because things never works as expected, you should also design for the case when things will go sour!</p> 
  <p>For REST API, you should use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes" target="_new">HTTP status codes</a> to report the status of each interaction with your API.&nbsp; The most used HTTP codes are the following:</p> 
  <ul>
   <li><code>200</code>: Everything worked.</li>
   <li><code>400</code>: The request is invalid. <br>Exemple: search an article with invalid status <code>xxx</code>.&nbsp;</li>
   <li><code>401</code>: Unauthorized. An anonymous user trying to access a resource that requires authentication.<br>Example: anonymous user trying to create a new article</li>
   <li><code>403</code>: Forbidden. You do not have enough privilege to access a resource.&nbsp;<br>Example: A user trying to delete an article of another user!</li>
   <li><code>404</code>: The resource requested was not found.</li>
   <li><code>409</code>: There is a conflict in the state of the resource.<br>Example: creating a user with an email already assigned to another user.</li>
   <li><code>500</code>: Something wrong happened on the server.<br>Example: Server database is down!</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>For all interaction that result to an error, a good practice is to return also a standard response containing the details of the error. </p> 
  <p>For exemple&nbsp;<code>GET /article?status=xxx&amp;limit=500</code> would return the status code <code>400&nbsp;</code>with the following response:&nbsp;</p> 
  <pre>{
  "errors":[
     {
       "code": "invalid_status",
       "message": "Got 'xxx'. Expecting 'published' or 'draft'"
     },
     {
       "code": "invalid_limit",
       "message": "Limit must be lower than 200"
     }
  ]
}</pre>

<h3>(Partial) Transcript</h3>
<p><strong><em>[Most episode transcripts/scripts are reserved for my Patreon supporters (at least for the time being), but I like to give you at least a taster here — or in this case, the first half of the episode.]</em></strong></p>

<p>Welcome to the Life and Times of Video Games, a documentary audio series about video games and the video game industry, as they were in the past and how they've come to be the way they are today. I'm Richard Moss, and this is episode 30, The Dragon Speech, and Chris Crawford's improbable dream.</p>

<p>We'll get going in just a moment. </p>

<p>*pause for pre-roll ad slot*</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Chris Crawford didn't always have a dream. He wasn't always tormented by a menacing dragon that he could not defeat.</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><em><p>it wasn't so very long ago, when I knew the dragon. It was in nineteen seventy five when I first encountered the concept of a computer game. That was a new concept to me. For me, the computer had always been a tool for scientific calculation.</p><p>Now, the notion of using it to play…well, that was a fascinating and utterly unconventional concept to me. And so I decided to begin to acquaint myself with this technology. I had no dream as yet. For me, the dragon still slept…</p></em></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>He was a teacher at the time, parlaying his knowledge of physics to students at a small community college in Nebraska, and he'd just met a man who was attempting to program a computerised version of a boardgame — a strategy wargame called Blitzkrieg.</p>

<p>Intrigued, he started to ponder the problem. And before long he made his own computer game, a turn-based tactical wargame he called Wargy 1. You played against a computer-controlled opponent with help from a physical board and some pieces from an Avalon Hill boardgame. You'd make your moves on the board, then input them into the computer, and in return it would print out coordinates for its own moves.</p>

<p>That game would eventually become a commercial program called Tanktics, which he initially self-published for Commodore-PET computers in 1978 — for a grand total of 150 sales, which was impressive at the time. And in 1981 he would have the game re-published on multiple systems by Avalon Hill.</p>

<p>But by then Chris was firmly entrenched in the video game business. He'd left his teaching job to join Atari in 1979, eager to become a part of this exciting video game revolution. At Atari he briefly learnt the basics of programming for the Video Computer System, or the Atari 2600, as we know it today, before he shifted over to the group that really excited him — the group focused on developing games for the Atari 800 home computer, which at the time had the finest graphics and sound capabilities of any home computers on the market.</p>

<blockquote><em><p>The 800 was so far ahead of everything else. It was the machine to learn on, and I knew nothing about graphics and sound. So I hurled myself into the machine, absorbing everything I could, learning all about graphics and sound. Some of you may find it ironic to learn that for a time there I was known as 'the graphics wizard of Atari'. And indeed, there was a period of time there where my game, Eastern Front, was the most graphically advanced product in the marketplace. Because that was a phase I needed to go through. I needed to understand that.</p>

<p>I needed to feel that I had a good grip on it.</p>

<p>And so all through this period, from 1975 to 1981, for six years, I was apprenticing myself to this technology. I was turning it over and over in my hands. I was getting the feel of it in my fingertips. And for six years I had no dream at all. All I did was learn. And by 1981 I felt that I understood the technology. I felt that I knew what this medium was about, but I had no dream I could — I couldn't see the dragon, but by 1981 I could hear him thrashing about in the forest. I knew he was out there somewhere. I knew he was big, whatever he was, and I wanted to find it. And then in one of those fortuitous circumstances that is so perfectly timed that we can only ascribe its event, its occurrence, to the the workings of fate, then Alan Kay came into my life.</p></em></blockquote>

<p>And here, in 1981 — this is where our story starts. That name, Alan Kay, may sound familiar to you; he's one of the fathers of the personal computer, and of a concept called the Dynabook, which eventually manifested in the form of the iPad. Alan Kay did a PhD in computer science in the late 1960s, where he was mentored by the fathers of computer graphics, Ivan Sutherland and David Evans, and then joined Xerox PARC, the research and development company that created the Xerox Alto computer — which would inspire Apple to create the Macintosh. Alan Kay and his colleagues at Xerox also invented the concept of object-oriented programming, as well as graphical user interfaces and lots of other forward-thinking things that took decades to turn into mainstream technologies.</p>

<p>In 1981, Alan Kay became Atari's chief scientist. He was hired to form a corporate research group that would push the boundaries of what's possible with video games. And Chris was asked to join that group, to apprentice himself to this great master of technology — whose mind races decades ahead, who could see and describe revolutions coming 20, 30, 50 years before they actually hit us.</p>

<p>Alan Kay had a massive influence on Chris, and he taught Chris myriad lessons. But Chris recalls that one lesson stood out above all else.</p>

<blockquote><p>Chris Crawford: I'd say the most important one was to dream big, or aim high. One of his most useful adages was if you don't fail at least 90 percent of the time, you're not aiming high enough.</p></blockquote>

<p>***</p>

<blockquote><em><p>Another way of viewing dreaming is to think in terms of alternate realities. There is, of course, reality, the real reality. But when we fantasise, we create an imaginary, a desired universe. But we don't care about whether the universe works, whether it's possible. Only when we dream do we create a universe that is actually possible.</p></em></blockquote>

<p>When Alan Kay taught Chris to dream, and dream big, Chris did exactly that. He dreamed of what games might become, of what games could be. At first his dream was imprecise, unclear, but as he thought upon it more, and as he wrote his first book, The Art of Computer Game Design, slowly it solidified in his mind.</p>

<blockquote><em><p>And by 1983, I had my dream. I could see the dragon clearly in my mind's eye.</p>

<p>Let me tell you about my dream.</p>

<p>I dreamed of the day when computer games would be a viable medium of artistic expression, an art form. I dreamed of computer games encompassing the broad range of human experience and emotion, computer games about tragedy or self-sacrifice, games about duty and honour, patriotism, of satirical games about politics or games about human folly. Games about man's relationship to God, or to nature. Games about the passionate love between a boy and a girl, or the serene and mature love between [a] husband and wife of decades. Games about family relationships or death, mortality, a boy becoming a man or a man realising he is no longer young. Games about a man facing truth at high noon on a dusty main street, or boy and his dog, or a prostitute with a heart of gold. </p>

<p>All of these things and more were part of this dream, but by themselves they amounted to nothing because all of these things have already been done by other art forms. There's no advantage, no purchase, no — nothing superior about this dream. It's just an old rehash. All we are doing with the computer — if, if, if all we do is just reinvent the wheel with poor-grade materials, well, we don't have a dream worth pursuing.</p></em></blockquote>

<p>The critical piece of Chris's dream, the part to made it so important to him, that elevated it above the idea of games as an imitation of other art forms, to become a true art form all their own — that was interactivity. Games are interactive. They tap into a need to learn through play that's hardwired into our very being. Chris wanted all those things he dreamed of to be presented in a deeply interactive way, in a way that was unique only to video games.</p>

<p>So he began to work on turning his dream to reality.</p>

<p>This work involved an attempt to lead by example — to make games about social interaction, games about geopolitics (and it's …</p></div></div>

<h2>Background</h2>



<p>I’ve been sitting on the “other” side of the table for a while now. Did around hundred of them. Primarily for software engineering positions, but I had my shot of fun with QA, sys admins and many others.</p>



<p>Frankly, I’ve always loved them. They kind of combine couple of passions that I deeply enjoy immersing myself in – presenting, learning, and seeing people grow. Presenting the company, learning about the candidate and seeing them grow as we provide positive reinforcement.</p>



<p>And trust me, I’ve seen my fair share of candidates. I’ve interviewed all kinds of people – introverts, extroverts, brilliant geniuses, loud and quiet folks, ordinary next-door neighbours and all kinds of weirdos. People who were excited to be there and those who appeared to have arrived from a different planet. You name it and I’ve seen it.</p>



<p>And yet, one thing is unique for pretty much all of them – I’ve enjoyed them all!</p>



<h2>Real-life story</h2>



<p>It was Tuesday, I think. I’ve been experimenting with publishing my articles on different days and, for no reason whatsoever, I chose to publish this one on Tuesday. Tuesday would do it. It was the article where I explained how we all are anxious about something and how I’m dealing with my share of it.</p>



<p>“You know what you should be writing about?”, asked a good friend of mine. She’d been following my blog from the very beginning and had always provided me with a great feedback. </p>



<p>“No. Tell me?”, I proceeded. “You should write an article on how to survive a job interview as an anxious introvert”.</p>



<p>And this got me puzzled. It got me puzzled for multiple reasons that are beyond explanation here, but one of the main reasons being the fact that this was a person with almost ten years of professional experience, who was, among other great things, extremely good at her job. Companies would be fighting over her, should she decide to apply. And yet, she struggled.</p>



<p>“But I don’t get it,”, I said, “why would YOU be anxious of interviews? You are great at what you do, you have perfect soft skills and you just have experience to prove that”.</p>



<p>“Well, it’s just that I see my friend, who is an extreme extrovert, having such an easy and fun time while interviewing, whereas I’d probably start sweating and collapse from a panic attack. How do I even compete against an extrovert who presents themselves way better than I do?”. </p>



<p>Ouch!</p>



<h2>It’s scary because it’s unknown</h2>



<p>There is a famous quote, said by US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, which goes like:</p>



<blockquote><p>Reports that say that something hasn’t happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, <em><strong>there are known knowns</strong></em>; there are things we know we know. We also know <strong><em>there are known unknowns</em></strong>; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But <strong><em>there are also unknown unknowns</em></strong> —the ones we don’t know we don’t know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones.</p><cite>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">Wikipedia</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Even though the context was a bit different, the concept of known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns is a useful one. Let’s put it into the context of job interviews.</p>



<h4>Known knowns</h4>



<p>Known knowns are things that you know that you know. Things like – job that you are applying for, skills required to apply, etc. Pretty much everything that you are (hopefully) aware of at the time when you are applying.</p>



<p>Assuming that you already did your due diligence, we won’t be bothering with these.</p>



<h4>Known unknowns</h4>



<p>Known unknowns are things that you are aware of, but you don’t know much about them. These are things like – how are the interviews handled at this company, what are they really looking for, who the interviewers are, etc.</p>



<p><span>These are the things where you need to put your detective cap on and – investigate</span>! The more you care about the company that you are applying for, the more time you should invest at this stage.</p>



<p>Start by learning more about the company and their values. Go to their website and read what they are about. Are they multi-national? Who their clients are and what their company values are.</p>



<p>Next, try and learn how this company does their interviews. Google for “[company name] interviews”. Look for websites dedicated to leaving the reviews of companies (e.g. Glassdoor). Make sure to look for websites local to your country (e.g. in Serbia we have Joberty and Helloworld).</p>



<p>Now go and learn who their employees are. Open up the LinkedIn and search for the company name. Explore who works there. What their education and their backgrounds are. Look for HRs, recruiters and interviewers. Learn about them. Google some of them as well.</p>



<p>Finally, ask around. See if there’s anyone working there who you might have contact with. Ask them for more info.</p>



<p>Rule of a thumb is – <span>the more you learn upfront, the more confident you will feel; and, in turn, the less anxious you will become.</span></p>



<h4>Unknown unknowns</h4>



<p>Unknown unknowns are things that you don’t even know are there. <span>These are the things that make you anxious without you even realizing it. And that’s exactly where this article comes to rescue.</span> So, bookmark it!</p>



<p>The issue here is that you can’t really prepare because you have no clue what to prepare for. <span>Do your fair share of dealing with known unknowns, make peace with statements that I write about and, trust me, you’ll do perfect.</span> I promise!</p>



<p>So, let’s start.</p>



<h2>It’s OK to feel nervous</h2>



<p>Let me put this as simple as possible. <span>Job interviews are stressful</span>. They just are and there’s no way around it. <span>Regardless of your personality type, there is a highly likelihood of hitting at least one of the most common anxieties</span> — speaking in public, presenting yourself, facing the unknown, showcasing your skills, solving (whiteboard) problems, …</p>



<p>If you’re lucky – you’re dealing with one anxiety only. But if you’re like most people – you’re probably hitting a jackpot. Doubly so if it’s a job that you really care about. Ouch!</p>



<p>But let me tell you this – we, the interviewers are aware of this. We expect you to be nervous, panicky, sweating and stuttering. Not because we’re a sadistic bunch but because we know that interviews make people nervous. And that’s OK, really! We absolutely do not expect you to be as cool as a cucumber. Cool for you if you are, but it doesn’t make any difference to us. We will NOT judge you for it.</p>



<h2>It’s OK to ask</h2>



<p>This is such an under appreciated and yet, such and easy and powerful thing you can do. Whoever was the person you had initial contact with (usually an HR or a Recruiter), just ask them what you can expect during the interview and what you should do to better prepare.</p>



<p>I can guarantee that you will never be judged for asking. Quite the contrary. You will show that you are interested in preparing upfront, which, at least to me, is a positive thing. A win-win.</p>



<h2>Our job is to make you feel comfortable</h2>



<p>Now this seems to blow people’s brains. And I have no idea why so, but it’s a fact.</p>



<p>Our job, as interviewers, is to help you relax. Seriously. And not because we’re particularly fond of you, but <span>because we WANT to help you present yourself in the best possible way</span>. You can even call it selfish if you want, but it kind of benefits both sides 🙂</p>



<p>We don’t want you redlining your heart rate. Quite the opposite. And, a win-win, really.</p>



<h2>Interviewers are nervous as well</h2>



<p>Weird, right? Unless you’ve been on the other side of the table, you probably never even thought about it. But it’s a fact.</p>



<p>We, the interviewers, get nervous and anxious as well. It can really range from a mild anxiety due to the fact that we are interviewing a candidate we’d really like to hire, all the way to sitting across the table from a person who, for lack of better word – makes us nervous.</p>



<p><span>The only difference between you, the interviewee, and us, the interviewers, is that we’ve done so many of the interviews that we lowered those anxities to manageable levels.</span> And we learn to keep ourselves cool. It’s just practice &amp; repetition really.</p>



<h2>What if you encounter an unpleasant interviewer?</h2>



<p>Well, that happens. Probably way more than we’d all like, but hey, …</p>



<p>But let me put it this way – <span>if you go to a restaurant and encounter a rude waiter or, even worse, an owner, would you feel bad about the fact that you are feeling bad?</span> Of course not! You’d leave that place never to return again.</p>



<p>What’s so different about interviewers then? <span>I’d see those as a perfect filter – they filter out companies that you don’t really want to work in.</span> You’re their guest and, if they don’t really care about properly welcoming you, then you have no business being there. Pay the bill (the time you spent there) and leave. Case closed.</p>



<h2>Summarized tips for surviving the interviews</h2>



<p>So, let’s quickly summarize everything that you’ve read so far:</p>



<ol><li>Learn about the company. Google for “[[ company name ]] interviews” and get familiar with it.</li><li>Learn about the interviewers, if possible. Google them if needed. Learn who they are and what they do. This might give you a clue on type of questions that you might get asked by them</li><li>It’s OK to ask. Ask your contact person how to prepare better. Let them help you. It’s a win-win.</li><li>It’s OK to be nervous. We (the interviewers) know that you probably will be. Don’t worry. We won’t judge you for it.</li><li>We’re there to help you present yourself in the best possible light. Yep. We’re trained to help you relax. We want you to show the best of yourself, given the circumstances.</li><li>We know that what you demonstrate is not a perfect representation of what you really know. Really. Anxiety, panic, nervousness, … it can be crazy and we know it. So, don’t worry. Let us help you and guide you through the process.</li><li>Finally, you can always look at it as a <em>one more rep</em>*. Really. The worst case scenario is that you have one more experience under your belt. And practice beats the talent; every single time.</li></ol>

You could make the application name really really long. And the search engine on the App Store gives more weight to the application name rather than the keybookwords defined.

A one-time English major at Berkely, he was a brilliant writer with a gift for creating characters. </p><p>He'd realized, early on, that <strong>the only way to find DVD owners was in the fringe communities of the internet: user groups, bulletin boards, web forums, and all of the other digital watering holes where enthusiasts met up</strong>. <strong>Corey's plan was to infiltrate these communities.</strong> He wouldn't announce himself as a Netflix employee. Posing as a home theater enthusiast or cinephile, he would join the conversation in communities geared toward DVD fanatics and movie buffs, befriend the major players, and slowly, over time, alert the most respected commenters, moderators, and website owners about this great new site called Netflix. <strong>We were months from launch, but he was planting seeds that would pay off...big time</strong>.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.amazon.com/That-Will-Never-Work-Netflix/dp/0316530204/ref=nodl_">That Will Never Work</a> by Marc Randolph (Netflix)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Solely through guest blogging we’ve acquired around 100,000 users</strong> within the first 9 months of running Buffer.

Of course the early ones barely drove any traffic and only very gradually did things improve, I think that’s very important to understand.

We asked all our network to invite their friends, and being startup people who wanted to help us, they obliged, so two-degrees out we probably got to 1k or so users.

      <h3 id="soul-a-new-language-now-in-v10-makes-audio-coding-vastly-more-accessible">SOUL, a new language now in V1.0, makes audio coding vastly more accessible</h3>

<h5 id="january-20-2021">January 20, 2021</h5>

<p>London — Today’s release of SOUL, the new universal language for audio applications, will dramatically lower barriers and expand access for developers creating any apps that depend on audio, as well as providing a more efficient architecture for audio processing.</p>

<p>SOUL has reached version 1.0 status with its language, compiler, and “SOUL patch” format all stable, tested, and ready to use in a wide variety of audio-related projects.. The team, led by JUCE and Tracktion creator Julian Storer, is already at work on an array of other SOUL tools including a visual editor and a developer portal.</p>

<p>“SOUL will revolutionize audio app development, eliminating challenges that have impeded developers for too long,” said Julian Storer, Head of Software Architecture at ROLI. “The need for a radical rethink of how audio apps are made has only become more urgent since I started the SOUL project in 2016. I’m tremendously excited about the V1.0 released today and the additional tools to come.”</p>

<p>Both a programming language and a platform for creating audio plugins and apps, SOUL will solve four fundamental problems facing audio developers today:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Easy to learn and use: C++, the standard language for audio app coding, is extremely difficult to learn. The SOUL language is much simpler and more intuitive. Browser-based tools and fast live testing make it even easier to use and master.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More secure: Sandboxing untrusted third-party code adds performance overheads that are a particular problem for audio coding. SOUL uses an intermediate assembly language called HEART that is safe to run without sandboxing, making SOUL code far more secure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optimized for power and performance: CPU-intensive power consumption is a constant problem for developers. The SOUL language is far more efficient. It is specifically designed for performance, with its JIT engine matching an equivalent program written in native C++.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Achieves lowest latency: Latency in audio apps is another deep-rooted issue that to date is solved by running audio on dedicated audio hardware. SOUL unlocks ultra-low latency on devices without the need for embedded CPUs and DSPs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Since debuting SOUL at ADC 2018, the team has continuously welcomed feedback through the open-source repository at https://soul.dev. This feedback has helped SOUL reach its V1.0 state today.</p>

<p>The SOUL team encourages developers to explore the language on soul.dev, read the documentation on the SOUL repository on Github, and give more feedback as the SOUL toolset continues to grow this year.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called “actions”. In other words, the Redux pattern provides state management for JavaScript apps. You can use the Redux library with any frontend framework, such as React, Angular, or even Vue. In the end, you can implement the Redux pattern in any vanilla JS application. </p><p>This article covers what Redux is, why you need it, how it works, the benefits, and when not to use Redux. To make Redux clearer, we’ll update you with code examples to make the concept easier to grasp. Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="what-is-redux">What is Redux?</h2><p>As mentioned in the introduction, Redux is a pattern that facilitates state management. It allows you to maintain a predictable state container for your JavaScript apps. This is important for consumer-facing applications where the interface changes based on user input. </p><p>On top of that, Redux prevents race conditions where two components simultaneously try to update the state. It accomplishes this task by defining actions that get dispatched to reducers. </p><p>Each action contains a type (also seen as an identifier) and a payload. Next, a reducer accepts the action and changes the state based on the received action type and payload.</p><p>Reducers are pure functions, which means they are predictable. A pure function returns the same output for the same input. You can use reducers to generate a new application state.</p><p>Lastly, to notify our interface that the application state has changed, we can subscribe to data changes. Whenever the application state changes, we update the UI.</p><p>It’s a simple, yet elegant solution to facilitate predictable state management for small and large applications. Luckily, most popular frameworks offer support for Redux. Here’s a quick overview:</p><ul><li><p><strong>React</strong> -&gt; <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">react-redux</a>: You can add Redux to your React application by installing the <code>react-redux</code> dependency. </p></li><li><p><strong>Angular</strong> -&gt; <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngrx/store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@ngrx/store</a> or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-redux/store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@angular-redux/store</a>: Both options work well to implement Redux into your Angular application. According to <a href="https://www.npmtrends.com/@angular-redux/store-vs-@ngrx/store-vs-@ngxs/store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">npmtrends.com</a>, <code>@angular-redux/store</code> is the most popular library in terms of weekly downloads.</p></li><li><p><strong>Vue</strong> -&gt; <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuejs-redux" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">vuejs-redux</a>: This dependency offers a light-weight implementation of Redux for Vue with only 45 lines of code and no dependencies. It provides the same API as the <code>react-redux</code> dependency.</p></li></ul><p>Next, why should you use Redux?</p><h2 id="why-use-redux">Why use Redux?</h2><p>Instead of directly exploring examples, let’s learn more about the problem Redux solves. </p><p>As with many applications, they start small. Imagine a pyramid structure of seven components where each component as two child components. Each component manages its state. However, situations occur where we have to share a state with a child component or a child component wants to modify the parent component’s state.</p><p>Do you see the problem? While our application grows to a higher number of components, maintaining data consistency becomes a hairy challenge. It’s not an easy task to manage each component’s state while sharing it with many other components. You’ll likely experience data inconsistency bugs, a fearsome nightmare for frontend developers.</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/f3b749e44077c9d0fbfc06e129be1439/1727d/5538b516f2c347f8846fe3c15d0d100e.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/f3b749e44077c9d0fbfc06e129be1439/1727d/5538b516f2c347f8846fe3c15d0d100e.png 1834w" sizes="(max-width: 1834px) 100vw, 1834px" alt="without Redux vs. with Redux">

Instead, we create a single store that handles our state management. On top of that, all communication regarding reading, updating, or creating data happens via the store. It prevents data inconsistency bugs from appearing. Moreover, components can listen to state changes to update the UI and avoid these data inconsistency bugs.</p><p>Lastly, you can install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Redux DevTools</a> that give you insights into your application’s current state to simplify debugging or testing your application. It’s a great incentive to get started with Redux.</p><p>Next, let’s explore Redux with code examples.</p><h2 id="redux-with-code-examples---how-does-it-work">Redux with code examples - How does it work?</h2><p>Let’s recap the Redux cycle before we take a look at our code example. This is how the Redux cycle looks like:</p><ol><li>Users interact with the interface and triggers an action</li><li>Action with/without payload is sent to a reducer using the dispatcher</li><li>Reducer checks if it handles the action and produces a new state based on the action and its payload</li><li>State changes are notified via subscription methods</li><li>UI renders again based on state changes received via the subscription method</li></ol><p>Now, let’s explore how this works using code. We’ll create a simple webpage that allows you to increase or decrease a counter in the state using plus and minus buttons. We’ll use a single <code>index.html</code> document that contains a script tag with all the necessary code. </p><p>You can find the completed code via <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/redux-fundamentals-core-example-forked-nigo3?file=/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CodeSandbox.io</a>.</p><h3 id="step-1-exploring-indexhtml">Step 1: Exploring index.html</h3><p>First, let’s create an <code>index.html</code> document with the following HTML setup.

This property contains the name of the action. As a best practice, use the format <code>&lt;reducer-name&gt;/&lt;action&gt;</code>. This makes it easier to identify actions as multiple components can send the same action. In our example, we will name the reducer <code>counter</code>. Therefore, we get the following actions:</p><ul><li><code>counter/increment</code></li><li><code>counter/decrement</code></li></ul><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>      </span><span>document</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>        </span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"increment"</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>        </span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"click"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>          store</span><span>.</span><span>dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> type</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"counter/increment"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>        </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>      </span><span>document</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>        </span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"decrement"</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span>        </span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"click"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>          store</span><span>.</span><span>dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> type</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"counter/decrement"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>        </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>Next, let’s define the reducer.</p><h3 id="step-3-define-a-reducer">Step 3: Define a reducer</h3><p>As we can dispatch multiple actions to the reducer, we’ll use a switch statement to handle the different actions.</p><p>First, we define the initial state for the application by setting the <code>count</code> equal to zero.

You may have multiple reducers for your application. When you dispatch an action, the action is sent to all reducers and not only the intended one. Therefore, you want all reducers to return the current state to avoid errors and only the intended reducer to return the updated state.</p><h3 id="step-4-subscribing-to-state-changes">Step 4: Subscribing to state changes</h3><p>In this step, we want to subscribe to state changes to update the UI when the state has changed.</p><p>We define a <code>render</code> method that retrieves the current state and renders the <code>count</code> property. Further, we pass this <code>render</code> function as an argument to the <code>store.subscribe</code> method to update the UI automatically when the state changes. This method exposed by our newly created store will call the <code>render</code> function when the state has changed.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>      </span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>      </span><span>const</span><span> countEl </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"count"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>      </span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>      </span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>      </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>        </span><span>const</span><span> state </span><span>=</span><span> store</span><span>.</span><span>getState</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>        countEl</span><span>.</span><span>innerHTML</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> state</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span>      </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>      </span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>      </span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>      </span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>      store</span><span>.</span><span>subscribe</span><span>(</span><span>render</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>Make sure to take a look at the <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/redux-fundamentals-core-example-forked-nigo3?file=/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">completed code</a>.

  <section>
    <p>One of the advantages of QWidgets when building a Qt application is
the ability to build in a simple way custom widgets with the QPainter
API. This gives the Qt developer almost total freedom to implement
complex geometries for their widgets.</p>
<p>On the other hands, QML contains by default only rectangles. These
rectangles can change the radius to create circles and rounded rectangles, but more
complex shapes are more complicated.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-state-of-custom-geometry-in-qtquick">The current state of custom geometry in QtQuick</h2>
<p>Fortunally, the Qt API provides multiple ways to implement custom shapes,
that depending on the needs might be enough.</p>
<p>There is the Canvas API using the same API as the <code>canvas</code> API on the web but
in QML. It’s easy to use but very slow and I wouldn’t recommend it.</p>
<p>Instead of the Canvas API, from the QML side, there is the
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-shapes-shape.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QtQuick Shapes module</a>.
This module allows creating more complex shapes directly from the QML
with a straightforward declarative API. In many cases, this is good enough
for the application developer but this module doesn’t offer a public C++
API.</p>
<p>If you need more controls, using C++ will be required to implement custom
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qquickitem.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QQuickItem</a>. Unfortunately drawing
on the GPU using QQuickItem is more
complex than the QPainter API. You can’t just use commands like <code>drawRect</code>,
but will need to convert all your shapes in triangles first. This involves
a lot of maths like it can be seen in the example from the
<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-scenegraph-customgeometry-example.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official documentation</a> or from
<a href="https://www.kdab.com/efficient-custom-shapes-in-qt-quick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the KDAB tutorial (Efficient custom shapes in Qt Quick)</a>.</p>
<p>A QPainer way is also available with <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qquickpainteditem.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QQuickPaintedItem</a>,
but it is slow because it renders your shape in a textured rectangle in the
Scene Graph.</p>
<h2 id="the-rusty-way">The Rusty way</h2>
<p>What if we could transform arbitrary shapes into triangles? We would get a
high level API but still get great performance. This process is called tessellation
and there are a few libraries that implement it. For example in C++, we
have Skia and CGAL. Unfortunatelly, both aren’t easy to use, so I decided to look
at the Rust library ecosystem and in particular at <a href="https://github.com/nical/lyon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lyon</a>,
which was designed with performance and compliance to the SVG standard in mind
since the goal is to use it in Servo in the future.</p>
<p>Lyon doesn’t have any C++ bindings but I got inspired by the recent
<a href="https://jbbgameich.github.io/misc/2020/12/21/rust-in-a-kde-project.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post from Jonah</a>
and I need to say the experience of writing bindings was a breeze.</p>
<p>The first step was creating wrapper <code>struct</code>s around the
Lyon primitives. <code>LyonPoint</code>, <code>LyonGeometry</code> and <code>LyonBuilder</code> will
later be directly usable from the C++ side.</p>

<p>This blog documents my journey in constructing an 8-bit relay computer, from scratch, made from tons of solder, wires,
lights, relays, sweat, tears, swearing and money.</p>
<p>The design of the computer is based on the one constructed by
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Relay/index.html">Dr. Harry Porter</a>
at Portland State University (reproduced on this blog with kind permission) but the construction method is my own and so
this blog captures the thoughts, experiences and pitfalls that I encounter along the way.</p>

<p>Growing up in Chile, Leonardo Barrientos didn’t know much about Delaware, at least until he went to law school in Santiago. He took a couple classes on American law, and only then did he come to understand how this unassuming state had become the preferred incorporation site not just for U.S. companies but for any foreign startup seeking funding from American venture capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the fact that the global startup economy is driving more innovation than ever, founders from Chile to India to Nigeria are compelled to incorporate their companies in Delaware, if they seek sizable capital for growth. Incorporating in Delaware may seem like a dramatic imposition on a startup’s identity — doing so is often to its legal and financial detriment —but most founders accept it as a necessary step to achieving international success. The Delaware path to incorporation has become so baked into the global technology market that, rather than try to supplant it, companies are building products to help navigate the state’s complicated corporate restructuring procedure, now virtually required of foreign companies by both local and American funders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overseas startups don’t choose Delaware because of some special tax break; the practice is based on a precedent that dates back to the turn of the century. In 1899, when Delaware enacted its <a href="https://www.djcl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/A-History-of-Delaware-Corporation-Law1.pdf">General Corporation Law</a>, the state laid the foundation for itself to become the incorporation hub of the United States. The law empowers courts to simplify the incorporation process; now, over 50% of publicly traded American companies are formed in the state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chris Field, a cofounder of legal-tech startup Clerky, said that this set off a feedback loop. “More and more people started gravitating there,” he said, “and the system got more mature and more built out.” As a result, lawyers across the United States — and the world — began developing Delaware-specific expertise.</p>



<p>Field said that during the dot-com bubble, many Silicon Valley companies would still form in California, but “by the mid-2000s, it really had become the de facto standard: Always form a startup as a Delaware corporation.” Today, the largest tech companies, including Google and Facebook, are all incorporated in Delaware.</p>



<p>Anil Advani is the managing partner at Inventus Law, a Silicon Valley corporate law firm. “If you’re trying to become a global company, then you want to look like, smell like, and talk like any other successful Silicon Valley company,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>. “When it comes to legal structure, don’t try to be creative.”</p>



<p>In Chile, where Barrientos began to learn about Delaware’s importance, he worked for one of the biggest financial consultancy firms in the country and saw firsthand how convoluted incorporation was. “You could tell how much founders struggled with legal fees and how to structure their companies correctly,” Barrientos told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Barrientos knew of products in the United States, such as Field’s Clerky and LegalZoom, that used technology to help automate legal procedures, incorporation in particular. But they catered to American startups; for overseas founders, the practice introduced a host of additional complications.</p>



<p>That’s when Barrientos decided to found his own startup, Lexgo, which makes incorporating in Delaware easier for Latin American companies. When Lexgo applied for funding from Y Combinator, the famed Silicon Valley startup accelerator, Barrientos went through the Delaware incorporation process himself; it’s a requirement for all participants, foreign or American. Although Lexgo wasn’t accepted, the decision to do the paperwork immediately paid off: When Barrientos took meetings with U.S. investors, they initially weren’t interested because Lexgo was based in Santiago. “Right away, we told them, ‘We’re a U.S. company. That shouldn’t be a problem,’” he said. The company <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/432434-71#funding">raised</a> a $373,000 seed round in 2019.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“If you’re trying to become a global company, then you want to look like, smell like, and talk like any other successful Silicon Valley company.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>But it’s not always American venture capitalists pressuring companies to incorporate in Delaware — VCs from outside the U.S. also say they prefer their portfolio companies to be incorporated there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kayode Oyewole is a partner at Ventures Platform, an early stage Nigerian VC fund. Oyewole told <em>Rest of World </em>that his fund encourages startups it believes to have international potential to register in Delaware because it will make it easier for them to raise capital, even if years down the line. Paystack, a Nigerian payments company that was recently acquired for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/">more than $200 million</a>, was backed by Ventures Platform in early investment rounds. Originally a Lagos-based entity, Paystack incorporated in Delaware in 2015.&nbsp;The push to incorporate in the U.S. has had knock-on effects for other business services too. Many technology products aren’t available to international companies, among them Stripe and the capitalization-table management platform Carta. Barrientos said he has heard of VCs who refuse to invest in companies that don’t use Carta, automatically disqualifying companies incorporated abroad. “And there’s no Carta of Brazil,” he said. Stripe, similarly, is not available in any <a href="https://stripe.com/global">African or Latin American countries</a>, although it’s currently being tested in Brazil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in order to obtain the benefits of American incorporation, overseas companies must overcome the hurdles of a complete internal restructuring. The complex endeavor requires companies to perform a corporate “flip,” or inversion, whereby a foreign entity becomes a subsidiary of a Delaware holding company that sits atop the corporate structure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Products like Lexgo and Clerky are making things smoother and more affordable for international companies. Even so, Clerky cofounder Darby Wong said he still encourages users to hire a lawyer to avoid small errors that could result in what he refers to as a “runaway chain reaction.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because incorporation is expensive — often costing close to $10,000 — many startup founders try to take shortcuts. Mistakes during the process can have deep implications for a company, jeopardizing its intellectual property and even its tax standing back home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, complicated corporate flips and all, incorporating in Delaware remains the price of admission to the global startup market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iyinoluwa Aboyeji is a Nigerian founder of two well-known startups, Andela and Flutterwave. Despite being founded in Nigeria, both were incorporated in Delaware. Aboyeji said he’s not averse to keeping his operations in Nigeria — he sometimes faces prejudice in the U.S. because of <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/how-a-forbes-cover-star-stole-millions/">stereotypes</a> about Nigerians. “If [American VCs] were willing to fully fund me, I would incorporate in Nigeria,” Aboyeji said. “You just kind of acquiesce and make it easy for people to deal with you.”</p>



<p>Barrientos said he doesn’t mind that he had to go through Delaware to incorporate. In an ideal world, he would be able to incorporate in whatever country made the most sense for tax purposes, rather than prioritizing where VCs invest. “We are a long way away from that,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>. “But I think we’ll probably get there.”</p>

    <p>
      SymQEMU: Compilation-based symbolic execution for binaries
    </p>
    
    <em>Proceedings of the Network and Distributed System Symposium (NDSS 2021),
    San Diego, CA, USA</em>
    
    
    <p>
      Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for software analysis and bug
      detection. Compilation-based symbolic execution is a recently proposed
      flavor that has been shown to improve the performance of symbolic
      execution significantly when source code is available. We demonstrate a
      novel technique to enable compilation-based symbolic execution of binaries
      (i.e., without the need for source code). Our system, SymQEMU, builds on
      top of QEMU, modifying the intermediate representation of the target
      program before translating it to the host architecture. This enables
      SymQEMU to compile symbolic-execution capabilities into binaries and reap
      the associated performance benefits while maintaining architecture
      independence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We present our approach and implementation, and we show that it
      outperforms the state-of-the-art binary symbolic executors S2E and QSYM
      with statistical significance; on some benchmarks, it even achieves better
      performance than the source-based SymCC. Moreover, our tool has found a
      previously unknown vulnerability in the well-tested libarchive library,
      demonstrating its utility in testing real-world software.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    SymQEMU is a fast symbolic execution engine for binaries. On this page, we
    provide its source code, the raw results of the experiments described in the
    paper, and instructions how you can replicate those experiments yourself.
  </p>

  <h2>Code</h2>

  <p>
    SymQEMU is available
    on <a href="https://github.com/eurecom-s3/symqemu">GitHub</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Experiments</h2>

  <p>
    In the paper, we describe three sets of experiments: we first benchmark
    SymQEMU with Google FuzzBench, then we run it on real-world software, and
    finally we perform a benchmark comparison during concolic execution of fixed
    paths. This section describes how to replicate our experiments, and provides
    links to our results.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        FuzzBench (see the <a href="http://s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/2020-05-24-symqemu.zip">report</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
        We will share our integration scripts shortly; they're being cleaned up
        to obtain SymQEMU and its dependencies from the new public repository.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Real-world software</p>

      <p>
        For the analysis of real-world software we used the same setup as in the
        <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/tools/symbolic_execution/symcc.html">evaluation of SymCC</a>. The binaries for SymQEMU,
        QSYM and S2E were plain builds without any instrumentation. SymQEMU was
        run via SymCC's fuzzing helper by prefixing the target command
        with <tt>/path/to/symqemu-x86_64</tt>. For the S2E analysis, we created
        a default project, then enabled the <tt>FunctionModels</tt> plugin and
        activated the option <tt>generateOnStateFork</tt> in
        the <tt>TestCaseGenerator</tt> plugin; coverage was evaluated
        with <tt>afl-showmap</tt> at the end of the analysis, using the same
        AFL-instrumented binaries as with the hybrid fuzzers.

      </p>

      <p>
        After the analysis of real-world software described above, we randomly
        collected 1,000 generated test cases per open-source target. We ran
        SymQEMU, QSYM and SymCC on each of those inputs, recording the time
        spent in execution and SMT solving, respectively, as per the logging
        output from the QSYM backend.

<p>In the Unabomber Manifesto, Section 212 always remained unfulfilling to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would society EVENTUALLY develop again toward an industrial-technological form? Maybe, but there is no use in worrying about it, since we can’t predict or control events 500 or 1,000 years in the future. Those problems must be dealt with by the people who will live at that time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That issue is why the “Freedom Club” revolution isn’t appealing. Genies do not go back in boxes. Similar to the communist manifesto, while problems are correctly identified, the solution leaves something to be desired.</p>

<hr>


<p>Ran Prieur takes technology and <a href="https://www.ranprieur.com/tech.html">breaks it down</a> in a more nuanced way than I think about it. I’m going to focus on a single axis.</p>

<p>Compare Waymo to comma. In one, you need cooperation from a society, in the other you don’t. One is a complex system that depends on industry and loses it’s usefulness out of context. The other is a complex self contained system.</p>

<p>A woman in a forest can create a supercomputer. This computer is off the grid, will last for 40+ years, has petaflops of compute power, and is self repairing. It exists in harmony with nature. It is non-toxic.</p>

<p>The smartphone is a marvel. The network, a nightmare. As well as the society needed to produce it.</p>

<hr>


<p>If all our world died tomorrow, from COVID-22 or something, we would leave behind godshatter. Relics with untold power. Imagine finding all that’s left is a smartphone. Useless without a solar charger, but add one and it’s a most valuable relic. And if they downloaded wikipedia offline, the discovery of that phone will allow you to rebuild it. Can we bootstrap faster?</p>

<p>That’s godshatter of the information age. A handheld device that allowed you to breathe underwater. A phaser. A portable device that could construct houses. The doctor’s mobile emitter. A machine that pulls the water from the air. A handheld flying machine. An arc reactor. All ruined if you have to connect to WiFi.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Profits">Perhaps a replicator could make you god.</a></p>

<hr>


<p>Why does anyone want Waymo? We need to decentralize the world, not build brittle systems that leak power. A Waymo network can be used for evil if evil people are at the controls. The Bitcoin blockchain has no controls. Every gun fires when its owner pulls the trigger, owned by millions. We’d live in a better world if nuclear weapons weren’t possible, owned by tens.</p>

<p>Can we build technology without industry? I fantasize about living in a forest with my AI girlfriend while we probe the universe. <b>What pathetic losers are building Twitter and Facebook.</b> That’s practically industry without technology. And they have the nerve to call themselves technology companies.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this. Am I building technology to further centralize or decentralize power?</p>

<p>Power is beautiful. Using energy to create order is the highest calling of God. Energy use isn’t bad! Uniform rectangular buildings are bad. Industrial chemical factories are bad. Humans are good.</p>

<hr>


<p>I’ve been learning biology. It’s unreal how amazing the technology to build humans is. Only now are we close with our stack. Human DNA is 6 GB. That’s a DVD. In 1970, you couldn’t store 6GB. Today, I can copy it in seconds on my M1 SSD. That’s actually faster than nature.</p>

<p>Biology is non-toxic. Biology is efficient. Biology is beautiful. Biology is technology.</p>

<p>Biology is not centralized. Biology is not alien. Biology is not rectangular. Biology is not industrial.</p>

<hr>


<p>STOP BUILDING SHITTY TECHNOLOGY.</p>

<p>If it centralizes power, it’s bad. If it decentralizes power, it’s good. Build technology that is inextricable from its narrative. Build technology that will give us freedom, not enslavement.</p>

<p>One axis to consider. Does this centralize or decentralize power? The power itself is unstoppable. How we divide it is a choice.</p>

<hr>


<p>I wish I had a more concrete plan. But for the love of God, if you build technology, consider this axis. Build the wrong technology, and we will live in an eternal prison.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>Of all the projects I’ve made, I receive the most questions about the <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/ink">Ink programming language</a>. Most questions fall into three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why did you make a programming language?</li>
<li>I want to make my own programming language – any advice?</li>
<li>Why does Ink work the way it does?</li>
</ol>
<p>This post aims to answer questions (1) and (2) and provide some resources for you to get started on your own language. I think (3) is best left for its own, more technical post.</p>
<p>This post is organized into a few sections.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#why">Why should you?</a></li>
<li><a href="#design">Design</a></li>
<li><a href="#impl">Implementation</a></li>
<li><a href="#other">Other considerations</a></li>
<li><a href="#start">Start small, get creative, ask questions</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-should-you">Why should you?</h2>
<p>Making an interpreter for a new programming language is the most technically rewarding project I’ve worked on. It pushed my understanding of fundamental software concepts and helped me comprehend how a computer works at a deeper level.</p>
<p>Programming languages and compilers / interpreters can be black boxes for programmers starting out. They’re tools taken for granted, and you can write good software without necessarily worrying about how the languages and primitive tools you’re using work under the hood. But writing a programming language involves understanding the most meaty parts of the computing stack, from the CPU and memory up through the operating system, in-memory data structures, processes, threads, the stack, all the way up to libraries and applications. It’s the floodgate to the most interesting mathematics in computing – category theory and type systems, algebras, lots of applications of graph theory, complexity analysis, and more. <strong>Writing and studying programming languages, I found myself getting more familiar with both the mathematics and the mechanical underpinnings of how computers work.</strong></p>
<p>The project made me a better developer as a result, even if my day-to-day work rarely concerns programming language tooling or compiler writing.</p>
<p>A programming language also has lots of room for expansions, optimizations, and extra creativity even after the project’s version one is “finished”. If you design the initial implementation carefully, you can add new keywords, new features, optimizations, and tools to your language and interpreter / compiler incrementally over time. It’s easy to turn a language into a long-term project and creative outlet, and I’ve enjoyed expanding on my initial implementation while studying other languages after my version-one was complete.</p>
<h3 id="the-pl-world-is-broad-and-deep-pick-your-battles">The PL world is broad and deep; pick your battles</h3>
<p>Unlike some other areas of software that follow hype cycles, the programming language field has grown and deepened steadily and constantly for a long time in both academia and industry. There’s a <em>lot</em> of literature, research, prior art, and practical advice in the wild about a million different concepts that can be combined into a new language, and a million different variations on how to implement them.</p>
<p>Especially for a personal-project language, I think the most fruitful approach is to <strong>pick one or two interesting ideas from the archaeology of computing, and build a programming language that examines and expands on those ideas deeply</strong>, rather than try to build the One True Language that’s best at everything and combines the best features of all the languages. Not only is it impossible to make such a language for all use cases, I think that kind of mindset also slows down development, adds unnecessary work, and doesn’t give you the mental space to learn as much about a few interesting topics you might be interested in.</p>
<p>For example, you might be interested in functional programming and immutable data structures. You could try to build a language that’s designed around storing all state in immutable data structures, and study how such data structures can be optimized and manipulated efficiently in a compiler. Or maybe you’re interested in low-level C programming and systems languages, in which case you might try to build a scripting language whose primary goals include elegant interoperability with C APIs and binary interfaces.</p>
<p>Where you start also determines the challenges and tradeoffs you’ll contend with. You might have an easier time writing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> interpreter due to its simpler syntax, because it’s easy to parse compared to, say, a more complex syntax for a language with a static type system. However, Lisps tend to have semantics that are further-removed from the low-level machine code that runs, like closures. So you may trade off the ease of parsing with execution complexity.</p>
<p>Pick your battles carefully, and stick to a few core ideas that you want to study deeply.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>Before you write either an interpreter or a compiler, you need to <em>design</em> a language. You can spend time studying category theory and type systems and programming paradigms, but the best thing you can do for yourself at this stage is to study ideas from a wide breadth of programming languages. Don’t just limit yourself to “modern” languages like Rust and Python; reach back into computing history. There’s rich ideas to be reinvented and combined in interesting ways reaching back at least a century into computing and mathematics.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get stuck in the mental model of popular modern OOP-like languages (Python, Ruby, Swift, C++) and spend the most time in this phase designing <em>syntax</em>. But designing the <em>semantics</em> of the language is where you should spend the most of your time, because it’s where the language gets its “feel” and where you’ll learn the most. Semantics are also more difficult to change after the fact than syntax. Some questions to ask yourself, to start thinking about language semantics and ergonomics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What types does your language have? Is it checked at compile-time? Does it automatically convert between types as necessary?</li>
<li>What’s the top-level organizing unit of programs in your language? Languages commonly call this modules, packages, or libraries, but some languages may invent their own concept, like Rust <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/crates.html">Crates</a>.</li>
<li>How does the language deal with exceptional conditions, like a missing file, a network access error, or a divide-by-zero error? Do you treat errors like exceptions that bubble up through the call stack, or are errors treated like values, as in C and Go?</li>
<li>Does your language perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail recursion optimization</a>? Or do you provide native control-flow tools for looping, like <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops?</li>
<li>How much utility do you want to build into the language, as opposed to a standard library? C, for example, doesn’t know about strings – string semantics are provided by the C standard library. Maps and lists are fundamental language constructs in most high-languages, and not so in most low-level ones.</li>
<li>How does your language think about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management">allocating memory</a>? Is memory automatically allocated as needed? Does the developer need to write code to do so? Is it garbage-collected?</li>
</ul>
<p>To answer these questions, I think it’s most helpful to just get a taste of a variety of languages in the wild. Here’s a small starter set that I recommend you take a look at, and what ideas I personally found intriguing from each language or language family.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lua</strong>: a data structure called <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/2.5.html">tables</a>, Lua <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/9.1.html">couroutines</a>, using strings as byte slices, interoperability with C</li>
<li><strong>Scheme / Clojure</strong>: Metaprogramming with macros, homoiconicity, closures, control flow with recursion. Die-hard Common-Lispers may disagree, but Scheme and Clojure are the easiest languages in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> family of languages for me to learn. You should study at least one kind of Lisp.</li>
<li><strong>Go</strong>: structural typing with <a href="https://tour.golang.org/methods/9">interfaces</a>, concurrency with blocking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads">green threads</a></li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: callback-style concurrency and asynchronous programming, first-class functions, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop">event loop</a>, Promises</li>
<li><strong>Awk</strong>: Awk is a great example of a small, simple language optimized for one use case: manipulating text files and textual data. It’s very well designed for that workflow, and a inspiration for how effective a small, domain-specific language with simple semantics can be.</li>
<li><strong>APL</strong> / <strong>J</strong>: APL and J are both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming#Array_languages">array languages</a>, which is a fascinating family of languages well known for its brevity</li>
<li><strong>Ruby</strong>: syntax. Ruby’s well known for its super-flexible syntax, because it lends itself easily to DSLs based on Ruby, like ActiveRecord.</li>

<li><strong>Haskell</strong>: the type system and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism">parametric polymorphism</a>, variant types, partial application and function type syntax. Once you wrap your mind around it, Haskell is also a good place to start diving deeper into the kinds of elegant programs possible with functional programming.</li>

<p>Once you have a design for how a language should work and feel, you should first “test-drive” it to see how programs written in the language feel to use.</p>
<h3 id="test-drive">Test-drive</h3>
<p>In this phase, I usually keep a text document where I experiment with syntax by writing small programs in the new as-yet-nonexistent language. I write notes and questions for myself in comments in the code, and try to implement small algorithms and data structures like recursive mathematical functions, sorting algorithms, and small web servers. I usually hold myself to this stage until most of my questions about syntax and semantics are answered. I also use this phase to test my hypotheses about the core ideas behind the language design. If I designed a language around functional programming and asynchronous, event-driven concurrency, for example, I’d write some sample code in this phase to validate that those ideas combine well together, and lends itself to programs that I’d enjoy writing. If I’m proven wrong, I’ll update my assumptions or play around with the language design to reflect what I’ve learned.</p>
<p>This straw-man design phase is a quick way to make sure that the language you’ve invented in your head could work well for the kinds of programs you want to write, without having to write much implementation.</p>

<div id="introduction">
<h2><a href="#id8">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Back in 2018, we compared empirically the performance overheads of Go
and C++ with regards to the low-level calling convention: to <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-argument-passing-in-go-and-cpp.html">pass
arguments</a>,
to <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-multiple-return-values-in-go-and-cpp.html">return multiple values</a>, and
<a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-errors-vs-exceptions-in-go-and-cpp.html">when propagating exceptions</a>.</p>
<p>Those results were obtained with Go 1.10 and Clang 6.0. Since then,
compilers have evolved and we are now running with Go 1.15 and Clang
11.0. Have the findings changed since&nbsp;then?</p>
<p>The question of interest&nbsp;was:</p>
<blockquote>
What is cheaper: handling exceptions via <code>panic</code> / <code>recover</code>, or
passing and testing error results with <code>if err := <span>...;</span> err != nil {
return err }</code>?</blockquote>
<p>In fact, as we will see below, the conclusions are stronger today than
they were two years&nbsp;ago.</p>
</div>
<div id="methodology">
<h2><a href="#id9">Methodology</a></h2>
<p>The reader is first invited to familiarize themselves with the
discussion of Go’s low-level calling convention as compared with C++’s
in the previous chapters of this series: <a href="https://dr-knz.net/go-calling-convention-x86-64.html">as of 2018</a> and <a href="https://dr-knz.net/go-calling-convention-x86-64-2020.html">as of 2020</a>. The 2018
analysis is still largely valid in 2020—the C++ calling convention did
not change, and Go introduced a few optimizations on the
implementation of <code>defer</code>.</p>
<p>There were three analyses&nbsp;previously:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to measure argument passing and returning multiple values, we will
use exactly the same methodology as the previous two analyses <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-argument-passing-in-go-and-cpp.html">here</a> and
<a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-multiple-return-values-in-go-and-cpp.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>These analyses contain their benchmark source code, which is also
provided at <a href="https://github.com/knz/callbench/tree/2018-results">github.com/knz/callbench</a>. The
derivation of plots was entirely automated via <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a>,
which we can thus&nbsp;re-run.</p>
</li>
<li><p>for the <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-errors-vs-exceptions-in-go-and-cpp.html">third analysis</a>,
which measures and compares the cost of error returns with that of
throwing and catching exceptions, we are going to reuse the same
methodology, but a diffence source code for the benchmark. The new
source code has been uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/knz/callbench/tree/2020-results">github.com/knz/callbench</a> as
well. This difference is motivated&nbsp;below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will also use an upgraded benchmark system, configured as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>CPU</span>: <span>AMD</span> Ryzen 7 3950X 3700.07MHz Family=0x17 Model=0x71&nbsp;Stepping=0</li>
<li><span>OS</span>: FreeBSD 13.0-<span>CURRENT</span>&nbsp;r366805</li>
<li>go version 1.15.5&nbsp;freebsd/amd64</li>
<li>C++ FreeBSD clang version 11.0.0&nbsp;(llvmorg-11.0.0-0-g176249bd673)</li>
</ul>

<div id="experimental-results">
<h2><a href="#id10">Experimental&nbsp;results</a></h2>
<p>All the generated data files and Jupyter notebooks <a href="https://dr-knz.net/go-errors-vs-exceptions-2020/notebook.zip">can be downloaded
here</a>.</p>
<div id="findings-for-argument-passing-and-returning-multiple-values">
<h3><a href="#id11">Findings for argument passing and returning multiple&nbsp;values</a></h3>
<p>Here the findings are largely unchanged from 2018: for the selected
benchmark code, the code generation by our selected compilers has not
changed&nbsp;significantly.</p>
<p>Only the new hardware <span>CPU</span> influences the measurements: the new <span>CPU</span> has
a higher clock frequency than previously, so for an equivalent
mix of instructions we expect and observe a 10-40% raw performance
improvement. Additionally, the Ryzen 7 3950X architecture has a
somewhat more powerful superscalar execution unit than the 1800X, and
is able to detect inter-instruction dependencies across more memory
accesses. This causes more measurements artifacts when the workload is
extremely small, and erases the performance differences between 1 and
5 function arguments or return&nbsp;values.</p>
<p>The main conclusions thus remain&nbsp;unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go uses memory to pass function arguments and return values. This
makes Go code perform about twice slower than equivalent C++ code on
function calls, where C++ compilers use register-based calling
conventions&nbsp;instead.</p>
<p>The particular <span>CPU</span> we used this year uses a micro-architecture able
to more aggressively optimize memory-heavy code, and so the Go
performance overhead relative to C++ is erased for very small
functions; unfortunately, these optimizations become ineffective with
more realistic, wider function&nbsp;bodies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In Go, memory is used for return values even when there is just one
or two words worth of data. In these cases, a C++ compiler also
typically uses registers. This choice in the Go compiler is
unfortunate, as it mandates copying the return values through memory
at every call level when functions return each other’s value in a
cascade. This cost thus multiplies the overhead of the memory-based
return by the call depth, in a way that does not occur, or much
less, with a typical C++ code&nbsp;generator.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As previously, we can discuss what is the proportion of function
calls relative to other types of code. Arguably, in
computation-heavy algorithms, functions often get inlined so that calls
disappear. In that case, it is possible for the Go compiler,
assisted by the <span>CPU</span> micro-architecture, to reach similar instruction
throughputs as the equivalent C++&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>However, we can also point out that Go still promotes the use of
dynamic dispatch (via interface methods) as an idiomatic approach to
software design. For example, string composition via
<code>bytes.Buffer</code> interfaces with the <code>fmt</code> packages using
interface calls (<code>io.Writer</code>), and the proportion of
cross-interface calls is relatively high in that case compared to
the computation&nbsp;load.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The reader is invited to review the more detailed summaries from the
previous analyses, where the situation is presented in more&nbsp;detail.</p>
</div>
<div id="measuring-errors-vs-panics-reminder-and-code-tweak">
<h3><a href="#id12">Measuring errors vs panics: reminder and code&nbsp;tweak</a></h3>
<p>This analysis calls for a benchmark which performs a “unit of work” in
a loop, with the size of the loop configurable as&nbsp;“workload”.</p>
<p>We are modeling the extremely common case where any error inside a
unit of work aborts the entire workload: the error may or may not be
generated inside the unit of work, but needs only be detected once for
the entire outer workload&nbsp;loop.</p>
<p>In Go, we originally used the following code as&nbsp;benchmark:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>arg</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Unlikely error case.</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>errObj</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// Common non-error case.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>id</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>),</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>workErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>n</span> <span>int</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>work</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>val</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>42</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>+=</span> <span>val</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>n</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In this code, <code>leafErr</code> represents the “unit of work”, where errors
can originate. The <code>workErr</code> represents the main work computation,
where <code>leafErr</code> is called&nbsp;repeatedly.</p>
<p>(The <code>go:noinline</code> annotation is explained in more detail in the previous&nbsp;analysis.)</p>
<p>In the case where the <code>error</code> return is used, we need to check the
<code>err</code> return on every iteration of the loop. If we used exception
instead, we could factor the exception check out of the&nbsp;loop:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>workExc</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>res</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Exception check factored out of the loop:</span>
  <span>defer</span> <span>func</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>r</span> <span>:=</span> <span>recover</span><span>();</span> <span>r</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}()</span>
  <span>// Main workload follows:</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>n</span> <span>int</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>work</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>+=</span> <span>leafExc</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>n</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>leafExc</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>arg</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Unlikely error case.</span>
    <span>panic</span><span>(</span><span>errObj</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// Common non-error case.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>id</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>(The accompanying C++ code is implemented similarly, using
<code><span>std::tuple</span></code> for error returns and <code>try/catch/throw</code> for&nbsp;exceptions.)</p>
<p>Just looking at the shape of the source code, we can already suspect
the findings that follow: there is less work inside the workload loop
when using exceptions. So as the workload increases, the cost of
setting up the “catch” logic gets&nbsp;amortized.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is exactly what was observed in 2018. (<a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-errors-vs-exceptions-in-go-and-cpp.html#summary-and-conclusions">Summary and
conclusions
here.</a>)</p>
<p>However, when running the same experiment in 2020 on our new test
machine, with Go 1.15, the measurements are all over the place, the
results appear chaotic, and the difference we observed last time is
nearly entirely erased. What&nbsp;happened?</p>
<p>It turns out that the new <span>CPU</span> used to run the benchmark really has a
much better micro-architecture. It is able to peek through the call
from the <code>work</code> function to the <code>leaf</code> function, analyze
inter-instruction dependencies across the call, and fully pipeline the
processing of the <code>leaf</code> function across multiple iterations of the
<code>work</code> loop. This effectively invalidates the model we used: in a
realistic application, there is enough complexity in the code inside
the “workload”, when it contains function calls, that the <span>CPU</span> cannot
pipeline loop&nbsp;iterations.</p>
<p>To restore a valid model, we should thus tweak the benchmark program
by adding just enough additional complexity in the “unit of
work”. Here, we achieve that by adding just one extra level of
intermediate&nbsp;call:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>arg</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Unlikely error case.</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>errObj</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// Common non-error case.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>id</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>),</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>workErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>n</span> <span>int</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>work</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>val</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>intermediateErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>42</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>+=</span> <span>val</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>n</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>(Likewise for the benchmark using&nbsp;exceptions.)</p>
<p>This program, at least on the <span>CPU</span> considered, is “complex” enough to
stop the superscalar unit from peeking across the function call. The
resulting code then behaves regularly in&nbsp;measurements.</p>
</div>
<div id="findings-for-error-returns-vs-exceptions">
<h3><a href="#id13">Findings for error returns vs&nbsp;exceptions</a></h3>
<p>The Jupiter notebook for this experiment contains the data processing steps
and the logic to generate comparison plots, with some detailed analysis
of the intermediate&nbsp;results.</p>
<p>The key result is the&nbsp;following:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://dr-knz.net/go-errors-vs-exceptions-2020/err-comparison.png"></p><p>What we see&nbsp;here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For an equivalent workload (e.g. 1000 “units of work”), the Go code
is 40% slower than the equivalent C++ code. This is generally
expected as Go is much more memory-heavy than&nbsp;C++.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Regardless of the language considered, the cost of setting up an
exception “catch” can be reliably amortized across an entire
workload: the performance of code using exception-based error
reporting asymptotically converges to become the same as code using
no error handling&nbsp;whatsoever.</p>
<p>In comparison, code that propagates errors as return values is
systematically slower as the workload increases; between 1-3% for
C++, up to 4-10% for&nbsp;Go.</p>
<p>This is one of the two main&nbsp;results.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The cost of setting up an exception “catch” is not entirely
negligible. Back in 2018, the mandatory fixed cost of the <code>defer</code>
setup and testing <code>recover()</code> in the <code>work</code> function was 50ns;
such that it took about 500 nanoseconds worth of “workload” to fully
offset this one-time&nbsp;cost.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>NixOS is a Linux distribution built from the ground up to make it easy to deploy
services. Tailscale is a peer-to-peer VPN built to make it easy to connect
machines. In this article I will show how to set up a Java Edition
Minecraft server (exposed only over Tailscale) in ten minutes on Digital Ocean.</p>
<p>Before you begin this guide, you’ll need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> account</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/">Minecraft</a> Java Edition account</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also need <a href="https://tailscale.com/start">a Tailscale account</a>. You can
make a free solo account using an <code>@gmail.com</code> address.</p>
<p>In NixOS one of the core principles is that the entire system is configurable
with a modular language called Nix. This allows you to configure everything
using a common syntax so you don’t need to remember every configuration file
format for every service you use. As such, you can configure an entire system
from a single file.</p>
<p>Let’s make a new configuration file called <code>host.nix</code> and set up a system that
has Tailscale start up on boot:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix"><span>{</span> <span>config</span><span>,</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span> <span>}:</span>

<span>{</span>
  <span># make the tailscale command usable to users</span>
  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span> <span>];</span>

  <span># enable the tailscale service</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This will have Tailscale start up, however to authenticate to Tailscale we need
to take a few more steps. First, head to the <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/authkeys">Pre-Auth Keys page in the admin
panel</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/preauth-key.png" alt="The key creation screen from the Tailscale adminUI"></p>
<p>Create a new one-time use key and then copy it to your notes. We will use it
below.</p>
<p>With this key we can write a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files#the-service-section">systemd oneshot
unit</a>
that will log in to Tailscale using this key.</p>
<p>A systemd oneshot job is something that systemd expects to be run once as
opposed to being a persistent service. The above Digital Ocean link explains
this in more detail.</p>
<p>Copy this configuration below the <code>services.tailscale.enable</code> line in your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>

  <span># create a oneshot job to authenticate to Tailscale</span>

</span><span>      </span><span>${</span><span>tailscale</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/tailscale up -authkey tskey-examplekeyhere
</span><span>    ''</span><span>;</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Make sure to replace <code>tskey-examplekeyhere</code> with the key you got from the Admin
panel. Without this key your VPS cannot connect to Tailscale.</p>
<p>Now that we have Tailscale configured to authenticate and connect to your
network, let’s enable the lightweight NixOS firewall so that we can only allow
Minecraft traffic over Tailscale. The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-firewall">NixOS
manual</a> has more
details, but at a high level we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the firewall</li>
<li>Mark tailscale0 as a trusted interface</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to Tailscale’s UDP port (don’t worry,
they will be rejected if they are not a part of your network)</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to your server’s SSH port (this will
also work over Tailscale, but having it exposed over the public internet can
help when debugging issues that happen before tailscale starts)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can do that with the following configuration added to the end of your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>networking</span><span>.</span><span>firewall</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span># enable the firewall</span>
    <span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

    <span># always allow traffic from your Tailscale network</span>
    <span>trustedInterfaces</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"tailscale0"</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># allow the Tailscale UDP port through the firewall</span>
    <span>allowedUDPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>port</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># allow you to SSH in over the public internet</span>
    <span>allowedTCPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>22</span> <span>];</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can configure the Minecraft server. The <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=20.09&amp;show=services.minecraft-server.dataDir&amp;from=0&amp;size=30&amp;sort=relevance&amp;query=services.minecraft-server">Minecraft
options</a>
expose a number of settings you can use to configure your server however you
want. Please note that you <em>must</em> set the EULA agreement to <code>true</code> yourself. The
Minecraft server is a closed-source program, so you must give NixOS permission
to use closed source packages.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>minecraft-server</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

      <span># This password can be used to administer your minecraft server.</span>
      <span># Exact details as to how will be explained later. If you want</span>
      <span># you can replace this with another password.</span>
      <span>"rcon.password"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"hunter2"</span><span>;</span>
      <span>level-seed</span> <span>=</span> <span>"10292992"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>};</span>
  <span>};</span>

  <span># enable closed source packages such as the minecraft server</span>
  <span>nixpkgs</span><span>.</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>allowUnfree</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we have everything we need. We set up Tailscale, we configured an automatic
login to Tailscale, we set up the firewall so that it rejects all incoming
traffic (except for traffic from you Tailscale network) and finally we
configured the Minecraft server so that your can play in survival mode.</p>
<p>Now let’s get this put into a new Digital Ocean server. Open a new text editor
window and create a file called <code>user-data.yaml</code>. Copy this template into it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>#cloud-config</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>write_files</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>/etc/nixos/host.nix<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>permissions</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"0644"</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>content</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>|
</span><span>      { pkgs, config, ... }:</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>{<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>}<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>runcmd</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- curl<span> </span>https<span>:</span>//raw.githubusercontent.com/elitak/nixos-infect/master/nixos-infect<span> </span>|<span> </span>PROVIDER=digitalocean<span> </span>NIXOS_IMPORT=./host.nix<span> </span>NIX_CHANNEL=nixos<span>-20.09</span><span> </span>bash<span> </span><span>2</span>&gt;<span>&amp;1</span><span> </span>|<span> </span>tee<span> </span>/tmp/infect.log<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>At the time of this article being written, Digital Ocean doesn’t have a NixOS
image by default. So we will use
<a href="https://github.com/elitak/nixos-infect">nixos-infect</a> in order
to automatically replace an Ubuntu installation with a NixOS one. We are also
going to use it to automatically configure the server with the <code>host.nix</code> file
we just made.</p>
<p>Copy the contents of <code>host.nix</code> into the <code>content</code> value of the <code>write_files</code>
block. Be sure to indent the file by four spaces so that it will work as yaml
user data. When you are done you should have a file that looks something like
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Xe/b2f26ae62e7ff6f6030e4a94ed3e2707">this reference file</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you have the cloud config, let’s launch the server in the cloud.</p>
<p>Open the Digital Ocean control panel and click Create and then click Droplets.
Choose an Ubuntu 20.04 image and a plan with at least 4 GB of ram (the Minecraft
server needs a lot of resources, unfortunately).</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/droplet-tier.png" alt="The droplet config using Ubuntu 20.04 and a droplet with 4 GB ofram"></p>
<p>Then choose a datacenter near you and enable the IPv6 and User Data options.
Paste the contents of your <code>user-data.yaml</code> file into the text box that shows
up. Choose your SSH key in the list of SSH keys that shows up and then give the
droplet a hostname, such as “minecraft”. If you want you can enable backups.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/user-data.png" alt="The droplet user data pasted into the user datafield"></p>
<p>Once you have everything set up, click the large green button labeled Create
Droplet. It may take up to 10 minutes to install and configure NixOS, however
you will be able to see the machine in your Tailscale network once everything is
done setting up. Go grab a cup of your favorite caffeinated beverage.</p>
<p>After it shows up in your network list, you can fire up your Minecraft
client and connect to your new server. You may need to select a slightly older
version of Minecraft if the in-game UI tells you to use an older version of
Minecraft. You can adjust the Minecraft version you are running using
<a href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754852-Changing-game-versions-">the launcher UI</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/host-info.png" alt="The host information in the Tailscale controlpanel"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/server-connect.png" alt="The minecraft server connectionUI"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/minecraft-world.png" alt="An in-game screenshot of the author’s Minecraft avatar in a forestbiome"></p>
<p>If you want to administer your minecraft server, you can add the <code>mcrcon</code>
package to your system config next to the <code>tailscale</code> package:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>;</span> <span>[</span> <span>tailscale</span> <span>mcrcon</span> <span>];</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then you can connect to the Minecraft server command line with this command:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ mcrcon -p hunter2
</code></pre><p>If you adjusted the rcon password above, you will need to adjust this command to
include that new password. From there you can change gamemodes, adjust the time
of day and anything else you want.</p>
<p>Once <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1084/sharing">node sharing</a> is generally
available, you can use it to invite people you trust to your server. (Node
sharing is still in private beta.) Generate an invite link in the admin panel
and they can use that to join your adventure.</p>
<p>If you want to make configuration changes to your server after you provision it,
edit the <code>/etc/nixos/host.nix</code> file in your favorite text editor (such as nano).
The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#ch-configuration">NixOS
manual</a>
should help guide you if you want to install more services (such as backups
using <a href="https://christine.website/blog/borg-backup-2021-01-09">borgbackup</a> or
anything else listed in the <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options">options</a>). The
cloud’s the limit!</p>

January 19, 2021 | https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/why-endbasic.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/why-endbasic.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div>
              
              <article><p>If you have been following this blog or my social profiles for the last year, you are probably aware that <a href="https://jmmv.dev/tags/endbasic">I have been working on something called EndBASIC</a>. You also probably know that this is a retro-looking BASIC interpreter written in Rust that <a href="https://endbasic.jmmv.dev/">happens to run on the web</a>. And if you know those two things, you are probably wondering, like some of my friends do: why am I <em>wasting</em> time developing such a useless project? <strong>Because.</strong></p>
<p>No, seriously, because. It is obvious that the EndBASIC language and environment will not gain massive traction, and I do not have any interest in inventing a perfect new language (because, let’s face it, we already have one and it’s called Rust 😉).</p>
<p>So, then, why do I spend any of my scarce free time on this project? If you must know:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s a fun thing to do.</strong> Just like some people enjoy watching TV shows, playing video games, or crafting wood, I enjoy programming. It feels like a game. And EndBASIC <em>itself</em> could be seen as a game at this point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s a form of art.</strong> Developing a personal project is a different experience than developing a work project. I can spend all the time in the world polishing the same turd over and over again, playing with different ideas until things look best.</p>
<p>If you have ever considered that programming may be art, then this kind of side project is where you crank your craft up a notch. As just one example, working on EndBASIC’s tests made me come up with the idea of <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/builder-pattern-for-tests.html">using the builder pattern for tests</a> and it seemed to have been well-received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s a learning experience.</strong> In writing EndBASIC, I’m playing with Rust. I strongly believe that Rust is one of the languages of the future and it’s the language that makes me say “aha, I agree” at every corner I turn. Yet, I haven’t mastered it. Working on Rust projects lets me learn a bunch of stuff about the language that will be helpful in future endeavors. And it’s not only about Rust per se: <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/rust-into-trait.html">learning the idioms</a> used in this language can <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-protect-the-data.html">help write better code</a> in any other.</p>
<p>Another example is that I also got to learn about WASM, targeting the browser from a “native” app and making it work on various different devices. This led me down the path of async programming and how to interact with Javascript in that context—which was <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/05/bridging-the-web-gap-endbasic.html">a painful but eventually-gratifying obstacle</a> to overcome.</p>
<p>And yet another example is that I also got to set up continuous <em>deployment</em>, first via Travis CI and then via the new GitHub Actions coolness. This, in turn, gave me ammo to write up more <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/github-actions-code-health.html">interesting</a> <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/do-not-submit.html">stuff</a> in this blog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Copying an “old technology” is irrelevant.</strong> Yes, BASIC is not the language of the future (although… VB.NET users may disagree with you because it supports, I don’t know, thousands of businesses?). But that doesn’t matter. Only 5,000 lines of the codebase (about 30% of the total) are devoted to parsing the language, and most of those lines are unit tests anyway. If I wanted to change the language per se to offer a more “modern” experience with things like first-order functions, objects, etc. it’d be <em>trivial</em> to do so.</p>
<p>To be clear, I have no interest in building my own language as mentioned in the opening, but having worked on the <em>building blocks</em> of a real language is enlightening, and having those building blocks around will surely come in handy in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So what happened to the <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/hello-endbasic.html">original goal</a> of teaching programming to my kids via this project? Well… uhh… let’s say I’ve gotten distracted having fun by myself rather than actually getting them in front of this. I should get back to that goal after all the recent improvements to make the environment more usable and seeing if they care at all.</p>
<p>But yes. For the most part, EndBASIC is a crazy/useless language. Although… ~50 other people currently disagree with the thought of this being useless if <a href="https://github.com/jmmv/endbasic/">GitHub stars</a> mean anything at all 😉 If you are one of those ~50, thank you! And if you are not, join me in the craze?</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Having an agile team is less about the tool you use. It’s more about the people and how your agile team is structured.</p><p>The internet is filled with posts telling you about how agile is great and how everyone should adopt it for their team. But there’s very little information on how to <em>do it</em>. As a result, many teams go through a tiresome journey filled with dead-ends, mistakes, and a series of "<em>this is pointless</em>" frustrated cry.</p><p>After talking to several development teams and helping them streamline their development process with <a href="https://zepel.io/">Zepel</a>, I’ve come across three common team structures.</p><p>In this post, I’ll share with you all three agile team structures, the challenges they cause, and what you can do to improve your team.</p><p>Let’s jump in.</p><hr><h2 id="team-structure-1-siloed-agile-team">Team Structure #1: Siloed Agile Team</h2><p>Nobody wants a siloed team. However, it’s easy to be trapped by <a href="https://zepel.io/features/sprints/">sprints</a> and <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/scrum/daily-scrum-standup/">daily standup meetings</a>, and assume that your team is agile.</p><p>A siloed organization looks a lot like this:</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png" alt="Example structure of siloed teams in agile software development" srcset="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png 600w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png 1600w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Siloed-Agile-Team.png 2064w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An example structure of how siloed teams look like</figcaption></figure><p>For most teams, a siloed structure consists of:</p><ul><li>a dedicate team for the app that involves building all the customer-facing functionalities,</li><li>an operations team that’s responsible for infrastructure and security, and sometimes</li><li>internal tools team that builds special tools for internal use.</li></ul><p><strong>The common problems you’ll encounter in this type of team structure are:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>App team vs Operations team:</strong> Both teams can end up becoming frustrated when server allocation becomes a bottleneck for deployment. This is especially common in a fast-growing organization with high customer demand and tight deadlines.<br></li><li><strong>Language barriers:</strong> This can often be seen between all the teams especially if one of them uses a specific language that the other can’t ingest easily. Too much time gets spent on trivial problems and forces teams to employ “<em>workarounds</em>” too often.<br></li><li><strong>Nobody is held accountable for tech debts:</strong> The app team continues to build features as the product manager prioritizes them based on customer requests. But very little importance is given to tech debts and bugs. This hinders the progress of the overall business as the end customer’s experience gets impacted.</li></ol><p><strong>What is the root cause for the problems in a siloed agile team?</strong></p><p>If you look at any organization that has a siloed team structure, you’ll notice the team has a departmental structure. They usually have a set of rigid responsibilities that doesn’t leave any room for cross-functional collaboration.</p><p>This rigid departmental structure can lead to incomplete infrastructure, a steady stream of bugs reported by customers, and functionality gaps that each team thought the other was working on.</p><p>Once your team notices all these problems, they’ll be under immense pressure to perform as quickly as possible because the reported bugs never seem to end. This desire to hit due dates will lead to fewer risks being taken.</p><hr><h2 id="team-structure-2-matrix-teams">Team Structure #2: Matrix Teams</h2><p>As a result of trying to improve the siloed structure, teams end up with a matrix-like team structure.</p><p>This is how a matrix agile team structure looks like:</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Matrix-Team-Structure.png" alt="Example of matrix team structure in agile software development" srcset="https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Matrix-Team-Structure.png 600w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Matrix-Team-Structure.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/agile/content/images/2020/08/Matrix-Team-Structure.png 1042w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Example of matrix team structure in agile software development</figcaption></figure><p>This agile teams structure includes:</p><ul><li>Multiple product teams, each with web developers, backend engineers, UI and UX person, and a scrum master.</li><li>A maintenance team that takes ownership of all services in production and ensured all bugs get squished as they came up.</li><li>An operations team that handles all infrastructure related requests.</li></ul><p>In first glance, you’d think this is a step in the right direction. After all, it solves the majority of the problems a siloed team had.</p><p>There’s a separate team in place that takes ownership of all the debts, product teams can move quickly and ship features faster, and developers worked close to each other with shared goals.</p><p><strong>However, there are still some hidden issues you’ll run into with this team structure.</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Getting maintenance team charged up and rally around a common goal becomes harder</strong>. At the end of the day, nobody wants their entire job to be just about the maintenance of someone else’s work.<br></li><li>Since the maintenance team worked on someone else’s work, they will first <strong>have to identify whose work they are fixing</strong> in case they needed help trying to understand the code.<br></li><li>Since everything falls on the maintenance teams in terms of maintaining quality and fixing bugs, it can lead to a <strong>lack of ownership of the quality of code within the product teams</strong>.<br></li><li>With several product teams cranking out one feature after another, <strong>the burden on a single operations team is high</strong>.

However, you can follow some key principles when it comes to building an agile team and putting together a team structure.</p><p><strong>1. Remove or minimize dependencies between teams</strong></p><p>The more dependencies you have between teams, the more processes you’ll have put in place. The can lead to increased wait times, missed deadlines, and frustrations.</p><p>If you begin to see an increase in dependencies between two teams working on critical functions, you should try to empower the team with <a href="https://zepel.io/agile-tools/">agile tools</a> or even consider combining the teams into a squad or a tribe.</p><p><strong>2. Optimize for understanding instead of processes</strong></p><p>When things go sideways or “<em>it doesn’t feel right</em>”, most teams look to impose rigid processes and optimize every interaction. This comes from the assumption that everyone is an expert when it comes to collaboration.</p><p>Instead, it’s better to optimize for understanding. Every person has a unique way of working and grasp information at different levels. Enabling your team to understand all the information at their disposal and the goal needed to achieve can help your team deliver a higher quality of work.</p><p><strong>3. Alignment is essential if you want to give autonomy</strong></p><p>Every team wants autonomy to work the way they want to. It promotes creativity and enables them to do better work. However, autonomy requires greater alignment towards the priorities. And it requires accountability to delivering value in short increments.</p><p><strong>4. Loosely define roles, but hold them accountable to a goal</strong></p><p>The first instinct for growing teams is to define strict roles &amp; responsibilities. It starts with the goal of holding each member accountable.</p><p>Instead of defining strict roles, define them loosely. Often, strict definition brings rigidity and narrows down the team’s focus on one solution.

			<p>The world is becoming more and more aware of privacy and concerns around it. We are trying to limit sharing our personal information online, but how often are we protecting one of our most private information: <strong>our legal address</strong>?</p>

<h3 id="your-address-is-private">Your address is Private</h3>
<p>Think about it, how often do you share your legal address in the world?</p>

<p>From online shopping, to delivery like food, grocery or selling second hand goods in marketplace… how many entities did you share your address with in the last one year? My bad, one year is too long. How about last one month?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your address information is personally identifiable information (Private Information), and shouldn’t be accessible by entities who don’t really need it.</p>
</blockquote>

<em>Your legal address is Private information.</em>
</center>


<p>From group chats, to online portals; from free signups to lucky draws; from resumes to job applications; from facebook marketplace to craigslist we keep sharing our address with strangers on untrusted platforms.</p>

<p>We consistently hear news about data leaks from poorly coded applications that exposed your address to malicious actors. Many online applications sell your legal address information to third parties for profit, or worse knowingly for the purpose of spam, phishing or hijacking your identity online or in the real world.</p>

<p>Despite this, we never we ask ourselves, why are we sharing the most private information with everyone?</p>

<p>Well, the reason is simple: there hasn’t been a platform until now which allowed users to <strong>“create addresses”</strong>. This is a new concept that most of us never thought of, but subconsciously have always wished it existed.</p>

<p>Point addresses are not legal addresses. They are mapping to a Point in the world named by you. You can create as many Point Addresses as you may want instantly.</p>

<p>You can call the location where you want deliveries as <strong>·happy-home-us·</strong> or <strong>·delivery2me-us·</strong> or anything else of your choice, and Point it precisely to the location in the real world with description and photos if you wish to add.</p>

<p>When you create a Point Address, you have complete control over it. From updating the Point itself such as changing its name, updating Point’s location, to its visibility (Public or Private), you have full control over your Point Address.</p>

<h3 id="private-protected-and-public-points">Private, Protected and Public Points</h3>
<p>With Point, you can mark your addresses one of the three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Private</strong>: The Point Address is only available to you, and nobody else.</li>
  <li><strong>Protected</strong>: Only those people who know the Point Address, either via link, or by name can search for it in Point Search.</li>
  <li><strong>Public</strong>: Points that are Public show on Explore and can be found by anyone looking for Points in that area. Good example of the Public points are to allow Business and Service Providers to share their location with people looking for the services.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        <p>Release versioning might seem like a boring topic. Honestly, it should be. There should only be a couple of right ways to do versioning, and each project should pick one of the agreed-upon methods (SemVer<sup id="fnref:semver"><a href="#fn:semver">1</a></sup>, CalVer<sup id="fnref:calver"><a href="#fn:calver">2</a></sup>, etc.) that makes the most sense to the project. We don’t live in this ideal world unfortunately and many projects choose to deviate from versioning standards. I’m not here to say they are wrong, but I’d like to discuss what they might be missing out on.</p>

<p>Along with a typical release version, it is useful to include extra metadata, such as the Git revision, <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/gnu-build-id-for-firmware">GNU Build ID</a>, build timestamp, and other related items. With all of this in place, both machines and developers can quickly hone in on <em>exactly</em> which release is running on a given device, what the source is, where it came from, and how to rebuild it if necessary.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this article, we are going to talk through all the various pieces of metadata to be included in your firmware binaries, debug symbols, and build artifacts so that developers and machines can quickly and easily know <strong>exactly</strong> which build is which and how to fetch associated files for the debug, test, and release pipeline.</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

<p>This post builds upon many of our previous posts and brings all the relevant information together under one post.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Versions don’t exist just to differentiate one release from another. They serve other purposes! Such purposes include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Providing an ordering to versions (e.g. 1.1 &gt; 1.0)</li>
  <li>Encode compatibility information, breaking changes, and upgrade/downgrade restrictions</li>
  <li>Reference a specific revision of the software</li>
  <li>Reference a specific build of the software</li>
  <li>Tell users when <em>major</em> changes took place (e.g. Windows 8 → Windows 10)</li>
</ul>

<p>If a project chooses to use just a Git SHA, or a build timestamp, or a random ASCII name, then many or all of the above benefits that versions typically provide are lost. We can do better!</p>

<p>Throughout this article, we’ll talk about the various pieces that I believe provide a holistic picture of the software that is packaged into a release and running on a device. First, let’s talk about Semantic Versioning.</p>

<h2 id="semantic-versioning">Semantic Versioning</h2>

<p><a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank">Semantic Versioning</a>, or SemVer for short, is likely the most popular versioning scheme in software today. It was built to solve the versioning story for a single package, but also how a single package interoperates with dependencies.</p>

<p>SemVer uses a sequence of three digits, MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, and also allows for an optional pre-release tag and build metadata tag. Altogether, a version looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-[pre-release-tag]+[build-meta-tag]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH digits are sorted numerically (1.1.11 &gt; 1.1.10), the pre-release tag is sorted alphanumerically (rc &gt; beta &gt; alpha), and the build-meta-tag is ignored completely when determining sort order or equality (1.1.1+abcd == 1.1.1+efgh). Each should be incremented when the following occurs, according to the spec:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MAJOR when you make incompatible API changes</li>
  <li>MINOR when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner</li>
  <li>PATCH when you make backward-compatible bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<p>Although it might seem pedantic, let’s dig into when a release lead might want to increment each field for a firmware project.</p>

<h3 id="incrementing-major">Incrementing MAJOR</h3>

<p>Example: 1.0.0 → 2.0.0</p>

<p>For most firmware projects, the MAJOR field might <em>never</em> be incremented. If I’m writing firmware for an nRF52, and it is the only MCU in my hardware product, it doesn’t have to interact or communicate with many other pieces of software or hardware, so there shouldn’t be any incompatible API changes!</p>

<p>There is one occassion where I would seriously consider incrementing the MAJOR field, and that is when our firmware becomes <strong>incompatible with a version of itself</strong>. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Normal software packages can be updated at any time, with almost no repercussions. If incompatibility arises, just revert the change and continue. However, on firmware devices, the firmware updates itself. If there is an incompatibility, it might require a re-install, a factory reset, or in the worst of cases, the device might be bricked!</p>

<p>With firmware updates, you also can’t expect every device to install every single version (unless that is a hard requirement of the update flow). If you deploy version 1.0.0, version 1.1.0, and version 1.2.0, your firmware should be able to update from 1.0.0 → 1.2.0 and skip 1.1.0 entirely. If a user puts your device in their nightstand and pulls it out 6 months later, this is exactly what should happen.</p>

<p>However, keeping that backward compatibility can weigh down our firmware, especially if we need to keep migration code in our firmware. Migration code adds complexity, code space, and increases our QA test matrix dramatically.</p>

<p>Let’s take the Pebble Smartwatch firmware as an example. The Pebble 2.0.0 firmware was released in early 2014. Over the next year, we released versions all the way up to 2.9.1. Within all of these versions, we were changing <em>a lot</em> of stuff. We changed our file system (from Contiki’s Coffee<sup id="fnref:coffee"><a href="#fn:coffee">3</a></sup> to an internally built one), re-wrote persistent data structures that were stored on internal and external flash, and completely re-architected how we stored our BLE bonding information. All of these things were critical to the functionality of our firmware, and at no point could we lose any of this data.</p>

<p>Despite all of these changes, a user could update directly from 2.0.0 to 2.9.1, and the boot-up sequence on the latter firmware would perform all the migrations (that was quite a long boot-up time).</p>

<p>When we were looking to revamp our firmware for a new product update, we decided to throw out all of the migration code from the 2 years before and move it into a “migration firmware” which users had to update through. With this, our 3.x set of firmwares had a clean slate with no backward-compatibility requirements! It was a breath of fresh air, and our firmware was thousands of lines of code smaller.</p>

<p>This was a backward-incompatible firmware update, and I believe it warranted the MAJOR increase from 2 to 3.</p>

<h3 id="incrementing-minor">Incrementing MINOR</h3>

<p>Example: 1.1.0 → 1.2.0</p>

<p>In the context of firmware, this is likely what most of your firmware version updates will be, especially if they contain new features and functionality. A MINOR update means that your device can upgrade from a version with the same MAJOR to any <em>newer</em> version with the same MAJOR. For example, as we discussed in the MAJOR section, any firmware in the 2.x release train should be able to update to any newer 2.x version, such as 2.0.0 → 2.5.0.</p>

<p>A MINOR update does not need to allow downgrading firmware versions, which is going from a firmware version to an older one, such as 2.5 → 2.0. Speaking from experience, this is a nightmare to deal with, and you should disable this behavior from ever happening, <em>at least in production</em>. Allowing downgrades in a limited form on pre-release software will help your developers and QA teams test the upgrade path between two versions more easily.</p>

<p>We provide a <a href="#detecting-downgrades">code snippet</a> later in the article to help prevent against downgrades at the installer level.</p>

<h3 id="incrementing-patch">Incrementing PATCH</h3>

<p>Example: 1.1.0 → 1.1.1</p>

<p>On past firmware projects that I’ve worked on, PATCH updates are usually hot-fixes, which are quickly tested and released after a critical bug is discovered upon releasing a prior firmware update. Each patch-fix might fix one or two bugs, and the amount of time needed to test and verify that the firmware works can be minimized.</p>

<p>Ideally, nothing that should prevent a downgrade from occurring should be placed in a patch upgrade. This means no persistent data structure changes, no migration paths, and no changes in how the device communicates with external devices or services.</p>

<p>Since there are minimal to no breaking changes, these firmware updates can be upgraded and downgraded to without harm.</p>

<h3 id="pre-release-tag-best-practices">Pre-release Tag Best Practices</h3>

<p>The pre-release tag is any series of dot separated identifiers consisting of ASCII letters and numbers.</p>

<p>The most common pre-release tags are ‘alpha’, ‘beta’, and ‘rc’, which should satisfy most of your versioning requirements.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use ‘alpha’ when the release branch is first cut from master or another release branch. It’s pretty much assumed that ‘alpha’ builds are unstable and should be treated as broken-by-default.</li>
  <li>Use ‘beta’ when the API is stable, there are no longer any breaking changes and features being pushed into the release, and the stabilization phase has begun.</li>
  <li>Use ‘rc’ (release-candidate) when you think everything is stable and QA should start doing rigorous testing because it might turn out that this build could be “the one”.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve seen many developers create out-of-order pre-release tags, so be sure to <a href="https://semver.org/#spec-item-11" target="_blank">read the spec</a> and test your assumptions.</p>

<h3 id="scripting-and-testing-semver">Scripting and Testing SemVer</h3>

<p>In all of my scripts that parse SemVer and when I need to quickly test version comparisons, I turn to the <a href="https://github.com/python-semver/python-semver" target="_blank">python-semver</a> package.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ pip install semver
$ python
&gt;&gt;&gt; semver.parse_version_info('1.1.1-alpha.1') \
    &lt; semver.parse_version_info('1.1.1-alpha.11')
True
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="missing-pieces-of-semantic-versioning">Missing Pieces of Semantic Versioning</h3>

<p>Semantic Versioning provides a plethora of benefits to our firmware and release management workflows, but it doesn’t solve all of our requirements. One of our requirements was to be able to reference a specific build of a firmware, which SemVer does not help with.</p>

<p>For example, if two developers locally compile a “1.1.1” firmware, we now have two builds of “1.1.1” with no way to tell the difference between the two! They could be based upon two entirely different revisions of software or even built with a different compiler. We could use pre-release tags or build meta tags, but we also don’t want to pollute our SemVer string with data that could be better solved by other versions.</p>

<p>Let’s now look at Git revisions, which will help us identify the software revisions that our firmware is built from.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Jack Ma resurfaced for the first time since Chinaâ€™s government began clamping down on his business empire nearly three months ago, appearing in a live-streamed video that sent Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.â€™s stock soaring but left plenty of unanswered questions about the billionaireâ€™s fate.</p>

<p>Ma spoke briefly on Wednesday during an annual event he hosts to recognize rural teachers. In one video of the event circulated online, Chinaâ€™s most famous entrepreneur can be seen touring a primary school in his hometown of Hangzhou. Ma, who had stayed out of public view since regulators suspended the initial public offering of his fintech company Ant Group Co., told the teachers heâ€™ll spend more time on philanthropy. He didnâ€™t mention his run-ins with Beijing.</p>

<p>Ant confirmed the authenticity of the video, first posted on an online blog, but declined to comment further. Shares of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant co-founded by Ma that owns about a third of Ant, jumped 8.5 per cent in Hong Kong and were up almost the same level in pre-market U.S. trade.</p>

<p>Speculation about Maâ€™s whereabouts and his standing with President Xi Jinpingâ€™s government had reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, after regulators ordered Ant to overhaul its business and began an antitrust investigation of Alibaba. Beijingâ€™s crackdown followed an October speech by Ma in which he infamously rebuked â€œpawn shopâ€� Chinese lenders, regulators who donâ€™t get the internet, and the â€œold menâ€� of the global banking community.</p>

<p>Maâ€™s comments on Wednesday struck a much different tone, echoing themes espoused by the ruling Communist Party. A former English schoolteacher, he spoke about the importance of reviving Chinaâ€™s countryside and narrowing income disparities by encouraging the return of younger talent to rural areas.</p>

<p>â€œRecently, my colleagues and I have been studying and thinking. We made a firmer resolution to devote ourselves to education philanthropy,â€� Ma said during the event. â€œWorking hard for rural revitalization and common prosperity is the responsibility for our generation of businessmen.â€�</p>

<p>While Maâ€™s exact whereabouts remain unclear, his emergence in a public forum may help quell some of the more dire rumors about his fate in a country where media coverage is often tightly choreographed. Among the earliest outlets to report on his video address was an online news outlet backed by the Zhejiang provincial government.</p>

<p>Ma had kept out of public view since regulators in November scuttled Antâ€™s US$35 billion IPO, tightened fintech regulations and launched a separate probe into Alibaba -- all in a span of weeks.</p>

<p>â€œJack Maâ€™s unexpected re-emergence -- just as sudden as his earlier disappearance -- is likely a sign that his relationship with Beijingâ€™s regulatory authorities has stabilized,â€� said Brock Silvers, a managing director at private equity fund Kaiyuan Capital in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>But Ma probably isnâ€™t out of the woods, Silvers added. â€œA path acceptable to all parties may have been identified, but Ant Group still looks likely to be dis-aggregated and regulatory restrictions will almost surely take a significant bite out of Antâ€™s former valuation.â€�</p>

<p>Jack Ma addressing teachers via livestream at an annual event Ma hosts to recognize rural educators, Jan. 20.</p>

<p>The clampdown on Maâ€™s empire is part of a broader campaign to rein in a generation of Chinese tech giants that Beijing views as wielding too much control over the worldâ€™s second-largest economy.</p>

<p>The government has increasingly sought to exert influence over the extent to which companies from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to ByteDance Ltd. amass data and direct commerce and media. The same month Antâ€™s IPO was scuttled, the nationâ€™s top antitrust watchdog published new guidelines warning tech giants against monopolistic practices from forced exclusive arrangements to collusion on data. While Ant and Alibaba have borne the brunt of that assault since November, investors have since sold off peers from Tencent to Meituan. Both stocks rallied more than 3 per cent on Wednesday.</p>

<p>While Alibabaâ€™s surge added about US$58 billion to the companyâ€™s market value, Maâ€™s standing with Beijing remains unclear. As of early December, the man most closely identified with the meteoric rise of China Inc. was advised by the government to stay in the country, a person familiar with the matter has said. Debate about his whereabouts arose because Beijing has in the past quietly detained billionaires that have run afoul of the law, without immediate trial.</p>

<p><strong>What Bloomberg Intelligence Says</strong></p>

<p>Jack Maâ€™s live-streamed appearance with rural teachers after keeping out of public view for more than two months may boost market sentiment on Alibaba and alleviate worst-case investor concerns. However, the monopoly probe launched in December by Chinaâ€™s State Administration for Market Regulation is yet to be resolved and may continue to weigh on the companyâ€™s future acquisitions and broader business practices.</p>

The neutron beam could penetrate dense materials but not light materials, creating an image that shows more detail of the phone’s inner workings than either X-ray image could on its own.

However, the image taken with 190 kV X-rays also misses important details because while the X-rays can pass more easily through the denser material, they also pass too easily through the lighter material as well.

Turbine blades are cast around ceramic molds, and fragments of ceramic can clog their vital cooling channels. A blade with clogged cooling channels could break or even melt while in operation, so such flaws must be rooted out with 100% certainty. The only way to reliably detect these ceramic fragments is to wash the blade in a solution containing gadolinium, an element with a high neutron cross section. Once the gadolinium has permeated the ceramic’s porous structure, the fragments will show up in stark contrast on the resulting neutron image.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="fws_600b5d7f16b97" data-column-margin="default" data-midnight="dark"><div><div data-t-w-inherits="default" data-bg-cover="" data-padding-pos="all" data-has-bg-color="false" data-bg-color="" data-bg-opacity="1" data-hover-bg="" data-hover-bg-opacity="1" data-animation="" data-delay="0"><div><div><div id="fws_600b5d7f16de4" data-midnight="" data-column-margin="default"><div><div data-t-w-inherits="default" data-bg-cover="" data-padding-pos="all" data-has-bg-color="false" data-bg-color="" data-bg-opacity="1" data-hover-bg="" data-hover-bg-opacity="1" data-animation="" data-delay="0"><div><div><div data-max-width="100%" data-max-width-mobile="default" data-border-radius="none" data-shadow="none" data-animation="fade-in"><div><div data-hover-animation="none"><p><a href="https://phoenixwi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hard-Drives-Neutron-Image.jpg"> <img data-delay="0" height="896" width="1536" data-animation="fade-in" src="https://phoenixwi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hard-Drives-Neutron-Image.jpg" alt="Neutron Image: Hard Drives" srcset="https://phoenixwi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hard-Drives-Neutron-Image.jpg 1536w, https://phoenixwi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hard-Drives-Neutron-Image-300x175.jpg 300w, https://phoenixwi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hard-Drives-Neutron-Image-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://phoenixwi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hard-Drives-Neutron-Image-768x448.jpg 768w" sizes="(min-width: 1450px) 75vw, (min-width: 1000px) 85vw, 100vw"> </a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-using-bg="true" data-t-w-inherits="default" data-shadow="medium_depth" data-bg-cover="" data-padding-pos="all" data-has-bg-color="true" data-bg-color="#ecab20" data-bg-opacity="0.9" data-hover-bg="#ecab20" data-hover-bg-opacity="1" data-animation="" data-delay="0"><div><div><div><p>Because of the way neutrons pass easily through denser metals, the neutron image of the 3.5″ hard disk drive on the left mainly shows the less dense plastic components of the hard drive’s internals. the 2.5″ external hard drive on the right is entirely encased in a plastic shell which is more opaque, but not entirely opaque, to neutrons.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><h4>Interactive N-Ray/X-Ray Comparison</h4></p></div><div id="fws_600b5d7f1759e" data-midnight="" data-column-margin="default"><div><div data-t-w-inherits="default" data-bg-cover="" data-padding-pos="all" data-has-bg-color="false" data-bg-color="" data-bg-opacity="1" data-hover-bg="" data-hover-bg-opacity="1" data-animation="" data-delay="0"><div><div><p><img src="https://phoenixwi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hard-Drive-X-Ray-Image.jpg" alt="X-Ray Image: Hard Drive"> <img src="https://phoenixwi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hard-Drive-Neutron-Image-scaled.jpg" alt="Neutron Image: Hard Drive"></p></div></div></div><div data-using-bg="true" data-t-w-inherits="default" data-shadow="medium_depth" data-bg-cover="" data-padding-pos="all" data-has-bg-color="true" data-bg-color="#ebab20" data-bg-opacity="0.9" data-hover-bg="#ebab20" data-hover-bg-opacity="1" data-animation="" data-delay="0"><div><div><div><p>Click and drag on the vertical line to compare X-ray and N-ray imaging.

			<p>2020 might be the year we all faced a pandemic. But 2019 was the year the earth burned. In Australia, the world watched in horror as bushfires destroyed&nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21048891/australia-wildfires-koalas-climate-change-bushfires-deaths-animals-damage">10.3 million hectares</a></span><span>25.5 million acres</span></span>, marking the continent’s most intense and destructive fire season in over 40 years. Earlier that fall, California saw more than&nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/business/the-2019-california-wildfires-caused-less-damage-than-the-last-two-devastating-seasons/643455">101,000 hectares</a></span><span>250,000 acres</span></span> </p>
<p> destroyed, with damages upward of $80 billion. Alaska saw nearly <a href="https://wildfiretoday.com/2020/02/26/wildfire-activity-in-2019-was-heavier-than-usual-in-alaska-but-slower-than-average-in-rest-of-u-s/">a million</a>. Record-breaking fires also hit&nbsp;<a href="http://silicamag.com/features/peat-in-heat">Indonesia</a>, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2019/huge-wildfires-in-russias-siberian-province-continue">Russia</a>, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/hellish-scenes-wildfires-engulf-lebanon-191015191252866.html">Lebanon</a>—but nowhere saw the sheer mass of media coverage as the fires that tore through the Amazon nearly all last summer.</p>
<p>By year’s end, thousands of global media outlets had reported that Brazil’s largest rainforest played host to more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/world/americas/amazon-fires-bolsonaro-photos.html">80,000 individual forest fires</a> in one year alone, resulting in an estimated <span><span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-wildfires-brazil-spurns-20-million-aid-offer-from-g-7-nations-today-2019-08-27/">906,000 square hectares</a></span><span>2.2 million acres</span></span> of environmental destruction. At the time, Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research <a href="http://queimadas.dgi.inpe.br/queimadas/portal-static/situacao-atual/">reported</a> it was the fastest rate of burning since record keeping began in 2013.</p>
<p>But amid the charred ruins of one of the largest oxygen-producing environments on the planet, a secret lies buried beneath the soil. A complex network of seeds, scat, fungi and fertilizers are already hard at work creating the next generation of tropical regeneration. We are racing to reverse-engineer the rainforest—and like any half-decent architect, we’re going to have to do it from the ground up.</p>

<p>This year, deforestation seems imminent. In January 2020, humans cleared <span><span><a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2020/02/deforestation-in-brazil-continues-torrid-pace-into-2020/">284 kilometers</a></span><span>176 acres</span></span> of rainforest in the Amazon, more than twice that registered in January 2019. The risk was compounded by a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/06/brazil-bolsonaro-commercial-mining-indigenous-land-bill">February 2020 announcement</a> by President Jair Bolsonaro of a bill he'd sent to Brazil’s Congress that would further open up indigenous reserves in the Amazon to commercial mining, oil and gas exploration, cattle ranching, agribusiness, hydroelectric dam projects, and tourism. By May, deforestation had increased by <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-brazil-amazon-rainforest-destruction/">more than 50%</a> across the region, actually intensifying in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic, as illegal loggers and miners rushed in to subsidize their incomes. It’s no secret in Brazil that&nbsp;many believe for their country to prosper, the Amazon will have to burn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With software, taking something apart and putting it back together again can help engineers improve their understanding of the underlying source code of their software. In structural engineering, the same methods can determine the cause of potentially fatal design flaws. Reverse-engineering is also useful in medical and scientific research, like with the <a href="https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project">Human Genome project</a>, where researchers try to decipher human DNA to discover more about how we work as a species.</p>
<p>Locked in a race against time, politics, and climate change, the ways in which we might be able to reverse-engineer and recover our rainforests might surprise even the most stoic of environmental theorists.</p>
<hr>

<p>The first step in reverse-engineering anything is to develop a shared language. What can we agree on? What are the risks? What are the goals? How can we apply quantitative properties to qualitative phenomena so we can measure and track our results? Those are the questions a new generation of rainforest researchers, using complex computational models are asking themselves as they begin to map the past and future of the Amazon.</p>
<p>“When it comes to computational modeling, the most useful role is to enable us to simulate different kinds of futures,” says <a href="https://environment.harvard.edu/about/faculty/paul-moorcroft">Paul Moorcroft</a>, an ecologist at Harvard University who has published a series of groundbreaking studies on the ecological dynamics of terrestrial plant communities and ecosystems around the world. “We can look at all sorts of different scenarios, for example land use management, or enforcement of fire codes and see how much potential wilding you would get versus destruction under different scenarios.”</p>
<p>These <a href="https://moorcroftlab.oeb.harvard.edu/publications/mechanistic-scaling-ecosystem-function-and-dynamics-space-and-time">potential futures</a>, which essentially range from “It’ll be okay” to “The Amazon will turn into a literal grassland by 2050,” are hotly debated in the rainforest research community. One thing researchers can all agree on, however, is that the Amazon burning is not a natural phenomena. </p>
<p>Unlike other forests––many of which go through a natural cycle of wetting, drying, and sometimes fire––the Amazon is home to one of the wettest ecosystems on earth. Despite the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-fires-brazil-president-bolsonaro-misinformation-cbsn-originals-documentary/">misinformation campaign</a> perpetuated by Bolsonaro and the Brazilian government, the Amazon’s fires aren’t  the result of some stray kindling or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/12/disinformation-and-lies-are-spreading-faster-than-australias-bushfires">environmental activism gone wrong</a>; they’re largely the result of systematic extraction by logging, mining, ranching and agriculture companies that slash and burn the forest to make way for business.</p>
<p>Its <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16512">effects on the forest floor</a>, mapped by both human hands and digital models, are devastating. With trees gone, nutrients wash away and the soil degrades into a dense, brick-like layer inhospitable to many plant roots. Without native shrubs or trees, symbiotic soil organisms die, further decreasing fertility. Heavy rains and intense sunlight at the equator leach nutrients from the soil, tripling the impact. Animal species crucial to pollination, seed processing, and seed dispersal disappear.</p>
<p>“It really only takes a couple of those events and the forest will basically just die,” says Moorcroft. Models show that in the years after a major burn, damaged root systems open up even the most resilient, 1000-year-old canopies to erosion, wind damage, pathogens, and termites. “Those large trees simply won’t survive.”</p>
<p>Computer models, fed by field observations, remote sensing, and increasingly sophisticated satellite, microwave and LiDAR data, also show us how climate change could affect the rainforest and vice versa, helping to align researchers and organizations on a common goal as they race to regrow what’s been lost. For example, they’re doing whatever it takes to achieve the <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/methodology/paris-temperature-goal/">1.5 to 2.0 degree Celsius</a> temperature targets established by the <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement">Paris Agreement</a> and pushing to stop the current rate of rainforest destruction that releases an estimated <span><span><a href="https://www.cgdev.org/publication/ft/why-forests-why-now-preview-science-economics-politics-tropical-forests-climate-change">9.7 billion metric tons</a></span><span>10.8 billion tons</span></span> of carbon into the atmosphere in the process.</p>
<p>As for the worst-case scenario, Moorcroft is not hedging his bets. “The question is, does it get warmer or wetter or warmer or dryer? If the answer is warm and dry, that’s when you tend to get devastating impacts.”</p>
<p>In fact, a <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2007GL030612#grl23422-fig-0002">2007 projection</a> found that if the Amazon reaches about 40 percent of forest converted into pastureland, the eastern Amazon could see a nearly 20 percent decrease in rainfall. <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/2/eaat2340.short">More recent studies</a> argue that this level of devastation could happen with as little as 20 to 25 percent deforestation. The potential result of that is a phenomena known as savannization, characterized by drastic changes in vegetation structure, soil aridity, and canopy coverage that computer models predict could unalterably transform the rainforest into a much more open ecosystem in the future.</p>
<p>This race against time, predicted by several climate models, is now beginning to see its first biological evidence as well. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2530064419300525">A 2019 study</a> published in <em>Perspectives in Ecology and Conservation</em> found that abandoned pastures affected by fires in the Brazilian Atlantic showed similarities in vegetation structure and plant functional traits to a savanna-like ecosystem––traits predicted to significantly impair its recovery. </p>
<p>“Ongoing climate change is likely to exacerbate the observed savannization and indicate that its transformation into savanna-like might be a matter of time,” study authors wrote. “A time that would be particularly short under the most likely climate scenarios.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, scientists on the ground are learning more than ever about what it takes to regenerate a rainforest from the ground up. Just as an architect might begin by studying the basic material units required to create a structure, many researchers in the Amazon are starting simply, then adding complexity in a mind-numbingly difficult endeavor to figure out the basic building blocks of Amazonian ecology –– the second step in any reverse-engineering process worth its salt.</p>
<p>Since this is <a href="https://silicamag.com/issues/dirt">the Dirt Issue</a>, it should come as no surprise that this part of the story starts in the soil. Back in the 15th century, when early colonists first set foot in Latin America, they believed that the incredible lushness of the rainforests was due to their super-fertile soils. In fact, over two-thirds of the world’s rainforests are considered “<a href="https://inesad.edu.bo/developmentroast/2012/11/five-types-of-rainforest-ecosystem-services-that-nourish-people-and-planet/">wet deserts</a>”––inhospitable to even the most hardy of plant pioneers. </p>
<p>The reason for this lies within the rapid nutrient cycle within the rainforest, where decaying matter like dead wood, leaf litter, fecal matter and even human perspiration are recycled back into the carbon chain so efficiently there’s not much left by the time it gets to the ground. The abundance of bacteria, fungi and insects that call the Amazon home are critical to young growth, leaching out minerals like potassium, phosphorus, calcium and magnesium. The high temperature and moisture of the rainforest also cause dead organic matter in the soil to decompose more quickly, further enhancing nutrient degradation. As a result, most rainforest plants are incredibly shallow-rooted, perfectly adapted to take advantage of the thin, nutrient-rich compost layer that makes up the first <span><span>15-20 centimeters</span><span>6-8 inches</span></span> of the rainforest floor. </p>
<p>How to tap into this complex, precarious ecosystem and reverse-engineer it is a monumental task, one that thousands of scientists around the world are trying to tackle. One of the most compelling of these projects is happening at the <a href="https://stri.si.edu/">Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute</a> in Panama, where researchers have access to a <span><span>700-hectare</span><span>1,700 acre</span></span> open air laboratory with conditions that parallel the Amazon.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are many discussions around edge computing and its adoption scenarios. One of the key ingredients that could accelerate edge transformation is the ability to use an existing software stack for continuous deployment to the edge. We believe that a new type of hardware that can organically coexist with the cloud ecosystem could be a solution to address the challenge. For example, Turing Pi designed to be an edge computer with cloud-native hardware architecture.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of processing data closer to the source isn’t new. Though, the opportunities that Kubernetes as well as machine learning open to it sound more promising than ever.&nbsp;</p><h4><em>It is doubtful that edge computing is going to replace the cloud. More likely, the edge is going to be an extension. That’s why the synergy of these two paradigms is empirical.&nbsp;</em></h4><p>Cloud computing has spawned many cloud-native solutions. Technologies like containers, serverless, Kubernetes changed the way developers build, deliver, and scale software. What all these technologies have in common is that they designed for distributed computing. The idea behind Turing Pi is a cluster of computers interconnected with Ethernet but all in one compact device. This architecture allows deploying and scaling software to the edge in the same way as in the cloud.&nbsp;</p><h4><em>The concept of a cluster board is similar to a PC motherboard but with an Ethernet network instead of a PCI bus. Rather than using just one processor, the cluster board can combine multiple processors and multiple types of processors. As an example, general-purpose compute modules can work in combination with machine learning modules. This heterogeneous approach could open a wider adaptation of machine learning applications at the edge.&nbsp;</em></h4><p>In other words, Turing Pi is a compact, energy-efficient, out of the box RACK system. These characteristics allow placing clusters in various locations, hard to reach places, and build things like mobile data centers. <a href="https://medium.com/@cfatechblog/edge-computing-at-chick-fil-a-7d67242675e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A striking example of cluster computing</a> adoption is the Chick-Fil-A restaurant chain. The company placed local Kubernetes clusters in more than two thousand restaurants. That helped Chick-Fil-A to build a resilient, highly available, internet-independent system. As a result, the company automated critical business processes and reduced public cloud load by processing data locally. The possibility of using cloud-native technologies at the edge helped Chick-Fil-A to accelerate innovations and get the code running in production as fast as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Turing Pi V1 model is mostly aimed at developers, Devops and researchers. It is an amazing platform for learning and experimentation. The cluster board currently supports Raspberry Pi compute modules, which are intended for industrial applications. Raspberry Pi, by far, is the most popular single-board computer, and its colossal software ecosystem should help to lower entry points for new developers.&nbsp;Bare metal cluster using Raspberry Pis and running on Linux is not only affordable compared to what it can do, but can also be a great tool when dealing with resource-intensive tasks like compiling, continuous data parsing, or learning how to manage a cluster using real hardware instead of virtual machines. Also, it is very useful to have a personal Kubernetes cluster to explore concepts of distributed systems, create proof of concept prototypes, and deploy self-hosted services on-premises or at the edge with almost zero recurring costs.</p><p>Yes, we believe that compact clusters and edge computing is a great fit. Compact clusters could be great building blocks for edge infrastructure. It’s easy to scale within one mini cluster and within the whole fleet of clusters. Different cluster nodes intended for different type of applications, which is a more reliable and efficient way to run services. At the same time container orchestration tools like Kubernetes makes it easy to monitor, maintain and deliver software.</p></div></div>]]>

The company will retain its Canadian headquarters.</p>  <p>"This is the most important day in the history of the company and an incredible milestone," said Allen Lau, one of Wattpad's co-founders, in an interview.</p>  <p>"It is the beginning of a new chapter and using TV show terminology, this is episode one of season two, so I'm absolutely looking forward to this."</p>    <p>Lau and Ivan Yuen, who will continue to lead Wattpad following the sale, started the self-publishing platform after the pair dreamed up the idea on a napkin while waiting for a flight at the Vancouver airport food court in 2006.</p>  <p>Wattpad quickly became home to stories from dozens of genres because it allows anyone to share their writing for free and is accessible on phones and tablets.</p>  <p>It became a household name around 2013 when Anna Todd, a Texas woman, started writing <em>After</em>,&nbsp;a fanfiction series on the platform about One Direction singer Harry Styles.</p>  <p>Her stories were eventually made into books and a film series, which encouraged Wattpad to start book publishing and studio entertainment divisions.</p>  <p>However, Lau admitted a sale wasn't always his plan.</p>  <p>"We weren't actively looking for sellers, but we have been talking to investors along the way …&nbsp;to accelerate our growth," he said.</p>  <p>"We knew Naver for quite some time and we realized after some conversations we have a shared vision."</p>  <h2>Opportunity to grow, get into animation, co-founder says</h2>  <p>Naver, which bills itself as "South Korea's largest web search engine," was an ideal partner because it owns digital comics platform Webtoon, he said.</p>  <p>Webtoon is behind some of the biggest names in webcomics, including <em>Lore Olympus</em>,&nbsp;and has worked with the Jim Henson Company and producers behind hit films like <em>The Lego Movie</em>, the <em>It&nbsp;</em>franchise and <em>Snowpiercer</em>.</p>  <p>Lau said Naver will offer Wattpad a chance to get into animation and to grow beyond the 90 million users — including more than five million writers — that Wattpad has. Webtoon said it has more than 72 million monthly active users.</p>  <p>"Wattpad's vision to entertain and connect the world through stories fits perfectly with our vision for Webtoon and Naver's content brand and we're thrilled to have them join the Naver family," Seong-sook Han, chief executive, said in a statement.</p>    <p>The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of Wattpad's fiscal year and is subject to regulatory approvals.</p>  <p>It is the latest in a string of sales that have seen once-promising Canadian tech companies snatched up by foreign owners during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>Element AI, a Montreal-based firm that creates artificial intelligence solutions for large organizations, signed a deal in November to be purchased by ServiceNow, a Santa Clara, Calif., company that offers a cloud-based workflow technology.</p>  <p>San Francisco-based "buy now, pay later" company Affirm reached a deal to buy Toronto rival PayBright for $340 million in early December.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>Not many websites make it the age of twenty-five. Today, let’s recognize <a href="http://www.pencilpages.com/" target="_blank">The Pencil Pages</a>, one of the first websites devoted to the woodcase pencil. Author Doug Martin created a website with articles, an often cited (and still not surpassed) directory of pencil manufacturers, photos of pencils, and a classified section. </p>
<p>The classified section at Pencil Pages (still going) was the first online place I’m aware that fostered a basic conversation about pencils, with posters speaking to one another.</p>
<p>Congratulations on this significant anniversary.</p>

The firm’s strategy has dramatic implications for the future of media and the venture capital industry. </p><p>This is the story of how Andreessen Horowitz disrupted the world of venture capital by cozying up to the media and then, how they purposefully threw that relationship away.</p><p>Let me tell you the story from the beginning.</p><p>About a decade ago, <strong>Margit Wennmachers</strong> sent an email to reporter <strong>Kara Swisher</strong>. </p><p>Swisher took a break from horseback riding to <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20100614/outcasts-wennmachers-joins-andreessen-horowitz-as-partner/">write that Wennmachers was leaving Outcast</a>, the communications agency she co-founded with <strong>Caryn Marooney</strong>. Wennmachers was joining the one-year-old venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz as a full partner – a rare title for a woman in Silicon Valley, especially in 2010.</p><p>Wennmachers explained her strategy for positioning the firm in the early days, <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/20/brand-building-a16z-ideas-people-marketing/">in an interview</a> on Andreessen Horowitz’s in-house podcast. “I wanted to try and get a cover story because – this sounds old fashioned now, because everybody reads their news on Twitter and it's all online whatever – but there's still a statement that comes with a cover story that is in print, that you see at the airport,” she recalled. </p><p>With Wennmachers’ press savvy, <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong>’s idea-a-second patter, and <strong>Ben Horowitz</strong>’s gravitas, the trio took Silicon Valley by storm. The firm outbid competitors for sought-after companies, spun up a slew of services for founders, and pitched its story relentlessly to the press.</p><p>With Wennmachers’ encouragement Andreessen penned a now <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">historic Op-Ed</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in 2011, titled, “Why Software is Eating the World.” The phrase became so ubiquitous that it can seem like everything eats the world these days. </p><p>“Margit is really a hidden founder of this firm,” a startup founder who has raised money from the firm told me. “The power dynamics there is, Marc, Ben, and Margit.” </p><p>Communications executives and reporters alike are in awe of Wennmachers for her sway with the media. “Comms in the Valley – she's the number 1 draft pick. She's very good,” one public relations person said. “I would never want to be crosswise with her.” </p><p>While Wennmachers’ strategy in that early period would have been familiar to many in Hollywood and Washington, it was less common in clubby and decorous Silicon Valley at the time. “She would say that was her job – to manage information so that she could shape the narrative,” one person who knows Wennmachers said. </p><p>Wennmachers deployed industry gossip and access to her firm’s partners to stay in the good favor of many reporters. </p><p>One communications executive at an Andreessen Horowitz portfolio company recalled Wennmachers fishing for information about an upcoming story on behalf of reporters. Wennmachers pushed to deliver the information to the reporters herself, this executive said. </p><p>A high-powered rival PR executive described Wennmachers as an enforcer: “<em>You don't cross us and if you do, we shut off the information flow.</em>”</p><p>One member of the press recalled Wennmachers chasing down a potential bit of news. When Wennmachers returned the call and threw cold water on the story, the reporter took it in stride. Wennmachers told the reporter that they were now a “friend of the firm.” The comment struck the reporter as odd. They were just trying to get the facts right. But Wennmachers’ attitude seemed to reflect a coziness that she had come to expect from reporters dutifully covering Silicon Valley. </p><p>Wennmachers regularly hosted salon-style dinners at her home near the Presidio in San Francisco with reporters, portfolio companies, and the firm’s partners. While it’s not unusual for a venture capital firm to host reporters for a dinner, Wennmachers did it better than anyone else. When I attended one of her dinners in 2014, it felt like I’d finally gotten invited inside the Silicon Valley. &nbsp;</p><p>“I was invited to dinner at her house with members of the media. It was incredible,” one founder recalled. “That was like a cool invitation. If you were in the press you were really excited about getting dinner at Margit’s house, which is kind of mind-blowing if you think about it.” </p><p>Wennmachers can put on a friendly façade, but if you spend much time with her you come to realize that she’s a profoundly serious person. She doesn’t win over reporters because she’s fun. It’s because she cuts through the bullshit. She fundamentally understands what makes a good story. She knows what motivates reporters better than many reporters. That’s part of what makes the firm’s turn against the media so worrying.</p><p>Back in that early media heyday, Wennmachers doled the firm’s partners out to media companies who were eager to have them speak at lucrative conferences. And the firm’s partners were game to prophesize in audacious terms about what the future might look like, filling column inches.</p><p>Swisher and Wennmachers – two women who climbed their way to dominance in an industry overrun with men – are friendly to this day. Many Silicon Valley insiders strongly suspect that Wennmachers was one of Swisher’s sources when she covered Silicon Valley’s day-to-day dramas. But Swisher describes Wennmachers as fiercely loyal to her own companies, though Wennmachers “also did not pretend a problem I might call about was not one.” </p><p>Marc Andreessen himself had a cozy relationship with reporters like Swisher. "Marc is fully in charge of his own communications and has over time stopped wanting to deal with the press for lots of reasons, including some mistakes he made.” </p><p>From 2009 through 2015, Andreessen Horowitz earned a run of truly phenomenal press coverage, catapulting itself into the very top echelon of venture capital firms – at least based on its reputation. The media loved that bald headed internet geek and his gruff business guru sidekick. And over cocktails or lunch at the Battery, reporters probed Wennmachers for information, even if she rarely earned a mention in their stories. </p><p>Then the magazine writer <strong>Tad Friend </strong>pitched a profile of Marc Andreessen for the <em>New Yorker</em>. Wennmachers already saw the firm’s position in the popular consciousness beginning to shift. The firm was no longer an exciting upstart. “At that point I was at a stage where it was like ‘enough.’ ‘We're done talking about ourselves,’” Wennmachers said in the podcast interview. On the other hand, she reasoned, “The <em>New Yorker</em> is the <em>New Yorker</em>, so how often is the <em>New Yorker</em> going to write the definitive piece on venture capital? Once in a decade? Maybe? Well, do I want that to be about whoever or do I want that to be about us? At that point, I want to occupy that spot?” </p><p>She decided to do the story – though of course <em>she</em> wouldn’t occupy it. She merited a single passing mention. Marc Andreessen’s shiny head was the focus instead.</p><p>The story ran in May 2015, with the title, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/tomorrows-advance-man">Tomorrow’s Advance Man</a>.” The glowing portrait instantly became one of the seminal stories on the venture capital industry.</p><p>Despite running more than 10,000 words, the article made a single passing mention of one of Andreessen Horowitz’s most important investments, Zenefits. The firm had backed up the truck to invest in <strong>Parker Conrad’s</strong> human resources software company and hyped it in the press. But cracks had started to appear. By the end of 2015, Buzzfeed reporter <strong>Will Alden</strong> had planted the seeds of Zenefit’s unraveling, raising questions about whether the company’s health insurance brokers were properly licensed. </p><p>That same year, John Carreyrou revealed that Theranos had “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901">struggled with its blood testing technology</a>.” Theranos had mostly raised money outside of Silicon Valley. But some venture capitalists tied their reputations to defending the company anyway. Marc Andreessen, who tweeted prolifically at the time, appeared to develop an affinity for blocking people who tweeted negatively about Theranos. </p><p>For reporters – and especially their editors – the Theranos story was a sign that tech reporters needed to take a more critical eye towards the startups they covered. Carreyrou was an investigative reporter, not on the Silicon Valley beat at all. Tech reporters shouldn’t have missed Theranos’s shortcomings. So, they redoubled their efforts.</p><p>Then, indeed, Andreessen Horowitz found itself with a troubled portfolio company of its own. In May 2016, I reported<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-zenefits/?sref=WS92jZg5"> in Businessweek</a> about Zenefit’s self-disruption. Many other tech reporters also dug into the company’s failings.  </p><p>Behind the scenes, <strong>Kim Milosevich</strong>, then Wennmachers’ top lieutenant, went to task pointing much of the blame for the company’s implosion on its co-founder <strong>Parker Conrad</strong> – who certainly deserved a big portion of the credit for the company’s problems. </p><p>But Andreessen Horowitz partner <strong>Lars Dalgaard</strong> had cheered Conrad on, telling Conrad to double the company’s revenue growth target, I reported back then. Zenefits was the company Andreessen Horowitz wanted to grow, grow, grow. Years earlier, Ben Horowitz himself had <a href="https://a16z.com/2010/03/17/the-case-for-the-fat-startup/">penned an essay</a> making the case for “fat startups,” ones that spend aggressively to block out their competitors. Zenefits seemed to be running that playbook. </p><p>But as the company’s business started to falter and with mounting regulatory risk, Horowitz stepped in to help push Conrad to step aside. The firm laid the blame at Conrad’s feet. And <strong>David Sacks</strong>, who had been the company’s chief operating officer, was sold to the world as a turnaround CEO. </p><p>That same year, the press started to turn its attention to Andreessen Horowitz itself, wondering if this firm really lived up to all the hype we’d been fed over the years. </p><p>My occasional bridge partner, <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter <strong>Rolfe Winkler</strong>, wrote in …</p></div></div>

    <div>
                <p>In this part, we examine the <em>foundation phase</em> of Visualize Value, including how Jack:</p><ol><li>attracted attention to his tweet despite having no following,</li><li>built synergy among his various media,</li><li>iterated till he found his first profitable and scalable product</li></ol><p>This story takes time to develop, but it encapsulates the creator's struggle of putting in thousands of hours of work with little returns to show for. Get a sense of what it was like for Jack; and if you are a struggling creator, I hope this will also provide you with the motivation to keep going. Let’s dive in.</p><p><em>Because of the sheer amount of visuals that Jack uses, this post is best viewed in your browser.</em></p><h2 id="the-early-years">The Early Years</h2><p>Jack graduated with a degree in graphic design in 2010, worked at multiple agencies till 2017, then started his own <a href="https://work.opponentco.com/">agency</a>. He got burnt out, then <a href="https://youtu.be/bwBYNQGiOXo">iterated on the agency model till he landed on Visualize Value</a>.</p><p>🗓 Jan 11 2019: Jack announces The Trust Accelerator. This is Jack's first project to 'automate' aspects of the agency model- he wanted to create efficient processes for the onboarding process of the agency's clients, instead of reinventing the wheel for each of them. At this point, Jack is already thinking of creating systems for his workflow. If you are currently involved in providing a service, it will be extremely helpful to think if you can productize part of that service/workflow. This is exactly the same tactic that Jack used for Visualize Value's Daily Manifest, as we shall see in the later part of this article.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Take more on, get duller.⁣<br>Take more off, get sharper.⁣<a href="https://t.co/fyaLM1dTGa">https://t.co/fyaLM1dTGa</a> <a href="https://t.co/P8bjmhcjMB">pic.twitter.com/P8bjmhcjMB</a></p>— Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1083397948216627200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>🗓 Jan 19 2019: 8 days later, there was Visualize Value's first Tweet (2 retweets, 9 likes). Jack essentially ran two concurrent experiments- The Trust Accelerator and Visualize Value. The latter is meant to be an evolution of the former- while The Trust Accelerator still needed the physical presence of the agency's staff, Visualize Value productizes the whole process of content creation, and allows clients to do so asynchronously.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">— <a href="https://twitter.com/naval?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@naval</a> <a href="https://t.co/sU6uXafWuY">pic.twitter.com/sU6uXafWuY</a></p>— Visualize Value (@visualizevalue) <a href="https://twitter.com/visualizevalue/status/1086488889315991552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Jack has a very interesting approach to productizing- instead of thinking of a single product, he launches several products at once, which allows him to capture different points on the scale of automation. If your goal is point e, you can always start by launching products on points a and b, then slowly progress towards your goal as you get better at the scale you choose to improve your products on.</p><p>🗓 January 22 2019: Jack's output with VV is stunning- he creates 3-5 visualizations a day. In addition, he did not just focus on a single person's thoughts and quotes. Instead, he covered a wide range of individuals, ranging from Seth Godin to Nassim Taleb, and of course, Naval.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">— <a href="https://twitter.com/ThisIsSethsBlog?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ThisIsSethsBlog</a> <a href="https://t.co/bPauMwp81p">pic.twitter.com/bPauMwp81p</a></p>— Visualize Value (@visualizevalue) <a href="https://twitter.com/visualizevalue/status/1087413490506178560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Because he tags each of these individuals, he is increasing his reach to fans of each individual. These fans may be non-overlapping, thus increasing his efficiency in building VV's brand.</p><figure><img src="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_D0BB7C680421-1.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/IMG_D0BB7C680421-1.jpeg 600w, https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_D0BB7C680421-1.jpeg 678w"></figure><p>🗓 May 19 2019: Jack has been quieter on VV's front. There was only one tweet from February 2019 to September 2019 period. While there was more likes (34) on this tweet, this is still very few compared to his current tweets which can get a few thousand likes.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"Feed" <a href="https://t.co/x4Ok2HyV3G">pic.twitter.com/x4Ok2HyV3G</a></p>— Visualize Value (@visualizevalue) <a href="https://twitter.com/visualizevalue/status/1129883797644824576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 18, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>(cont) Jack will be a lot quieter on Visualize Value's Twitter feed for the next few months for good reason-</p><p>🗓 May 23 2019: Jack launched his own Substack, aptly named Visualize Value. It is clear that he sees that VV can go beyond simply being a Twitter account that puts out graphics- instead, he wishes to expand into different forms of media, such as newsletters, audio content and YouTube videos. His own Substack can also serve as the platform for those different forms of media, such as:</p><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xMfB_M6OaWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>(cont) As you build your own personal brand, it is important to consider which platforms you can use to best serve the type of media you have in mind.</p><p>Jack mixes things up by using his Twitter to build a following for Visualize Value (by leveraging on already famous people) → creating a Substack that holds written and video content → allowing for older videos (like the one above) to be (re)discovered.</p><figure><img src="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_F70918785C07-1.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/IMG_F70918785C07-1.jpeg 600w, https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/IMG_F70918785C07-1.jpeg 1000w, https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_F70918785C07-1.jpeg 1031w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In short, there is synergy between the various forms of media and products that he is creating. If you are building some piece of media that just isn't getting the attention that you think it deserves, do not dump them into the trash can. Instead, think of how they can be re-marketed and discovered in the future. Media is an awesome tool for indie hackers because of the short iteration cycles- use them wisely. Look for demand from consumers, and once you've built up your audience, you can funnel them to your older projects.</p><p>Over the next few months, Jack will be extremely active on Substack, posting various articles explaining his graphics, and recording audio content.</p><p>🗓 May 29, 2020: '11 months, $0.' A post from Jack that summarizes Visualize Value thus far. </p><figure><a href="https://visualizevalue.substack.com/p/stay-the-course"><div><p>Stay the course</p><p>Here’s an illustration from yesterday, inspired by experience building the Visualize Value business: 11 months, $0.330 days.Thousands of hours staring into a screen.Was it worth it?

If not, iterate, iterate, iterate.</p><p>🗓 October 4 2019: Jack resumed frequent postings on Visualize Value. While the posts have higher engagement, they are still not wildly popular.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">WMD <a href="https://t.co/frr4iXaFsT">pic.twitter.com/frr4iXaFsT</a></p>— Visualize Value (@visualizevalue) <a href="https://twitter.com/visualizevalue/status/1179910292559597569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 4, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>🗓 September 6 2019: Jack released a simple document that he uses himself to keep track of his own goals and habits. </p><figure><a href="https://visualizevalue.substack.com/p/an-idiot-with-a-plan"><div><p>An Idiot with a Plan</p><p>“An idiot with a plan can beat a genius without a plan.” — Warren Buffet Without a plan, I act like an idiot.

While it is true that the newsletter is the <em>main</em> product, newsletter writers often confuse it for the <em>only</em> product. Imagine if we entice people to subscribe like how magazines offer subscription gifts.</p><figure><img src="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_678E97F71D24-1.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/IMG_678E97F71D24-1.jpeg 600w, https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/IMG_678E97F71D24-1.jpeg 1000w, https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_678E97F71D24-1.jpeg 1469w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>🗓 November 29 2019: It is the one year anniversary of Visualize Value. Jack still has not made significant money, neither does he have any 'best-selling' products. I am highlighting this as it is important to see how other successful creators/indie hackers struggle, and know that this is often part of the journey.</p><p>Jack offered the print edition of Visualize Value for sale (which has been discontinued).</p><figure><img src="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/Untitled.png" alt="" srcset="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Untitled.png 600w, https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Untitled.png 1000w, https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/Untitled.png 1456w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>While it is unclear what the exact reason is for Jack discontinuing this product, he soon launched another product that will prove to provide much higher ROI and easier distribution-</p><p>🗓 December 16 2019: Jack launched the VV Daily Manifest at an affordable price of $19. This is his first foray into digital products, and it probably opened his eyes to the ease and profitability of such products.</p><figure><img src="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/Untitled-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Untitled-2.png 600w, https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Untitled-2.png 1000w, https://theirtimeline.com/content/images/2021/01/Untitled-2.png 1512w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>There are 3 takeaways from the launch of VV's Daily Manifest:</p><ol><li>Digital products are great for indie hackers who do not necessarily have the capital for physical goods, and for solopreneurs who do not have the time to handle administrative work (e.g. shipping of goods).</li><li>Iterate the product/service that you are offering! It took only about 2 weeks for Jack to offer a new product (from the previous print version of VV). The more (high quality) products you put out there, the more you can test the market demand.</li><li>Leverage on the knowledge and workflows that you already have. Similar to Janel Loi's <a href="https://newsletteros.com/">Newsletter OS</a>, VV Daily Manifest probably grew out of the workflow that Jack already possessed. There is no need to create a product from scratch, you can ask yourself- what is some workflow that you have managed to synthesize over the years? Even if you are unsure if there will be demand for your idiosyncratic knowledge, it does not hurt to put it out there and gauge interest.</li></ol><p>This concludes the first chapter of Jack Butcher's Visualize Value- how he started his project from scratch, to landing on his first digital product that will shift his whole focus. At this point, Jack likely has not made much money from this project. But, he has laid the foundations for Visualize Value to soar.</p><p>Subscribe to receive updates on the release of the next installment- we are going to explore how Jack expanded on his arsenal of digital products, and started becoming extremely profitable.</p><p>Give Their Timeline <a href="https://twitter.com/their_timeline">a shout out on Twitter</a> if there is any entrepreneur whom you'll like to be featured too.</p>

<p>I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97642.No_More_Mr_Nice_Guy">No More Mr. Nice Guy</a> a couple weeks ago and I can’t decide if it was life changing or sexist pseudoscientific garbage. At the moment I’m thinking it’s a little bit of both.</p>



<p>But one concept hit home for me: <em>covert contracts</em>. The idea is that “<a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/02/we-become-what-we-are-told-we-are/">Nice Guys</a>” (and of course there are “Nice Gals” too, but the book is written for men) aren’t all that nice. They’re playing the part so that they’ll get <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/24/jobs-to-be-done-is-a-terrible-name/">what they want</a>. They think:</p>



<blockquote><p>IF I can hide my flaws and become what I think others want me to be<br>THEN I will be loved, get my needs met, and have a problem-free life.</p><cite>Robert A. Glover, No More Mr. Nice Guy</cite></blockquote>



<p>This is called a covert contract. <em>If I do X, then you’ll do Y, even though neither of us have acknowledged it.</em> Of course, the other person <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/01/never-underestimate-peoples-ability-to-not-hear-you/">has no idea</a> this is happening; it’s all in <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/26/extreme-ownership-book-notes/">the Nice Guy’s head</a>. So the Nice Guy doesn’t get what he wants.</p>



<p>And this isn’t just your average everyday implicit expectation. In this case, the Nice Guy feels like he’s been cheated. He thinks the other person owes him and didn’t hold up their end of the bargain (which they didn’t know existed). So he ends up disappointed and frustrated, which manifests in <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/28/the-all-powerful-bad-apple/">not-at-all-nice behavior</a>: passive aggression, isolation, clinginess, rage, all sorts of stuff.</p>



<p>The book talked a lot about relationships and sex (“if I am loving and giving towards my wife all day then she’ll have sex with me tonight”). But now that <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/22/power-in-naming-things/">it has a name</a>, I notice it everywhere:</p>



<ul><li>Work: “If I review your code quickly then you’ll make it a priority to review mine.”</li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/23/parenting-doesnt-do-what-i-thought/">Parenting</a>: “If we do a fun craft then you won’t pitch a hissy fit when I say no candy afterwards.”</li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/16/if-everyone-else-on-earth-disappeared-how-would-you-spend-your-time/">Friendships</a>: “If I don’t make fun of your weight then you won’t make fun of my height.”</li></ul>



<p>The punchline is that <strong>everyone would be <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/08/the-key-to-happiness-is-to-stop-getting-upset-all-the-dang-time/">happier</a> if the Nice Guy would <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/05/respond-to-vulnerability-with-vulnerability/">just ask</a> for what he wants.</strong> </p>



<p>I’ve talked before about how <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/13/clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind/">being clear is scary</a>, and how a lot of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/19/avoid-avoiding/">my actions are avoidance based</a>. In the spirit of my 2021 theme of the <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/30/2021-the-year-of-courage/">Year Of Courage</a>, this introduction to covert contracts has given me a new <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/23/2020-my-year-of-mantras/">mantra</a>:</p>



<p><strong>Just say it.</strong></p>



<p>Death to covert contracts. Ask for what you want. Clear is kind, unclear is unkind. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/24/intense-intervention-or-acceptance-pick-one/">Just say it</a>.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post started as a few simple sentences for my brother; tips on how to lose fat and manage blood sugar better. I decided to write them down as a reminder to myself, or anyone, especially those in middle age, as I’m starting the year with a health drive.</p>

<p>The golden triad is simple: <em>optimise your sleep, diet and activeness.</em></p>

<p>Consider this as 10 years of research simplified into a blog post. If knowledge was the answer we’d all be millionaires with six pack abs – lifestyle change is the only way.</p>

<p>Setting up for success: I recommend a few links throughout this, before reading I’d start with: <a href="https://youtu.be/qHUFgFYdJck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Behaviour/Environment Design</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Your diet is not only what you eat.</p>

  <p>It is what you watch, what you listen to, what you read, the people you hang around.</p>

  <p>Be mindful of the things you put into your body emotionally, spiritually and physically.”</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This one is fairly obvious, simply put, sleep restores body and mind, so try to improve your quality of sleep.</p>

<p>Also, sometimes we think we’re hungry when were really tired.</p>

<p>The book: Why We Sleep by Mathew Walker  <br>
The hack:  Try and sleep 8 hours every night, ideally at the same time, even on weekends. Don’t drink caffeine after midday. Avoid alcohol? <a href="https://youtu.be/EOaSWPROOxw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Five tips</a></p>


<p>I’ve always had success shedding a few pounds following the Slow Carb Diet; evolved or created by Tim Ferriss in The Four Hour Body. This is my go-to approach, as a bonus I also truly feel it’s <em>anti-inflammatory</em> effects.</p>

<p><em>I like it because at it’s core it’s about simplicity, no white food (bread/rice/pasta), no processed food (i.e. no sugar), so it really encourages you to eat home cooked <strong>whole foods</strong>.</em></p>

<p>There is a tonne of information online about what is involved:</p>

<p>A detailed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bb1EWGiOuNjnUCDYHzih0NlBRwYzpf6fqaHkFMDJg3k/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">real-user intro</a> or a <a href="http://www.williamhertling.com/2011/02/4-hour-body-fat-loss-cheat-sheet_27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cheat sheet</a> or an <a href="http://www.fitnessinfographics.com/diets-4-hour-body-slow-carb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">infograhic</a>.</p>

<p>I also believe in the health benefits of Time Restricted Feeding; due to a book called The Circadian Code, here’s an excellent intro/overview by the author: <a href="https://youtu.be/t0NI0jELuF4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Satchin Panda - Daily Rythms</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Lifestyle is what, WHEN and how much we Eat, Sleep, and Move on a daily basis.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My preference is to exercise/workout, or go for a walk, in the morning, before eating. I will drink water or black coffee, then tend to start eating around midday, I try not to eat at night (after 9:30). Meaning a 9-10 hour feeding window, giving my digestion a break. If an option, I would also swim and sauna in the evening.</p>

<p>I think calorie density/food satiety (feeling full) can play there parts (for example, eating enough so as not to snack, or starting meals with soups or veggies/salads): <a href="https://youtu.be/0CdwWliv7Hg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calorie Density: How To Eat More, Weigh Less and Live Longer</a></p>

<p>The hack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>whenever you break fast, start with a slow carb/high protein meal.</li>
  <li>Hydrate (2 litres water per day), don’t drink calories and have a day off (cheat day).</li>
  <li>Take pictures on your phone of everything you put in your mouth (for a week).</li>
  <li>Or log everything in myfitnesspal. (what gets measured gets managed).</li>
</ul>


<p>A complex and debatable topic, as there are many variables; types of exercise, what we can sustain/enjoy, our age, our ability to recover, etc.</p>

<p><em>For this goal, the idea is simple, do activities that keep our metabolism in fat burning mode</em>.</p>

<p>I believe we’re burning fat when in a calorie deficit (consuming less calories than we use). Muscle is denser/heavier than fat, building muscle means we use more calories to move, which means burning fat (our goal). Also, as we age we suffer from muscle atrophy (loss), so if we don’t build new muscle, we’re getting slowly weaker. “Use it or lose it, baby!”</p>

<p>As the saying goes, you can’t outrun a bad diet. Whilst running/swimming/cycling/yoga/pilates are great exercise for our health/heart/cardio, it isn’t the optimum way to burn fat, as they don’t build as much muscle.</p>

<p>Lifting weights, which also stimulates the heart and builds muscle, includes lifting our own bodyweight, so we can start with simple push-up/pull-ups, air squats, then perhaps progress to kettlebells/dumbbells. High Intensity Interval Training is an excellent way to kickstart the metabolism and continue fat burning for a few hours (some call it the afterburn effect), but this is probably true of many exercises.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a quick/light HIIT circuit/session using weights (time-lapse, 45 sec each exercise, 15 sec rest, x3 rounds): <a href="https://youtu.be/jdV_td3OJg4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HIIT session</a></p>

<p>Also, walking is an excellent recovery tool, great to keep the fire going and burn calories…</p>

<p>Ideally, in time, we would combine compound strength training (e.g. squats/deadlifts, to stop muscle atrophy) with some weighted HIIT classes (2-3 x per week), then some other general recovery exercises throughout the week (like walking/swimming).</p>

<p>N.B. An important point to remember is to fuel our body correctly, to optimise the benefits of whatever type of training protocol we follow. I try to balance this a slow carb (25%), medium fat(40%), high protein(35%), if possible.</p>

<p>The hack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>do as many wall push-ups, pull-ups (start on a chair), air squats, just before and 90 mins after meals, as you can (consider <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?&amp;q=negative+pull+ups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">progressions</a>)</li>
  <li>Replace car journeys with walking or cycling (great for the bank balance too)</li>
</ul>


<p>Putting on fat doesn’t happen overnight, neither does fat loss, or composition changes. Consistency over the long term is the key.  If you crack and have a tasty treat, or a day off exercise, make sure to enjoy it and start over the next day. James Clear has an excellent mindset/approach “I try to never miss two in a row”.</p>

<p>It’s not all about what you put in your mouth, keep active, and sleep well. Remember, losing anything from 1-2 pounds of fat per week really is winning.</p>

<p>The book(s): The Slight Edge/Atomic Habits  <br>
The hack: Simple, small and satisfying daily positive choices that move you in the right direction. Picture yourself winning, try to track how often you are choosing to take that action/behaviour, and enjoy all the small wins.</p>

<p>Albert Einstein is reputed to have said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn’t, pays it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>And I’m still a fat b*st*rd</em>…</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This is a&nbsp;declaration of&nbsp;a&nbsp;new era.</p>
<p>Cryptography was almost exclusively a&nbsp;military technology for&nbsp;centuries. When in&nbsp;1990s millions of&nbsp;personal computers connected to&nbsp;the&nbsp;internet, cryptography graduated from a&nbsp;munition to&nbsp;an&nbsp;industrial tool to&nbsp;secure credit card payments over a&nbsp;global, open and&nbsp;hostile environment.</p>
<p>For&nbsp;the&nbsp;next 20 years cryptographic research and&nbsp;engineering was very vibrant, but&nbsp;culminating in&nbsp;a&nbsp;loud confirmation by&nbsp;Edward Snowden that the&nbsp;<b>resulting products were not&nbsp;good enough</b>. SSL, PGP and&nbsp;other protocols turned out to&nbsp;be insecure, their implementations were buggy and&nbsp;hard maintain, all cryptographic primitives are broken and/or&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;misuse (MD5, RC4, RSA). High-level protocols were full of&nbsp;design and&nbsp;engineering mistakes and&nbsp;full of&nbsp;misunderstandings. The&nbsp;whole discipline had a&nbsp;culture of&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=47m58s">abstinence-only cryptography</a> and, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, poor engineering standards mixed with academic hubris and&nbsp;sabotage by&nbsp;the&nbsp;governments. 20 years of&nbsp;real-world cryptography produced a&nbsp;few useful artifacts and&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;mess.</p>
<p>Then, three things started to&nbsp;happen:</p>
<p>First, <b>personal computers and&nbsp;the&nbsp;internet reached very deep into lives of&nbsp;almost everyone</b>. Individuals now store their entire life in&nbsp;affordable pocket computers, businesses run all their operations over the&nbsp;internet, governments routinely participate in&nbsp;cyberwars. The&nbsp;importance of&nbsp;securing information shifted from “good to&nbsp;have” to&nbsp;“actively desirable”. Apple, the&nbsp;most valuable corporation on&nbsp;Earth, is selling billions of&nbsp;computers with _security_ and&nbsp;_privacy_ as&nbsp;a&nbsp;one of&nbsp;their main selling points.</p>
<p>Second, <b>Bitcoin and&nbsp;blockchains happened</b>. Things envisioned by&nbsp;Nick Szabo, Hal Finney, Wei Dai, Tim May and&nbsp;other cypherpunks back in&nbsp;1990s finally started to&nbsp;materialize. The&nbsp;internet discovered a&nbsp;whole new continent: with “wild west” anarchy, “gold rushes”, and&nbsp;massive real and&nbsp;fictional opportunities. On&nbsp;that continent the&nbsp;excellence in&nbsp;cryptography is no&nbsp;longer simply desirable, but&nbsp;becomes vitally important: the&nbsp;unauthorized access to&nbsp;data now equates to&nbsp;the&nbsp;immediate loss of&nbsp;unbounded amount of&nbsp;highly liquid assets.</p>
<p>Finally, a&nbsp;<b>new generation of&nbsp;software engineers has grown up</b>, who have an&nbsp;enormous enthusiasm to&nbsp;fix mistakes of&nbsp;the&nbsp;past and&nbsp;bring cryptographic engineering to&nbsp;a&nbsp;new level: with clean designs, excellent documentation, record-breaking performance, safety and&nbsp;usability, and, most importantly, strong ethics.</p>
<p>Today we have <b>robust cryptographic building blocks</b> that are not&nbsp;only safer and&nbsp;faster, but&nbsp;also designed to&nbsp;be composable and&nbsp;extensible to&nbsp;build on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;them with confidence: such as&nbsp;<a href="http://keccak.team/">Keccak</a>, <a href="https://github.com/miscreant/miscreant/wiki/AES-SIV">AES-SIV</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://ristretto.group/">Ristretto</a>.</p>
<p>We have <b>better programming languages</b> (Rust, Go, Swift) where engineering can be done with clarity, safety and&nbsp;ease. Pure Rust libraries such as&nbsp;<a href="https://miscreant.io/">Miscreant</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://dalek.rs/">Dalek</a> set a&nbsp;new bar for&nbsp;all cryptography engineers.</p>
<p>For&nbsp;the&nbsp;first time ever, the&nbsp;<b>ambitious ideas of&nbsp;zero-knowledge proofs</b> that were stuck in&nbsp;academic papers for&nbsp;many years are finally implemented for&nbsp;the&nbsp;blockchain applications: <a href="https://z.cash/">Zcash</a>, <a href="https://elementsproject.org/elements/confidential-transactions/">Confidential Transactions</a>, <a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/bulletproofs/">Bulletproofs</a>.</p>
<p>We are living in&nbsp;a&nbsp;renaissance era of&nbsp;cryptography: <b>we have fantastic tools, amazing people and&nbsp;strong demand for&nbsp;high-quality cryptographic products with direct financial incentives</b>. We are now at&nbsp;a&nbsp;lift-off point: we have a&nbsp;strong foundation to&nbsp;build upon with confidence. Now is the&nbsp;best time ever to&nbsp;learn and&nbsp;work with cryptography. Expect truly transformative technologies come out of&nbsp;this mix in&nbsp;the&nbsp;coming years.</p>

iPads, many teachers and students lost access to some of their favorite PhET simulations because these
simulations were built on our legacy Java code. With CheerpJ, we were able to create new
browser-compatible versions of 57 legacy Java simulations, restoring access at a time of great need. The
PhET teacher community could not be happier!</blockquote>
