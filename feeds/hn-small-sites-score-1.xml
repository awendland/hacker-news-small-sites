Invented by Gallant, Lambert, and Vanstone, this technique is commonly referred to as GLV Endomorphism and can now be activated in Bitcoin Core in order to improve the speed and efficiency of Bitcoin’s signature verification.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Hal Finney, GLV Endomorphism, and Patents</h2><p dir="ltr">The use of GLV Endomorphism was first explored by Hal Finney, one of Bitcoin’s earliest contributors and the <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155054.0" target="_blank">first person to receive a Bitcoin transaction from Satoshi Nakamoto</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In his <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3238.msg45565#msg45565" target="_blank">bitcointalk.org post</a> on February 8th, 2011, Finney shared that he had been inspired to experiment with this technique after reading the <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.394.3037&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography, by Hankerson, Menezes and Vanstone</a> - the same Vanstone who submitted the patent. His initial tests were promising, revealing an estimated 25% increase in the optimization of signature verification.</p><p dir="ltr">Since then, the feature has been implemented in Bitcoin Core but has yet to be enabled due to the existing patent around the cryptography that was filed on December 23rd, 1999.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">“Implementing it was one of the original motivations in developing the libsecp256k1 library, which has since replaced all cryptographic use of OpenSSL in Bitcoin Core,” shared Andrew Poelstra of <a href="https://blockstream.com/" target="_blank">Blockstream</a> with the BTC Times. “(But) it was disabled by default to avoid patent concerns and has never been enabled in Bitcoin Core.”</p><p dir="ltr">With the patent expiring, Bitcoin developers will now move quickly to enable GLV Endomorphism: the feature had actually been rigorously tested throughout the development of the libsecp256k1 library, making the optimization just as well-tested and mature as any other part of the library.</p><p dir="ltr">Once activated, nodes should expect to see a significant drop in ongoing resource usage as Bitcoin Core will now utilize the new signature verification method for freshly received transactions and blocks.</p><p dir="ltr">“Once you've caught up to the tip, nodes need to verify every new transaction and block that comes in. All of that will see a direct reduction in CPU usage,” <a href="https://twitter.com/pwuille" target="_blank">Pieter Wuille</a> of <a href="https://chaincode.com/" target="_blank">Chaincode Labs</a> told the BTC Times.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us" target="_blank">Dr. Adam Back</a> of Blockstream commented, “this performance improvement was first drawn attention to for use in Bitcoin by Hal Finney.

<p>God...dammit</p>


<p>It's hard to see a child outside today without some kind of iDevice pumping high fidelity 192kbps stereo lossless audio into their shiny white headphones, but <em>BACK IN MY</em> <em>DAY, </em>the iPod hadn't been invented yet. &nbsp;Pickings were slim. &nbsp;Walkmen were outdated, CD players were pricey and would skip if bumped around despite their ESP features, MiniDisk was another stillborn Sony format, and MP3 players were still ugly and ridiculously expensive (at least Apple fixed the ugly part).</p>
<p>Thus, Tiger Electronics, pioneers in the high tech market of McDonald's Happy Meal toys, invented "Hit Clips"</p>
<p><iframe width="584" height="438" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N9pgMmDmd8w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hit Clips were small cheap digital audio players that could play music off of little plastic cartridges. &nbsp;The audio was mono, sounded terrible, and only included a 60 second sample of a song.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5621" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Better hold on to that patent Tiger...</p>
<p>Still, the songs were officially licensed and included bands like The Backstreet Boys, Aaron Carter, Sugar Ray, and ...Dreamstreet</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="Dream_street_blue_house" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="456" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house.jpg 635w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house-300x215.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house-417x300.jpg 417w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px"></a></p>
<p>The 00s were a very strange time for all of us...</p>
<p>Anywho, while helping my 17 year old cousin move some furniture, we came across a large collection of hit clip cartridges, but no player. &nbsp;Struck with a wave of nostalgia, I asked if I could take one to do a tear down.</p>
<p>Thus this post.</p>

<p>The hit clip cartridge has 8 metal contacts on the back:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5620" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Taking it apart, I was hoping to find some identifiable piece of hardware, but instead found the chip-on-board construction that is so popular with super-low-cost low-power electronics along with a few discrete components.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5625" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Under this blob of epoxy is a wire-bonded chip of silicon. &nbsp;The song is likely hard coded directly into the silicon wafer rather than being programmed there after the fact using flash or OTP memory. &nbsp;It's cheaper that way if you make enough units.</p>
<p>This didn't give me a whole lot to work from, but assuming the capacitor is a bypass capacitor (decent assumption), I at least had some idea of how to power the thing. &nbsp;Poking around for a bit gave me this schematic:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="hitclipschem" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem-300x225.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>I'm not sure what the two No Connect pins do, but apparently there was a version of the Hit Clip that allowed music to be recorded to special cartridges, so I'm guessing they have something to do with that.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure how much voltage the part needed, but a quick search on Ebay gave me some idea:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay.png"><img loading="lazy" title="ebay" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay.png" alt="" width="720" height="475" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay.png 720w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay-300x197.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay-454x300.png 454w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></a></p>
<p>3 AAAs means 4.5V. &nbsp;Also, can you believe people are bidding $40+ for these things?</p>
<p>Before I could get serious about debugging, I needed some way to connect traces to the board easily. &nbsp;I ended up soldering on some header pins and plugging it into a breadboard:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5629" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>My original assumption was that the bottom-left pin was ground as it connected to the mystery chip more times than the other power-pin. &nbsp;You'll note the scratch-outs indicate that I was wrong. &nbsp;In that configuration, the chip drew 200+mA during the half-second that I left it connected. &nbsp;Presumably there's a reverse bias protection diode that I was blowing up.</p>
<p>Swapping the power pins around, the current started at around 280<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>A before dropping to zero.</p>
<p>Convinced that I had it right, I moved to the other pins. &nbsp;There were four pins to chose from and a voltage measurement showed me that two of them were at the 4.5V rail while the other two were settled close to 0V.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Low</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Low</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Since I had already identified my two power pins, I had to assume that these four pins were used for data somehow and that the two high pins had internal pull up resistors.</p>
<p>Connecting Pin1 to ground sinks about 12mA from that pin. &nbsp;12mA is much to high to be from a simple pull-up resistor. &nbsp;My guess is that it's some kind of output pin to tell the player that the cartridge is inserted all the way. I decided to leave it alone and move on to Pin 3.</p>
<p>Connecting Pin 3 to ground caused the circuit's current draw to rise from zero up to 300<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>A. Removing this short did nothing to change the current increase although it did settle down after about 60 seconds.</p>

<p>This is when I knew I was on to something. &nbsp;60 seconds of current draw meant that this part was outputting its music sample! &nbsp;I was expecting the player to need to do something more complicated like pull bytes of music off the cartridge over a SPI bus or at least provide a clock source, but it turns out that the cartridge can handle that all by itself. &nbsp;I'm guessing that the two on-board series resistors are used for fine-tuning its internal clock source after the chip has been printed.</p>
<p>I quickly whipped out my oscilloscope and took a trace of Pin 2:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace.png"><img loading="lazy" title="scopetrace" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace.png" alt="" width="1191" height="816" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace.png 1191w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace-300x205.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace-1024x701.png 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace-437x300.png 437w" sizes="(max-width: 1191px) 100vw, 1191px"></a></p>
<p>Data!</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p><em>While doing a similar job on a different Hit Clip (Who Let the Dogs Out by the Baha Men), I discovered different behavior. &nbsp;Connecting Pin 3 to ground did nothing while commenting pin 1 to&nbsp;ground toggled between data and no data. &nbsp;I'm not sure if there was a change in the Hit Clip design through generations, or if I took imprecise notes. &nbsp;The PCB layouts of the two clips is clearly different, and it looks like pin 3 is NC on the second clip.</em></p>
<p>I noticed an intermittent square wave with a period of almost exactly 24kHz and a duty cycle that varied with time. &nbsp;Pin 4 had similar data.</p>
<p>So there was definitely something going on here, and it was definitely digital somehow, but I needed some way to capture loads of digital data to later analyze. &nbsp;Fortunately, Santa gave me an 8 bit Saleae logic analyzer for Christmas:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="saleae" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>I actually picked up the Hit Clip while looking for a good project to test this thing out. &nbsp;It's a really nice device, and the Windows/Mac/Linux compatible software is really slick.</p>
<p>Anywho, with the Saleae connected to Pin 2 and Pin 4, I reactivated the circuit and took a trace at a 24MHz sample rate. &nbsp;I came up with this:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace.png"><img loading="lazy" title="saleae trace" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace.png" alt="" width="1647" height="986" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace.png 1647w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace-300x179.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace-1024x613.png 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace-500x300.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1647px) 100vw, 1647px"></a></p>
<p>It was strange at first to see how the two data lines appeared to take turns, but once I remembered that Hit Clips only output in mono, it made a lot more sense. &nbsp;These two lines are encoding the same mono stream of audio.</p>
<p>Looking closer at the low-going blips, I noticed that they were quantized. &nbsp;The length of each blip was always near some integer multiple of 0.3333<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s.</p>
<p>Knowing what I know about audio amplifiers, I theorized that these two outputs are meant to directly drive the push and pull FETs of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-D_amplifier">class D amplifier</a> in real time. &nbsp;In other words, a blip on one line pulls the waveform output voltage up while a blip on the other pulls it down. &nbsp;The width of the blip indicates how hard (or for how long) it pulls.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Redditor urquan points out that this kind of modulation is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-sigma_modulation">Sigma-Delta Modulation</a>.</p>
<p>While it's technically a digital output, it's encoded in such a way that it can be fed directly into an analog circuit.</p>
<p>I figured that if I could give myself a stream of this data, I could probably simulate the output digitally. &nbsp;To cut down on the number of samples, I exported the trace to a CSV file that only records timestamps when something changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output.png"><img loading="lazy" title="saleae output" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output.png" alt="" width="534" height="810" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output.png 534w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output-197x300.png 197w" sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px"></a></p>
<p>In order to make use of this data, I just needed to record how much time passed between a signal dropping low and rising up again, and I should have such data points arriving at almost exactly 24kHz. &nbsp;All of the data from one pin was given a positive value while the data from the other pin was given a negative value.</p>
<p>I also tried quantizing the data by dividing the time delays by 0.33333<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s, and while this worked for small numbers, I noticed that some of the larger numbers fell pretty far from a solid integer.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3.png"><img loading="lazy" title="divby3" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3.png" alt="" width="603" height="555" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3.png 603w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3-300x276.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3-325x300.png 325w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"></a></p>
<p>It looked like 0.33333<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s was a bad estimate of the actual quantization time. &nbsp;Thinking a little more critically, I noticed that a 24kHz wave has a period of 41.67<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s. &nbsp;When divided by my quantization time, this comes out to almost exactly 125 which is pretty darn close to 128, a power of two.</p>
<p>Changing my quantization time to 0.3255<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s or <span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_d7efcee3110178fb773e908bd2b03eda.gif" alt=""></span> yielded much better results:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255.png"><img loading="lazy" title="divby3255" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255.png" alt="" width="603" height="555" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255.png 603w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255-300x276.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255-325x300.png 325w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"></a></p>
<p>Now the question is what to do with these numbers.</p>
<p>My first attempt involved just pumping them into a WAV file and taking a listen. &nbsp;With this setup, all of the negative numbers were negative points on the waveform. &nbsp;Here's the first 400 samples:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.png"><img loading="lazy" title="straightwav" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.png" alt="" width="937" height="523" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.png 937w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav-300x167.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav-500x279.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 937px) 100vw, 937px"></a></p>
<p>I took these values, gained them up to fill a 16 bit WAV file and took a listen:</p>
<p><audio controls="controls"><source src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support the audio element</audio></p>
<p>Firstly, I was shocked to get anything even closely resembling audio. &nbsp;Especially something so recognizable. &nbsp;That being said, the audio quality isn't the best. &nbsp;The raw values out of the cartridge only extend from around -60 to +60 which leads me to believe that it's encoded as a 7-bit signed integer (-64 to +63). &nbsp;7-bit audio isn't exactly lossless, but I wasn't convinced that this was the best I could do.</p>
<p>I found two problems with the way I was decoding the audio:</p>
<h3>Empty samples</h3>
<p>I noticed looking at the Saleae trace that there were many periods in the 24kHz digital data stream where neither trace showed a blip.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip.png"><img loading="lazy" title="noblip" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip.png" alt="" width="1055" height="905" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip.png 1055w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip-300x257.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip-1024x878.png 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip-349x300.png 349w" sizes="(max-width: 1055px) 100vw, 1055px"></a></p>
<p>Because my script was only looking at the blips, I simply skipped passed these data points. &nbsp;The end result was that the music played slightly faster than it should have. &nbsp;This was obvious when my output WAV file was shorter than my original trace.</p>
<p>I modified the script to detect when more than <span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_e8eaa034768987e29c645972e4862a53.gif" alt=""></span> passed between consecutive blips and interpolate blips at the proper places by just repeating the previous value.</p>
<h3>Push Pull simulation</h3>
<p>I noticed later on that I wasn't really simulating the push-pull driver that the Hit Clip likely used. &nbsp;The digital encoding is actually more of a derivative of the output waveform rather than the waveform itself. &nbsp;In other words, a positive value doesn't guarantee that the output will be positive, but rather that it will have a positive slope. &nbsp;A larger value specifies a larger slope.</p>
<p>I modified my script to keep a running value starting from zero where the incoming value from the cartridge is added to the previous value to generate the next one. &nbsp;There was a problem of DC drift because the values don't all add up to zero. &nbsp;My first time through, I found that the largest value was 1 while the smallest value was somewhere around -50,000 which overflowed my signed 16 bit WAV output.</p>
<p>I solved this by …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="background">background</h2>
<p>i bought a macbook pro (16", 2019) in May as my XPS died (motherboard fried maybe?). personally i dont like apple at all, but fuck it, i had never used a mac before, so why not? i really love to try new things</p>
<p>for my experience i am satisfied with my macbook, except for some stupid issues, one of which is what im going to dig into in this article</p>
<p><strong>shutdown/restart hang (caused by a kernel panic)</strong></p>
<p>i found many users have encounterd the (almost) same panic: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/constant-kernel-panics-userspace-watchdog-timeout-no-successful-checkins-from-com-apple-windowserver.2222878/">https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/constant-kernel-panics-userspace-watchdog-timeout-no-successful-checkins-from-com-apple-windowserver.2222878/</a></p>
<p>Also on reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/hwk0o5/how_to_stop_watchdog_timeout_kernel_panics/">it's the exactly same panic</a></p>
<p>if you look at the posts you will find they are actually having different problems except all the problems lead to (the same) watchdog timeout</p>
<p>my panic report looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>panic(cpu 2 caller 0xffffff7f881a1aae): watchdog timeout: no checkins from watchdogd in 302 seconds (11 totalcheckins since monitoring last enabled), shutdown in progress

</pre></div>
<p>everytime the hang happens, it eventually gives me a backtrace like this</p>
<p>i called customer service, the friendly tech support suggested that i should reinstall the system (if i cant figure out how to reproduce the panic),
so i erased the partition table and restarted from scratch, then the hang happened again after a few shutdowns</p>
<p>i was really upset, but as i cant reproduce the panic, i cant even ask apple to fix it</p>
<p>then i decided to look into the panic myself</p>
<h2 id="the-backtrace">the backtrace</h2>
<p>the first glance at panic report tells me it might be something wrong with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Controller">SMC</a>, i followed apple's guide to reset SMC, without luck</p>
<p>apple diagnostics reports no issue</p>
<p>so it must be in the kernel right?</p>
<p>lets start reading the backtrace</p>
<p>by reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">Call Stack</a> you will have a basic understanding of how kernel subroutines get executed</p>
<p>so how is it executed? just read from brace bottom to top</p>
<p>first thing first, the panic report only gives me related kernel extensions, to find out exactly what code is causing the panic, we have to get symbols from the kernel (extensions)</p>
<p>we dont need to download anything to debug such a problem, the kernel is installed on our machine, just copy it, along with all the related extensions:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>/System/Library/Kernels/kernel <span># kernel</span>
/System/Library/Kernels/Extensions <span># extensions</span>
</pre></div>
<p>follow <a href="https://www.repleo.nl/wordpress/symbolicate-os-x-kernel-panics-using-lldb/">https://www.repleo.nl/wordpress/symbolicate-os-x-kernel-panics-using-lldb/</a> to locate symbols</p>
<p>the kernel slide bytes, and AppleSMC text base address can be found in the panic report, like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>Kernel slide:     0x0000000007400000

com.apple.driver.AppleSMC(3.1.9)[4589419D-7CCC-39A9-9E2F-F73FE42DD902]@0xffffff7f881a9000-&gt;0xffffff7f881c7fff
</pre></div>
<p><img alt="lldb" src="https://jm33.me/img/mac_panic/lldb.webp"></p>
<p>from this screenshot we can see more clearly about what's going on, the backtrace tree is now symbolicated</p>
<h2 id="lets-reverse-some-code">lets reverse some code</h2>
<p>as far as i know AppleSMC kext is proprietary, the only way to know what it does is to reverse it</p>
<p>from lldb, we dont see anything worthy of reversing, its just a watchdog timeout call</p>
<p>anyways, AppleSMC module seems interesting, lets reverse it</p>
<p>after loading the AppleSMC binary, we have to rebase the binary so it matches the address at runtime: Edit, segment, rebase program</p>
<p>press G then paste the address <code>0xffffff7f881b6d9c</code>, we get:</p>

<p>I don't think the <code>while (1)</code> loop is ever going to end. When <code>thread_policy_set</code> fails, it enters the loop and never breaks out.</p>
<p><code>v13</code> represents 1 sec I think. Basically this loop puts a mutex io lock, then feeds watchdog (when the timer pointer plus 248 is null or whatever), finally it sleeps for 1 sec, repeats the loop.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!*</span><span>((</span><span>_BYTE</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>this</span> <span>+</span> <span>248</span><span>))</span>

</pre></div>
<p>When it stops feeding the watchdog, watchdog timeouts after about 3 min, hence the panic.</p>
<h2 id="whats-watchdog">whats watchdog</h2>
<p>from <code>man watchdogd</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>watchdogd ensures that the system is healthy and able to make forward progress throughout the system lifecycle.
    If watchdogd or the Watchdog KEXT determine that the system is unhealthy they will attempt to take corrective action and ultimately may panic the system to get it back to a usable state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, in the case of the Linux operating system, a user-space watchdog daemon may simply kick the watchdog periodically without performing any tests. As long as the daemon runs normally, the system will be protected against serious system crashes such as a kernel panic. To detect less severe faults, the daemon[4] can be configured to perform tests that cover resource availability (e.g., sufficient memory and file handles, reasonable CPU time), evidence of expected process activity (e.g., system daemons running, specific files being present or updated), overheating, and network activity, and system-specific test scripts or programs may also be run.[5]</p>
<p>Upon discovery of a failed test, the Linux watchdog daemon may attempt to perform a software-initiated restart, which can be preferable to a hardware reset as the file systems will be safely unmounted and fault information will be logged. However it is essential to have the insurance of the hardware timer as a software restart can fail under a number of fault conditions. In effect, this is a dual-stage watchdog with the software restart comprising the first stage and the hardware reset the second stage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from my understanding, <code>SMCWatchDogTimer</code> stopped kicking watchdog somehow (at <code>IOLockUnlock()</code>), then watchdog realizes <code>AppleSMC</code> might be dead, it initiates a panic, reboot and throw the panic report to user</p>

<p>Landfill is an interesting product. The price fluctuates far enough that it can fluctuate from positive to negative and back again. If someone is building a tunnel, you can probably get paid to <i>take</i> landfill. If someone is building an island, you can probably get paid for <i>supplying</i> landfill. There are projects that can only go ahead at certain times: the Hornsby quarry remediation project was only viable because the north connex was being built.</p><p>That's slightly obscure, and there's not much you can do with landfill other than, well, fill land. But we are about to hit a very unusual combination of circumstances which will create some head-scratching economics.</p><p>Solar panels are getting cheaper. The learning rate for solar energy is (probably) the steepest of any energy technology yet deployed. So we can be pretty much assured that within the next decade we'll have enough solar power to power anything we want (as long as it is day time). We'll overprovision our houses and factories (and offices if they still exist) with generation capacity so that in the morning or evening when the sun is hitting at an oblique angle, we still have enough for our needs.</p><p>That means that at peak times, we'll have <i>more</i> than enough solar energy. What do we do with that surplus energy?</p><p>Actually, it's slightly worse than that, because there are some (non-renewable) power plants that can't fully idle. A nuclear reactor can't fully turn off for a few minutes in the middle of the day. Neither can a coal power plant. So they will be running at a time when nobody has a need for power. That may be OK -- if you make a lot of money generating power overnight, you might be prepared to pay some small penalties during the day for overproduction if that's what it takes to keep the system running.</p><p>Which means that someone, somewhere is going to get paid to create a dummy electrical load. We've never (as far as I can tell) seen "grid stability" <i>payments</i> <i>for</i> <i>using</i>&nbsp;electricity before. But it's the inevitable conclusion of where we are the moment: discounted rates for consumers who can change their requirements to help with grid stability exist already; there's no reason that this wouldn't still be necessary when the price of electricity hits zero.</p><p>Therfore, there will be times of the day (in certain weather conditions) when some companies will get <i>paid</i> to use electricity.</p><p>The kinds of consumers that will get paid are likely to be doing something that is energy inefficient (obviously), and not particularly capital intensive (since their equipment will be idle a lot of the time), and making something that can be stored indefinitely (because you definitely can't do just-in-time manufacturing if you are waiting for times when the price for electricity goes negative). But quite a lot of products could be made to fit that.</p><p>A possible product that I think is likely to play out this way is water desalination. Desalinated water is very expensive because of the embedded energy cost: it's often described as "bottled electricity". Currently we tend to use reverse osmosis because it's more energy efficient; but if you don't have to worry about energy costs, you might choose instead to boil water and distil it: since the capital costs are cheaper.</p><p>Now things get even weirder. Let's say you are getting paid 0.5c per kWH (a not unreasonable price) that you use. You might find that you can sell the water for -0.01c per kL. Yes, you can make a profit: not just giving it away, but you could still be profitable while paying someone to consume it.</p><p>If this all plays out, we might have water and electricity (at times) having a negative price. These are common inputs to other processes, so it doesn't end there: there might be a business that requires water and electricity occasionally, but the input costs normally make the business unviable. They in turn might be able to make some money selling the end product at a negative price if their inputs have a negative price.</p><p>If this sounds all a bit unbelievable, remember that up until very recently, many economists thought that it was impossible to have negative interest rates... right up until the moment when they started happening. We already have examples of products that oscillate between positive and negative prices, it's just that they were never fundamental inputs to other processes. My prediction is that by 2030 we will have a small part of the economy ticking away profitably making negative price products.</p><p>(Post scriptum: now for the completely weird: how do negative price products interact with negative interest rates?)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><h2>PilBox - Building Android Apps in PicoLisp</h2>
<p><b>Build your Apps in PicoLisp without an Android SDK</b></p><p>
PilBox ("PicoLisp Box") is a generic Android App which allows to write Apps in
pure PicoLisp, without touching Java, and without the need of an Android SDK.</p><p>
You do not need to root your device. And - if you prefer - you do not need a
separate development machine (PC or laptop): All can be done in a terminal on
the device, and even in a Lisp REPL while the App is running.</p><p>
Note: <b>PilBox needs Android &gt;= 5.0!</b></p><p>
It comes with PicoLisp binaries for Arm64 pre-installed. If your device has an
Arm32 CPU, you can - after installing the PilBox App but before starting it -
download and install the emulator version <a href="https://software-lab.de/arm32.zip">https://software-lab.de/arm32.zip</a>.
If this was done by mistake, you can revert to Arm64 binaries with
<a href="https://software-lab.de/arm64.zip">https://software-lab.de/arm64.zip</a>.</p><h3>How does it work?</h3><p>
The PilBox App itself (called the "PilBox kernel") is written in Java, the
normal Android way. It displays a WebView GUI, and starts a PicoLisp <b>binary</b>
compiled for Arm64 CPUs. This binary may now run any PicoLisp program, by
setting up a local web server where the WebView component connects to, possibly
opening a database, and doing whatever is desired.</p><p>
The PilBox kernel provides an interface to the Android Java runtime environment.
To the PicoLisp code it looks like a remote database, where Java objects are
mapped to PicoLisp DB objects, and Java functions and methods are executed via
remote procedure calls.</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/457.d" alt="PilBox.png"></p><p>
If a ZIP file is passed to the PilBox kernel upon start-up, it is unpacked, and
may override or extend whatever is installed already. This is done typically by
clicking on a downloaded ZIP, or by "sharing" it from some other App.</p><p>
Then it looks for a file "App.l" in the App's working directory, <span>load</span>s it,
and listens at the port number found in a file "Port". Out of the box, "Port" is
8081, and "App.l" is a meta-App which provides a convenient runtime environment
for managing Apps installed via the ZIP mechanism.</p><h3>Getting started</h3><p>
You can download the PilBox App from Google Play store, or get it directly from
<a href="https://software-lab.de/pilBox.apk">https://software-lab.de/pilBox.apk</a>. In the latter case, you may need to
enable "Unknown Sources" in your settings.</p><p>

<span>pilBox.apk</span> contains the PilBox kernel App as an APK ("Android Package"), and
the ZIP files are small demo applications.</p><p>
Then go to Apps -&gt; PilBox -&gt; Permissions and enable "Location" and "Storage".</p><h3>The pre-installed generic App</h3><p>
Initially, when started without any ZIP file, the PilBox kernel shows an empty
white screen with a PicoLisp logo on the top-left and a settings icon on the
top-right (the screenshots were taken on a tablet, so on a phone the proportions
may differ):</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/426.d" alt="emptyPilBox.png"></p><h4>The REPL</h4><p>
If you tap on the PicoLisp logo on the left, it opens a REPL (Read-Eval-Print
Loop) - a kind of terminal window into the App:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/430.d" alt="repl1.png"></p><p>
The REPL gives you control over many aspects of the App. It has a large text
field for displaying results and editing text, a single-line text field at the
bottom for command input, and the three buttons "Eval", "Edit" and "Clear
Cache".</p><p>
The main purpose is to enter commands, and look at their results in the text
area. As the "Eval" button is the first on the page, it is implicitly activated
if you hit <span>Enter</span> when typing a command.</p><p>
As a special case, if a command starts with a dollar-sign:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/431.d" alt="repl2.png"></p><p>
it is taken as a Shell command, here <span>ls -l</span>, and shows the listing in the text
area:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/432.d" alt="repl3.png"></p><p>
Otherwise (not starting with a dollar-sign), the command line is evaluated as a
Lisp expression. For example, after typing <span>(pp 'gps)</span>, we get:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/433.d" alt="repl4.png"></p><p>
If you type a file or path name like <span>App.l</span> in the command line,</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/434.d" alt="repl5.png"></p><p>
and press the "Edit" button, the file is opened in the text area and may be
edited:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/435.d" alt="repl6.png"></p><p>
Press the "Done" button to close the file again.</p><p>
The "Clear Cache" button invalidates the <span>WebView</span> cache, and is useful after
changing an App's CSS file.</p><p>
Tapping on the PicoLisp logo takes you back to the start screen.</p><p>
Normally, you won't edit your App's sources in the REPL, but instead edit them
in a terminal program like <span>Termux</span> with <span>vim</span> or <span>emacs</span>, and pass them as a
ZIP file to PilBox as described below.</p><h4>Settings</h4><p>
If you tap on the settings icon on the right of the start screen, it opens a
default settings page. Initially it shows two tabs, one with all standard
PicoLisp localizations</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/436.d" alt="settings1.png"></p><p>
and one listing the installed PILs (PicoLisp Apps):</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/437.d" alt="settings2.png"></p><p>
Initially the list is empty.</p><p>
The REPL behavior and the default settings page are normally overridden by
installed Apps, and are available only on the start screen.</p><h3>Installing your own App(s)</h3><p>
The empty PilBox kernel is not very useful, except for perhaps exploring the App
environment in the REPL.</p><p>
To install your own App, prepare a ZIP file with a directory containing
</p><ul>
   <li>One or more <span>*.l</span> Lisp files, where one of them must be named <span>App.l</span></li>
   <li>Optionally a CSS file named <span>lib.css</span></li>
   <li>Optionally an icon in a file named <span>logo.png</span></li>
   <li>Optionally a directory called <span>loc/</span> with localizations</li>
</ul><p>
The file <span>App.l</span> is mandatory, and is <span>load</span>ed to start the App. If one of the
<span>*.l</span> files is named <span>settings.l</span>, then it overrides the behavior of the
settings icon while this App is active.</p><p>
The first Lisp expression in <span>App.l</span> is <span>read</span> in, and should be a string
giving the App's name.</p><p>
You pass your ZIP file to the PilBox kernel by "sharing" it from another App
(e.g. the "Downloads" App). As I use the <span>Termux</span> App for local development, I
usually generate the ZIP file directly on the device, pass it to the
<span>termux-share</span> utility, using the world-readable <span>storage</span> area:
</p><pre>   $ zip -rFS ~/storage/downloads/myApp.zip myApp/
   $ termux-share ~/storage/downloads/myApp.zip
</pre><p>

When the PilBox kernel starts, it scans all top-level directories for other
files named "App.l". Each of those directories is taken as a PIL App. If only a
single one is found, it is started immediately, otherwise a list of buttons with
the App names is displayed.</p><h3>Hello World</h3><p>
For a minimal example for a PIL App, look at
<a href="https://software-lab.de/hello.zip">https://software-lab.de/hello.zip</a>. It consists of a directory <span>hello/</span> with
a single file <span>App.l</span>. This file contains:
</p><pre>   "Hello World"

   (menu "Hello World!"
      (&lt;h1&gt; "center blue" "Hello World!") )
</pre><p>

The first line gives the App's name, and the <span>menu</span> expression displays a
header line in blue with "Hello World!".</p><p>
If you pass this ZIP to the PilBox kernel, it immediately shows this screen
(because it is the first and only App installed so far):</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/440.d" alt="helloApp.png"></p><p>
A tap on the PicoLisp icon has no effect now (we are no longer on the PilBox
kernel start screen), but the settings page is still the default one. If we open
the "PILs" tab, we see that there is a single package "PIL-hello" installed:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/441.d" alt="helloSettings.png"></p><h3>Calculator</h3><p>
Let's move on to something more interesting than the obligatory "Hello World".
The package </p><li><a href="https://software-lab.de/calc.zip">https://software-lab.de/calc.zip</a></li><p> contains a calculator App.</p><p>
After we pass it to the PilBox, the start screen now shows <i>two</i> Apps:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/443.d" alt="calcPilBox.png"></p><p>
The calculator can be started by hitting the topmost button:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/445.d" alt="calculator.png"></p><p>
Play with it around a little. It employs PicoLisp's big numbers, so it can only
handle integers (of unlimited size though).</p><p>
If we go to the "PILs" tab in the settings, we see that now there are two
packages,</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/447.d" alt="settings3.png"></p><p>
and clicking on the "PIL-calc" link lists the package's contents:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/450.d" alt="pil-calc.png"></p><p>
The back-arrow brings you back to the "PILs" tab.</p><p>
Enabling the checkboxes in the "PILs" tab allows for the removal of the selected
packages. It removes <i>all</i> files in the package, so it must be handled with
care!</p><p>
The PilBox kernel start screen can be reached by clicking on the PicoLisp icon.
There we can also get to the REPL again.</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/451.d" alt="repl7.png"></p><h3>The Demo App</h3><p>
Finally, there is <a href="https://software-lab.de/demo.zip">https://software-lab.de/demo.zip</a>, an extensive but rather
silly Demo App. It contains examples for conventional GUI components, as they
are needed in database applications,</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/452.d" alt="demoFields.png"></p><p>
but also or accessing the Android toolbox, like taking pictures or scanning
QR-Codes, reading GPS coordinates, and posting notifications:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/454.d" alt="demoNotify.png"></p><p>
Feel free to install it, play around, and study the code.</p><h3>Using the Android API</h3><p>
PilBox is only useful if it can communicate with the Android API on the device.
Therefore, it loads the Android library "lib/android.l" in the PicoLisp
distribution (which in turn is built upon the Java reflection API).</p><p>
The central function in "lib/android.l" is <span>java</span>. It maps Lisp function calls
to the Java virtual machine, supporting eight types of calls:
</p><pre>   (java "cls" 'T ['any ..]) -&gt; obj       New object
   (java 'obj 'msg ['any ..]) -&gt; any      Send message to object
   (java 'obj "fld" ["fld" ..]) -&gt; any    Value of object field
   (java "cls" 'msg ['any ..]) -&gt; any     Call method in class
   (java "cls" "fld" ["fld" ..]) -&gt; any   Value of class field
   (java T "cls" ["cls" ..]) -&gt; obj       Define interface
   (java 'obj) -&gt; [lst ..]                Reflect object
   (java "cls") -&gt; cls                    Get class
</pre><p>

Depending on the type of the first one or two arguments (transient symbol,
internal symbol, or <span>T</span>) it behaves differently.</p><p>
This is not trivial, and requires some understanding of the Java side. For
example, to aquire a <span>WakeLock</span>, Java code samples do
</p><pre>   PowerManager powerManager = (PowerManager)getSystemService(POWER_SERVICE);
   WakeLock wakeLock = powerManager.newWakeLock(PowerManager.PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK, "MyWakelockTag");
   wakeLock.acquire();
</pre><p>

To implement the same in PicoLisp, we must first look up the constant values
<span>POWER_SERVICE</span> and <span>PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK</span>. They are found in
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#POWER_SERVICE">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#POWER_SERVICE</a>
as "power" and in
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.html#PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.html#PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK</a>
as 1. With that, the corresponding Lisp code is:
</p><pre>   (java
      (java (java CONTEXT 'getSystemService "power") 'newWakeLock 1 "MyWakelockTag")
      'acquire )
</pre><p>

The gobal constant <span>CONTEXT</span> is defined in …</p></div></div>

</div>
      
      <p>If you like circles, spheres and shapes that fit nicely together, you’ll probably like spherical circle packings. In this post, I’ll describe how I turned one into a lamp.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>A circle packing is an arrangement of circles that fit tightly together, so that no circle can be enlarged without causing overlaps. Circle packing is a nice mathematical rabbit hole<sup id="fnref:circle_packing" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:circle_packing">1</a></sup>, but this post focuses on Steiner chains, which is the type of packing I used for building the lamp (more pictures of which can be found <a href="https://stuffmatic.com/projects/circle-lamp">here</a>).</p>

<h2 id="steiner-chains">Steiner chains</h2>

<p>A Steiner chain<sup id="fnref:steiner_chain" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:steiner_chain">2</a></sup> is constructed by surrounding a circle with a ring of additional circles that are all also tangent to a larger circle. In other words, a Steiner chain consists of circles packed in a circle (a concept I’ve previously explored in <a href="https://stuffmatic.com/projects/copper-circles">this project</a>).</p>

<div>
  
    <p><img src="https://stuffmatic.com/assets/posts/circle_packing_lamp/steiner.png" alt="A simple Steiner chain.">
    </p>
    
  
  <p>A simple Steiner chain with a center circle surrounded by a ring of 9 smaller circles, all tangent to the bounding circle (dashed).</p>
  
</div>

<p>The fact that a Steiner chain fits tightly in a circle can be used to construct nested packings by repeatedly replacing the center circle with a smaller Steiner chain. Here’s an animation illustrating the idea.</p>

<div>
  
    <p><img src="https://stuffmatic.com/assets/posts/circle_packing_lamp/steiner.gif" alt="Nesting Steiner chains">
    </p>
    
  
  <p>Nesting Steiner chains.</p>
  
</div>

<p>The lamp is built from a total of 13 circles, forming a nested Steiner chain with two rings, each containing 6 circles.</p>

<h2 id="deforming-a-circle-packing">Deforming a circle packing</h2>

<p>It’s intuitively clear that a circle packing can’t be arbitrarily deformed without “ruining” it. For example, stretching a packing in one direction turns the circles into ellipses. Luckily, there is a class of circle preserving planar deformations, so called Möbius transformations<sup id="fnref:mobius_transformation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mobius_transformation">3</a></sup>, that can be used to parametrically control the shape of a circle packing. This is really useful for parametric design purposes.</p>

    </p>
    
  
  <p>Möbius transformations applied to a circle packing.</p>
  
</div>

<h2 id="going-spherical">Going spherical</h2>

<p>The Möbius transformations described in the previous section turn out to be the only options for transforming a circle packing in the plane. However, if we venture into three dimensional space, there is another option: <em>inverse stereographic projection</em><sup id="fnref:stereographic" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:stereographic">4</a></sup>. Loosely speaking, this transformation can be used to wrap a circle packing around a sphere.</p>

<p>For this project, I put together a parametric design tool to explore interesting spherical circle packings. This tool generates packings in three steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a nested Steiner chain</li>
  <li>Apply a Möbius transformation</li>
  <li>Wrap the packing around a sphere using inverse stereographic projection</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s an animation showing the tool in action.</p>

<h2 id="generating-the-blueprint">Generating the blueprint</h2>

<p>The previous sections outline a method for creating nice spherical circle packings. In order to create physical objects from these packings, I wrote some code for procedural generation of laser cutter blueprints. One cruical thing to keep in mind when making a pendant lamp is the center of mass. To ensure the lamp is hanging properly, the center of mass and the wire hole need to lie on the same vertical line. The center of mass calculation is simplified by the fact that it only has to deal with circles (the contribution from the joints is negligible).</p>

<h2 id="building-the-lamp">Building the lamp</h2>

<p>Once I had generated a blueprint and manufactured the parts, assembling the lamp went pretty smoothly. All circles, joints and joint holes were numbered so I would not have to think too much during assembly.</p>

                    <p>Starting a newsletter is exciting. I remember my first newsletter about remote work back in 2015. It was so cool having an actual audience of people to write to every week. It was like I had my own TV show or magazine or something. I later on realized that you could actually make money from this by finding people who would pay you for sponsoring or having an ad in your newsletter. Now, I'll share that with you how.</p><h2 id="my-story-short-version-">My story (short version)</h2><p>Since then I've progressed to running <a href="https://klart.io/pixels">Pixels</a>, a newsletter with curated designs and I'm sending it to more than 4000 people every week making money through sponsors.</p><p>Here's what I've learned.</p><p>Good question. As I see it, a sponsor is paying you money because they like what you're doing and they want to be related to you, in some way. You can see it as a mutual agreement, which both parties enjoy, possibly for a longer period of time.</p><p>Ads are more like a transactional thing. X pay money to Y to be have something displayed in front of people.</p><p>Everyone doesn't want to monetize their newsletter and that's cool. I've started a few myself just for fun and because I like writing and curating interesting content. But if you do want to earn money I think sponsors are the way to go. Read on!</p><p>There's really no number on how many subscribers you need to be able to land your first sponsor. Personally I got my first sponsor for Pixels at about a thousand subscribers but I could probably have reached out way sooner than that. If I was starting fresh today, I'd probably start to reach out when I'm around 100 subscribers. It's good to build relationships early, and companies are not stupid so they won't pay if they don't like what's in it for them anyway. Worst thing you can get is a no.</p><h2 id="define-your-audience">Define your audience</h2><p>One of the most important things when reaching out to potential sponsors is that you've defined your audience. Who's reading your newsletter? Are they developers? designers? photographers? yoga instructors? This will be key, so better figure this one out.</p><h2 id="find-relevant-companies">Find relevant companies</h2><p>When you go out looking for potential sponsors you shouldn't just "find any company". If your sponsor is not aligned with your readers it will probably come out in a weird spammy way as those old banner ads in the 90's. &nbsp;This will lead to poor ad performance and unhappy subscribers and sponsors. Everybody lose.</p><p>If you however manage to find a relevant sponsors, for example a new database system as a sponsor for your newsletter about open source, your readers will probably find it interesting, and your sponsor will get great ad performance. Win-win!</p><h2 id="who-should-you-email">Who should you email?</h2><p>This depends a little bit. I've found that it's a lot easier to get a referral down rather than up. So start with the CEO if it's a relatively small company and otherwise, try the marketing manager.</p><p>If you can't find an email address to anyone, try the general info email and ask who you should contact about email sponsorships. There are services like <a href="https://hunter.io/">Hunter.io</a> that you can use to find email addresses to people given a domain name.</p><h2 id="reach-out">Reach out</h2><p>Found a bunch of relevant companies to reach out to? Great! Now it's time to send a few emails.</p><p>Since you've already defined your audience this will be easy. In the subject, state what the company will get out of your offering and explain this further in your email.</p><p>This is an example of a first outreach email to sponsors for a newsletter about mobile cameras:</p><figure><pre><code>Subject: Reach Hobby Photographers

Hi Company!

My name is Foo from Bar. I run a weekly newsletter about the latest trends in mobile cameras.

Since you're making an app to develop photos I figured you would enjoy reaching this audience.

Are you interested in an exclusive sponsorship?

Best,

Foo</code></pre><figcaption>Example outreach email</figcaption></figure><p>Keep it short, personal and mention your audience. If they're interested they will probably get back to you for more information.</p><h2 id="follow-up-follow-up-follow-up">Follow-up, Follow-up, Follow-up</h2><p>Most of the time you'll probably not get a reply on the first email and that's why you have to follow-up. You might have heard this before but I can't stress this enough. It has happened so many times that I've closed a deal on the 7th or 8th email 3 months or so after I sent the first one.</p><p>Keep track of everything in a spreadsheet, one column for the email, one for the next follow-up. I usually do something like this:</p><ul><li>First email</li><li>After 3 days: Second email</li><li>Another 4 days: Third email</li><li>Another 5 days: Fourth email</li><li>... At least make it here. Bonus points for continuing...</li></ul><p>One you start doing this at scale you might want to consider a CRM system to not get completely overwhelmed by all your follow-ups. This is also the reason I started <a href="https://wobaka.com/">Wobaka</a>, to make automating follow-ups and keeping track of contacts super smooth.</p><h2 id="make-it-easy-for-them">Make it easy for them</h2><p>Once you do get a reply from someone you should make it super easy for them. Sponsoring you is probably a very small piece of their marketing budget so it's essential that the process is smooth, otherwise they could just increase their Twitter or Facebook ad budget instead, right?</p><p>Have a payment link ready that they can use, propose a date and state what you need from them. Don't bother with calendars and booking apps. Keep it simple. You can use a tool like <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> or <a href="https://paypal.com/">Paypal</a> for the payments.</p><p>This is an example for our photographer newsletter:</p><figure><pre><code>Subject: Re: Reaching Hobby Photographers

Thanks for getting back to me!

There are currently 1257 people reading the newsletter every friday. Open rate is 51% and click rate is 27%. This is an example: LINK

The sponsorship is AMOUNT and I'd be happy have you on as early as next week. If that's interesting I need the following for the ad:

- Title: Short
- Text: Less than 300 characters
- Image: 16:9 aspect ratio, png format

You can use this link for payment: LINK.

To reserve your spot I need the payment, the rest is ok to deliver a day or two before the newsletter.

Best,

Foo</code></pre><figcaption>Sponsorship details email example</figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-much-should-you-charge">How much should you charge?</h2><p>I strongly advice not getting into CPM and the likes. This is because I really don't think it's the same to appear in a generic Google or Facebook ad compared to backing a newsletter their potential customers actually enjoy reading. I would stick to fixed prices per newsletter.</p><p>About the price, I actually advice you to shoot from the hip. Try something, if it works, maybe raise it, if not, maybe lower it. Keep experimenting!</p><h2 id="don-t-listen-to-the-negative-folks">Don't listen to the negative folks</h2><p>Most people will be happy that you've got sponsors. That just means that you'll be able to spend more time writing the newsletter they love. Some people may however don't like it. It has never happened to me but I've heard about it. If it happens to you, just don't bother, instead focus on all the people you can spend more time writing to!</p><h2 id="enjoy-the-process-">Enjoy the process!</h2><p>Writing a newsletter is super rewarding. I love reading comments on how people enjoy reading mine. I hope you'll be able to keep writing and maybe even make a living on your newsletter.</p><p>Best of luck!</p><p><em>Fredrik</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description">
<p>Google is the biggest internet company in the world today.&nbsp; And it seems that this giant, successful company is going to have a birthday. As a present, we came up with a few interesting facts in honor of the birthday <b>big boy</b> company.</p>
<h2>1. People do not seem to know Google’s exact birth date.</h2>
<p>Yes, it is true. People do not know the exact date of Google’s birthday. It has been reported that Google has been given six different dates for their official birthday. Eventually they decided they need a fixed date, so that people know when to celebrate. Google later determined that <b>September 27th</b> will be the day.</p>
<h2>2. Google may even happen to be 25 years old.</h2>
<p>There are some indications that the real birth date might come even earlier than ’98. Google could be in fact, over the age needed to purchase alcohol in the US, legally. Although Google already has encoded their official starting date with the cryptic “98 9 27” doodle, it all must have started even earlier. In 1995, in the dormitory of Standford, the two main Google guys initiated the miracle power behind the most popular search engine in the world. Some say that during the infant years of Google development, the two founding men were frequently in disagreement with each other. However, we have the search engine today as proof they eventually shook hands and decided to put aside their differences and get to work.</p>
<h2>3. Google has a T-rex dinosaur on-site as a special reminder.</h2>
<div><p>Indeed, there is a T-rex on-site at Google’s headquarters. The dyno structure features a bone from a real Tyrannosaurus. When an amateur paleontologist initially discovered the bone by accident, they thought it comes from a different type of dinosaur. Stan, the name of the bone construction, is a vivid reminder that adaptation is key to survival.</p><p>Apart from being a preferred gathering <a href="https://www.demilked.com/google-campus-dinosaur-stan-flamingos/" target="_blank">spot for flamingos meeting</a>, Stan is there to remind Google employees they need to give their best all the time. Or risk having their company become extinct, just like a dinosaur.</p></div>
<h2>4. A T-rex game likes to hide in Google Chrome.</h2>
<div><p>Google is fond of dinosaurs, we noticed. Apart from the giant structure at their HQ, they also made a digital dyno version. When you browse the net on Google Chrome, a warning will appear about Google not being able to connect.</p><p>When the dinosaur is visible, if you push the space bar on your keyboard, a game will begin where you are a running dinosaur jumping over obstacles. The game length is theoretically infinite and has been an arena for peculiar competition for the highest score.</p></div>
<h2>5. Many things are hiding in Google’s products.</h2>
<p>You can find many Google easter eggs by doing a simple search. These hidden gems become quite apparent once you begin to understand what they are.&nbsp; For example, searching with the word “askew” will return search results in a tilted view. You can also try “zerg rush,” “blink HTML” or the classic “Google in the 1998”.</p>
<h2>6. Google was not at all pleased that the name of the company became a generic search term.</h2>
<p>“Google” and “just Google it” are common words, but the company thought that could undermine all their efforts. There is, however, no way to stop such a trend. We have little control over how language use evolves. Marketing departments would say they want the brand name should circulate as much as possible. Still, Google has reached a level where the term becomes forever embedded in our culture. At this point, the process of “genericization” becomes unstoppable and out of control, even Google’s.</p>
<h2>7. Google devours more businesses than people genuinely think.</h2>
<p>Some estimate that Google purchases more than one company per week. Most of the companies tend to be small, but some can be rather large. Most of the acquired products get blended in with others that are already part of an applied marketing strategy.&nbsp; However, Android resides firmly within Google’s realm on its own accord and is very well known.<br>Google does not usually sell the companies that it buys. </p>
<h2>8. The “I’m Feeling Lucky” Google button cost more than tens of millions of dollars per year.</h2>
<p>This button is really fun. But for Google, it is an expensive add-on. The simple task of taking a person directly to the top result page without the advertising makes Google miss a lot of potential revenue. That lost income estimates put it at around $110 million. When addressed directly, Google officials responded that without the feeling lucky button Google will look like a corporate beast with an exclusive focus on money. The fact that the button remains on the main google page is a true testament that Google understands the search engine is for the real people out there.</p>
<h2>9. The first Google storage building blocks come from Lego.</h2>
<p>Google, one of the largest companies in the world today, has many demands, most of them understandably also pretty big. For example, all the countless public photos, videos and emails needs a place to stay, and there are building-size structures that come to the rescue. But back in 1996, things were different for the Google founders, when they had to find a solution for their first storage device need. The hard drives they found were too bulky, so they produced unique server boxes made out of Lego parts.</p>
<h2>10. Google proves to be very generous to the spouses of employees who die while working for the company.</h2>
<p>Losing a loved one on the job is always tough. Dying while working in a comfortable, air-conditioned office is not the same as, say, a coal mine accident. However, one thing is sure: death comes unexpectedly, and it is a hard stone to all sides involved. Google understands that and pays the husband or wife of the decreased fifty percent of their salary for the next ten years! Even the children of those unfortunate enough to perish on the job have benefits too – they are set with compensatory payments till they reach adulthood.</p>
<h2>11. One search on Google requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts of Apollo 11 to the moon. </h2>
<div><p>Isn’t that a funny statistic? Searching with Google is made so simple now. Most people don’t believe when they hear the actual computing and networking power behind every simple search querry.</p><p>Searching the internet today takes more resources than were necessary to put people on the moon. Even your smartphone has better capabilities than the equipment NASA had when they attempted the first moonwalk. </p></div>
<h2>12. One time Google experienced a crash for five minutes, and almost half of the whole internet went down too.</h2>
<div><p>What if you can’t use your computer for five minutes? No bid deal, right? You can take a walk and come back again. Five minutes for Google is too much.</p><p>It was on August 19, 2013, when the famed Google stopped operating for a total of five minutes. This short interruption sufficed for Google to take down around 40% of all internet traffic.</p><p>While it is true that many companies have risen to the occasion and provide search opportunities for people, Google still dominates the more substantial part of the internet. Google has grown to the point where it almost became a synonym for the internet itself. When Google has a problem, the chances are that so does most of the world wide web.</p></div>
<h2>13. Google employs goats.</h2>
<div><p>There is a lot of beautiful green space around Google offices. And that could require a lot of mowing for sure. So they come up with the ingenious idea to have some goats to take care of the grass for them.</p><p>According to Google employees, they love goats because for a score of reasons. Goats are not as noisy, don’t cause any pollution, and, most of all, are more cure and cuddly than lawnmowers.</p></div>
<h2>14. Google has lots of dogs on site.</h2>
<div><p>Speaking of goats, Google also loves all kinds of animals and lets people bring their pets to work. Having your best friend around you is a huge booster for morale and productivity.</p><p>Note that cats are not banned from Google. It’s just that cats don’t usually get along with dogs, so there are fewer of them on-site. But there are still quite a few.</p></div>
<h2>15. Google has given a dog the title of Top Dog.</h2>
<p>According to Google’s official history, the dog of the owner of Google, whose name is Yoshka, is the first and only dog to be given the name Top Dog back in 1999. A post appeared on Google by Yoshka, stating that all dogs are welcome to come to Google. Yoshka is not the only dog in the company, but it was the first. The dog owner was non-other than Urs Hölzle. He was the person responsible for reducing the power needed for Google data centers by half!</p>
<h2>16. Google centered their logo on the main search page in 2001.</h2>
<div><p>Google’s homepage is simple, a much-needed requirement when millions around the world visit it on a daily. Any changes to that page, even the tiniest ones, will be indeed significantly noticed.</p><p>In the early days of the search engine, the Google logo resided to the left side of the page. But in 2001, they moved it to the center and has been there ever since. This seemingly slight change is pretty significant. It changed how the main page is perceived forever.</p></div>
<h2>17. Google continues to make small changes.</h2>
<div><p>There have been some rather small adjustments to the Google logo, in time. Those changes include the layout of the letters of the word “Google.”</p><p>Small changes are the general approach, but Google also goes big. They came up with different ways to arrange the words, which included a new font too.</p></div>
<h2>18. Changes include the name.</h2>
<p>In recent years, the most significant and notable change occurred when the company changed its name from Google to Alphabet. That change was prompted by the fact the company was dominating most of the search, information, internet and other aspects of the business.</p>
<h2>19. Google Instant.</h2>
<p>Google Instant means that you will see results immediately as soon as you start typing if your connection allows it.&nbsp; Google can then collect ample information on you about your browsing patterns to get you where you want to go even faster. Google Instant changes the autocomplete options, and the suggested search results in an …</p></div></div>

<p>He had a bell tied to his computer. Every time he made a sale, the bell would chime. Amazon started out selling only books, and sales back then were only far and between.</p>
<p>Eventually, the bell started chiming continiously, and he had to take it down.</p>
<p>A lot of popular software tools have similar functionality built in. Each time you get a new subscriber, Mailchimp sends you an alert email. Each time you make a sale, Stripe sends you a payment notification.</p>
<p>When you first start making stuff online, there's no better feeling than knowing that someone out there wants to pay money to use your product or follow your work. And there's no better pick-me-up when you've had a tough day.</p>
<p>I have a similar set up for one of my apps. Each time a customer upgrades to a "premium" plan, I have a script that randomly fetches a gif from Giphy with the keyword "money". This is then included in an email that contains information about who bought, what they bought, and how munch money I made. </p>
<p><img src="https://images.postmake.io/resources/blog/founder-dopamine-hits/alert_email.gif" alt="Sample Alert Email"></p>
<p>I've had this setup for more than a couple of years now, and these emails are still the highlight of my days. But as much as I enjoy getting these emails, I hope I'll eventually reach a point where I'll have to turn them off. </p>
<p>I guess for now, these dopamine hits will have to do.</p>

</div><div><p>Back in June I discovered that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/SPFForHELOs">in theory we should have SPF records
for EHLO hostnames too</a>. The conventional explanation
for this (apart from 'big email providers say so', the usual reason
to do anything in modern SMTP) comes from, for example, <a href="https://bridge.grumpy-troll.org/2020/07/small-mailserver-bcp/">this
writeup of small mailserver best current practices</a>,
and goes like this (I'm paraphrasing):</p>

<p>People use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework">SPF</a>
to validate the envelope sender domain (the SMTP MAIL FROM). However,
when you send a bounce, it has a null sender and thus no sender
domain to use for SPF checks. So the sender domain is taken from
the EHLO hostname, for lack of a better place to get it from (since
there is no SMTP level 'the bounce claims to have been sent by X
domain' information to be had, although this is commonly in the
message headers).</p>

<p>This is of course kind of bogus. What is really happening here is that
receiving mail servers are attempting to validate that the EHLO/HELO
hostname itself is not forged and are using SPF for this purpose. This
is a complete repurposing of SPF, which we can see since 'Sender' is
right in the name 'Sender Policy Framework' and there's no 'sender' of
the bounce that is visible at the SMTP level (and no entirely standard
way that it's visible in the mail headers, either).</p>

<p>There are some lessons here for email related 'standards' and in general
any Internet standards, which I can summarize this way: if there's a
hole that people think needs filling, any nearby peg will get hammered
into it regardless of what the peg was originally designed for.</p>

<p>PS: This elaborates on <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1307064512302940161">a recent tweet of mine</a> that was
sparked by adding SPF DNS records for our EHLO hostnames (and writing
the official explanation of the change for our records).</p>

<h3>Sidebar: This explanation and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208">RFC 7208</a></h3>

<p>RFC 7208 says two things in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208#section-2.3">section 2.3, <em>The "HELO" Identity</em></a>:</p>

<ul><li>it's RECOMMENDED that you check the HELO identity (but carefully)
all the time, and do so before checking MAIL FROM.</li>
<li>if the envelope sender is the null sender, the message is presumed
to come from 'postmaster@&lt;HELO name&gt;' and this is used as the
MAIL FROM to check (even if you already checked the HELO identity).</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven't gone through RFC 7208's section on doing SPF checks to see
if it treats HELO and MAIL FROM checks somewhat differently in its
algorithm, because frankly I'm not interested enough.</p>

<p>This means that RFC 7208 itself is a superset of the conventional
explanation I summarized above. In RFC 7208, you have SPF records
for your EHLO hostnames both because of bounces and because receivers
are recommended to check them all the time. This implies that all
of your mail sending machines should have SPF records, not just the
ones that can send bounces.</p>

<p>(Now that I've looked that up, I may need to update some of our
DNS records. Again.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>We rebooted all of our servers remotely (more or less) and it all worked</h2>

	<p><small>September 26, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Even under normal circumstances, we don't routinely reboot our Linux
servers. Reboots are disruptive to our users (especially to the
people who are logged in to the servers that reboot), and local
policies require us to schedule an after-hours downtime for large
scale user visible things like this, which is disruptive to our
lives. We do reboot them periodically, either for significant enough
Ubuntu kernel security issues or just because we want to get them
back on up to date kernels. However, all of this is under normal
circumstances, when we are actually physically in the office to
deal with machines that fail to go down or come up cleanly.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">The current situation is not normal</a>. We've been out
of the office since early March, and even in March our systems had
been rather a while since a reboot (through the magic of our
Prometheus metrics and dashboards, I can tell you that at the end
of March 12th, the last day I was in the office, most of our systems
had been up for about 259 days).  Since we were out of the office,
we didn't even think about rebooting for a very long time, and by
early September many of our machines had been up for over 400 days
without a reboot. Things reached a critical point and we (by which
I mean my co-workers, as I was on vacation) decided that we should
take the risk to reboot everything, while taking some steps to
mitigate the risks for very important machines.</p>

<p>(Said steps being that the reboot of those machines was scheduled for
early morning, when a co-worker who is an extreme morning person would
stop by the office.)</p>

<p>What happened was, well, nothing. Everything rebooted quietly,
everything came back up again without problems, and I believe that the
co-worker in the office didn't need to do anything. The not as user
visible machines that we rebooted before hand all worked, the user
visible machines that we rebooted during the downtime worked too, and
none of our fears came to pass.</p>

<p>(Well, we did discover a machine or two with odd BIOS settings
that caused problems, but they weren't particularly user visible
machines; they were generic machines in <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/SlurmHasCreatedCattle">our SLURM cluster</a>.)</p>

<p>It would be nicer to have remote power control and a KVM over IP setup
for all of our machines, so that we could deal with everything from
home; that would make reboots almost completely risk free (and an
unexpected hardware failure is hard to deal with during a scheduled
downtime anyway). But it's reassuring to have a positive experience
even just with the basics. It will also probably encourage us to do it
again, sooner than last time around.</p>

<p>(Also, it's nice for a potentially risky operation to just work.
A quiet day is its own reward, and sometimes our small successes
deserve a little celebration.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust is a strange language.</p><p>It has modern and promising design idea, and good performance compared to C++. It's proved to be an alternative system language that can use for writing OS, although there's no product level rust OS yet, there're several implementations as the potential players. It's the highest expected, trying the whole bag of tricks to grow, gaining popularity in the young crowds...all these are very good to a novel and health community.</p><p>On the other hand, this language seems no idea where to go. No, I'm not talking about its dreaming goal, of course I know its goal is explicitly expressed: safety, speed, and concurrency. What I'm confusing is the way it choose towards its goal. Rust community choose an iterative model rather than waterfall model to develop Rust language. That is to say, the code and interfaces keeps changing while the design is still not confirmed. Although it's the popular development model in today's internet industry on business software, I doubt if it's the best way for a foundational foresight programming language. However, it's too early to say whether the development model is bad in nowadays' industry. We can see many companies are trying to use Rust even its design is still unstable. In the past, such kind of activity is insane to take risks in a serious product. But today's industry is in a rapid iterating, maybe our understand is too old for it, and maybe Rust's model is the brand new way to improve the industry. People can adapt the fast changing things even it's their fundamental langugage, and there could be stronger auto tools to rely on. Who knows, let's give it a try, warriors, the boss pays for it.</p><p>This article is about the Rust frontend on GCC. It's reasonable for me (or any potential contributors) to blame Rust's development model, since it's interfering the efforts of its own GCC frontend.</p><p>So far, the only reliable implementation is the officially supported LLVM front-end. I don't know if there're more, but I will not choose if it's not based on a mainstream compiler infrastructure. After all, it's system level language, once you choose, it's not expected to be changed in a decade. To my experiences to lead the software development in past decade, it's not so simple to change fundamental things, from libs to compilers to languages. It's not impossible, but why waste time to do it when you have lots of other workloads to deal with?</p><p>Stop, it's not a criticism article against Rust. So I'm not going to blame it more.</p><p>OK, that's enough, now that we're trying to work for the Rust front-end on GCC, it's reasonable to say we're interested in this language. And we hope to promote it better. As a perennial GNU hacker, it's natual for me to think about Rust on GCC. I have several experiences on writing language front-ends, the architecture is similar, and the theory is similar too. However, gcc-rust is a very hard project that couldn't be done successfully by one-man effort. In this article, I'll introduce the ideas and efforts around FOSS community. I hope all these information can help people to understand the situation, and help potential contributors to take part in.</p><p>Of course, Rust on LLVM has gone so far away, but what would I

Hydra Cave</h2><p>Rust on GCC is a Hydra. Why? Because there're at least 3 possible ways to go. Oh well, three heads of a dragon.</p><p>These 3 ways are originally mentioned by @redbrain who is one of the enthusiasts of Rust on GCC (<a href="https://github.com/redbrain/gccrs/issues/2#issuecomment-563255365" target="_blank">https://github.com/redbrain/gccrs/issues/2#issuecomment-563255365</a>). Unfortunately, he has dropped his efforts, but his work of Rust on GCC is still inspiring.</p><p>The first way is the most lightweight way. The original Rust compiler provides a IR (Intermediate Representation) named MIR, so the idea is really simple, we can take advantage of the front-end of Rust on LLVM then convert MIR to GENERIC which is the general IR in GCC. The pros is that we don't have to deal with the occasionally changing of Rust's grammar. This idea is achievable, since the original Rust compiler is in the similar architecture to convert MIR to LLVM-IR. The only problem is that this Rust on GCC frontend has to require the original rustc, and this may bring the LLVM dependencies chain. Then people may wonder why we still bother to implement Rust on GCC, it doesn't reduce the dependencies in the development environment nor likely to be widely accepted by GCC folks. No mention the license issue.</p><p>The second way is to use GCC JIT interface on top of the original Rust compiler. This architecture implies to add a new backend (libgccgit <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/cp/index.html" target="_blank">https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/cp/index.html</a>) to the original Rust compiler. So it's not the Rust on GCC as most people expected, it's a new feature request to Rust developer to support yet another compiler backend and maintain the code by Rust community. This is the perfect approach only if Rust developers accept it. However, the hard part would be license issue, and it all depends on the willing of Rust community.</p><p>The third way is the traditional way, full C++ implementation of Rust on GCC. There's an existing good example, gccgo, which is the Go language front-end on GCC. It's the hardest way to build a Rust compiler from scratch. The pros is that the developers can expect to do everything they like to build an efficient Rust compiler to challenge the orginal one, and it doesn't require LLVM as the prerequisite. Finally, no any license issue, we can make it GPLv3+. However, there must be a strong group to maintain this front-end. Gccgo has a strong team hired by Google. No mention you have to keep updating the volatile Rust grammar periodically.</p><p>All these approaches are independent from each other, so it's impossible to combine all these 3 forces. The MIR way is working by @sapir <a href="https://github.com/sapir/gcc-rust/tree/rust" target="_blank">https://github.com/sapir/gcc-rust/tree/rust</a>, and it's still in progress; The libgccjit way requires the connection to Rust community that is out of my reach, and I don't know who is working on it; as a GNU hacker, I think my prefered way is the third one. The third way was dropped by @redbrain, but there's some inspiring code left.</p><h2>What we've got so far?</h2><p>My plan is not to secretly working on it then throw a release suddenly to shock people. I have too many projects in my TODO, I do want to have gcc-rust, and I do want to have more friends on it. Let me emphersize it again, it's impossible to do it by one-man effort.</p><p>Fortunately, @SimplyTheOther have done fully-operational and working lexer, parser of a recent Rust syntax. It's great work. I have enough experiences to write parsers for practical languages, it's time consuming work. That's why I appreciate @SimplyTheOther's work so much. Of course, I agree with @SimplyTheOther that the most time consuming work would be the type checking part, at least for Rust, I'm afraid that it could be true.</p><p>After I helped to fix tiny bugs to make it work smoothly, I started to write an enhanced AST dumper. It's reasonable for us, first, I need to get familiar with @SimplyTheOther's AST design; second, we need to output a human-readable AST for debugging.</p><p>Let me show you a silly example:</p><pre spellcheck="false"><span><span>fn</span> <span>abc</span></span>(x:<span>u32</span>, y:<span>u32</span>) -&gt; <span>u32</span> {
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>return</span> x+y;
}

<span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>1</span>+<span>1</span>;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc(<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>);
}
</pre><p>Alright, it's silly meaningless code, let's see how the AST dump looks like.</p><p>Assuming you stored the source code to test.rs, then run AST dump:</p><pre spellcheck="false">rust1 -frust-<span>dump</span>-parse test.rs
</pre><p>The output could be:</p><pre spellcheck="false">Crate:
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;items:

<span>u32</span> abc(x : <span>u32</span>, y : <span>u32</span>)
BlockExpr:
{
&nbsp;outer attributes: none
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;statements:
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; <span>return</span> ArithmeticOrLogicalExpr: x + y
&nbsp;final expression: none
}

void main()
BlockExpr:
{
&nbsp;outer attributes: none
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;statements:
&nbsp; ExprStmtWithBlock:
&nbsp;&nbsp; BlockExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outer attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inner attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statements:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ArithmeticOrLogicalExpr: <span>1</span> + <span>1</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; final expression: none
&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>)
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; outer attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp; StructExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PathInExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc(<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inner attributes:none
&nbsp;final expression: none
}
</pre><p>It's good for us to debug or extend the parser. After all, if we can't make sure the parser is correct, how can we move forward to type checking and IR transformation?</p><p>The project repo is here, patches are welcome: <a href="https://github.com/philberty/gccrs" target="_blank">https://github.com/philberty/gccrs</a></p><h2>What's next?</h2><p>Before answer this question, I guess you may wonder why I used `rust1` rather than a traditional name `gccrust` or something else.</p><p>`rust1` is the Rust compiler, while `gccrust` is a collection that calling compiler, assembler, and linker like a chain. We haven't done the IR transformation yet, so there won't be anything can be assembled and linked except for the AST. Oh my poor Rust compiler!</p><p>It's not so hard to transform AST to GENERIC which is the current toplevel IR of gcc. However, it's meaningless to rush if we haven't made sure the parser work correctly for the Rust grammar. No mention the critical feature of Rust, the linear type system.</p><p>If you understand what I've said so far, then I can answer the question "what could be the next".</p><p>1. The type system, too big to talk about it here.</p><p>2. The static analysis.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the advantages of llvm-rust was that it used the static analysis of LLVM. Fortunately, David Malcolm finished his GCC static analysis framework recently <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/806099/" target="_blank">https://lwn.net/Articles/806099/</a>. I'm not sure if there could be any hook for front-end to interact with, or maybe we can't touch it once we pass the authority to the next level IR. Anyway, it's an exciting feature of GCC to research.</p><p>3. The new middle-IR for Rust specific pre-optimizing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea is largely inspired by gccgo because they've inserted a specifically designed IR for Go language before transforming it to GENERIC. This IR was named GOGO. Gccgo will do some pre-optimizing with GOGO. From the compiler design perspective, it's reasonable to do so, since some information may lose after …</p></div></div>

<p>In this week's post, you will learn how to build a command line tool that
manipulates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>In this example, I have medical data on some hospital patients:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>data.csv</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>id,height_ft,weight_lb,glucose_mgdL
PT-9357,5.96,189,124
PT-5315,5.53,180,106
PT-7733,6.15,222,126
PT-9667,6.10,174,104
PT-8893,6.00,232,98
PT-1125,5.97,187,85
PT-1222,5.82,237,104
PT-7681,6.00,198,134
PT-7043,5.98,227,78
PT-2623,5.55,204,125
PT-7031,5.50,216,107
PT-4947,5.91,199,105
PT-9711,6.13,237,107
PT-3737,6.03,179,111
PT-2931,5.78,187,87
</code></pre>
<p>Here's what the columns mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code> - the patient's id number.</li>
<li><code>height_ft</code> - the patient's height (units <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)">ft</a>).</li>
<li><code>weight_lb</code> - the patient's weight in (units <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)">lb</a>).</li>
<li><code>glucose_mgdL</code> - the patient's fasting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_level">blood glucose</a> levels (units <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#SI_multiples">mg</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre#SI_prefixes_applied_to_the_litre">dL</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>From this data, I want to make several calculations:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to calculation the patients' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">body mass index</a> (BMI) from their
height and weight.</li>
<li>I want to classify the patients' weight based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">BMI</a>, e.g. "obese",
"underweight".</li>
<li>I want to classify the patients' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes">diabetic status</a> based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_level">blood
glucose</a>, e.g. "diabetic", "prediabetic".</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's how I can use <code>csv-proc</code> to accomplish this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ ./csv-proc data.csv '
_height_m = float(row.height_ft) * 0.3048
_weight_kg = float(row.weight_lb) * 0.453592
bmi = _weight_kg / _height_m ** 2
bmi = round(bmi, 1)
if bmi &lt; 18.5:
    bmi_cat = "underweight"
elif 18.5 &lt;= bmi &lt; 25:
    bmi_cat = "normal"
elif 25 &lt;= bmi &lt; 30:
    bmi_cat = "overweight"
elif 30 &lt;= bmi:
    bmi_cat = "obese"

_glucose_mgdL = float(row.glucose_mgdL)
if _glucose_mgdL &lt; 100:
    glucose_cat = "normal"
elif 100 &lt;= _glucose_mgdL &lt; 126:
    glucose_cat = "prediabetic"
elif 126 &lt;= _glucose_mgdL:
    glucose_cat = "diabetic"
'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(This uses the functions <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float">float</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round">round</a>.)</p>
<p>I could also accomplish this by defining some helper functions using the
<code>--init</code> flag:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ ./csv-proc data.csv '

_height_m = N(row.height_ft) * 0.3048
_weight_kg = N(row.weight_lb) * 0.453592
bmi = round(_weight_kg / _height_m ** 2, 1)
bmi_cat = classify_bmi(bmi)
_glucose_mgdL = N(row.glucose_mgdL)
glucose_cat = classify_glucose(_glucose_mgdL)

' --init '

from bisect import bisect_right
from functools import partial

N = float

def classify(x, *, cutoff, label):
    return label[bisect_right(cutoff, x)]

classify_bmi = partial(
    classify,
    cutoff=[18.5, 25, 30],
    label="underweight normal overweight obese".split(),
)

classify_glucose = partial(
    classify,
    cutoff=[100, 126],
    label="normal prediabetic diabetic".split(),
)

<p>(This uses functions <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float">float</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partial">functools.partial</a>, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect_right">bisect.bisect_right</a>.)</p>

<p>I use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html">csv</a> module to read and write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>.
The method <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.Sniffer.sniff">csv.Sniffer.sniff</a> analyzes a sample of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV file</a> and guesses the "dialect" (delimiter, quoting, etc.).
I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader">csv.DictReader</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter">csv.DictWriter</a> instead of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader">csv.reader</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.writer">csv.writer</a> because I want to expose the rows as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict">dictionaries</a> instead</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile">compile</a> to prepare text to be executed as code by <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec">exec</a>.
To determine the new columns to add to the output, I examine how
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict">collections.OrderedDict</a> <code>env_local</code> changes after processing a row.
I ignore local variables that start with <code>_</code> because I wanted an easy way to
create "temporary variables" that won't show up in the output.</p>
<p>When I process each row of the input <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV file</a>, I create a <code>RowProxy</code> object
that allows accessing <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict">dictionary</a> entries as attributes. E.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rp = RowProxy({"cat": 3})
rp["cat"]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rp.cat
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>

<p>In this week's post you learned how to a command line tool that manipulates
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>.
You learned how to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html">csv</a> module to read and write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>, as well as how to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.Sniffer">csv.Sniffer</a> to automatically deduce the
"dialect" of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV file</a>.
You also learned how to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile">compile</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec">exec</a> to run text as Python code.</p>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build a tool like <code>csv-proc</code> that allows you to filter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>
based on some criteria.
For example, if you only want to view prediabetic patients from <strong>data.csv</strong>,
you could call your program like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ csv-filter data.csv '100 &lt;= float(row.glucose_mgdL) &lt; 126'
</code></pre>

(<a href="https://github.com/shaunlebron/pacman-mazegen">code on GitHub</a>)
</p>


<canvas id="canvas"></canvas>

<h2><span>Work in Progress</span></h2>
<p>
<i>
Generating random Pac-Man mazes is a deceptively difficult problem that I spent some months working on.  It is not easy to describe clearly.  I hope you are patient.  This page is an effort to begin communicating how the algorithm works.  It will slowly be refined (your feedback appreciated) until it is all stated as clearly as possible.
</i>
</p>

<h2>Contraints</h2>
<p>
The mazes are built carefully to closely match design patterns deduced from the original maps found in Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Map is 28x31 tiles.</li>
<li>Paths are only 1 tile thick</li>
<li>No sharp turns (i.e. intersections are separated by atleast 2 tiles).</li>
<li>There are 1 or 2 tunnels</li>
<li>No dead-ends.</li>
<li>Only I, L, T, or + wall shapes are allowed, including the occasional rectangular wall.</li>
<li>Any non-rectangular wall pieces must only be 2 tiles thick.</li>
</ul>

<h2>It's like Tetris</h2>

<p>
We start by stacking tetris pieces on a 5x9 grid. Gravity pulls the pieces in the left direction rather than down.  The edges of the resulting tetris pieces correspond to walkable paths in the maze.  This grid is then mirrored across the left vertical axis to create a symmetric map, then scaled by 3 to form an original-size 28x31 map.
</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>
For clarity, I call the squares in the initial 5x9 grid, <b>cells</b>, and the squares in the final 28x31 grid, <b>tiles</b>.  So, this algorithm first creates the <b>cells</b> and transforms them into <b>tiles</b>
</p>

<h2>Simple Model</h2>

<p>
Shown in the above diagram titled "Simple Model" is the 5x9 grid of tetris pieces.  The pieces are created one cell at a time using some algorithm to limit the type of pieces at certain locations (they are numbered to show the order of creation).
</p>

<p>
The ghost pen and the edge between rows 7 and 8 at column 1 are present in every map, since the starting location of Pac-Man and the ghost pen location are constant.
</p>

<h2>Height and Width Adjustments</h2>

<p>
Cells are directly transformed into a 3x3 group of tiles. Unfortunately, this creates a resulting map that is too short by 1 tile and too wide by 1 tile.  So, we increase the height of one cell for every column, and decrease the width of one cell for every row, allowing the generated map to fit in the exact dimensions of the original game.
</p>

<p>
Shown in the above diagrams titled "Height Adjustments" and "Width Adjustments", the highlighted cells are the candidate cells whose size can be changed without creating ugly walls (i.e. walls that have non-uniform thickness).
</p>

<p>
Arrows occupy cells which have been chosen for size adjustment.  Care is taken to prevent discontinuities in the edges as a result of the shifting of cells from the size change.
</p>

<h2>Border Cells and Tunnels</h2>

<p>
I won't explain too much about this right now.  But the above diagram titled "Border Cells and Tunnels" has arrows to indicate the tunnel candidates.  The highlighted cells show the type of tunnel candidates by color.  Some cell edges are erased to create some variation in how walls connect with the boundary of the map (shown in green).  The tunnel creation algorithm is sophisticated in how it chooses different types of tunnels.
</p>

<h2>Final Paths</h2>

<p>
When the cells are finally transformed into tiles, what you are left with is shown in the diagram above titled "Final Paths".  Here you can directly map a cell to a 3x3 group of tiles.  You can even pick out the cells whose height are width have been adjusted by 1 tile in this map.
</p>

<h2>Final Tiles</h2>

<p>
See how the above diagram titled "Final Tiles" differs from "Final Paths".  The paths are shifted from the tile <em>edges</em> toward the tile <em>centers</em>.  Each tile with a path going through its center is turned into a path tile.  Finally, any tile that touches a path tile becomes a wall tile.  The map structure is now complete.

<p>Terra Nil is a relaxing city builder about ecosystem reconstruction.</p>
<p>Turn a barren wasteland into an ecological paradise complete with different flora and fauna, then clean up after yourself to leave the environment pristine.&nbsp;This strategy game/city builder/puzzler subverts the conventional goal of the city builder genre.&nbsp;Terra Nil is about the restoration of a ravaged environment, where the lightest touch is best.</p>

<p>The whole game can be played with the mouse:&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li>left/right click select/deselect</li><li>middle button to pan&nbsp;</li><li>scroll wheel to rotate / zoom</li></ul>
<p>There are also keyboard controls:</p>
<ul><li>arrows or wasd to pan&nbsp;</li><li>z/x to zoom&nbsp;</li><li>r to rotate</li></ul>

<p>We live in a world where we are being looked at all the time. I say “looked at” because that kind of sounds less harsh compared to “tracked and surveilled”. The phones and smart devices that we ourselves make sure are with us all the time are always listening to us - even when we are no talking to them. Google and Apple, even Instagram and Tiktok, know where you are all the time even when you are not even using their apps. Google has access to all your emails and can shut you out of your life just because. You cannot escape the Facebook mafia. If you stop using Facebook, they catch you with Instagram. If you don’t use Instagram they will catch you with Whatsapp. If you somehow even escape that. Facebook now owns “Giphy”  the gif search engine that is built in your phone keyboard. Hell, let’s say you don’t even use that they can track you with their integrations in every single website and app that you are using. They have a profile of you even if you never made it and it is more detailed than it would have been if you have provided that data yourself. </p>
<p>All conveniences come at a <em>tradeoff</em>. You have to give up something to get something in return. We as a society have, for most cases out of ignorance and in many cases willingly, traded our privacy for the benefits that the technologies provide. We allow apps, websites, and devices to constantly gather data about us which they can then use to profile us and subsequently sell more products to us using targeted advertising. And if you think that you, an adult, are impervious to advertising and are not influenced by it one bit then you, my friend, are wrong. Billions of dollars would not have been spent on advertising every year if you, the target, was not affected by it. With the advent of sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Google as a whole which know every single thing about you they know with much high precision which ad to show you and when. Technology has become so very advanced that it can now show you the ad for a product which you yourself don’t know that you need.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="How I keep ads away from me" src="https://akhil.me/uploads/images/Privacy%20ads.jpg">
<figcaption>Ads all around us</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you really don’t give it much thought, it doesn’t seem to be that big a deal. Sure they are collecting data on us but what’s the harm in that. Targeted advertising, theoretically, should be beneficial to us considering it takes away the pain of finding a product ourselves by showing as ads of products we are more likely to buy. Sure we might be persuaded to buy something that we didn’t really need but that has been done by pushy, persistent salespeople for ages. If you really think like this, and only like this, then the benefits of using tech if well worth the loss of privacy which even happens behind the scenes. </p>
<p>I, for one, am somewhat of a <em>privacy-conscious</em> person. I am not saying that I do not use new tech or tools that have the capability of tracking. I still use Gmail and a smartphone as well as many such apps or sites that I know for a fact are tracking me. But every such instance has been a decision on my part and not blind submission. </p>
<p>My first stance is to avoid using anything that can track me and invade my privacy. I do not use any social media platform directly at all. Any and all posts that you see on my Social Media come from a syndication app that allows me to not have social media apps on my phone. I do not install unnecessary apps and regularly delete apps that I don’t see myself using frequently. </p>
<p>Then come the things I have to use because the disruption of quality of life by not using them is much higher than the threshold that I have set for privacy. I will have to use Gmail, Whatsapp, and Amazon. I will have to visit other sites that use all sorts of tracking scripts. For these items, I have measures that ensure that I let as little tracking data go out as I can. It starts with only using a privacy-centric, ad-blocking browser on all platforms and goes to extent of having actual physical hardware whose sole purpose is to block tracking, ads, and malicious scripts from even reaching my network. I have gone to the extent of even self-hosting my own DNS to the amount of data any third party DNS provider can theoretically capture. I have, by doing this, found a balance between being able to enjoy the convenience that comes with using tech and knowing that I have not entirely given up on my privacy. The ability to completely De-Google, De-Amazon or De-Facebook myself would have been nice but this is a satisfactory second best. </p>
<p>I am listing down all the things/actions that I personally follow broken down into basic and advanced on the basis of how easy they are to setup. Everyone should be doing everything mentioned in the Basic section at the very least and as much as possible from the advanced section.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use adblockers</strong> - You will immediately see how much your life will get better as soon as you install the adblocker on your browser. Not only will you be saved from all the ads and annoying popups but your webpages will start loading much faster. Below you can see how much ad content is being pushed to you by the sites that you use daily. I recommend uBlock Origin which you can download here - <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#installation</a>. Download the version specific to your browser.</li>
<li><strong>Use a better browser</strong> - Chrome is good. Really good. But it is still a product of Google which they own and control. If you want the best features of Chrome without the privacy issues you can use Brave(<a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://brave.com/</a>). I use brave on all my devices - laptops and phones as the default browser. It has inbuilt ad and tracker blocking and since it is built on the same open-source framework as Chrome you still get the features you love. Having said this Brave has its minor issues as well so if you can use Firefox with the adblocker plugin. </li>
<li><strong>Avoid smart devices if possible</strong> - <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/amazons-alexa-never-stops-listening-to-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexa is always listening to you</a>. Always. And she is sending everything that she hears to Amazon servers. Google Home is doing the same. So is Siri. If you can live without them, that’s the best-case scenario. If you don’t want to be left out of the whole smart house times use them wisely. Keep your Alexa and Google homes off at all times and turn on only when you want to use them. That’s what I do with my Amazon Echo. </li>
<li><strong>Use paid/ad-free services wherever possible</strong> - We use a lot of apps and services which use ads as their source of income to offer their service for free. Most of them also have a paid ad-free version which might offer you a little extra functionality as well. I am a big proponent of paying for an app or service if it really adds value to my life. It also supports smaller developers financially without having to rely on shady techniques like ads and data gathering. For me, no ads is the biggest perk. The biggest example for me for this is Youtube. I have been paying for Youtube premium for a very long time. Even though <a href="https://akhil.me/2020/Breaking-out-of-the-Baby-Shark-trap/">I have weaned my daughter off her Youtube habit</a> there was a time when we used to watch youtube for at least a couple of hours every day. I did not want to expose her, or myself as a matter of fact, to any advertising for as long as it was possible so I upgraded to Youtube premium. In the same spirit, there are a bunch of apps that I have paid for even though they would have functioned exactly the same if I had gone for the free version. More on this in a future post.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t install anything you don’t need</strong> - I am not sure if you have noticed but every single business out there is trying to get you to install their app. Everyone from my local grocer to my pediatrician now has an app. And they want that to be on my phone. The reason they are pushing for you to install these apps is so that they can gather more data about you and use the apps to send you targeted notifications. You do not need to install every app just because it prompted you to install it. Even if you have to install an app because the web version was not satisfactory you now have the option of removing immediately after use. Looking at how fast and cheap internet connections we have with us all the time you can now install and remove apps on demand. </li>
<li><strong>Don’t click on random links</strong> - This is just plain common sense. No there are no scandalous photos or videos of your favorite celebrities behind that shady looking link. No one is giving you a BMW worth 1Cr just for clicking a link and sharing a photo. High-quality copies of movies that have not even released cannot be downloaded from torrent sites. Use a little common sense.</li>
<li><strong>Do not connect to random free wifis</strong> - There are no free things in this world. At least not anymore.</li>
<li>Keep your phones, laptops, software, and apps up to date. <br>

</li>

Skip to next section if you find talking about computers and networks boring)"></a>(Good to have. Skip to next section if you find talking about computers and networks boring)</h2><ol>
<li><p><strong>Use Ad-blocking DNS</strong> - Although my first preference would have been network-wide adblocking using a PiHole (next point) this is still a good option for people who don’t want to mess with hardware and their router. By changing a few, simple settings on your device you can start blocking ads and trackers at a DNS level. Sure your adblocker could already be blocking those but it is limited to the browser only. It cannot block ads and trackers embedded in the apps and games that you have installed on your phone. Blocking trackers using a privacy-centric DNS takes care of that. The setup process is fairly easy and you should be running in a couple on minutes. I personally recommend Adguard DNS (<a href="https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html</a>). I have tried in the past and considering that the configuration is easy and no hardware or servers are needed it is a good way to start. I recommend that you configure your router to use Adguard as the upstream DNS (all instructions are present in the link shared) so that you don’t have to make changes in each device individually. Else you always have the option of setting it up on the …</p></li></ol></section></article></div></div></div></div>

<article>
    <p>This is the 2nd post in a series on how Swift’s calling conventions work on ARM64. If you have not read <a href="https://vivekseth.com/swift-arm64-int-bool/">my first post on Swift’s calling conventions</a> for <code>Int</code> and <code>Bool</code> types, please read that first.</p>
<p>To try out the examples in this article, please make sure you have done the following set up first:</p>

<p>Item #3 is very important. If you set a breakpoint in Xcode’s UI the following steps may not work.</p>
<h2 id="the-code-we-will-investigate">The Code We Will Investigate</h2>
<p>In this post we will investigate the calling conventions used in the following code. In the <a href="https://vivekseth.com/swift-arm64-int-bool/#the-project-we-will-use">iOS app project you created</a>, replace the contents of <code>ViewController.swift</code> with the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>import</span> <span>UIKit</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Before continuing, make sure you can build and run the project.</p>
<h2 id="background-information">Background Information</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0055/c/">“Procedure Call Standard for the ARM 64-bit Architecture”</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The base standard provides for passing arguments in general-purpose registers (<code>r0</code>-<code>r7</code>), SIMD/floating-point registers (<code>v0</code>-<code>v7</code>) and on the stack. For subroutines that take a small number of small parameters, only registers are used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technically the document does say that floating-point arguments will be stored in registers <code>v0</code>-<code>v7</code>, but its actually a little more complicated than that. Each <code>v&lt;n&gt;</code> register holds 128bits, and there are different registers which reference different chunks of this memory.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0801/a/advanced-simd-and-floating-point-programming/extension-register-bank-mapping-in-aarch64-state">These docs</a> explain how these other registers work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mapping between the registers is as follows: <br>
<code>d&lt;n&gt;</code> maps to the least significant half of <code>v&lt;n&gt;</code> <br>
<code>s&lt;n&gt;</code> maps to the least significant half of <code>d&lt;n&gt;</code> <br>
<code>h&lt;n&gt;</code> maps to the least significant half of <code>s&lt;n&gt;</code> <br>
<code>b&lt;n&gt;</code> maps to the least significant half of <code>h&lt;n&gt;</code> <br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that the register <code>d0</code> maps to the least significant 64 bits of <code>v0</code>. Similarly <code>s0</code> maps to the least significant 32 bits of <code>d0</code> (transitively, <code>s0</code> also maps the least significant 32 bits of <code>v0</code>).</p>
<p>Since <code>Float</code>s only need 32 bits, Swift will store them in <code>s&lt;n&gt;</code> registers. Similarly Swift will use <code>d&lt;n&gt;</code> registers to store <code>Doubles</code> since they need 64 bits.</p>
<p>Armed with this knowledge, we should expect that <code>Float</code> arguments will be stored in registers <code>s0</code>-<code>s7</code>. Let’s try it out.</p>
<h2 id="float">Float</h2>
<h3 id="argument-values">Argument Values</h3>
<p>Use the approach <a href="https://vivekseth.com/swift-arm64-int-bool/#placing-breakpoints-on-swift-functions">described here</a> to place a breakpoint on <code>testFloat</code>, and run the project until the breakpoint triggers. Then run the following commands in LLDB:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">(lldb) register read s0 s1 -f f
      s0 = 100.111
      s1 = 100.222
</code></pre></div><p>This confirms our hypothesis! We can find <code>Float</code> arguments in the <code>s0</code>-<code>s7</code> registers.</p>
<p>We can also confirm the relationship between <code>s0</code>, <code>d0</code>, and <code>v0</code> below:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">(lldb) register read s0 -f h
      s0 = 0x42c838d5
(lldb) register read d0 -f h
      d0 = 0x0000000042c838d5
(lldb) register read v0 -f h
      v0 = 0x00000000000000000000000042c838d5
</code></pre></div><p>Notice how the larger registers contain the same data, just padded.</p>
<h3 id="return-value">Return Value</h3>
<p>Just like we learned in my <a href="https://vivekseth.com/swift-arm64-int-bool/#return-value">previous article</a>, <code>Float</code> return values will be stored the same way that the first <code>Float</code> argument is stored. This means that a <code>Float</code> return value should be stored in <code>s0</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s confirm:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">(lldb) thread step-out
(lldb) register read s0 -f f
      s0 = 200.333
</code></pre></div><p>Great! This is exactly what we expect. Just to remind you, <code>thread step-out</code> will execute the rest of the current function, pop the call stack, and then pause the debugger. At this point, the return value should be correctly stored in the intended register.</p>
<h2 id="double">Double</h2>
<h3 id="argument-values-1">Argument Values</h3>
<p><code>Double</code> works exactly the same as <code>Float</code> execpt that values are stored in the 64bit <code>d0</code>-<code>d7</code> registers. This means that the arguments to <code>testDouble</code> will be stored in <code>d0</code> and <code>d1</code>.</p>
<p>You can verify this by setting a breakpoint on <code>testDouble</code> and running:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">(lldb) register read d0 d1 -f f
      d0 = 200.111
      d1 = 200.222
</code></pre></div><h3 id="return-value-1">Return Value</h3>
<p>The return value works exactly the same as with <code>Float</code>, execpt it uses the <code>d0</code> register.</p>
<p>You can use these commands to try it out:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">(lldb) thread step-out 
(lldb) register read d0 -f f
      d0 = 400.333
</code></pre></div><h2 id="mixed-argument-types">Mixed Argument Types</h2>
<p>What happens if a function has mixed argument types?</p>
<p>This works as you would probably expect. <code>Float</code>/<code>Double</code> arguments are stored in the floating point registers, and <code>Int</code>/<code>Bool</code> arguments are stored in the general purpose registers.</p>
<p>Let’s try it out to see what happens:</p>
<h3 id="float-int">Float, Int</h3>
<p>Set a breakpoint on <code>testFloatInt</code> and run the following commands.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">(lldb) register read s0 s1 -f f
      s0 = 300.111
      s1 = 300.222
(lldb) register read x0 x1 -f d
      x0 = 300333
      x1 = 300444
</code></pre></div><p>Notice how the <code>Int</code> arguments are stored in registers <code>x0</code>, and <code>x1</code> even though they are the 3rd, and 4th arguments respectively. This is because they are the 1st and 2nd <em><code>Int</code></em> arguments.</p>
<p>Also notice how Swift chose to put the floaing point values in the floating point registers <code>s&lt;n&gt;</code> even though the general purpose registers <code>x&lt;n&gt;</code> would have had enough space to store these values.</p>
<h3 id="int-float-double-int">Int, Float, Double Int</h3>
<p>Let’s try out a more complex example in which integer and floating point values are interleaved.</p>
<p>Set a breakpoint on <code>testIntFloatDoubleInt</code> and run the following commands.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">(lldb) register read x0 -f d
      x0 = 400111
(lldb) register read s0 -f f
      s0 = 400.222
(lldb) register read d1 -f f
      d1 = 400.333
(lldb) register read x1 -f d
      x1 = 400444
</code></pre></div><p>Again, Swift puts the 1st and 2nd <code>Int</code> values in <code>x0</code> and <code>x1</code> respectively.</p>
<p>Also notice how the first floating point value is in <code>s0</code>, but the 2nd one is in <code>d1</code>. This is beacause the <code>s&lt;n&gt;</code>, and <code>d&lt;n&gt;</code> registers actually just represent a smaller section of a <code>v&lt;n&gt;</code> register. Once Swift uses <code>s0</code> for one argument it means that <code>d0</code>, and <code>v0</code> are used up too. It must store the next floaing point argument in <code>s1</code> / <code>d1</code>, etc.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I hope this article helped explain how Swift stores its floating point arguments on ARM64! If you’ve read <a href="https://vivekseth.com/swift-arm64-int-bool/">my first article</a> too you should now understand how Swift stores <code>Int</code>, <code>Bool</code>, <code>Float</code>, and <code>Double</code> types as arguments and return values.</p>
<p><code>Int</code> and <code>Bool</code> values are stored in the <code>x&lt;n&gt;</code> registers, and floaing point values are stored in the <code>v&lt;n&gt;</code> registers (or the smaller variants if possible).</p>
<p>In my next article I’m planning to cover how Swift stores <code>Strings</code> on ARM64.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure you use <a href="https://vivekseth.com/swift-arm64-int-bool/#placing-breakpoints-on-swift-functions">the approach desribed here</a> to set breakpoints. Setting breakpoints using the UI or using <code>breakpoint set --name &lt;func_name&gt;</code> may not work because LLDB may not pause the function on the first instruction. If other instructions execute, there’s a chance that the register values may get overwritten.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you are running this code on a real iOS device. If you run this code on the iOS simulator, Swift will likely be running on a x86 CPU which has a different calling convention.</p>

  <section>



    <article>
      

      <p>I recently had the opportunity to dive down into <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/nomad">Hashicorp’s Nomad</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>. We are looking into replacing a manually provisioned setup that is currently configured by <a href="https://www.saltstack.com/">Salt</a>. While Salt already offers us easy deployment and configuration of all our environments from a Salt server, we lack rolling updates, horizontal scaling and an easy way to roll back to an earlier version. We also want to do cool stuff, like deploy all of our features in pull requests for our non-developer teams to review.</p>

<p>Last but not least, being a small team, we would also like to avoid becoming system administrators of a small cluster of linux servers, requiring hardening and maintenance. This made us have a keen eye towards managed services, and becoming truly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_native_computing">Cloud Native™</a>.</p>

<p>Our application is already containerized with docker, so picking a container orchestrator to handle deployment is the default move, it is just a matter of which one.</p>



<h2 id="why-not-docker-compose-or-docker-swarm">Why not Docker Compose or Docker Swarm?</h2>
<p>We have built the entire application stack using docker containers, both provided by images readily available on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">dockerhub</a> and our own containerized code. This led us to a natural usage of docker-compose to orchestrate our stack when developing. The entire application stack includes rabbitmq, redis, celery and our product based on <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a> fronted by a gunicorn wsgi.</p>

<p>Docker Compose is great as it allows us to spin up all of our containers and dependent applications in unison. It is simple to configure and we keep our compose file source controlled in the same repository as our code. However, while it is <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/production/">certainly possible to use compose in production</a>, we were hesitant as it doesn’t quite qualify as an orchestrator, lacking replication, load balancing or rolling updates.</p>

<p>The next natural thing to explore would be <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/">Docker Swarm</a>. Swarm is native to docker and fulfills almost all of our requirements, aside from being managed by a provider. We did however steer clear off it after discussing potential requirements not involving docker containers.</p>


<p>My team, and especially the CTO, is not afraid of adopting new tech and likes to emphasize the fun-factor of working with software. So while Nomad currently is nowhere to be seen as a service on any of the big cloud providers, it deserved a thorough investigation before being cast aside. Especially considering Hashicorp’s track record of delightful products like <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform">Terraform</a> and <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-know-nomad">Getting to know Nomad</h2>
<p>Nomad offers great terminology, and when learning new software, terminology and to some degree analogy is key. Nomad uses Job, Task Groups and Tasks when defining what should actually be run on the cluster. This is great, as it immediately conveys an inheritance relationship and instills some sort of workflow in the mind of the user.</p>

<p>Example Nomad job file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>job</span><span> </span><span>"example"</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>datacenters</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"dc1"</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"service"</span><span>
  </span><span>group</span><span> </span><span>"caching-group"</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>task</span><span> </span><span>"redis"</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>driver</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"docker"</span><span>
      </span><span>config</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>image</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"redis:3.2"</span><span>
      </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>task</span><span> </span><span>"rabbitmq"</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>driver</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"docker"</span><span>
      </span><span>config</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>image</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"rabbitmq:latest"</span><span>
      </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>After reading some documentation, writing a simple job file, deploying it to your local development cluster, you open up the dashboard. Here, Nomad is a clear winner again. It offers an intuitive and inviting user interface, that quickly explains to you what you have running on your cluster and it’s current state.</p>

<p>Writing a job specification does however feel unpolished, as I was left with having to <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/2811">duplicate environment variables between Tasks</a> if multiple containers needed the same env vars.</p>

<p>Nomad’s container networking is also in need of some love. As with Kubernetes, Nomad offers an extra layer of networking to isolate and communicate between task allocations. However, as Container Network Interfacing just <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-general-availability-of-hashicorp-nomad-0-12">made it in this July</a>, it unfortunately ended up scaring me off as being too bleeding edge.</p>


<p>Kubernetes is ubiquitous. It is everywhere, on all the cloud providers as a service. It is hugely popular and with that popularity comes add-ons, modifications and a ton of guides and experiences to lean on. It does however also come with a legacy.</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-know-kubernetes">Getting to know Kubernetes</h2>
<p>Deployments, Jobs, ReplicaSets, ReplicationController, Pods, etc. It just doesn’t explain itself as nicely as terminology in Nomad. It requires the user to painstainkingly read all of the documentation before getting an idea about how they are connected, or not. This is of course only an issue when first learning Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Scowering through the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/">‘Getting Started’</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/">‘Concepts’</a> documentation of Kubernetes however, it also becomes apparent that it is wildly unopionated. This further slows my “time-to-market”, and I am left rather overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Now where Kubernetes shines: it is wildly unopinionated! You can configure and connect your resources (or kubernetes objects depending on the page of documentation you are on) in a multitude of ways. You can control your cluster in a multitude of ways, and you can write your yaml split into multiple files or in one big file if that fits your fancy.</p>

<p>Kubernetes is huge. I think it is described best by the quote on <a href="https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes/what-is-kubernetes">Ubuntu’s website</a>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Kubernetes ... started as a simple container orchestration tool but has grown into a cloud-native platform. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The deep cloud integration also means that spinning up a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer">Service</a> of type LoadBalancer actually creates a Load Balancer instance on your chosen cloud provider. How wild is that?</p>

<p>In 2020, it is <a href="https://twitter.com/ktheilgaard/status/1304703249610571777">unfair to call Kubernetes a Container Orchestrator</a>, it is simply so much more. It is a standardization of interacting with a cloud provider, and thus must be unopionated to allow for some inversion of control.</p>


<p>Nomad is far from mature and is simply not ready for a customer-facing production workload in my humble opinion. It already has large early adopters, but it appears to be for internal use. Had the networking and task configuration felt complete, as well as perhaps being offered as a managed service, I would probably have preferred working with Nomad, simply due to it being more opionated and thus simpler.</p>

<p>It is great to see the <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad">rapid development</a> that Nomad is undergoing, and I look forward to seeing it as a managed service sometime in the future.</p>

<p>For now though, Kubernetes is king.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		<div>
			<div><p>Rasa is an open source library for building conversational interfaces, most commonly called “chatbots”. Building a good chatbot is not an easy task and people at Rasa knows it, that’s why their library contains a lot of different components working together.</p>
<p>One of these components is the NLU (Natural Language Understanding) that resulted to be the best choice for a set of projects where I needed to build a model to do Named Entity Recognition. In this post I’d tell you some of the reasons I decided to go with Rasa.</p>
<p>Rasa has been built to create chatbots, so an important concept in this kind of tools is the “intent”. What the NLU tries to do is to distinguish between different “intentions” the user has when her inputs some text.</p>
<p>For example, if the user input is:</p>
<ul>
<li>hi</li>
<li>what’s up?</li>
<li>how you doing?</li>
</ul>
<p>The desired intent can be called “greet”.</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to order a burger with fries on the side</li>
<li>I’d like to order an hamburger with fries</li>
<li>I want a burger and some fries too</li>
</ul>
<p>The desired intent can be called “order”.</p>
<p>As you can see, the intents mechanism works like a classification model where the input is the users text and the predicted intent is the output.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The way Rasa is built makes it very easy to add examples to train the NLU. You don’t need to be a programmer nor have technical expertise to help, with a good documentation almost everyone could be capable to contribute(*). This allows a cheaper and faster way to move your project forward.</p>
<p>(*) There are exceptions like adding regular expressions or things from external components.</p>
<h2>Training</h2>
<p>The NLU training is made through several files located in the /data folder:</p>
<ul>
<li>intents: within each intent type it’s possible to add several claims, tagging the existing entities within the text.</li>
<li>synonyms: you can define synonyms between different words/tokens in order to normalize them into a single token.</li>
<li>lookup tables: you can add a list of words/tokens for each type of entity you’d like to extract, this kind of lists help improving the performance of the ML CRF model component included in Rasa.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see an example:</p>
<p><code>- intent: check_balance<br>
examples: |<br>
- What's my [credit](account) balance?<br>
- What's the balance on my [credit card account]{"entity":"account","value":"credit"}<br>
</code></p>
<p>In the code above we can see that for the “check_balance” intent we want to extract the account entity type. The words/tokens “credit” and “credit card account” both refer to the same “account” entity type.</p>
<p><code>- synonym: credit<br>
examples: |<br>
- credit card account<br>
- credit account</code></p>
<p>This way you can clearly tell the NLU to consider “credit card account” and “credit account” as synonyms to “credit”.</p>
<p>Then we can train the nlu with this command:</p>
<p><code>rasa train nlu</code></p>
<h2>Use</h2>
<p>In order to use this NLU component you need to run the service this way:</p>
<p><code>rasa run --enable-api -m models/CURRENTMODEL.tar.gz</code></p>
<p>Once the service is up and running we can make requests:</p>
<p><code>curl SERVER_IP:SERVER_PORT/model/parse -d '{"text": "SENTENCE"}'</code></p>
<p>Beautiful, we don’t need to build a custom API, we already have the service ready to use as it is.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p><code>rasa test nlu --config config.yml --nlu data/ --cross-validation</code></p>
<p>This command takes the “config.yml” file, where you can customize the pipeline with all the components and uses all the training files in the /data folder to evaluate the NLU model and generate the performance results. You don’t need to split the data into training and test sets, that’s done automatically by using the –cross-validation parameter.</p>
<p>The beauty of this is that it automatically generates files with all the metrics (f-score, precision, recall) for each entity type. It’s amazing the amount of time this can save you.</p>
<h2>Extensibility</h2>
<p>Adding components to the pipeline is really simple and transparent. Each component is represented by an independent Python script so you don’t have integration problems.</p>
<p>For example the Duckling component, an open source library developed by Facebook which allows you to extract time, date, number, duration and other features from text is easily integrated to Rasa by adding the following lines to the config.yml file:<code>- name: "DucklingHTTPExtractor"<br>
url: "http://0.0.0.0:8000"<br>
locale: "en_GB"<br>
dimensions: ["time", "amount-of-money", "duration", "ordinal", "number"]</code></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are some of the features that made me decide for Rasa for my last named entity recognition related projects. I encourage you to try it for yourself.</p>

<![CDATA[Should You Care About IPv6 Connectivity for Your Web Server?]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content-area">
<figure id="attachment_4836"><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/43b24700a36c52cd86ef021786d6a667/p/uploads/2020/02/c8961522.png" alt="city network illustration" width="1400" height="680" data-crediturl="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/wireless-communication-network-concept-iotinternet-things-1007765257" data-credittext="metamorworks"><figcaption><span><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/wireless-communication-network-concept-iotinternet-things-1007765257">metamorworks</a></span></figcaption></figure>
<p>IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol, replacing the outdated IPv4 that still powers the majority of the web, and solving the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion">IP exhaustion issue</a>. Is it really faster, and should you care about it for your server?</p>
<h2>Is IPv6 Faster?</h2>
<p>There’s a bit of debate surrounding this question. On paper, IPv6 should be marginally slower. <a href="https://www.omnisecu.com/tcpip/ipv6/comparison-between-ipv4-header-and-ipv6-header.php">The header size is much larger</a>, due to IPv6 needing 128 bits for the source and destination addresses compared to IPv4’s 32 bits. Overall, IPv6’s header size is nearly doubled.</p>
<p>This isn’t really an issue in practice though, since&nbsp;IPv6 is not just an increase in address size—it greatly simplifies the handling of traffic, and in some cases can lead to actual performance increases due to bottlenecks in IPv4 infrastructure.</p>
<p>In the past, IPv6 used to be terribly slow, but it’s getting better year by year. According to Facebook in 2015, <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/networking-traffic/ipv6-it-s-time-to-get-on-board/">IPv6 improved TCP connect response times by up to 15%</a>. However, this is on the order of a few milliseconds, which isn’t nothing, but isn’t such a radical speed benefit that would require you turn it on immediately.</p>
<p>In some cases though, IPv6 can actually be a bit slower than IPv4, not to mention the fact that some users may not be able to access IPv6 content.</p>
<h2>Verdict: It Doesn’t Hurt to Enable It</h2>
<p>The good news is, we don’t need to settle this debate here, since the question doesn’t actually matter. You don’t have to choose one or the other. Most modern browsers will <a href="https://superuser.com/a/1199141">send out TCP handshake requests to both the IPv4 and IPv6</a> addresses of your web server (as well as any other alternate addresses). Whichever one responds first is chosen to make the full connection.</p>
<p>If an older browser doesn’t support this, it will simply connect to the IPv4 address. This is known as the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Eyeballs">Happy Eyeballs</a>&nbsp;(or Fast Fallback) algorithm, and it’s the major reason that makes IPv6 adoptable in the first place.</p>
<p>Overall, if you can’t enable IPv6 for some reason, or simply don’t care, you won’t be missing out on much. However, enabling it is very simple, and with potential performance improvements on the table, it’s worth taking a few minutes to turn it on. After all, it can’t hurt.</p>

<h2>How To Turn On IPv6 in NGINX and Apache</h2>
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need to make sure your web server is even accessible over IPv6. This will usually involve you requesting an IPv6 address from your VPS provider. For AWS, IPv6 addresses are created automatically for EC2 instances, and are assigned to the ENI—not the instance itself.</p>
<p>After that, you’ll need to create an&nbsp;<strong>AAAA Record</strong> (four times IPv4) in your DNS, so that users will know what address to connect to. Your DNS provider should have an option for this. For AWS, you can even create AAAA Alias records, which will map dynamically to an AWS resource over IPv6.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/4fc49a91d112d63154ba425628de515a/p/uploads/2020/02/51480353.png" alt="dns aaaa record" width="532" height="322"></p>
<p>For NGINX, you can enable IPv6 by listening on your server’s available IPv6 addresses, with the following notation:</p>
<pre>server {
  listen [::]:80;
}</pre>
<p>Optionally, you can listen on a single manual address using <code>listen [ADDRESS]:80</code>, or only enable IPv6 using <code>ipv6only=on</code>.</p>
<p>For Apache, you can turn it on in the same manner using an additional <code>Listen</code> directive in your <code>httpd.conf</code>:</p>
<pre>Listen [ADDRESS]:80</pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I admit it: I haven’t taken notes in a while. Back in university I was generally using OneNote and drawing quick illustrations on the touch screen of my Lenovo. But that was a while ago, and I just recently found a reason to take notes again.</p>
<p>I began the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Coursera machine learning</a> course and ended up looking into note-taking solutions, trying to figure out which would suit my style and the content of the course best. After bouncing between a few different tools, my final “stack” is:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Notion</a> for taking notes (you can see the notes <a href="https://www.notion.so/Machine-Learning-Notes-fe3bb4e0fab84020a151739f6033e785" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://excalidraw.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Excalidraw</a> for illustrations (I won’t discuss this further, but it is a great way to generate quick and easy graphics for notes without getting caught up on perfectionism — for an example see the graphics on <a href="https://www.notion.so/Linear-Regression-with-One-Variable-c6742a27450f41118b8eb953c99275cf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this page</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jupyter</a> for running Python code (not actually required for the course, but I do it anyways so I can learn Python as I work through the course — you can view the notebooks <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/liamross/machine-learning-notes/tree/master/notes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose these because they ended up working best for me personally, but they may not be the best fit for everyone. However, I’ll discuss more why I made the choices I did, and you can decide for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>First, some requirements:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The tool should allow me to take notes easily and quickly</li>
<li>It should have good support for code snippets and math</li>
<li>Notes should look good with minimal intervention</li>
</ol>
<p>There have been an abundance of note-taking apps released recently (or not so recently), and many of them overlap in terms of functionality. I’m going to go through the ones I considered and explain why I ended up choosing Notion.</p>

<p>Now for the options that I immediately ruled out:</p>
<h3 id="onenote"><a href="#onenote" aria-label="onenote permalink"></a><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/onenote/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">OneNote</a></h3>
<p>Even though it served me well in university, I decided not to use OneNote for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>No native code snippet support (although it can be added with a plugin)</li>
<li>I wasn’t really a fan of the infinite canvas approach, I like some more structure</li>
<li>It feels pretty geared towards touch screens, and I’m not drawing my illustrations any more</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="evernote"><a href="#evernote" aria-label="evernote permalink"></a><a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Evernote</a></h3>
<p>The old reliable option. Definitely the most well-known out of all the options. Also probably the worst. I almost immediately ruled it out because:</p>
<ol>
<li>No syntax highlighting</li>
<li>No latex support (necessary for a course like machine learning with lots of math)</li>
<li>Limited formatting options (or at least obvious easy-to-use ones from my quick check)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="roam"><a href="#roam" aria-label="roam permalink"></a><a href="https://roamresearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Roam</a></h3>
<p>The hyped new note-taking tool / early cult formation. People have been going wild for it on twitter, so I figured I’d look into it. At the end of the day I ruled it out for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It costs money ($165 USD a year for “Professional”, or $500 USD for 5 years if you choose the “Believer” package… Hmmm)</li>
<li>Notes taken with it don’t actually look that good (but that’s just personal preference, they don’t look terrible)</li>
<li>It doesn’t offer me anything that other free options don’t have (or at least anything that I’d find useful for the kind of notes I’m taking)</li>
</ol>

<p>And now the options that actually worked. One common pro for all of these options is they are free, or at least offer a free tier which I fall under.</p>
<h3 id="obsidian"><a href="#obsidian" aria-label="obsidian permalink"></a><a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Obsidian</a></h3>
<p>I actually started taking notes with Obsidian, since it had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlink" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">backlinks</a> which I thought would be useful, especially if I wanted to organize my notes by topic rather than by lecture. However, I ended up switching to <a href="#Jupyter">Jupyter</a> in order to be able to have the notes be public, and in order to run Python code.</p>
<h4 id="pros-of-obsidian"><a href="#pros-of-obsidian" aria-label="pros of obsidian permalink"></a>Pros of Obsidian</h4>
<ol>
<li>Super easy to link between pages using the <code>[[Some other page]]</code> syntax. Can also use that syntax for images which is nice</li>
<li>Since Obsidian is just a file editor, you own the Markdown files it produces</li>
<li>Full latex math support</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="cons-of-obsidian"><a href="#cons-of-obsidian" aria-label="cons of obsidian permalink"></a>Cons of Obsidian</h4>
<ol>
<li>Limited by the fact it’s a Markdown editor in terms of formatting and syntax (also no way to format attached images so they aren’t full width)</li>
<li>Since it is a local application that uses a unique syntax for Markdown, you can’t easily share the notes</li>
<li>Even though I’m very proficient with Markdown (this blog is written in it!), it sucks to take bad Markdown-looking notes and have the actual nice notes in a different view</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="jupyter"><a href="#jupyter" aria-label="jupyter permalink"></a><a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jupyter</a></h3>
<p>I switched to Jupyter to share the notes publicly and to run Python algorithms in-line. However, it suffered from the same Markdown weaknesses as Obsidian, and was an even worse tool for actual note-taking. I ended up switching to <a href="#Notion">Notion</a>, but continue to use Jupyter for supplementary Python examples related to my notes. All in all this isn’t really Jupyter’s fault, since it was never really designed for heavy-duty multi-notebook note-taking. However in my dreams there will one day be a tool with the features of Notion but with the ability for running in-line code.</p>
<h4 id="pros-of-jupyter"><a href="#pros-of-jupyter" aria-label="pros of jupyter permalink"></a>Pros of Jupyter</h4>
<ol>
<li>Being able to run Python code in-line is by far the largest benefit of using Jupyter</li>
<li>You own the files</li>
<li>Full latex math support</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="cons-of-jupyter"><a href="#cons-of-jupyter" aria-label="cons of jupyter permalink"></a>Cons of Jupyter</h4>
<ol>
<li>Absolutely terrible for linking between files. Have to basically do <code>[Other page](./other_page.ipynd)</code> each time, and obviously that’s even worse if the path isn’t that simple. Jupyter definitely wasn’t made for that kind of note-taking. Same for images</li>
<li>Same cons as Obsidian with relation to being a Markdown editor, although Jupyter has a edit mode for blocks rather than persistent Markdown, so the experience is a bit better. Nonetheless, I still found myself constantly editing then “running” blocks which was slightly inconvenient</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="notion"><a href="#notion" aria-label="notion permalink"></a><a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Notion</a></h3>
<p>Finally, I ended up trying out Notion and it stuck.</p>
<h4 id="pros-of-notion"><a href="#pros-of-notion" aria-label="pros of notion permalink"></a>Pros of Notion</h4>
<ol>
<li>Notes look immediately good, and there are more formatting options </li>
<li>Decent latex support. Slightly worse than Obsidian and Jupyter since it only has Katex support, but still good enough for my use cases so far</li>
<li>They just recently introduced backlinks which I’ve found to be quite nice</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="cons-of-notion"><a href="#cons-of-notion" aria-label="cons of notion permalink"></a>Cons of Notion</h4>
<ol>
<li>Takes a while to index new pages so linking to them can be slow for the first bit</li>
<li>A con that is specific to moving to Notion from Jupyter is I can no longer run in-line Python. However I still have Jupyter notebooks containing live Python code, and I link to them from the Notion notes so I still get the benefits of Notion and Jupyter</li>
<li>No support for tables that aren’t databases. A bit of a bummer if you just want to make a simple Markdown table to display some information (like a training set which comes up a lot in the machine learning course)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I’m very happy with Notion so far. It allows me to take notes quickly, and hits all the requirement checkboxes. Additionally, it’s easy to share as a public site for my notes, which is an added benefit. To see the notes click <a href="https://www.notion.so/Machine-Learning-Notes-fe3bb4e0fab84020a151739f6033e785" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>, and to visit the repository with code examples and Jupyter notebooks click <a href="https://github.com/liamross/machine-learning-notes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

Sometimes. But not always. Consider the following snippet of code:</p><div data-language="cpp"><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>g</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>I intentionally do not define <code>g</code> in this translation unit since otherwise, the compiler will be too smart and inline everything.
Nevertheless, all the major C++ compilers can figure out that <code>f</code> only contains a tail-call to <code>g</code> and generate codes like this:</p><p>Now lets consider the following code:</p><div data-language="cpp"><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>g</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>noexcept</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>g</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Since the compilers have no idea if <code>g</code> would throw or not, they are forced to generate codes that invoke <code>std::terminate</code> in case bad things happened.
Here is the result codegen from various compilers:</p><p>msvc</p><div data-language="nasm"><pre><code><span>$</span>ip2state<span>$</span>int f(void) DB <span>02H</span>

        call    __cxa_begin_catch
        call    std::terminate()</code></pre></div><h2>How to deal with C functions?</h2><p>Now we know that <code>noexcept</code> can cause overhead if we call a non-noexcept function inside, how do we deal with functions that will not throw but are not mark as <code>noexcept</code>? Fortunately, the venerable <a href="https://twitter.com/hankadusikova?s=20">Hana Dusíková</a> came up with a clever solution:</p><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Did you ever get an suboptimal code, because you were calling external C function in your noexcept code?</p><p>Suffer no more:<a href="https://t.co/LA7C76a063">https://t.co/LA7C76a063</a></p></div>— Hana Dusíková 🍊 (@hankadusikova) <a href="https://twitter.com/hankadusikova/status/1276828584179642368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2020</a></blockquote><p>You can mark the <code>noexcept_cast</code> function force inline by compiler-specific extensions so it will not decrease performance in debug mode.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Don't spam <code>noexcept</code> if you don't have a project-wise "no exception" policy. And be especially careful with higher-order functions that may invoke user-defined functions. All in all, <code>noexcept</code> is a part of the type system and the contract of your API. Only add <code>noexcept</code> to function that you want to guarantee not to throw.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>All data and engineering teams are faced with a constant inflow of organizational, technical, and interpersonal problems and the ability of your team to have business impact will depend largely on how effectively it can move towards optimal solutions to those problems.&nbsp; In this article, I discuss<em> four communication techniques</em> that improve the ability of a team to solve problems.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://documents.app.lucidchart.com/documents/4a162d92-9c91-4478-91b4-b893591b316f/pages/0_0?a=624&amp;x=109&amp;y=38&amp;w=844&amp;h=253&amp;store=1&amp;accept=image%2F*&amp;auth=LCA%2015c6c000cf3d2ca79ca0f2238c9ccfd56666e1b7-ts%3D1600622689" alt="" width="553" height="164"></figure>



<p><strong><em>Work from the problem to the solution:&nbsp; move in the right direction.</em></strong></p>



<p>When presented with a problem, first spend time elucidating the problem space before addressing potential solutions.&nbsp; Interestingly, I think the intuitive and most common approach is to do the opposite: present and advocate for your solution. &nbsp; I think the reason for this is that people tend to assume that others understand the problem as clearly as you do, that you have a full understanding of the problem, and that you understand which aspects of the problem are the most critical to solve for the business.&nbsp; Thus, the only thing that is interesting is the solution you came up with – a solution that is either clever or based on your notable experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem though is that these assumptions are usually wrong.&nbsp; Typically if you spend time first fleshing out the problem, you will realize that other people on the team have context on the problem that you don’t have.&nbsp; Or that they do not share an understanding of what the problem is or that there is disagreement about what aspects of the problem are the most critical to solve first.&nbsp; Often you will realize that people are focused on solving the technical problem but that they do not have a good understanding of the <em>business </em>problem.&nbsp; It is critical that the business problem is clearly fleshed out before addressing the technical problem.</p>



<p><em>Recommendation.&nbsp; </em>Spend time talking about the problem before anyone presents solutions.&nbsp; It will make sure everyone has the same context.&nbsp; It ensures that the business problem is the focus and that people will agree – <em>before presenting their solution ideas</em> – which aspects of the problem are the most critical to solve. This process helps remove ego from the conversation, which can develop when a group of smart highly experienced present different solutions that incidentally emphasize different aspects of the problem.&nbsp; Time spent on the problem space consistently will help you identify better solutions, more efficiently, and with less drama.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://documents.app.lucidchart.com/documents/4a162d92-9c91-4478-91b4-b893591b316f/pages/0_0?a=624&amp;x=121&amp;y=330&amp;w=853&amp;h=272&amp;store=1&amp;accept=image%2F*&amp;auth=LCA%2025c83fef8709e6b41929b2f07e7877b84a6ba280-ts%3D1600622689" alt="" width="576" height="183"></figure>



<p><strong><em>Split-tracking – prevent circular and chaotic conversations.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>I have seen a number of conversations about thorny problems go in circles and not only fail to identify good solutions but even make little progress towards a shared understanding of the problem space.&nbsp; How do you prevent this from happening?&nbsp; The primary thing to do is to keep your conversation organized.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One way to do so is to use a technique called <em>split-tracking</em>.&nbsp; Split-tracking is a technique, in which you identify that more than one issue or concern has been raised, bring group awareness to this observation, generate consensus that there is more than one issue at play, and then push others to focus on one issue at a time. &nbsp; Why does this help? &nbsp; People often don’t realize that they are conflating two issues so they don’t realize when they are jumping back and forth between these issues.&nbsp; If these issues are not explicitly identified and separated, it can be hard to probe and press a person’s thinking on an issue – they can unconsciously side-step into the second issue. If there are multiple people discussing a problem, it is possible for people to start going in circles if different people re-direct the group to a secondary issue and then another person brings it back to the first issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Recommendation.&nbsp; </em>Be on the lookout for multiple underlying issues and concerns.&nbsp; If you see them, stop the conversation and say,  “I am hearing two issues here.&nbsp; One is issue $X and other is issues $Y.&nbsp; Which one should we focus on first?” &nbsp; Make sure other people realize that there are separate issues – even if they are correlated – and get them to agree to work on them separately.&nbsp; In general, think like a scientist – care about the taxonomy of your problem and neatly classify all the sub-problems that exist and their relation to each other (i.e., this is a subproblem of this bigger problem).&nbsp; You can work towards a solution much more effectively, if the problem space is well organized and explicitly understood by everyone in the conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Empathy – prevent friction and “land mines” from stopping forward progress.</em></strong></p>



<p>Have you ever been in a meeting discussing a problem, making some progress, and then just suddenly had all forward progress come screeching to a halt? &nbsp; Usually this happens when people become defensive or if the conversation triggered an emotional response in someone.&nbsp; How do we prevent this from happening?&nbsp; Although each individual needs to work to keep the bigger picture in mind and to keep their ego out of the conversation, you cannot control other people’s reactions.&nbsp; So what can you do?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Recommendation.&nbsp; </em>Work on being more empathetic in your communication.&nbsp; Carefully consider how others view the problem and how some aspects of the problem may impact them and their work more than you.&nbsp; Consider that even if they have less relevant experience than you, that they still want their viewpoints to be considered and valued.&nbsp; In general, approach people and their thoughts with curiosity.&nbsp; Try to clarify your understanding of their perspective and make it clear that you are spending time trying to understand their views.</p>



<p>If you do this, you will be less likely to trigger an emotional response that will put a lot of friction between you and your solution.&nbsp; You will make people feel heard even if the solution that is ultimately arrived at doesn’t solve their main pain points. When you approach problems empathetically, it is also easier to build consensus and excitement in the group, which is critical. Identifying the solution is not the final step – implementing the solution is, and you want a motivated team to tackle that step.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emphasizing empathy when working with others has a few other advantages.&nbsp; One, because empathy is driven by curiosity about someone’s perspective, it makes it easier to identify genuine issues that you hadn’t been considering previously, thereby enriching your understanding of the problem.&nbsp; Two, it will help you identify nuances in the concerns of others, providing opportunities for split-tracking and organization of the conversation.&nbsp; Three, empathetic communication enhances psychological safety of the group, which in turn means that all people will feel comfortable voicing their concerns and insights. A group that can communicate openly will be better at fleshing out the full problem space and thereby will be better at identifying the optimal solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, I would like to note although people inherently vary in how empathetic they are, it is also a skill that can be cultivated. &nbsp; So make it a mindset that you work actively to engage in.&nbsp; Cultivate your curiosity. If you struggle with it, try meditation. Its core teaching is the power of developing an open loving curiosity about the world.&nbsp; I’ve spent a week in silent meditation, and I can tell you that if you can find the in and out flow of your breath to be fascinating, then it becomes easy to be intrigued by the perspective of your peers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Monitoring – keep the conversation on track</strong></p>



<p>The part of the brain involved in understanding and solving a problem, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, is distinct from the part of the brain, the medial prefrontal cortex, that is involved in monitoring your environment and behavior for errors that signal a course correction is needed.&nbsp; I have noticed that leaders, who are great at moving a team towards optimal solutions, are able to keep this monitoring brain area highly activated even as they also help the team move towards a solution.&nbsp; They tend to be constantly scanning the conversation at a meta-level looking for issues that will derail it.&nbsp; So what type of issues are they monitoring for?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Establish what you are monitoring for and set the conditions.&nbsp; </em>To know what to monitor for, you first need to clearly identify, at the start of a meeting, what your agenda is and what the basic problem(s) is that you will address.&nbsp; Once there is consensus here, it will be clearer to you if the conversation has moved off track and what you should be monitoring for.&nbsp; Moreover, it also ensures that you have needed conditions for keeping the conversation on track.&nbsp; For example, given your agenda, you should evaluate whether you even have the right decision makers in the room.&nbsp; Do you have unnecessary people who can push the conversation into tangents or are you lacking the needed people so that even if you make a decision, you may not be able to act upon that decision?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Conversation below the right level?&nbsp; </em>Is someone “going into the weeds” by diving into a technical explanation that isn’t needed right now? &nbsp; Monitor for this and pull the group out quickly. &nbsp; At best, it is just a waste of time.&nbsp; At worst, it will derail the conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Conversation above the right level?&nbsp; </em>Similarly, thoughts can steer the conversation to a level above the agenda.&nbsp; For example, if your company recently switched to a pods organization and there is some question about how to best handle ownership of one line of work in this new pod structure, it can be easy for the conversation to suddenly be about the pods themselves – whether they are good and how to change and improve the pods.&nbsp; This level of conversation would be above the one set in your agenda, is not one that you want to or are capable of addressing in your current meeting, and if you even were interested in addressing it, you probably don’t have the right people in the room to do so.&nbsp; Pull …</p></div></article></div>

<article>
  <p>Nearly a century ago, Alonzo Church invented the simple, elegant, and yet elusive lambda calculus. Along with Alan Turing, he then proved the Church-Turing thesis: that anything computable with a Turing machine can also be computed in the lambda calculus. However, nearly as soon as we had digital computers, we started inventing programming languages, and with them a vast treasure of features, beautiful and terrible, many of which seem very hard to relate to the fundamental nature of computability, let alone the lambda calculus specifically.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While it’s true that anything which can be computed, period, can be computed in the lambda calculus, you might not want to: it’s austere, to say the least, and was not designed with modern sensibilities regarding readability in mind. We developed all those languages and features for a reason! Still, Church demonstrated not just that it was possible to compute anything computable with the lambda calculus, but also <em>how</em> one might do so.</p>
<p>In this series, we’ll examine some ways to express common programming language features using the minimalistic tools of the lambda calculus. We begin with perhaps the most ubiquitous type: booleans.</p>
<h2 id="λ-is-blind">λ is blind</h2>
<p>The lambda calculus’s austerity is extreme: you don’t even have booleans. All you have are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Lambda abstractions;</p></li>
<li><p>Applications; and</p></li>
<li><p>Variables.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll now review these in some detail; feel free to skip this section if you’re already familiar with the lambda calculus.</p>
<h3 id="lambda-abstractions">Lambda abstractions</h3>
<p>Lambda abstractions (“lambdas,” “abstractions,” and “functions” will also be used interchangeably) introduce a function of a single variable.</p>
<p>Abstractions are written <code>λ x . y</code>, for variable <code>x</code> and expression <code>y</code>, where <code>x</code> is now available as a bound variable in the body, and any enclosing definition of <code>x</code> is shadowed (i.e.&nbsp;<code>λ x . λ x . x</code> = <code>λ x . λ y . y</code> ≠ <code>λ x . λ y . x</code>). (We shall assume strictly lexical scoping for the time being.)</p>
<p>In Haskell, we would write <code>\ x -&gt; y</code> instead; in JavaScript, <code>function (x) { return y }</code> or <code>(x) =&gt; y</code>.</p>
<h3 id="applications">Applications</h3>
<p>Applications (“function application” and “function call” will be used interchangeably) apply the result of the expression on the left to the expression on the right.</p>
<p>Applications are written as <code>x y</code>, for expressions x and y, and left-associated, i.e.&nbsp;<code>a b c</code> = <code>(a b) c</code> ≠ <code>a (b c)</code>. Function application binds tighter than lambda abstraction, i.e.&nbsp;<code>λ x . λ y . y x</code> = <code>λ x . λ y . (y x)</code> ≠ <code>λ x . (λ y . y) x</code>.</p>
<p>The syntax is the same in Haskell; in JavaScript, we would write <code>x(y)</code> or <code>a(b, c)</code>. Note however that since lambda calculus functions are all single-argument functions, a more direct (though less idiomatic) equivalent for the latter would be <code>a(b)(c)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>
<p>Variables introduced by enclosing lambdas.</p>
<p>Variable are written as more or less arbitrary names, typically alphanumeric (e.g.&nbsp;<code>x</code> or <code>y0</code> or <code>thing</code>); however, we will feel free to include non-alphanumeric characters in names as we see fit, since the paucity of syntax means there’s little risk of ambiguity.</p>
<p>Since the only available variables are those bound by enclosing lambdas, we can also infer that there are no <code>let</code> bindings for local variables, and no globals of any sort; the lambda calculus doesn’t come with a standard library.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>In quasi-BNF, the grammar for the lambda calculus is extremely minimal:</p>
<figure>
<p><em>e</em> <strong>:=</strong> <code>λ</code> <em>x</em> <code>.</code> <em>e</em> <strong>|</strong> <em>e</em> <em>e</em> <strong>|</strong> <em>x</em> <strong>|</strong> (<em>e</em>)</p>
</figure>
<p>And finally, this table gives a side-by-side comparison of the syntax of the lambda calculus with the corresponding syntax in Haskell &amp; JavaScript:</p>

<p>Lambdas are the only way to introduce values—they’re the only “literal” syntax in the language. We can therefore infer that the only kinds of runtime values must be closures. In an interpreter for the lambda calculus, closures might consist of the name of the introduced variable, the body of the lambda, &amp; a map relating the names and values of any variables it closed over when constructed (again, we assume strict lexical scoping). There are no bits, bytes, words, pointers, or objects in the language’s semantics; only this runtime representation of lambdas.</p>
<p>Likewise, lambdas are also the only way to introduce variables—there’s no standard library, built-ins, primitives, prelude, or global environment to provide common definitions. We’re truly baking the apple pie from scratch.</p>
<p>All of this raises the question: how do you <em>do</em> anything when you don’t even have <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>? Lambdas and variables don’t <em>do</em>, they merely <em>are</em>, so that leaves application. When all you have is application, everything looks like a lambda abstraction, so we’ll represent booleans using lambdas.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not <em>just</em> booleans we’re after; <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> aren’t much use without <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>if</code>, and all the rest. To be useful, our representation of booleans should therefore suffice to define these, as well. But how do you define <code>if</code> without using <code>if</code>? In a lazy language like Haskell, we might define <code>if</code> as a function something like so:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>if_ ::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb1-2">if_ cond then_ else_ <span>=</span> <span>if</span> cond <span>then</span> then_ <span>else</span> else_</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In a strict language like JavaScript, we’d instead take functions for the alternatives:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>function</span> <span>if_</span>(cond<span>,</span> then_<span>,</span> else_) {</span>
<span id="cb2-2">  <span>if</span> (cond) {</span>
<span id="cb2-3">    <span>then_</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">  } <span>else</span> {</span>
<span id="cb2-5">    <span>else_</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6">  }</span>
<span id="cb2-7">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Both these definitions use the language’s native booleans and <code>if</code> syntax (a tactic for implementing embedded DSLs known as “meta-circularity”), and thus aren’t viable in the lambda calculus. However, they do give us a hint: in both cases we have a function taking a condition, consequence, and alternative, and using the first to select one of the latter two. In the lambda calculus, we might start by writing:</p>
<pre><code>if = λ cond then else . ?</code></pre>
<p>(Note: there aren’t any keywords in the lambda calculus, so there’s nothing stopping me from naming variables things like <code>if</code>, a fact which I will take free advantage of.)</p>
<p>We’ve introduced a definition for <code>if</code>, as a function of three parameters; now what do we do with them? The lambda calculus’s stark palette makes it easy to enumerate <em>all</em> the things we can do with some variable <code>a</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Ignore it, whether by simply not mentioning it at all (as in <code>λ a . λ b . b</code>), or by shadowing it with another lambda which binds the same name (as in <code>λ a . λ a . a</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Mention it, whether on its own in the body of a lambda (as in <code>λ a . a</code> or <code>λ a . λ b . a</code>), somewhere within either side of an application (as in <code>λ a . λ b . a b</code> or <code>λ a . λ b . b a</code>), or some combination of both (as in <code>λ a . (λ b . a) a</code>).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We could for example simply return <code>then</code> or <code>else</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if = λ cond then else . then
if = λ cond then else . else</code></pre>
<p>But in that case the conditional isn’t conditional at all—the value in no way depends on <code>cond</code>. Clearly the body must make use of all three variables if we want it to behave like the <code>if</code>s we know and love from other languages.</p>
<p>Taking a step back for a moment, let’s examine the roles of <code>if</code>’s arguments. <code>then</code> and <code>else</code> are passive; we only want to use or evaluate one or the other depending on the value of <code>cond</code>. <code>cond</code>, then, is the key: it takes the active role.</p>
<p>Thus, in the same way that our <code>if_</code> functions in Haskell &amp; JavaScript employed those language’s features to implement, we’re going to define <code>if cond then else</code> as the application of the condition to the other two parameters:</p>
<pre><code>if = λ cond then else . cond then else</code></pre>

<p>This feels strangely like cheating: surely we’ve only moved the problem around. Now instead of <code>if</code> making the decision about which argument to return, we’ve deferred it to <code>cond</code>. But <code>if</code> and <code>cond</code> aren’t the same, semantically; <code>if</code> takes a boolean and two other arguments and returns one of the latter, while <code>cond</code> <em>is</em> a boolean—albeit evidently a boolean represented as a function. Let’s make that precise by writing down <code>if</code>’s type:</p>
<pre><code>if : Bool -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code></pre>
<p>Notwithstanding our use of the yet-to-be-defined name <code>Bool</code> for the type of the condition, this is the same type as we gave <code>if_</code> in Haskell; that’s a good sign that we’re on the right track! It takes a <code>Bool</code> and two arguments of type <code>a</code>, and it must return one of those because that’s the only way for it to come up with the <code>a</code> that it returns. But what <em>is</em> <code>Bool</code>?</p>
<p>Working backwards from the type and definition of <code>if</code>, we see that <code>cond</code> is applied to two arguments, and therefore must be a function of two parameters. Further, these are both of type <code>a</code>, and the value it returns must also be of type <code>a</code> for <code>if</code>’s type to hold. Thus, we can define the type <code>Bool</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code>Bool = ∀ a . a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code></pre>

<p>If a given <code>Bool</code> is a function of two arguments of arbitrary type, returning the same type, it must therefore select one of its arguments to return. There are only two distinguishable inhabitants of <code>Bool</code>, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, so we can therefore deduce that since <code>if</code> defers the selection of the result to the <code>Bool</code>, for <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> to actually differ they must make opposite selections. In other words, <code>true</code> must return the <code>then</code> parameter, while <code>false</code> must return the <code>else</code> one:</p>
<pre><code>true, false : Bool
true  = λ then else . then
false = λ then else . else</code></pre>
<p>We didn’t move the problem around after all; we solved it. What we noticed was a deeper insight: this encoding of booleans makes <code>if</code> redundant, since if we can apply <code>if</code> to a <code>Bool</code> and two arguments, we could equally apply the <code>Bool</code> to those arguments directly.</p>

<p>It’s frequently convenient to conflate booleans with bits, their minimal representation, but in truth they’re not the same at all. Practically, some programming languages define booleans as a byte in memory, perhaps clamping its values to 0 and 1; others define them as instances of some boolean class, or constructors of an algebraic datatype. Some provide no formal relationship between <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> at all, save for a common interface—duck typing.</p>
<p>Mathematically, booleans are the values in propositional logic; the upper and lower bounds of a lattice; the zero and one of a semiring; the members of the set with cardinality 2; …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>Pikchr (pronounced "picture") is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pic_language">PIC</a>-like markup
language for diagrams in technical documentation.  Pikchr is
designed to be embedded in <a href="https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#fenced-code-blocks">fenced code blocks</a> of
Markdown or similar mechanisms of other documentation markup languages.</p>

<p>For example, the diagram:</p>

<p>Pikchr diagrams can appear in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Wiki pages</li>
<li>Tickets and bug reports</li>
<li>Forum posts</li>
<li>Check-in comments</li>
<li>Anywhere else that Markdown or similar markup languages are used</li>
</ul>

<p>Pikchr diagrams are easy to generate.  The language is simple.
There is lots of documentation and examples on-line (links below).
Anyone who is comfortable using Markdown should be able to pick up Pikchr
with minimal extra effort.</p>

<p>Pikchr is safe for use in internet-facing applications.  Hostile
Pikchr scripts cause no harm (apart from generating ugly diagrams).</p>

<h2>Demos</h2>

<li><a href="https://pikchr.org/home/pikchrshow">/pikchrshow</a> ← Enter Pikchr text and see the result on-line</li>
</ul>

<h2>Documentation Is A Work In Progress</h2>
<p>As of 2020-09-16, the Pikchr code is stable and is in active use.
However, documentation is still under development.
We are using Pikchr to write the Pikchr documentation (in Markdown),
hence it was necessary to deploy Pikchr into a working content
management system (<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/fossil">Fossil</a> in this case) prior to having
complete documentation available.  Volunteer assistance is welcomed!</p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">


  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <blockquote>
  <p>Explicit is better than implicit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first line of a PyTorch training loop normally looks like this:</p>

<p><code>text, hypothesis, judgement = current_batch</code></p>

<p>Or it might look like this 🤔:</p>

<p><code>hypothesis, text, judgement = current_batch</code></p>

<p>It’s easy to forget the correct order and I prefer to make the components of my minibatch explicit.</p>

<p><code>current_batch.hypothesis</code></p>

<p>This blog post is going to demonstrate how to use <code>NamedTuples</code> to allow the above access.</p>

<p>We will implement a custom <code>torch.utils.data.Dataset</code> and will pass it to the <code>data.DataLoader</code>.</p>

<p>Our <code>InferenceDataset</code> is just a wrapper over <code>pandas.DataFrame</code> that returns <code>namedtuples</code> :</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>InferenceDataset</span><span>(</span><span>Dataset</span><span>):</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>df</span><span>:</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>DataFrame</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>df</span> <span>=</span> <span>df</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__len__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>df</span><span>)</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__getitem__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>key</span><span>):</span>
        <span>assert</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>)</span> <span>is</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>f"Non-intiger key (</span><span>{</span><span>key</span><span>}</span><span>)"</span>
        <span>current_row</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>df</span><span>.</span><span>iloc</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>]</span>

        <span>InfRow</span> <span>=</span> <span>namedtuple</span><span>(</span><span>"InfRow"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>"text"</span><span>,</span> <span>"hypothesis"</span><span>,</span> <span>"judgement"</span><span>))</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>InfRow</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>=</span><span>current_row</span><span>.</span><span>text</span><span>,</span>
                      <span>hypothesis</span><span>=</span><span>current_row</span><span>.</span><span>hypothesis</span><span>,</span>
                      <span>judgement</span><span>=</span><span>current_row</span><span>.</span><span>judgement</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you’re not familiar with <code>namedtuple</code>s, returning an instance of <code>InfRow</code> might seem confusing, however, it just acts like a regular tuple with the added benefit of named access to fields.</p>

<p>Consequently, the vanilla tuple operations work:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>row</span> <span>=</span> <span>InfRow</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>=</span><span>"I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."</span><span>,</span>
	     <span>hypothesis</span><span>=</span><span>"I've believed in three impossible things before breakfast."</span><span>,</span>
	     <span>judgement</span><span>=</span><span>"implication"</span><span>)</span>

<span># integer indexation is the same as for vanilla tuples
</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>row</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>])</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>I</span><span>'ve believed in three impossible things before breakfast

# and so is unpacking
text, hypothesis, judgement = row
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above is great news for backwards compatability, ensuring that you can modify and test your <code>DataLoaders</code> one at a time, while keeping the old code for training and inference.</p>

<p>In addition to the standard access methods, <code>namedtuples</code> provide the named fields, that we’re after:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># cont. from above
</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>row</span><span>.</span><span>hypothesis</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>I</span><span>'ve believed in three impossible things before breakfast
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We construct the <code>InferenceDataset</code> by loading our dataset files into a <code>DataFrame</code> and passing the <code>DataFrame</code> to the <code>InferenceDataset</code> constructor:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>train_df</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>read_csv</span><span>(</span><span>dataset_path</span><span>)</span>
<span>train_dataset</span> <span>=</span> <span>InferenceDataset</span><span>(</span><span>train_df</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then pass it to the <code>DataLoader</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>train_dataloader</span> <span>=</span> <span>DataLoader</span><span>(</span>
        <span>train_dataset</span><span>,</span>
        <span>sampler</span><span>=</span><span>RandomSampler</span><span>(</span><span>train_dataset</span><span>),</span>
        <span>batch_size</span><span>=</span><span>batch_size</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And within normal iteration, we can access the minibatch fields by names:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>batch</span> <span>in</span> <span>train_dataloader</span><span>:</span>
    <span>prediction</span> <span>=</span> <span>model</span><span>(</span><span>batch</span><span>.</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>batch</span><span>.</span><span>hypothesis</span><span>)</span>
    <span>....</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Printers are cool because they are, but I have friends that remind me at least weekly that hacking a printer is not useful. Every time it’s mostly the same thing all over again, find a 1990 type bug, write a stupid script, done.
Some months ago, I started a new project, a wild ride inside Google’s humongous codebase. While most of Google code, especially Android, is open source, some parts are not.
I’ll try to talk about one such case, the bootloader of a Pixel 3 phone.</p>

<p>What you are about to read mostly applies to Android 10 and later versions. Much has changed, but the exciting part for us is that now fastboot can run in userspace mode.</p>
<p><a href="https://source.android.com/devices/bootloader/fastbootd">Here</a> you can find the nitty-gritty details, the TL;DR is something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recovery and Fastboot partitions are now the same thing. One less partition, more code reuse. Nice.</li>
<li>The mechanisms to start Recovery or Fastboot is now slightly different, but this is taken care of by the bootloader.</li>
<li>Userspace Fastboot can’t issue some types of commands, namely OEM.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because Userspace fastboot can’t issue OEM commands, we will have to dig into the bootloader code.</p>

<p>Ok, we got a binary, let’s see what’s inside.</p>

</code></pre><p>As soon as I saw that, I started wondering when phones started using UEFI. UEFI and EDK2 are cool, but when did they end up being used in phones?</p>
<p><a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/qcomxbl/">Here</a> there are some notes on the history of why QC uses UEFI. If I understand it correctly, it’s because they want to support Windows on ARM.</p>
<p>Now that we know it’s UEFI, and we satisfied our curiosity on why it’s UEFI, we can start working on it.</p>

<p>Binwalk on the bootloader image will yield precisely zero. UEFI images are very structured, support compression, and allow for nested volumes. Ether, you know what you are looking at, or you are not going to get far.</p>
<p>Get uefi-firmware-parser from pip with</p>
<p><code>python -m pip install --user uefi-firmware-parser</code></p>
<p>uefi-firmware-parser it’s more of a framework and can be used in scripts. Fortunately, they provide a super nice and handy wrapper. The script can brute force <code>-b</code> any unknown image type, searching for known UEFI magic numbers.</p>

            <p>Mr. Jobs had a fascinating desire to make the internals of his Macintosh computer as aesthetically pleasing as the outside. There is something uniquely meaningful to us about this aim that at first thought one cannot describe. The affect of his aim lies in something we call "artisanship". That is: a perception of additional value that is orthogonal to the perceivable value that could have otherwise have been excavated if the producer had chosen to invest time in it.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.robsdomain.com/content/images/2020/05/Artboard-1.jpg"></figure><p>Perhaps because we realize time is finite and intrinsically meaningful we perceive the time invested into the intrinsic beauty of the totality of the object as aesthetic and are more willing to ascribe it a higher value. </p><p>Software is different from hardware in that a physical product is, in a way, an authoritative truth: it is materially in front of you as a "thing" that isn't easily transformed into something else. Software, on the other hand, &nbsp;suffers (and benefits) from the attribute of being an "iterable truth". It has little to no material cost besides time and due to its non-material anchoring is infinitely malleable. Unlike a physical good, software does not trigger the instinctive quality heuristic to "measure twice cut once". An incorrect cut may be metaphorically "undone" by throwing away the wood because the wood costs little to nothing. There is no penalty for the failure to prepare and measure it seems.</p><p>In the continued search for universal principles of application I often wonder whether the artisanal dimension of a product is applicable to the digital world. While that would be my hope – as there is little more satisfying than the comfort of a universal principle to justify your stubborn investment in perfection – evidence continues to suggest the contrary. </p><p>Perhaps the phenomenon of artisanal beauty is unique only to products that exist in material domains; however, at times I wonder if the contemporary technology myth of "moving quickly and allowing things to break" has become too saturated in the collective compass to see other approaches. Does real world artisanal software exist? Would the end customer even care?</p><p>Maybe artisanal software is produced for the joy in craft of the creator rather than the consumer. Comically a lot like life in a way.</p><hr><p>Kind thanks to <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/statue-inside-room-2661943/">Alex Y</a> of Pexels for the cover image</p>

      <p>A few days ago I re-published on the Chrome Web Store a small browser extension "HackerNews No Pressure". You can find the store listing <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hackernews-no-pressure/bonmddkjpellaijbbpejnboedneopbgp" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>It's purpose is to hide user scores, comment scores, and link scores when browsing <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">https://news.ycombinator.com</a>. The implementation is ridiculously simple, it doesn't have any logic, and only consists in a small stylesheet that hides a few elements. It doesn't have any impact other than this and is fairly stable, I'm using it as a side-loaded extension since around 5 years now with zero maintenance.</p>
<p>Someone <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24455242">asked about that feature</a> in a recent thread, so I felt that would be nice to make it available again to more people.</p>
<p>And that's how HN looks when enabled.</p>

  <p>Plastic is really bad for the environment. It takes 450 to 1000 years to degrade[1]. It affects marine life and litters our streets. Only around 9% of plastic is being recycled every year in the US. We are in Chicago. Everywhere we look, there's a piece of plastic stuck somewhere. We started an experiment to go plastic free grocery shopping for 1 month. These are our findings.</p>

<h4>1 - Our cost of food has gone down 70%.</h4>

<p>We are surprised. We thought we would have to pay more for our grocery. Here is a comparison of food prices with and without plastic packaging. The prices are from 5 popular grocery stores in Chicago.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EixtvIGXgAEs5cY?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="Average food prices in Chicago (September 2020) Corn, red onion, potato and carrot."><br>
</p><p>Average food prices in Chicago (September 2020) </p>

<p>Interesting, right?</p>

<p>Another reason behind this result is that plastic wrap food usually comes in bulk. We end up buying more food than we need. Buying food per pound helps us think about how much we will eat. For a family of 2, we usually buy about 1-2 pounds of each produce. Here are the price differences.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EixtUosXsAU8LjX?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="Food prices per pound vs per package in Chicago. September 2020 Corn, red onion, potato and carrot."><br>
</p><p>Food prices per pound vs per package (September 2020, Chicago)</p>

<p>We save so much if we go for zero packaging food. After all, people are paying a premium for the plastic package without thinking. We also don't waste as much of food. It's win-win!</p>

<h4>2 - We eat healthier</h4>

<p>We can't order food delivery anymore. It used to be a big chunk of our monthly bill. Most of the time we cook at home. We make homemade french fries instead of buying chips. It tastes better! We bring our own containers to restaurants when we order takeout.</p>

<h4>3 - Opt out a lot of options for shopping</h4>

<p>I don't know if it's only us feeling this way, but a lot of products have too many options.<br>
Opting out of plastic leaves only a handful of brands. Saves a ton of time for shopping.</p>

<h4>4 - We create a lot less trash</h4>

<p>Less packaging. Less trash.</p>

<p>Here are the cons.</p>

<h4>1 - It was difficult to find meat and bread that don't use plastic or styrofoam.</h4>

<p>Only 1-2 stores of the 5 have paper packaging for meat. For bread, we have to look for a local bakery for zero plastic options.</p>

<h4>2 - Food delivery is no longer an option.</h4>

<p>I put it as a pro and con in this section. Pro is that we saved a lot of money.<br>
Con is that we can only do takeout and bring our own food containers, which is not convenient.</p>

<p>Overall it has more pros than cons. <br>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>In a <a href="https://rolisz.ro/2020/06/10/playing-codenames-with-rust/">previous post</a> I implemented the game of Codenames in Rust, allowing a human player to interact with the computer playing randomly. Now let's implement a smarter computer agent, using word vectors. </p><p>Word vectors (or word embeddings) are a way of converting words into a high dimensional vector of numbers. This means that each word will have a long list of numbers associated with it and those numbers aren't completely random. Words that are related usually have values closer to each other in the vector space as well. Getting those numbers from raw data takes a long time, but there are many pretrained embeddings on the internet you can just use and there are also libraries that help you find other words that are close to a target word. </p><h2 id="word-vectors-in-rust">Word vectors in Rust</h2><p>Machine learning has embraced the Python programming language, so most ML tools, libraries and frameworks are in Python, but some are starting to show up in Rust as well. Rust's performance focus attracts people, because ML is usually computationally intensive. </p><p>There is one library in Rust that does exactly what we want: <a href="https://github.com/finalfusion/finalfusion-rust">FinalFusion</a>. It has a set of pretrained word vectors (quite fancy ones, with subword embeddings) and it has a library to load them and to make efficient nearest neighbor queries. </p><p>The pretrained embeddings come in a 5 GB file, because they pretty much literally have everything, including the kitchen sink, so the download will take a while. Let's start using the library (after adding it to our <code>Cargo.toml</code> file) to get the nearest neighboring words for "cat":</p><pre><code>use std::io::BufReader;
use std::fs::File;
use finalfusion::prelude::*;
use finalfusion::similarity::WordSimilarity;

fn main() {
    let mut reader = BufReader::new(File::open("resources/ff.fifu").unwrap());

    // Read the embeddings.
    let embeddings: Embeddings&lt;VocabWrap, StorageViewWrap&gt; =
        Embeddings::read_embeddings(&amp;mut reader)
            .unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", embeddings.word_similarity("cat", 5).unwrap());
}</code></pre><p>After running it we get the following output:</p><pre><code>[WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.81729543), word: "cats" },
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.812261), word: "kitten" },
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7768222), word: "feline" },
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7760824), word: "kitty" },
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7667354), word: "dog" }]</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>
    
    <p>Loading a 5GB file from disk will take some time. If you have enough RAM, it should be in the OS's file cache after the first run, so it will load faster. Also, compiling this program with --release (turning on optimizations and removing debug information) will speed it up significantly. 
    </p>
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>One of the rules of Codenames is that hints can't be any of the words on the board or direct derivatives of them (such as plural forms). The <code>finalfusion</code> library has support for masking some words out, but to get plural forms I resorted to another library called <a href="https://crates.io/crates/Inflector"><code>inflector</code> </a>which has a method called <code><a href="https://docs.rs/Inflector/0.11.4/inflector/string/pluralize/index.html">to_plural</a></code>, which does exactly what's written on the box. </p><pre><code>use std::io::BufReader;
use std::fs::File;
use finalfusion::prelude::*;
use finalfusion::similarity::EmbeddingSimilarity;
use std::collections::HashSet;
use inflector::string::pluralize::to_plural;

fn main() {
    let mut reader = BufReader::new(File::open("resources/ff.fifu").unwrap());

    // Read the embeddings.
    let embeddings: Embeddings&lt;VocabWrap, StorageViewWrap&gt; =
        Embeddings::read_embeddings(&amp;mut reader)
            .unwrap();
    let word = "cat";
    let embed = embeddings.embedding(word).unwrap();
    let mut skip: HashSet&lt;&amp;str&gt; = HashSet::new();
    skip.insert(&amp;word);
    let pluralized = to_plural(word);
    skip.insert(&amp;pluralized);
    let words = embeddings.embedding_similarity_masked(embed.view(), 5, &amp;skip).unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", words);
}</code></pre><p>This is a slightly lower level interface, where we first have to obtain the embedding of the word, we build the set of words to skip and then we search for the most similar words to the vector that we give it. The output is:</p><pre><code>[WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.812261), word: "kitten" },
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7768222), word: "feline" },
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7760824), word: "kitty" }, 
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7667354), word: "dog" }, 
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7471396), word: "kittens" }]</code></pre><p>It's better. Ideally, we could also somehow remove all composite words based on words from the table, but that's a bit more complicated.</p><p>This can be wrapped in a function, because it's a common use case:</p><pre><code>fn find_similar_words&lt;'a&gt;(word: &amp;str, embeddings: &amp;'a Embedding, limit: usize) -&gt; Vec&lt;WordSimilarityResult&lt;'a&gt;&gt; {
    let embed = embeddings.embedding(&amp;word).unwrap();
    let mut skip: HashSet&lt;&amp;str&gt; = HashSet::new();
    skip.insert(&amp;word);
    let pluralized = to_plural(&amp;word);
    skip.insert(&amp;pluralized);
    embeddings.embedding_similarity_masked(embed.view(), limit, &amp;skip).unwrap()
}
</code></pre><h2 id="implementing-the-first-spymaster">Implementing the first spymaster</h2><p>Let's implement our first spymaster which uses word vectors! First, let's define a type alias for the embedding type, because it's long and we'll use it many times.</p><pre><code>type Embedding = Embeddings&lt;VocabWrap, StorageViewWrap&gt;;</code></pre><p>Our spymaster will have two fields: the embeddings and the color of the player. The <code>Spymaster</code> trait requires only the <code>give_hint</code> function to be implemented.</p><pre><code>pub struct BestWordVectorSpymaster&lt;'a&gt; {
    pub embeddings: &amp;'a Embedding,
    pub color: Color,
}

impl Spymaster for BestWordVectorSpymaster&lt;'_&gt; {
    fn give_hint(&amp;mut self, map: &amp;Map) -&gt; Hint {
        let enemy_color = opposite_player(self.color);
        let remaining_words = map.remaining_words_of_color(enemy_color);
        let mut best_sim = NotNan::new(-1f32).unwrap();
        let mut best_word = "";
        for word in remaining_words {
            let words = find_similar_words(&amp;word, self.embeddings, 1);
            let hint = words.get(0).unwrap();
            if hint.similarity &gt; best_sim {
                best_sim = hint.similarity;
                best_word = hint.word;
            }
        }
        return Hint{count: 1, word: best_word.to_string()};
    }
}</code></pre><p>This spymaster uses a simple greedy algorithm. It takes each word that has to be guessed and find's the most similar word to it, while keeping track of the similarity. It returns as hint the word that had the highest similarity to any of the words that belong to the opposite team. </p><p>How does it do? I drew some random boards with a fixed seed and ran this spymaster on them. If you hover over the hint, it shows what are the words it's based on. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>

       </div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Unfortunately, the CC embeddings give even worse results.</p><h2 id="cleaning-up-the-embeddings">Cleaning up the embeddings</h2><p>My fix for this was to write a script to prune down the embeddings to only "real" words (ones made of only letters). First, I had to get a set of all these words. </p><pre><code>    let words = embeddings.vocab().words();
    let mut total = 0;
    let mut lowercase = 0;
    let mut select = HashSet::new();

            select.insert(w.clone());
        }
    }
    println!("{} {}", total,  lowercase);</code></pre><p>Then I had to get the embeddings and the norms for each of these words:</p><pre><code>    let mut selected_vocab = Vec::new();
    let mut selected_storage = Array2::zeros((select.len(), embeddings.dims()));
    let mut selected_norms = Array1::zeros((select.len(),));

    for (idx, word) in select.into_iter().enumerate() {
        match embeddings.embedding_with_norm(&amp;word) {
            Some(embed_with_norm) =&gt; {

                    .assign(&amp;embed_with_norm.embedding);
                selected_norms[idx] = embed_with_norm.norm;
            }
            None =&gt; panic!("Cannot get embedding for: {}", word),
        }

        selected_vocab.push(word);
    }
</code></pre><p>And finally write the now much smaller embedding file:</p><pre><code>    let new_embs = Embeddings::new(
        None,
        SimpleVocab::new(selected_vocab),
        NdArray::from(selected_storage),

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		    <div id="attachment_2355"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2355" src="http://micawberprinciple.com/wp-content/uploads/Lockheed_P-38_Lightning_USAF-e1509685065667.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="400"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2355">Lockheed P-38 Lightning. My Father Built these Planes During WWII, and He Always Loved Them.</p></div>
<p><span>The year is 1943 and America is deep in the desperate struggle to save the world from tyranny. The United States had entered World War II a little more than a year earlier following the December 7, 1941 attack by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor.</span></p>
<p><span>As the United States ramped up the war effort the government decided that to win this fight, in addition to brave soldiers and superior equipment, they would also need help from the brightest minds in the world. This lead to the founding of the Statistical Research Group (SRG). The SRG was located in Manhattan, just a block away from Columbia University, and before long many of the best mathematicians in the world were working there.</span></p>
<p><span>How smart were the people working at the SRG? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milton Friedman</a>, a future winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, worked at the SRG and it was later joked that while he was there he was often only the fourth smartest person in the room.</span></p>
<p><span>And who was the smartest? That was widely recognized to be the brilliant mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Wald" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abraham Wald</a>, a Jew who had fled Europe prior to the start of the war.</span></p>
<p><span>The Air Force came to Wald with a problem. Too many of their planes were being shot down so they wanted to add extra armor to the vulnerable parts of the planes. Too much armor would make the planes too heavy to fly properly, so they couldn’t add extra armor over the entire plane. They asked Wald to tell them how much extra armor to add to the parts of the planes that were being hit most often.</span></p>
<p><span>To help Wald they had collected statistics on the bullet holes in planes returning from combat. They presented him the following statistics:</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;<span><strong><span>Section of Plane</span></strong></span></td>
<td><span><strong><span>Bullet Holes Per Sq. Ft.&nbsp;</span></strong></span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Engine</span></td>
<td><span>1.11</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Fuselage</span></td>
<td><span>1.73</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Fuel System</span></td>
<td><span>1.55</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Rest of Plan</span></td>
<td><span>1.80</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><span>Given these statistics, what would you tell the Air Force?</span></p>
<p><span>The answer Wald came up with&nbsp;surprised&nbsp;them. He instructed the Air Force to put the extra armor not where the bullet holes were, but were they weren’t – on the engines! And how did Wald come up with this answer. Simple. He considered the missing bullet holes. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Air Force had presented him with statistics on planes that had returned safely from combat. Wald recognized this as biased sample that told a distorted and incomplete story. There were also a lot of planes at the bottom of the ocean, and Wald correctly guessed that these planes were full of bullet holes in the engines.</span></p>
<p><span>The Air Force followed his advice and the results were stunning. Immediately more planes started returning safely from combat saving the lives of countless pilots and crew members.</span></p>
<p><span>Wald correctly identified this as not so much a math problem but as a problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survivorship bias</a>, and once you understand this concept you start seeing it everywhere. Survivorship bias tells a lot of distorted and incomplete stories and looking for the missing bullet holes, as Wald had done, can save you from making bad decisions based on inaccurate and incomplete information. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Fortune Cookie Lottery Winners</strong></h2>
<p><span>On March 30, 2005 the Powerball lottery drawing produced 110 2<sup>nd</sup> prize winners who had picked 5 of the 6 numbers correctly. This entitled each of them to winnings of over $100,000. Lottery officials found this strange since, based on the number of tickets sold, there should have only been about 5 2<sup>nd</sup> prize winners.</span></p>
<p><span>Searching for an explanation the officials asked winners how they had picked their numbers. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/12/world/americas/as-the-cookie-crumbles-winners-galore-in-lottery.html?mcubz=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An article</a> in The New York Times described what happened next:</span></p>
<p><span><em>“Our first winner came in and said it was a fortune cookie,” said Rebecca Paul, chief executive of the Tennessee Lottery. “The second winner came in and said it was a fortune cookie. The third winner came in and said it was a fortune cookie.” </em></span></p>
<p><span>The fortune cookie with the lucky numbers was eventually traced to a factory in Long Island City, owned by Wonton Food, which produces four million fortune cookies a day.</span></p>
<p><span><em>“That’s ours,” said Derrick Wong, of Wonton Food, when shown a picture of a winner’s cookie slip. “That’s very nice, 110 people won the lottery from the numbers.”</em></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://awealthofcommonsense.com/2017/10/taking-financial-advice-from-a-lottery-winner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reporting</a> on the incident <a href="http://awealthofcommonsense.com/about-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ben Carlson</a> wrote cynically, but more truthfully than we care to admit, “If any of these 110 people worked in the investment business they probably would have started their own newsletter – </span><em><span>My Secret Formula for Winning the Lottery.”</span> </em></p>
<p><span>And they could have made the newsletter sound very convincing. After all, the author could have pointed to109 other people who also followed this formula and won big. But you wouldn’t fall for it, because you would look for the missing bullet holes, and you understand that there are thousands of planes piloted by fortune-cookie-lottery-number-picking pilots laying at the bottom of the ocean.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Other Examples of Survivorship Bias</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span>Many investing companies start new mutual funds in what are known as “fund incubators.” These funds, employing various strategies, are kept small and are not available for public investing. After several years in the incubator the most successful ones are rolled out to the public touting their stellar investment records. The underperformers are discontinued in an attempt to keep the missing bullet holes hidden forever.</span></li>
<li><span>In the classic book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Thomas-Stanley-Ph-D-ebook/dp/B00CLT31D6/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1509685860&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+millionaire+next+door" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Millionaire Next Door </em></a>authors <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Stanley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas J. Stanley</a> and William D. Danko state that business owners make up the largest group of millionaires next door. But this is not the same as saying that most business owners are millionaires. Most businesses fail and the ocean floor is littered with planes piloted by brave but ultimately unsuccessful entrepreneurs. So before jumping in and starting your own business, consider the missing bullet holes.</span></li>
<li><span>My wife and daughter love the real estate shows on HGTV. These shows make flipping houses look effortless and exciting. And there is no shortage of books and infomercials telling you how easy it is to make money buying real estate with little or no money down. While it is certainly possible to make money in real estate, it is not easy. Don’t forget to look for the missing bullet holes. They are not difficult to find. Lots of would-be real estate tycoons, including personal finance radio guru Dave Ramsey, have crashed in spectacular fiery fashion. Before you start flipping houses, consider the missing bullet holes.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>My purpose in discussing survivorship bias is not to talk you out of taking risks. Indeed, I believe that anything worth doing involves risk. I just don’t think you should take risks based on the distorted and incomplete picture that survivorship bias presents.</span></p>
<p><span>Speaking of this Ben Carlson said, “Every inspirational speech by someone successful should have to start with a disclaimer about survivorship bias.”</span></p>
<p><span>Instead, clear up the picture first by searching out the missing bullet holes and seeing what you can learn from them. They often tell the most interesting and useful part of the story. This won’t guarantee you success but it will increase your chances for a safe return by allowing you to put some extra armor on the vulnerable areas of your plane. After doing that, buckle your seat belt and prepare for takeoff!</span></p>
<p>Note: I read the story of the missing bullet holes in the excellent book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Be-Wrong-Mathematical-ebook/dp/B00G3L6JQ4/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1509686186&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=how+not+to+be+wrong" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking</a>, </em>by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Ellenberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jordan Ellenberg</a>.</p>

You can work in a restaurant eighty hours a week, and you’re not going to get rich. Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it. It is much more about understanding than purely hard work. Yes, hard work matters, and you can’t skimp on it. But it has to be directed in the right way. </p><p>If you don’t know yet what you should work on, the most important thing is to figure it out. You should not grind at a lot of hard work until you figure out what you should be working on. </p><p>I came up with the principles in my tweetstorm (below) for myself when I was really young, around thirteen or fourteen. I’ve been carrying them in my head for thirty years, and I’ve been living them. Over time (sadly or fortunately), the thing I got really good at was looking at businesses and figuring out the point of maximum leverage to actually create wealth and capture some of that created wealth. </p><p>This is exactly what I did my famous tweetstorm about. Of course, every one of these tweets can be extrapolated into an hour’s worth of conversation. The tweetstorm below is a good starting point. The tweetstorm tries to be information-dense, very concise, high-impact, and timeless. It has all the information and principles, so if you absorb these and you work hard over ten years, you’ll get what you want.&nbsp;[77]</p><blockquote><h2>How to Get Rich (Without Getting Lucky):</h2><h2> ↓ </h2><h2>Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Understand ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale. </h2><h2>↓</h2><h2>Pick an industry where you can play long-term games with long-term people. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven’t figured this out yet. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable. </h2><h2>↓</h2><h2>Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated. </h2><h2>↓</h2><h2>Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>“Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.” </h2><h2>—Archimedes </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media). </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge with accountability and show resulting good judgment. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Labor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it. </h2><h2>↓</h2><h2>Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>An army of robots is freely available—it’s just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Judgment requires experience but can be built faster by learning foundational skills. </h2><h2>↓</h2><h2>There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers. <br>↓ </h2><h2>Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>You should be too busy to “do coffee” while still keeping an uncluttered calendar. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work. </h2><h2>↓</h2><h2>Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>There are no get-rich-quick schemes. Those are just someone else getting rich off you. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve. </h2><h2>↓ </h2><h2>When you’re finally wealthy, you’ll realize it wasn’t what you were seeking in the first place. But that is for another day.&nbsp;[11] </h2></blockquote><blockquote><h2>Summary: Productize Yourself </h2></blockquote><p><strong>Your summary says “Productize yourself”—what does that mean?</strong> </p><p>“Productize” and “yourself.” “Yourself ” has uniqueness. “Productize” has leverage. “Yourself” has accountability. “Productize” has specific knowledge. “Yourself ” also has specific knowledge in there. So all of these pieces, you can combine them into these two words.</p><p>If you’re looking toward the long-term goal of getting wealthy, you should ask yourself, “Is this authentic to me? Is it myself that I am projecting?” And then, “Am I productizing it? Am I scaling it? Am I scaling with labor or with capital or with code or with media?” So it’s a very handy, simple mnemonic.&nbsp;[78] </p><p>This is hard. This is why I say it takes decades—I’m not saying it takes decades to execute, but the better part of a decade may be figuring out what you can uniquely provide.&nbsp;[10] </p><p><strong>What’s the difference between wealth and money? </strong></p><p>Money is how we transfer wealth. Money is social credits. It is the ability to have credits and debits of other people’s time. </p><p>If I do my job right, if I create value for society, society says, “Oh, thank you. We owe you something in the future for the work you did in the past. Here’s a little IOU. Let’s call that money.”&nbsp;[78] </p><p>Wealth is the thing you want. Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep. Wealth is the factory, the robots, cranking out things. Wealth is the computer program that’s running at night, serving other customers. Wealth is even money in the bank that is being reinvested into other assets, and into other businesses. </p><p>Even a house can be a form of wealth, because you can rent it out, although that’s probably a lower productivity use of land than some commercial enterprise. </p><p>So, my definition of wealth is much more businesses and assets that can earn while you sleep.&nbsp;[78]</p><blockquote><h2>Technology democratizes consumption but consolidates production. The best person in the world at anything gets to do it for everyone. </h2></blockquote><p>Society will pay you for creating things it wants. But society doesn’t yet know how to create those things, because if it did, they wouldn’t need you. They would already be stamped out.</p><p>Almost everything in your house, in your workplace, and on the street used to be technology at one point in time. There was a time when oil was a technology that made J.D. Rockefeller rich. There was a time when cars were technology that made Henry Ford rich. </p><p>So, technology is the set of things, as Alan Kay said, that don’t quite work yet&nbsp;[correction: Danny Hillis]. Once something works, it’s no longer technology. Society always wants new things. And if you want to be wealthy, you want to figure out which one of those things you can provide for society that it does not yet know how to get but it will want and providing it is natural to you, within your skill set, and within your capabilities. </p><p>Then, you have to figure out how to scale it because if you only build one, that’s not enough. You’ve got to build thousands, or hundreds of thousands, or millions, or billions of them so everybody can have one. Steve Jobs (and his team, of course) figured out society would want smartphones. A computer in their pocket that had all the phone capability times one hundred and was easy to use. So, they figured out how to build it, and then they figured out how to scale it.&nbsp;[78]</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>To increase the reliability of deploys and safely deploy broad-reaching changes, we need to change something about our engineering culture around creating changes.</p>

<p>Often, when someone works on changes that span multiple services, they think of it as a separate Pull Request for every <em>project</em>. Then, when it comes to deploy day, there’s a concern: We want to make a change to X but Y also needs that change to work - how do we deploy these at the same time?</p>
<p><strong>We don’t.</strong></p>
<p>No matter how much of our time or you brilliant engineers we dedicate to this topic, there’s no way to guarantee that changes to two projects takes effect at the <em>exact same time</em>. There will always be, at minimum, valuable seconds (and hundreds of requests) between one service starting up with the new version and another.</p>

<p>To fix this, we need to modify how we think about our changes from not just per-feature but to per-phase per-feature. What I mean is, there are actually two phases to every feature’s deployment:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Migration</strong>: We add or modify behaviour while retaining backwards-compatibility with what currently exists.</li>
<li><strong>The Cleanup</strong>: We remove the old behaviour and only keep the backwards-<em>in</em>compatible change.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="example-one-databases">Example One: Databases</h2>
<p>Around databases is somewhere this concept is used extensively. When you make a change to an existing database schema, you need to temporarily have your app support both versions of the schema until the change is complete.</p>
<p><strong>The Scenario:</strong></p>
<p>Our customers database needs to change two columns first_name and surname into one column full_name as some places don’t have the concept of first/last names.</p>
<p><strong>The Method:</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, we need to understand that two services need a change: our database and our application. We need to change the schema of our database tables and change our application to write those new values to the right column.</p>
<p>For our database:</p>
<ul>
<li>We create a PR: <strong>[DB1]</strong> that <em>adds</em> a new <code>full_name</code> optional column and <em>changes</em> the <code>first_name</code> and <code>surname</code> columns to be optional (by accepting a <code>null</code> or empty value).</li>
<li>We create a PR: <strong>[DB2]</strong> that <em>removes</em> <code>first_name</code> and <code>surname</code>, and <em>changes</em> the <code>full_name</code> column to be mandatory (by requiring a non-empty value).</li>
</ul>
<p>For our application:</p>
<ul>
<li>We create a PR: <strong>[APP1]</strong> that <em>removes</em> the <code>first_name</code> and <code>surname</code> columns from the data it writes, and <em>adds</em> the <code>full_name</code> column to the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, we deploy them in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>[DB1]</strong> - all columns exist and our app is writing to the first and surname columns.</li>
<li><strong>[APP1]</strong> - our application stops writing to the first and surname columns, now it will start writing to the full name column instead.</li>
<li><strong>[DB2]</strong> - the app is writing to the new column so we can remove the old columns now.</li>
</ol>
<p>By splitting our database changes into a migration and cleanup step, we were able to deploy our changes without having to worry about if the app was writing to the old or new columns.</p>
<p>Another benefit of this is that we can have <em>any</em> amount of time between merging the PRs as long as they’re in the above order.</p>
<h2 id="example-two-dependent-applications">Example Two: Dependent Applications</h2>
<p><strong>The Scenario:</strong></p>
<p>We have two applications Auth and App. We’re going to be changing from usernames to email addresses for our authentication and need to change the API.</p>
<p><strong>The Method:</strong></p>
<p>Although we could do something really hacky and support email addresses in the <code>username</code> field, it’s probably not the right thing to do and would confuse people later for sure.</p>
<p>For Auth:</p>
<ul>
<li>We create a PR: <strong>[Auth1]</strong> that <em>changes</em> the API validation for the <code>username</code> field to be optional, and <em>adds</em> the new <code>email</code> field as well as an if-branch that checks against an email if it’s specified, else it checks against the username as normal.</li>
<li>We create a PR: <strong>[Auth2]</strong> that <em>removes</em> <code>username</code> from the API validation, and makes the <code>email</code> field mandatory, as well as removing the if-branch - only leaving the branch that authenticates with emails.</li>
</ul>
<p>For App:</p>
<ul>
<li>We create a PR: <strong>[App1]</strong> that <em>changes</em> the request from using <code>username</code> to using <code>email</code> instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, we deploy them in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>[Auth1]</strong> - the application is still using <code>username</code> for auth.</li>
<li><strong>[App1]</strong> - the application switches to using <code>email</code> instead.</li>
<li><strong>[Auth2]</strong> - we are no longer using the <code>username</code> field so we can remove it now.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another method we could use to solve this is to create a new API endpoint in [Auth1] (leaving the current endpoint) and then remove the old endpoint in [Auth2]. The PR [App1] would then be to use the <code>email</code> field and change the request’s API endpoint. The order would remain the same though.</p>
<p>Something you may have noticed about this example is that I didn’t include the changes you would probably also have to make to your database. If you’d like, as a thought exercise: just on a high level, try to think about what PRs we’d make to change the <code>username</code> column to an <code>email</code> column and figure out where you would insert those PRs into the above deployment steps.</p>

<p>An API-breaking change is anything that alters the contract between two services. It is anything that would require the consumer of your API to make a change in order to keep working properly. Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A REST API endpoint’s path/URL changes</li>
<li>An API introduces new, <em>required</em> fields or changes the current set of required fields</li>
<li>An API <em>removes</em> a field</li>
<li>An API changes the data it returns</li>
<li>An API changes the structure or status code of a response</li>
</ul>
<p>What is <strong>not</strong> an API-breaking change?</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing new, <em>optional</em> fields</li>
<li>Changing currently-required fields to be optional</li>
<li>Changing what an API does as long as it doesn’t affect a dependent service/application</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust is a strange language.</p><p>It has modern and promising design idea, and good performance compared to C++. It's proved to be an alternative system language that can use for writing OS, although there's no product level rust OS yet, there're several implementations as the potential players. It's the highest expected, trying the whole bag of tricks to grow, gaining popularity in the young crowds...all these are very good to a novel and health community.</p><p>On the other hand, this language seems no idea where to go. No, I'm not talking about its dreaming goal, of course I know its goal is explicitly expressed: safety, speed, and concurrency. What I'm confusing is the way it choose towards its goal. Rust community choose an iterative model rather than waterfall model to develop Rust language. That is to say, the code and interfaces keeps changing while the design is still not confirmed. Although it's the popular development model in today's internet industry on business software, I doubt if it's the best way for a foundational foresight programming language. However, it's too early to say whether the development model is bad in nowadays' industry. We can see many companies are trying to use Rust even its design is still unstable. In the past, such kind of activity is insane to take risks in a serious product. But today's industry is in a rapid iterating, maybe our understand is too old for it, and maybe Rust's model is the brand new way to improve the industry. People can adapt the fast changing things even it's their fundamental langugage, and there could be stronger auto tools to rely on. Who knows, let's give it a try, warriors, the boss pays for it.</p><p>This article is about the Rust frontend on GCC. It's reasonable for me (or any potential contributors) to blame Rust's development model, since it's interfering the efforts of its own GCC frontend.</p><p>So far, the only reliable implementation is the officially supported LLVM front-end. I don't know if there're more, but I will not choose if it's not based on a mainstream compiler infrastructure. After all, it's system level language, once you choose, it's not expected to be changed in a decade. To my experiences to lead the software development in past decade, it's not so simple to change fundamental things, from libs to compilers to languages. It's not impossible, but why waste time to do it when you have lots of other workloads to deal with?</p><p>Stop, it's not a criticism article against Rust. So I'm not going to blame it more.</p><p>OK, that's enough, now that we're trying to work for the Rust front-end on GCC, it's reasonable to say we're interested in this language. And we hope to promote it better. As a perennial GNU hacker, it's natual for me to think about Rust on GCC. I have several experiences on writing language front-ends, the architecture is similar, and the theory is similar too. However, gcc-rust is a very hard project that couldn't be done successfully by one-man effort. In this article, I'll introduce the ideas and efforts around FOSS community. I hope all these information can help people to understand the situation, and help potential contributors to take part in.</p><p>Of course, Rust on LLVM has gone so far away, but what would I

Hydra Cave</h2><p>Rust on GCC is a Hydra. Why? Because there're at least 3 possible ways to go. Oh well, three heads of a dragon.</p><p>These 3 ways are originally mentioned by @redbrain who is one of the enthusiasts of Rust on GCC (<a href="https://github.com/redbrain/gccrs/issues/2#issuecomment-563255365" target="_blank">https://github.com/redbrain/gccrs/issues/2#issuecomment-563255365</a>). Unfortunately, he has dropped his efforts, but his work of Rust on GCC is still inspiring.</p><p>The first way is the most lightweight way. The original Rust compiler provides a IR (Intermediate Representation) named MIR, so the idea is really simple, we can take advantage of the front-end of Rust on LLVM then convert MIR to GENERIC which is the general IR in GCC. The pros is that we don't have to deal with the occasionally changing of Rust's grammar. This idea is achievable, since the original Rust compiler is in the similar architecture to convert MIR to LLVM-IR. The only problem is that this Rust on GCC frontend has to require the original rustc, and this may bring the LLVM dependencies chain. Then people may wonder why we still bother to implement Rust on GCC, it doesn't reduce the dependencies in the development environment nor likely to be widely accepted by GCC folks. No mention the license issue.</p><p>The second way is to use GCC JIT interface on top of the original Rust compiler. This architecture implies to add a new backend (libgccgit <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/cp/index.html" target="_blank">https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/cp/index.html</a>) to the original Rust compiler. So it's not the Rust on GCC as most people expected, it's a new feature request to Rust developer to support yet another compiler backend and maintain the code by Rust community. This is the perfect approach only if Rust developers accept it. However, the hard part would be license issue, and it all depends on the willing of Rust community.</p><p>The third way is the traditional way, full C++ implementation of Rust on GCC. There's an existing good example, gccgo, which is the Go language front-end on GCC. It's the hardest way to build a Rust compiler from scratch. The pros is that the developers can expect to do everything they like to build an efficient Rust compiler to challenge the orginal one, and it doesn't require LLVM as the prerequisite. Finally, no any license issue, we can make it GPLv3+. However, there must be a strong group to maintain this front-end. Gccgo has a strong team hired by Google. No mention you have to keep updating the volatile Rust grammar periodically.</p><p>All these approaches are independent from each other, so it's impossible to combine all these 3 forces. The MIR way is working by @sapir <a href="https://github.com/sapir/gcc-rust/tree/rust" target="_blank">https://github.com/sapir/gcc-rust/tree/rust</a>, and it's still in progress; The libgccjit way requires the connection to Rust community that is out of my reach, and I don't know who is working on it; as a GNU hacker, I think my prefered way is the third one. The third way was dropped by @redbrain, but there's some inspiring code left.</p><h2>What we've got so far?</h2><p>My plan is not to secretly working on it then throw a release suddenly to shock people. I have too many projects in my TODO, I do want to have gcc-rust, and I do want to have more friends on it. Let me emphersize it again, it's impossible to do it by one-man effort.</p><p>Fortunately, @SimplyTheOther have done fully-operational and working lexer, parser of a recent Rust syntax. It's great work. I have enough experiences to write parsers for practical languages, it's time consuming work. That's why I appreciate @SimplyTheOther's work so much. Of course, I agree with @SimplyTheOther that the most time consuming work would be the type checking part, at least for Rust, I'm afraid that it could be true.</p><p>After I helped to fix tiny bugs to make it work smoothly, I started to write an enhanced AST dumper. It's reasonable for us, first, I need to get familiar with @SimplyTheOther's AST design; second, we need to output a human-readable AST for debugging.</p><p>Let me show you a silly example:</p><pre spellcheck="false"><span><span>fn</span> <span>abc</span></span>(x:<span>u32</span>, y:<span>u32</span>) -&gt; <span>u32</span> {
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>return</span> x+y;
}

<span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>1</span>+<span>1</span>;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc(<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>);
}
</pre><p>Alright, it's silly meaningless code, let's see how the AST dump looks like.</p><p>Assuming you stored the source code to test.rs, then run AST dump:</p><pre spellcheck="false">rust1 -frust-<span>dump</span>-parse test.rs
</pre><p>The output could be:</p><pre spellcheck="false">Crate:
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;items:

<span>u32</span> abc(x : <span>u32</span>, y : <span>u32</span>)
BlockExpr:
{
&nbsp;outer attributes: none
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;statements:
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; <span>return</span> ArithmeticOrLogicalExpr: x + y
&nbsp;final expression: none
}

void main()
BlockExpr:
{
&nbsp;outer attributes: none
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;statements:
&nbsp; ExprStmtWithBlock:
&nbsp;&nbsp; BlockExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outer attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inner attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statements:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ArithmeticOrLogicalExpr: <span>1</span> + <span>1</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; final expression: none
&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>)
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; outer attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp; StructExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PathInExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc(<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inner attributes:none
&nbsp;final expression: none
}
</pre><p>It's good for us to debug or extend the parser. After all, if we can't make sure the parser is correct, how can we move forward to type checking and IR transformation?</p><p>The project repo is here, patches are welcome: <a href="https://github.com/philberty/gccrs" target="_blank">https://github.com/philberty/gccrs</a></p><h2>What's next?</h2><p>Before answer this question, I guess you may wonder why I used `rust1` rather than a traditional name `gccrust` or something else.</p><p>`rust1` is the Rust compiler, while `gccrust` is a collection that calling compiler, assembler, and linker like a chain. We haven't done the IR transformation yet, so there won't be anything can be assembled and linked except for the AST. Oh my poor Rust compiler!</p><p>It's not so hard to transform AST to GENERIC which is the current toplevel IR of gcc. However, it's meaningless to rush if we haven't made sure the parser work correctly for the Rust grammar. No mention the critical feature of Rust, the linear type system.</p><p>If you understand what I've said so far, then I can answer the question "what could be the next".</p><p>1. The type system, too big to talk about it here.</p><p>2. The static analysis.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the advantages of llvm-rust was that it used the static analysis of LLVM. Fortunately, David Malcolm finished his GCC static analysis framework recently <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/806099/" target="_blank">https://lwn.net/Articles/806099/</a>. I'm not sure if there could be any hook for front-end to interact with, or maybe we can't touch it once we pass the authority to the next level IR. Anyway, it's an exciting feature of GCC to research.</p><p>3. The new middle-IR for Rust specific pre-optimizing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea is largely inspired by gccgo because they've inserted a specifically designed IR for Go language before transforming it to GENERIC. This IR was named GOGO. Gccgo will do some pre-optimizing with GOGO. From the compiler design perspective, it's reasonable to do so, since some information may lose after …</p></div></div>

      <p>Every developer needs access to some servers for example to check the application logs.</p>
<p>Usually, this is done using public-private key encryption where each developer generates their own public-private key pair.
The public keys of each developer are added to the <code>authorized_keys</code> file on each server they should have access to.</p>
<h2 id="painful-manual-changes">Painful manual changes</h2>
<p>So far so good. However, what happens when one developer leaves the company?</p>
<p>In that case, the public keys of that developer should be removed from all servers. This could be quite a bit of work depending on how many servers they had access to.
And even worse, if it’s done manually, there is quite some risk that the key is still forgotten on some server, so the access remains open.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-solutions">Alternative solutions</h2>
<p>There are some commercial and open source solutions out there which want to help out with this problem. The basic idea is that you add and maintain the keys and the access lists on that service and when you remove a key, they will remove it from all your servers.</p>
<p>Sounds good, but it has one very big disadvantage: it’s a potential single source of failure. If someone captures access to that service, they can gain access to all your servers. And if you lose access to that service, you also lose access to all your servers in the worst case.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution-signing-keys">The solution: signing keys</h2>
<p>When I was facing this problem, I asked on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24157180">HackerNews</a> how others are tackling this problem.</p>
<p>There were some great suggestions and insights from the community and the best solution to the problem seems to be the signing of keys which I will present to you here in detail.</p>
<h3 id="the-rough-idea">The rough idea</h3>
<p>The rough idea is this: You still generate a public-private key pair for each developer. However, you don’t upload the public keys to your servers.</p>
<p>Instead, you sign the public keys with a so-called certificate authority (CA) key which you generate before. This signing simply generates a third certificate file which you give back to the developer and they put it inside of their <code>.ssh/</code> folder next to the private and public key.</p>
<p>On the servers, you simply tell the server the public key of your CA and the server can detect if a user has a properly signed certificate and only allows access to the developers who have such a signed certificate.</p>
<h3 id="the-advantages">The advantages</h3>
<p>When you sign a certificate, you can determine how long that signing is valid. So if you sign it with a validity of 3 months and the developer leaves the company, then after 3 months they won’t have access to any of the servers for sure.</p>
<p>Now you say: well, but I don’t want to sign keys of everyone every 3 months which is a fair point.</p>
<p>One possibility is to automate the process for example by building a service where a user can automatically get a signed certificate when they authorize with their company e-mail and password, but that is beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>The simple alternative is that you issue certificates that are valid longer and then if someone leaves the company, you can revoke the certificate, i.e. invalidate it. You can put a list of invalid certificates on your servers and they will not accept the user any more.
This could for example be done by having this list on AWS S3 or some other storage and a cronjob on each server that regularly pulls this.</p>
<h3 id="show-me-how-to-do-this">Show me how to do this</h3>
<p>Glad that you asked!</p>
<p>It’s actually super simple once you know the drill.</p>
<p>First, you generate a certificate authority public-private key pair of which you should keep the private key very secure:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">umask <span>77</span>                        <span># you want it to be private</span>
mkdir ~/my-ca <span>&amp;&amp;</span> cd ~/my-ca
ssh-keygen -C CA -f ca -b <span>4096</span>  <span># be sure to use a passphrase and store it securely</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then on your server you specify that all users signed by your CA are allowed to access the server:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upload the public key of your CA on your server, e.g. at <code>/etc/ssh/ca.pub</code></li>
<li>Tell the server to allow access to users signed by it by adding a line to <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ca.pub <span># Trust all with a certificate signed by ca.pub</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To make the changes effective, you should reload the ssh service: <code>sudo service ssh reload</code>.</p>
<p>Now if a developer generated their public-private key pair (e.g. <code>ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521</code>), they simply send you their public key (note that you never need to send any private keys around!).
Then you sign their public key to generate their certificate:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Inside your ~/my-ca folder, sign their public key (here: id_ecdsa.pub)</span>
ssh-keygen -s ca -I USER_ID -V +12w -z <span>1</span> id_ecdsa.pub
</code></pre></div><p>Quick explanation for the different parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-s ca</code> - you want to use your CA to sign</li>
<li><code>-I USER_ID</code> - the id of your user / the username</li>
<li><code>-V +12w</code> - how long before the certificate expires - here valid for 12 weeks</li>
<li><code>-z 1</code> - the serial number of this certificate - can be used to make this particular certificate invalid later, should be unique</li>
<li><code>id_ecdsa.pub</code>: the public key of the developer which you want to sign</li>
</ul>
<p>It will generate the certificate <code>id_ecdsa-cert.pub</code> which you can send to the developer and they put it into their <code>~/.ssh</code> folder next to their public-private key pair.</p>
<h3 id="it-gets-even-better">It gets even better</h3>
<p>Sounds cool, right? But you can do even better!</p>
<p>You probably have developers with different experience and different teams and roles and not everyone accessing the same servers.</p>
<p>So let’s add roles into the signing process!</p>
<p>That way, on the server you specify which roles are allowed to access the server and during the signing process you specify the roles of the developer you are signing.</p>
<p>Then, that developer can access all servers matching to their roles.</p>
<p>When you on board a new developer, you only need to generate that one certificate and boom they have access to all relevant servers without adding anything on those servers.</p>
<p>Here is how this looks like schematically:</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://www.paepper.com/blog/posts/how-to-properly-manage-ssh-keys-for-server-access/ssh-keys-with-roles.png" alt="ssh certificate signing with roles">
    
      <figcaption>ssh certificate signing with roles</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<p>This is how you configure roles on a server:</p>
<p>First, create the folder to configure access: <code>sudo mkdir /etc/ssh/auth_principals</code>
Inside that folder, you can create files with the name of the server user that someone could login as. For example to grant root access to some roles, add the file <code>/etc/ssh/auth_principals/root</code>.</p>
<p>Inside <code>/etc/ssh/auth_principals/root</code> you simply list all roles which should be able to login as root with one role per line:</p>
<p>Finally, configure on the server to use roles by again adding a line to <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">AuthorizedPrincipalsFile /etc/ssh/auth_principals/%u
</code></pre></div><p>To make the changes effective, you should reload the ssh service: <code>sudo service ssh reload</code>.</p>
<p>This is how you sign a key with roles (they are added to the certificate):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ssh-keygen -s ca -I USER_ID -n ROLE1,ROLE2 -V +12w -z <span>2</span> id_ecdsa.pub
</code></pre></div><p>It’s the same as before, but with the <code>-n ROLE1,ROLE2</code> flag. Important: there can’t be spaces between the comma for different roles!</p>
<p>Now, that developer could log onto any server where <code>ROLE1</code> or <code>ROLE2</code> are in an auth_principals file for a user name they try to login as.</p>
<h3 id="revoking-keys">Revoking keys</h3>
<p>Finally, if you want to invalidate a certificate, you can do that by the user name or the serial number of the certicate (<code>-z</code> flag). It’s recommended to make a list of generated certificates in an Excel spreadsheet or have a database depending on the number of your peeps.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ssh-keygen -k -f revoked-keys -u -s ca list-to-revoke
</code></pre></div><p>This is when you already have a <code>revoked-keys</code> list and want to update it (<code>-u</code> flag). For the initial generation, use it without the update flag.</p>
<p>The <code>list-to-revoke</code> needs to consist of usernames (ids) or serial numbers (<code>-z</code> flag during generation) like this:</p>
<pre><code>serial: 1
id: test.user
</code></pre><p>This would revoke access to the certificate with serial 1 and all certificates with id <code>test.user</code>.</p>
<p>To make the server respect revoked keys, you need to add the generated / updated <code>revoked keys</code> file to <code>/etc/ssh/revoked-keys</code> and configure it again in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:</p>
<p>Warning: make sure that the <code>revoked-keys</code> file is accessable and readable, otherwise you might lose access to your server</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">RevokedKeys /etc/ssh/revoked-keys
</code></pre></div><h2 id="summary-good-ssh-key-management">Summary: good ssh key management</h2>
<p>In my opinion, this solution is as good as it gets. You have the option to manage the access to your servers via ssh based on roles. You only need to configure your servers once (which roles are allowed to access it). For each new developer, you only need to generate a signed certificate and they immediately have access to all relevant machines matching their role / experience.
And when they leave the company, you can revoke their access also in a simple way.</p>
<p>And even if a mishap occurs and a developer leaves without having their access revoked, their certificate will expire after some time, so they also lose access automatically.</p>
<p>For small teams, you can do these steps manually as they are very fast to do; then as you grow, you can automate the certificate signing with a login service based on company authentication details.</p>
<p>Happy ssh-ing!</p>

<p>AWS Lightsail doesn’t usually show up in a list of AWS’ most popular services. However, Lightsail can be a great service to use especially if you are looking for a service that is easy to set up and has low maintenance. In this article, we will take a deeper look into Lightsail, when to use it and compare it to some of its competitors.</p>
<p>AWS Lightsail is a collection of building blocks that make it easy to get a web application up and running pretty quickly. These building blocks are:</p>

<h2 id="lightsail-instances">Lightsail Instances</h2>
<p>These instances are analogous to Virtual Private Servers (VPS) which are backed by EC2 instances (most likely the t2/t3 family) under the hood. AWS provides a lot of flexibility when it comes to choosing what kind of instance you want to run.</p>
<p>AWS Lightsail can be created in the following AWS Regions (as of September, 2020):</p>
<ul>
<li>US East (Ohio) (us-east-2)</li>
<li>US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)</li>
<li>US West (Oregon) (us-west-2)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Mumbai) (ap-south-1)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Seoul) (ap-northeast-2)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Singapore) (ap-southeast-1)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Sydney) (ap-southeast-2)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Tokyo) (ap-northeast-1)</li>
<li>Canada (Central) (ca-central-1)</li>
<li>EU (Frankfurt) (eu-central-1)</li>
<li>EU (Ireland) (eu-west-1)</li>
<li>EU (London) (eu-west-2)</li>
<li>EU (Paris) (eu-west-3)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lightsail also provides several options for the base image that you use for instance. You can choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS Only</strong>: You can choose from various Linux/Unix-based or a Windows-based OS</li>
<li><strong>Apps + OS</strong>: If you are planning to run a CMS like Wordpress or application on top of Django or Node, you can choose an image that installs these applications by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>More details about Lightsail instance images can be found <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/compare-options-choose-lightsail-instance-image">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/instance-1.png" alt="instance-1" title="AWS Lightsail Instances"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/instance-2.png" alt="instance-2" title="AWS Lightsail Instances"></p>
<p>One of the best features of Lightsail is its clear and transparent pricing. You can create an instance that best fits your needs and you can be confident of how much it will cost you at the end of the month. AWS is notorious for complex billing and this can put off a lot of new customers.</p>
<p>Lightsail instances come with generous data transfer limits which is definitely a big improvement.</p>
<p>AWS recently added <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-alarms">support for alarms in Lightsail</a>. This is a big improvement since previously there was no way to set up an alert for Lightsail system metrics such as CPU utilization.</p>
<p>You also have the flexibility of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/features/upgrade-to-ec2/">upgrading your instance</a> to EC2 in the future.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/instance-3.png" alt="instance-3" title="AWS Lightsail Instances"></p>
<h3 id="loadbalancers">Loadbalancers</h3>
<p>Lightsail provides the option of adding a loadbalancer to your stack if you need to distribute traffic across your instances. Lightsail also lets you generate free SSL certificates from the UI itself and they work seamlessly with the loadbalancers.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/loadbalancer-1.png" alt="loadbalancer-1" title="AWS Lightsail Loadbalancer"></p>
<h3 id="managed-database">Managed Database</h3>
<p>Lightsail lets you create a managed MySQL or PostgreSQL database easily. Lightsail makes certain database administration tasks much simpler:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated database snapshots</li>
<li>Resize your database from a snapshot</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/database-1.png" alt="database-1" title="AWS Lightsail Database"></p>
<h3 id="dns-management">DNS Management</h3>
<p>Lightsail makes it easy to direct traffic from your custom domain to your instances. This can be done by either creating a static IP or a DNS zone for your domain.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/dns-1.png" alt="dns-1" title="AWS Lightsail DNS"></p>
<h3 id="lightsail-pros--cons">Lightsail: Pros &amp; Cons</h3>
<p>Like with any cloud service, Lightsail has its pros and cons. Some of the more obvious ones are:</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear &amp; transparent pricing</strong>: Pricing is clear and you have a good idea of what your monthly expenses would be.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of use</strong>: Lightsail’s UI is straightforward and easy to use especially when compared to the AWS console.</li>
<li><strong>Low maintenance:</strong> Most of the lightsail services (DNS, Loadbalancers, Database) are managed and thus the operational burden of running your application in Lightsail is pretty low.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lightsail is missing some advanced features such as:
<ul>
<li>Security groups: there is no support for security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic. You need to use firewalls to achieve the same.</li>
<li>If the rest of your infrastructure is on Terraform, it might be hard to fully provision all Lightsail services using Terraform since some of the services <a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+lightsail">aren’t yet supported</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Currently, it is not possible to upgrade your Lightsail database to RDS.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lightsail-alternative-lightsail-vs-digitalocean">Lightsail Alternative: Lightsail vs DigitalOcean</h2>
<p>DigitalOcean is LightSail’s main competitor. The target audience for both of these services are developers who want to be able to spin up their web services easily. We will try to compare these two offerings to get a better idea of how these services stack up against each other.</p>
<p>They’ve taken the relatively complex process of deploying servers to the cloud and simplified the entire process. Their UI is beautifully designed and cloud servers can be deployed within minutes. Pricing has always been transparent and you know what you’ll be paying each month upfront.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p>Lightsail and DigitalOcean are pretty comparable when it comes to the features they both offer. They both provide an easy-to-use interface for setting up as well as APIs for any programmatic setup. When it comes to choosing a server, they both provide a lot of choices. One can go with a The table below compares the two across various dimensions:</p>

<p><a href="https://joshtronic.com/2020/09/06/vps-showdown-digitalocean-lightsail-linode-upcloud-vultr/">The blog post</a> does a comprehensive performance comparion between various VPS providers. Lightsail and DigitalOcean performed comparably in these tests.</p>
<h3 id="when-to-use-lightsail">When to use Lightsail</h3>
<p>When it comes to choosing between Lightsail and DigitalOcean, there are a few factors to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are already using AWS, it makes sense to use Lightsail.</li>
<li>If you are planning to use other AWS services or you might upgrade from Lightsail to EC2, it makes sense to use LightSail.</li>
<li>If you haven’t used either of these services before, you are probably better off starting with DigitalOcean. DigitalOcean is simple and straightforward to use and this is their main business.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Lightsail is a service targeted towards developers who probably haven’t used AWS before or want a service that is easy to use with minimal maintenance overhead.</p>
<p>There are a lot of good reasons to use Lightsail:</p>
<ul>
<li>No need for prior AWS knowledge</li>
<li>Get a complete web service up &amp; running in less than an hour</li>
<li>Clear &amp; transparent pricing</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently <a href="https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/09/vscode-remote-ssh/">rediscovered</a> the ability of Visual Studio Code to develop on remote machines. Just connect to a server via SSH and develop there.</p><p>Even though I’m using Git, I don’t have to commit everything immediately to continue development on another machine, I don’t have to take care to keep all my development tools up to date on all my machines, and I can continue working from my Surface Go with Windows exactly where I left off with my Ubuntu desktop. And I can, for example, start drafting a blog post on one computer, but finish it on another.</p><p>All I need is a cheap rented virtual private server and Visual Studio Code on every machine I want to code from.</p><hr><p>But first of all the reason why I got the idea in the first place:</p><p>To program in Go, I mainly used <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IDEA Ultimate</a> from JetBrains in the past. The best IDE a developer can wish for. Excellent for Java, Kotlin, Go and a lot of other programming languages. And pretty cool: As a student you can get the full IDE for free.</p><p>However, since I won’t be a student forever and IDEA Ultimate or as an alternative just <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoLand</a> from JetBrains <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/store/#personal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t very cheap</a> (at least for hobby projects), I thought I might get used to a different workflow now that will cost me less money later.</p><p>The second best option for developing Go is probably <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Studio Code</a>. The Go team took over the development of <a href="https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Go extension</a> not too long ago, which will hopefully make it more and more pleasant to develop Go programs with VS Code in the future.</p><p>VS Code is free, partly even <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open source</a> and I already use it for quite a lot of things anyway, be it for writing longer blog articles or if I need to write some JavaScript. In itself it is just a text editor, but there are quite a few extensions that add all kinds of functionality. And VS Code is fast and available for all three major computer operating systems.</p><p>For VS Code there is an extension called “Remote - SSH” (documentation is available <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) with which it is possible to connect to another computer or server via SSH. On the remote computer VS Code installs a remote server to provide almost all functionality that is possible locally. It’s like running VS Code directly on the remote computer and developing from there.</p><p>As a server I use the cheapest option from <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hetzner Cloud</a>. With just a few clicks I created a VPS with Ubuntu 20.04, two Gigabytes of RAM and 20 GB SSD storage. I also use Ubuntu 20.04 on my desktop computer and laptop, the environment I am used to. And if the server should be too weak for certain tasks, I can scale it up with a few clicks, even temporarily. The costs are 2,89 € per month. If I don’t need the server for a longer period of time, I could also create an image of the hard drive, delete the server and create a new one later based on the image. That would cost only a few cents per month.</p><p>This way I only have to install all the tools I need on the server. Like Go for the programming of various private projects or Hugo for this blog and my website. But I don’t have to install these tools on all my devices anymore, namely my desktop computer, my Ubuntu-ThinkPad and my Surface Go. There I only need Visual Studio Code with the “Remote - SSH” extension.</p><p>It definitely takes some getting used to in order to adapt to the less comfort you might be used to through the JetBrains IDE. But once you have found the right settings of the Go extension (for example that the Go language server <code>gopls</code> is used), then programming with this setup works quite well.</p><p>My favorite feature is definitely the ability to forward ports from the server to the local machine.</p><p>The only possible negative point is that I need an internet connection to develop so that I can connect to the server. But so often I am not without internet and even in Germany the mobile network should be sufficient for SSH. And when I am offline, I will just have to do something else.</p></div></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6682ce0e9be9292fb093d16e4b89a6cbec481554/1fe8d/images/uploads/sign-up-buttons.png" alt="SaaS Startups Using Sign Up Buttons"></p>

<p>The fate of many&nbsp;startups depends almost entirely on one&nbsp;conversion point: When a visitor becomes a user.</p>

<p>All too often, this pivotal role&nbsp;falls on the shoulders of a pitifully generic “sign up” button that’s lucky to get even a minute of consideration during development.</p>

<p>If you take a moment to consider the wording of your signup button, you can drastically increase how many of your visitors turn into users.</p>

<p><em>(What happens after the conversion is important, too, but things get significantly easier once you have someone’s email and opt-in.)</em></p>
<h2>Why "Sign Up" buttons don't work.</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>They're&nbsp;ignored.&nbsp;</strong>When visitors see common elements repeated on many sites, they begin unconsciously ignoring those elements (aka "habituation").&nbsp;Doesn't matter if they're blue or green or hell-fire-orange.</li>
  <li><strong>You're asking for blind commitment.</strong>&nbsp;Don't&nbsp;assume visitors&nbsp;know what you're asking them to sign up for. People don't read pages, they skim. They could've easily missed the part where you mention a&nbsp;free trial or key benefits.</li>
  <li><strong>You're not offering any value.</strong> Asking someone to "sign up" offers no help in changing the visitor's thinking from "Why should I?" to "I want this!"</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to get more signups&nbsp;from your signup button:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tie it to your product.</strong> If you have a SaaS for trading bitcoins: "Start Trading Bitcoins." If&nbsp;you have a marketplace for artists: "Start Selling Art." This helps prevent the button from being overlooked.</li>
  <li><strong>Give, don't take.</strong> "Get Access" and "Sign Up" both lead to the same thing, but one makes the visitor feel they're getting something, while the other doesn't.</li>
  <li><strong>Compel people to act.</strong> Use action verbs such as <em>get</em>, <em>start</em>, and <em>try</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples from startups that get it right:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a5e786dc725cdf0d2cc7d265cf2130fd5e785f5e/09f83/images/uploads/sign-up-buttons-2.png" alt="Startups with Good Signup Buttons"></p>

<p>(I especially like gliffy’s “Start Drawing,” which implies how quickly you can get started, and directly relates to&nbsp;their product: <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/">an app for easily drawing diagrams</a>.)</p>
<h2>Case study: Getting 3x more clicks by changing two words.</h2>
<p>Take this example from one of my clients. Like many software companies, Scalyr—a <a href="https://www.scalyr.com/">log aggregation and monitoring tool</a>—asked its visitors to “sign up.” I suggested that we test a version of the button that <em>gives</em> and <em>compels</em>: “Try it Free”. Here’s what happened:</p>

<p><strong>Asking visitors to <em>Try it Free</em> <span>increased clicks by 212%</span>.</strong></p>

<p>Complete obliteration of the old “Sign Up” button, and a&nbsp;huge win for a test that took two minutes to set up.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7562f9ce9e08b024e6c838126e1d6f54e24e07ed/7465d/images/uploads/scalyr-test-result.png" alt="A/B test on Scalyr resulted in 212% increase in clicks."></p>
<h2>Now try it yourself...</h2>
<p>Test a variation of your “sign up” button with something that <em>gives</em>,&nbsp;<em>compels</em>, and is <em>tied to your product</em>. It’s one of the easiest things to test, and could have a huge effect on your conversion rates. If you follow my advice then you’re almost certain to do better than asking visitors to “sign up.”</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This is a followup to my post about a year ago, <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/ui/druid/2019/11/22/reactive-ui.html">Towards a unified theory of reactive UI</a>. It is a deeper exploration of the question: “what is the best way to express reactive UI in Rust?”</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>There is an astonishing diversity of “literature” on reactive UI systems. I put “literature” in quotes here, because, with some exceptions, the best primary sources are the code of open source projects. Some of the diversity comes from differences in goals, but some of it is accidental. In many cases, it’s simply because the designers didn’t have insight at the time about better solutions. My post last year attempted to put some order to this diversity, by discovering common patterns.</p>

<p>I believe it’s likely that the answer to “the best way to express reactive UI in Rust” is to be found in the existing literature, at least by combining major themes, if not in a single existing system to copy. It seems unlikely we’ll have to invent something completely new. But sorting through it is not easy. It is not the intent of this post to provide a comprehensive review of the literature (though I think such a thing would be interesting), it is to guide inquiry into the most promising avenues. I want to do mining, not stamp collecting. Where is the richest vein of ore?</p>

<p>To focus the inquiry, I will start by listing some goals. While in general these goals all seem like good things, it’s important to understand them as tradeoffs. Prioritizing different goals will lead you to different places, and not everyone has the same needs. Take overall system complexity, for example. If you’re a trillion dollar corporation, then a complex system is merely a question of allocating resources, and may even be strategically useful as a moat to discourage competition. But if you’re an indie game developer trying to integrate basic UI, you have a very different perspective.</p>

<p>Each goal will be presented primarily as a way to introduce design decisions made by existing reactive systems, and filter the ones that seem most promising as sources and inspiration.</p>

<p>Then I will go into deeper into three principles, which I feel are critically important in any reactive UI framework: whether to use “observable objects,” how to express the mutation of the render object tree (or trees in general), and the notion of stable identity of nodes in that tree.</p>

<p>Finally, I will introduce <a href="https://github.com/raphlinus/crochet">Crochet</a>, a research prototype built for the purpose of exploring these ideas.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<h3 id="concise-expression-of-application-logic">Concise expression of application logic</h3>

<p>The main point of a reactive UI architecture is so that the app can express its logic clearly and concisely, and the results can drive the rest of the UI stack in a reasonable way.</p>

<p>A central feature of reactive UI is for the app to declaratively express the current state of the view tree. In traditional object-oriented UI, it’s more common to specify the initial state (often as a static document, not even code), plus additional logic for state changes. I think the debate is now essentially over, the reactive approach is winning.</p>

<p>SwiftUI has gained considerable attention due to its excellent ergonomics in this regard. But other approaches are also worth studying. In particular, immediate mode GUI (<a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">imgui</a>) is nearly as declarative, it just achieves it in a very different way (about which more below). And React and its many derivatives are also “good enough.” <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> is another example from the JS world that deserves praise, though considerably more difficult to adapt to Rust because of its reliance on a sophisticated compiler.</p>

<p>It’s very popular in Rust GUI land to adapt <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/">Elm</a> patterns; we see clear influence in <a href="https://github.com/antoyo/relm">relm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hecrj/iced">Iced</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bodil/vgtk">vgtk</a>, and others. But I think much of the conciseness and friendliness of Elm comes from the language itself, particularly its facility with higher-order composition. When adapting to a more pragmatic language such as Rust, I consider each subtask of view building and dispatching messages to components as each a half-lens, requiring the writing out of two pieces of logic to integrate a component. For this reason, I find Rust UI code adapted from Elm to be not as clear and concise as possible.</p>

<p>A great resource for comparing the concision of different toolkits is <a href="https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/">7GUIs</a>. We don’t have these ported to Crochet yet, except for counter, but plan to. For reference, here’s the <code>run</code> method for that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>fn</span> <span>run</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>cx</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Cx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Label</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"current count: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>self</span><span>.count</span><span>))</span><span>.build</span><span>(</span><span>cx</span><span>);</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>Button</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"Increment"</span><span>)</span><span>.build</span><span>(</span><span>cx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>self</span><span>.count</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="actually-being-incremental">Actually being incremental</h3>

<p>While imgui can express UI concisely, it cheats somewhat by not being incremental. Generally, it makes up for this by being able to repaint the world very quickly (using GPU acceleration), but there are downsides, including power consumption. In the context of a game which is actively using the GPU anyway, it’s fine, but is a good reason not to choose imgui outside that context.</p>

<p>The documentation of <a href="https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/conrod">Conrod</a> expresses a goal fairly well: “Conrod aims to adopt the best of both worlds by providing an immediate mode API over a hidden, retained widget state graph.” And once you have that, doing efficient incremental updates in the retained widget graph is a solved problem, though the details can be intricate. Unfortunately, I do not believe Conrod delivers on this promise, because app logic does an awful lot of explicit graph construction and juggling of node id’s, neither of which you would find in an actual immediate mode API.</p>

<p>On the other side, <a href="https://github.com/hecrj/iced">Iced</a>, while having many desirable properties, does not satisfy the “actually incremental” goal: while there is caching in the renderer, it builds a full view tree every 16ms (actually twice when there are incoming events). This is fine when the view tree is relatively small, but is a serious problem at scale.</p>

<p>The popularity of “virtual DOM” approaches requires a discussion of diffing, which I feel is (modulo escape hatches for lower level direct tree mutation) a form of half-incrementality. The idea is that it should be cheap to produce a full view tree, then a reconciliation engine computes a minimal diff between that and the old tree, which is then be applied, through DOM mutation or some other means. Because DOM is slow, it’s certainly faster than ham-handed direct DOM mutation (which is difficult to make truly minimal), but still creates performance problems as the view tree grows. React programmers should be well familiar with this issue.</p>

<p>When escape hatches are provided, are they a reasonably principled way to achieve lower level access to tree mutation, simply shifting some tracking of state to the component (often a list view or similar collection), or are they a dirty hack to work around fundamental architectural decisions that limit performance? Both are represented in the literature.</p>

<h3 id="tab-focusing">Tab focusing</h3>

<p>It seems like a relatively simple feature, but proper implementation of tab focusing requires fairly deep architectural support (or, in the case of Web-based UI, it is punted to the browser). Basically, it requires the toolkit to maintain state of which widget is focused, and to query enough of the entire view tree to determine which is the next in tab focus order. Proponents of imgui have suggested a very hacky partial solution (see <a href="http://www.johno.se/book/imgui.html">johno on IMGUI</a>), but I find such things unsatisfying.</p>

<p>Again, Iced is an example of an existing Rust GUI toolkit that is lacking this feature, and I think would require nontrivial architectural work to address, at least in a systematic way that would satisfy similar future needs. Down the line, those needs include accessibility, a serious Achilles heel for imgui-flavored designs in particular.</p>

<p>I believe a proper approach to this problem involves stable identity of widgets, about which much more below.</p>

<h3 id="simple-types">Simple types</h3>

<p>Now we get into more controversial goals. One that I personally am finding increasingly important is expressing the interface between app logic and UI toolkit using simple types.</p>

<p>Rust in particular invites the use of complex types, largely because it has a rich type system that is capable of expressing many concepts as types. By contrast, it’s traditional in object oriented UI to have very loosely coupled dynamic typing; a lot of the values being passed around have a type which is some variant of “any.”</p>

<p>A great example of complex types is SwiftUI, in which a component returns a statically-known type implementing the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view"><code>View</code></a> protocol. As a consequence, the concrete return type of a component generally encodes its entire view hierarchy, including special conditional and looping combinators; this is explained well in the <a href="https://www.objc.io/blog/2019/11/05/static-types-in-swiftui/">Static Types in SwiftUI</a> blog.</p>

<p>There are advantages to such a scheme, but also serious downsides. Error messages from the compiler get… interesting. And it also has a serious impact on compile times, as (at least in Rust) the compiler has to monomorphize the types before even starting to generate code.</p>

<p>To me, one of the most serious drawbacks to the complex type approach is that scripting languages can’t easily play, as the types must be known at compile time.</p>

<p>Again, imgui is an example of an architecture that avoids complex types, by drawing the UI directly rather than constructing an intermediate tree of view objects. But imgui is not the only such; another compelling example to learn from is <a href="https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/under-the-hood-of-jetpack-compose-part-2-of-2-37b2c20c6cdd">Jetpack Compose</a>.</p>

<h3 id="simple-control-flow">Simple control flow</h3>

<p>It is very tempting to use complex control flow patterns: putting significant logic in callbacks, using higher order composition techniques, or using a compiler to significantly transform the code. Yet, such techniques have downsides.</p>

<p>The first is simply that this complexity leaks out into the app. In current Druid, we use some higher order composition techniques such as lenses. While fairly simple by Haskell standards, and our users with Haskell background tend to like them, a lot of people coming to Druid find them confusing.</p>

<p>The simplest mechanism for …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>We turned a coffee maker into a dangerous machine asking for ransom by modifying the maker’s firmware. While we could, could someone else do it too? As you might expect, the answer is: Yes. Follow us on a journey where we show you that firmware is the new software.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Some research is so fun that it confirms why I do this work. I was asked to prove a myth, call it a suspicion, that the threat to IoT devices is not just to access them via a weak router or exposure to the internet, but that an IoT device itself is vulnerable and can be easily owned without owning the network or the router. I also bet that I could make that threat persist and present a true danger to any user. We often say that your home network, thought of as a chain of trust, is only as strong as its weakest link, but what if the same were true at the device level? What would that mean?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s say you have an IoT device that is well protected with functions that can be accessed through a well-defined API; even if you can control the device through the API, you probably can’t do too much harm. Firmware, the programming inside the device has logical constraints that don’t allow you, for example, to close garage doors while someone is in the way of them or overheat a device so that it combusts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We used to trust that hardware, such as a common kitchen appliance, could be trusted and could not be easily altered without physically dismounting the device. But with today’s “smart” appliances, this is no longer the case.</p>



<p>My colleagues often hear me say that&nbsp; “firmware is a new software.” And that software is very often flawed. We see it everywhere. CPU flaws, and cryptographic chips generating weak keys that can be easily broken. The weakened state of IoT security is due in large part to the fact that, nowadays, it is more convenient and cheap to place a processor inside a device which controls and orchestrates all hardware parts, motors, sensors, heating elements, etc. based on a short program called firmware. This solution is not only cheap, but has also one important property – it can be updated</p>



<p><br>Back in the day, if there was a so-called design flaw in a piece of hardware, the rigid design (often hardwired) meant the vendor would need to replace the whole component or logic board or even replace the entire device. Manufacturers would have to change the manufacturing process and at potentially great financial losses. In the era of firmware, this can be easily mitigated just by issuing a firmware update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The process of updating firmware can vary greatly, from connecting to the special device using a special tool (which still requires the vendor’s physical interaction) to the more and more popular way of OTA (over the air) updates. In this case, a vendor doesn’t have to be physically present and the whole process is done either automatically over the internet or semi-automatically after a user’s notification and approval of the update.&nbsp;</p>







<div><p>So let’s see what we have. We have a coffee maker that allows you to make coffee the old fashioned way by pressing a few buttons or via a mobile phone or tablet using an app. The maker operates with Wi-Fi and when unboxed you have to connect it to your network through a companion app on your mobile phone. When turned on for the first time, the coffee maker works in a local mode and it creates its own Wi-Fi network that the hopeful coffee drinker first connects to in order to set up the device.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s worth to mention that this coffee maker is no longer supported by the vendor as they moved to a more secure platform in 2017 and technology because of all the flaws illustrated in this research. But this also shows a general problem we have with abandoned IoT devices.</p><p>When we downloaded the companion app, we saw that it allows you to create a network of any&nbsp; devices of this particular vendor and connects these devices to the&nbsp; home network and then allows you to control all the functions of your coffee maker or smart kettle. It also allows you to check the firmware version of the device and update it if needed.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>The protocol that this device speaks has already been documented on the internet by <a href="#references">several other researchers</a>. As expected, it’s a simple binary protocol with hardly any encryption, authorization or authentication. Communication with machines takes place on <code>TCP</code> port <code>2081</code>. The format of the command is very simple:</p>

<p>In response (if there is a response) the coffee maker sends back:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="593" height="111" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-10.png 593w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-10-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px"></figure></div>



<p><code>response_type</code> differs based on the command, but the general rule is: If the response contains data <code>response_type = command + 1</code>, if it’s just a status then <code>response_type=3</code> and then there is only one <code>data</code> byte which contains resulting status, where <code>1</code> means success. The complete list of commands is in the  <a href="https://github.com/avast/ioc/tree/master/SmarterCoffee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub repository</a>.<br></p>



<p>&nbsp;So just for illustration, by issuing this command:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="396" height="78" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-8.png 396w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-8-300x59.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px"><figcaption><em>making a nice cup of coffee with “default” settings</em></figcaption></figure></div>







<p>You’ll make yourself a nice cup/cups of coffee based on the default settings of the coffee maker. As you can see, there is no security, so anyone who has access to the network and is able to reach the IP address of the coffee maker can control it. What is more interesting, is that all these commands are also available through that default opened Wi-Fi network when the device is not joined to a home network yet.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Let’s return to our main goal of hijacking the coffee maker for nefarious purposes. How secure is the updating process? Can we break into it? Can we even change the firmware to do something else than was originally intended? Can we turn the device into a physically dangerous device? Can we do it remotely? As I said in the beginning, the weakest link always compromises the whole system. Either it’s a network or a device. The goal is answering all the above questions and prove that IoT devices could be also compromised at the firmware level.</p>



<p>To start, we wanted to learn how the update process works. We have several options to do this, but we already have a recipe for this based on similar past research we have done. The general rule is to make it as simple as possible; here is our to-do list when trying to reverse the update process of a piece of firmware.</p>



<ol><li>Get it (the file with the firmware)</li><li>Unpack it (if it is packed/encrypted)</li><li>Reverse engineer it (translate those zeroes and ones into meaningful code)</li><li>Modify it (add the malicious content)</li><li>Upload it (and push it back to the device)</li></ol>



<p>It’s simple right?</p>







<p>First, we need to get the firmware somehow, and again there are several options. Let’s stick to the rule, the simplest option first:</p>



<ol><li>Google it – as obvious as it seems,&nbsp; sometimes security researchers omit this step which could save them a lot of work.

<p>Life is not so simple, and neither is reverse engineering IoT devices. It turned out that we had to use a combination of all the aforementioned techniques. First, we googled it, and as the commands have already been documented, we found a command that says <code>“update the firmware.”</code> But the command itself (its parameters and format) had not been documented. So by issuing:</p>







<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-9.png" alt="" width="396" height="78" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-9.png 396w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-9-300x59.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px"><figcaption>t<em>his simple (two bytes) command switches coffee maker into update mode</em></figcaption></figure></div>







<p>the coffee maker goes into an update mode (on the newer firmware you have to push a button to actually start the update, but this is not the case with older versions !)</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zt-eEhReRyN8xe20y_NoBwNR_TCZ02Y87hyXVZDDiU6WtGGW2s4bmTBy37tdaIS9TBm5hLoBKwqcc1iE0tHjhC4HzVqqhSX_DB1bRUvGy9QTeuwGiYuSRVXTuoWxnkGFwOn57tVX" alt=""></figure></div>







<p>Hmm nice, but nothing happens. By analyzing network traffic, we concluded that there is nothing to analyze, as there is no traffic coming out of the coffee maker at this stage. So we tried the Android companion app.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-02-at-9.30.47-AM.png" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is Screen-Shot-2019-08-02-at-9.30.47-AM.png"><figcaption><em>Android application for smart coffee maker, right picture shows an update screen</em></figcaption></figure></div>







<p>You can see the update button is grayed out, so obviously, the firmware is up-to-date and there is no easy option to push the firmware update to be able to see what’s in the network traffic. What’s interesting here is what’s missing. There was no communication to the internet neither from the coffee maker nor from the app. So how is it possible that the app knows that the coffee maker has the latest firmware? The only packets of data that went through were those between the machine and app when the app had been asking the machine for the version of the firmware.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="677" height="177" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-4.png 677w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-4-300x78.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px"><figcaption>Typical traffic analysis of IoT with companion app: we are interested in traffic between app and internet and app and device.</figcaption></figure></div>







<p>This is strange, and it seemed to tell us that the firmware is probably not on the internet and must be part of the app. So we opened the .apk file as easy as a .zip file. What we found there, proved our assumption.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/reUvllV7KNcZW0e9A4E_XljR0jknTZL-CLUbS3vJx0uiyArpgKdEVSpK1vEUUG0Q6Tu00I0wUlZMdQ8nG1w_Mdxz611TUCxA2DozEy0wftaC0qynZhhx8_pKNc6VeST1djzBgVti" alt=""><figcaption><em>Files inside the apk: You can see firmware for both products are contained in the two files with suffix .bin&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure></div>







<p>The firmware is part of the Android app and it also means that new versions of the firmware always come with new versions of the app. This makes perfect sense if you think about it for a second. The new firmware usually adds new …</p></div></article></div>

<p>We turned a coffee maker into a dangerous machine asking for ransom by modifying the maker’s firmware. While we could, could someone else do it too? As you might expect, the answer is: Yes. Follow us on a journey where we show you that firmware is the new software.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Some research is so fun that it confirms why I do this work. I was asked to prove a myth, call it a suspicion, that the threat to IoT devices is not just to access them via a weak router or exposure to the internet, but that an IoT device itself is vulnerable and can be easily owned without owning the network or the router. I also bet that I could make that threat persist and present a true danger to any user. We often say that your home network, thought of as a chain of trust, is only as strong as its weakest link, but what if the same were true at the device level? What would that mean?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s say you have an IoT device that is well protected with functions that can be accessed through a well-defined API; even if you can control the device through the API, you probably can’t do too much harm. Firmware, the programming inside the device has logical constraints that don’t allow you, for example, to close garage doors while someone is in the way of them or overheat a device so that it combusts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We used to trust that hardware, such as a common kitchen appliance, could be trusted and could not be easily altered without physically dismounting the device. But with today’s “smart” appliances, this is no longer the case.</p>



<p>My colleagues often hear me say that&nbsp; “firmware is a new software.” And that software is very often flawed. We see it everywhere. CPU flaws, and cryptographic chips generating weak keys that can be easily broken. The weakened state of IoT security is due in large part to the fact that, nowadays, it is more convenient and cheap to place a processor inside a device which controls and orchestrates all hardware parts, motors, sensors, heating elements, etc. based on a short program called firmware. This solution is not only cheap, but has also one important property – it can be updated</p>



<p><br>Back in the day, if there was a so-called design flaw in a piece of hardware, the rigid design (often hardwired) meant the vendor would need to replace the whole component or logic board or even replace the entire device. Manufacturers would have to change the manufacturing process and at potentially great financial losses. In the era of firmware, this can be easily mitigated just by issuing a firmware update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The process of updating firmware can vary greatly, from connecting to the special device using a special tool (which still requires the vendor’s physical interaction) to the more and more popular way of OTA (over the air) updates. In this case, a vendor doesn’t have to be physically present and the whole process is done either automatically over the internet or semi-automatically after a user’s notification and approval of the update.&nbsp;</p>







<div><p>So let’s see what we have. We have a coffee maker that allows you to make coffee the old fashioned way by pressing a few buttons or via a mobile phone or tablet using an app. The maker operates with Wi-Fi and when unboxed you have to connect it to your network through a companion app on your mobile phone. When turned on for the first time, the coffee maker works in a local mode and it creates its own Wi-Fi network that the hopeful coffee drinker first connects to in order to set up the device.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s worth to mention that this coffee maker is no longer supported by the vendor as they moved to a more secure platform in 2017 and technology because of all the flaws illustrated in this research. But this also shows a general problem we have with abandoned IoT devices.</p><p>When we downloaded the companion app, we saw that it allows you to create a network of any&nbsp; devices of this particular vendor and connects these devices to the&nbsp; home network and then allows you to control all the functions of your coffee maker or smart kettle. It also allows you to check the firmware version of the device and update it if needed.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>The protocol that this device speaks has already been documented on the internet by <a href="#references">several other researchers</a>. As expected, it’s a simple binary protocol with hardly any encryption, authorization or authentication. Communication with machines takes place on <code>TCP</code> port <code>2081</code>. The format of the command is very simple:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="593" height="111" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-6.png 593w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-6-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px"></figure></div>







<p>In response (if there is a response) the coffee maker sends back:</p>

<p><code>response_type</code> differs based on the command, but the general rule is: If the response contains data <code>response_type = command + 1</code>, if it’s just a status then <code>response_type=3</code> and then there is only one <code>data</code> byte which contains resulting status, where <code>1</code> means success.

<p>You’ll make yourself a nice cup/cups of coffee based on the default settings of the coffee maker.

<p>This is strange, and it seemed to tell us that the firmware is probably not on the internet and must be part of the app. So we opened the .apk file as easy as a .zip file. What we found there, proved our assumption.&nbsp;</p>

<p>MovingPandas is a Python library for handling movement data based on Pandas and <a href="https://geopandas.org/">GeoPandas</a>. 
It provides trajectory data structures and functions for analysis and visualization.</p>

<p>The MovingPandas repository is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/anitagraser/movingpandas">Github</a>.</p>

<p>For more information on individual releases, check out the <a href="https://anitagraser.github.io/movingpandas/changelog">Changelog</a>.</p>

<p>The official documentation is hosted on <a href="https://movingpandas.readthedocs.io/">ReadTheDocs</a>.</p>

<p>For an example use case, check out our <a href="https://anitagraser.github.io/movingpandas/3_horse_collar.html">movement data exploration tutorial</a>.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>MovingPandas development started as a QGIS plugin idea in 2018. 
The resulting Trajectools plugin was first published in 2019. 
However, it became clear that the core trajectory handling classes should be extracted into 
in a separate library to make them usable outside the context of QGIS. 
This was the birth of MovingPandas.</p>

<p>In 2020, MovingPandas was approved for <a href="https://www.pyopensci.org/">pyOpenSci</a>.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Convert GeoPandas GeoDataFrames of time-stamped points into MovingPandas Trajectories and TrajectoryCollections</li>
  <li>Add trajectory properties, such as movement speed and direction</li>
  <li>Split continuous observations into individual trips</li>
  <li>Generalize Trajectories</li>
  <li>Aggregate TrajectoryCollections into flow maps</li>
  <li>Create static and interactive visualizations for data exploration</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://anitagraser.github.io/movingpandas/pics/movingpandas_hvplot2.gif" alt="Interactive trajectory visualization using hvplot"></p>

<h2 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h2>

<p>The MovingPandas repository contains multiple tutorials in the form of Jupyter notebooks that 
illustrate diverse analysis capabilities using different datasets, including: tracking data of ships, 
migration of birds, and tracks from a horse’s GPS collar. 
All MovingPandas tutorials are available on MyBinder - no installation required: 
<a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/anitagraser/movingpandas/binder-tag?filepath=tutorials/0_getting_started.ipynb"><img src="https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg" alt="Binder"></a></p>

<p>MovingPandas Trajectory objects are created from GeoPandas GeoDataFrames. A minimal example would be:</p>

<p>MovingPandas provides static plots using Matplotlib and interactive plots using hvplot:</p>



<p><img src="https://anitagraser.github.io/movingpandas/pics/mp_fig1.png" alt="The trajectory is plotted as a blue line on a white background with latitude and longitude values labeled on the axes."></p>

<p>Matplotlib and hvplot parameters are passed along to the underlying libraries to enable extensive customization of plots:</p>

<h3 id="exploring-movement-characteristics">Exploring Movement Characteristics</h3>

<p>MovingPandas makes it straightforward to compute movement characteristics, such as trajectory length and duration, as well as movement speed and direction.</p>

<p>For example, we can explore the daily travelled distance as recorded by a GPS tracker:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>df</span> <span>=</span> <span>read_file</span><span>(</span><span>'tracker.gpkg'</span><span>)</span>
<span>df</span> <span>=</span> <span>df</span><span>.</span><span>set_index</span><span>(</span><span>'t'</span><span>)</span>
<span>tc</span> <span>=</span> <span>mpd</span><span>.</span><span>TrajectoryCollection</span><span>(</span><span>df</span><span>,</span> <span>'CollarID'</span><span>)</span>

<span>daily</span> <span>=</span> <span>mpd</span><span>.</span><span>TemporalSplitter</span><span>(</span><span>tc</span><span>).</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>mode</span><span>=</span><span>'day'</span><span>)</span>
<span>daily_lengths</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>traj</span><span>.</span><span>get_length</span><span>()</span> <span>for</span> <span>traj</span> <span>in</span> <span>daily</span><span>]</span>
<span>daily_t</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>traj</span><span>.</span><span>get_start_time</span><span>()</span> <span>for</span> <span>traj</span> <span>in</span> <span>daily</span><span>]</span>
<span>daily_lengths</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>DataFrame</span><span>(</span><span>daily_lengths</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>=</span><span>daily_t</span><span>,</span> <span>columns</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'length'</span><span>])</span>
<span>daily_lengths</span><span>.</span><span>hvplot</span><span>(</span><span>title</span><span>=</span><span>'Daily trajectory length'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://anitagraser.github.io/movingpandas/pics/mp_fig3.png" alt="The evolution of the length of the daily trajectories is plotted over the whole obseration period."></p>

<p>In this case, the movement data, which comes from a GPS collar of a horse, reveals that the animal tends to travel farther during summer days than during shorter winter days.</p>

<p>Other functions deal with trajectory generalization, splitting trajectories into subtrajectories, clipping trajectories to an area of interest, and extracting trajectory start and end times and locations.</p>

<p>God...dammit</p>


<p>It's hard to see a child outside today without some kind of iDevice pumping high fidelity 192kbps stereo lossless audio into their shiny white headphones, but <em>BACK IN MY</em> <em>DAY, </em>the iPod hadn't been invented yet. &nbsp;Pickings were slim. &nbsp;Walkmen were outdated, CD players were pricey and would skip if bumped around despite their ESP features, MiniDisk was another stillborn Sony format, and MP3 players were still ugly and ridiculously expensive (at least Apple fixed the ugly part).</p>
<p>Thus, Tiger Electronics, pioneers in the high tech market of McDonald's Happy Meal toys, invented "Hit Clips"</p>
<p><iframe width="584" height="438" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N9pgMmDmd8w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hit Clips were small cheap digital audio players that could play music off of little plastic cartridges. &nbsp;The audio was mono, sounded terrible, and only included a 60 second sample of a song.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5621" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Better hold on to that patent Tiger...</p>
<p>Still, the songs were officially licensed and included bands like The Backstreet Boys, Aaron Carter, Sugar Ray, and ...Dreamstreet</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="Dream_street_blue_house" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="456" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house.jpg 635w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house-300x215.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house-417x300.jpg 417w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px"></a></p>
<p>The 00s were a very strange time for all of us...</p>
<p>Anywho, while helping my 17 year old cousin move some furniture, we came across a large collection of hit clip cartridges, but no player. &nbsp;Struck with a wave of nostalgia, I asked if I could take one to do a tear down.</p>
<p>Thus this post.</p>

<p>The hit clip cartridge has 8 metal contacts on the back:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5620" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Taking it apart, I was hoping to find some identifiable piece of hardware, but instead found the chip-on-board construction that is so popular with super-low-cost low-power electronics along with a few discrete components.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5625" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Under this blob of epoxy is a wire-bonded chip of silicon. &nbsp;The song is likely hard coded directly into the silicon wafer rather than being programmed there after the fact using flash or OTP memory. &nbsp;It's cheaper that way if you make enough units.</p>
<p>This didn't give me a whole lot to work from, but assuming the capacitor is a bypass capacitor (decent assumption), I at least had some idea of how to power the thing. &nbsp;Poking around for a bit gave me this schematic:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="hitclipschem" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem-300x225.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>I'm not sure what the two No Connect pins do, but apparently there was a version of the Hit Clip that allowed music to be recorded to special cartridges, so I'm guessing they have something to do with that.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure how much voltage the part needed, but a quick search on Ebay gave me some idea:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay.png"><img loading="lazy" title="ebay" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay.png" alt="" width="720" height="475" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay.png 720w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay-300x197.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay-454x300.png 454w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></a></p>
<p>3 AAAs means 4.5V. &nbsp;Also, can you believe people are bidding $40+ for these things?</p>
<p>Before I could get serious about debugging, I needed some way to connect traces to the board easily. &nbsp;I ended up soldering on some header pins and plugging it into a breadboard:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5629" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>My original assumption was that the bottom-left pin was ground as it connected to the mystery chip more times than the other power-pin. &nbsp;You'll note the scratch-outs indicate that I was wrong. &nbsp;In that configuration, the chip drew 200+mA during the half-second that I left it connected. &nbsp;Presumably there's a reverse bias protection diode that I was blowing up.</p>
<p>Swapping the power pins around, the current started at around 280<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>A before dropping to zero.</p>
<p>Convinced that I had it right, I moved to the other pins. &nbsp;There were four pins to chose from and a voltage measurement showed me that two of them were at the 4.5V rail while the other two were settled close to 0V.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>

<td>High</td>

<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Low</td>

<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>High</td>

<tr>
<td>4</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Since I had already identified my two power pins, I had to assume that these four pins were used for data somehow and that the two high pins had internal pull up resistors.</p>
<p>Connecting Pin1 to ground sinks about 12mA from that pin. &nbsp;12mA is much to high to be from a simple pull-up resistor. &nbsp;My guess is that it's some kind of output pin to tell the player that the cartridge is inserted all the way. I decided to leave it alone and move on to Pin 3.</p>
<p>Connecting Pin 3 to ground caused the circuit's current draw to rise from zero up to 300<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>A. Removing this short did nothing to change the current increase although it did settle down after about 60 seconds.</p>

<p>This is when I knew I was on to something. &nbsp;60 seconds of current draw meant that this part was outputting its music sample! &nbsp;I was expecting the player to need to do something more complicated like pull bytes of music off the cartridge over a SPI bus or at least provide a clock source, but it turns out that the cartridge can handle that all by itself. &nbsp;I'm guessing that the two on-board series resistors are used for fine-tuning its internal clock source after the chip has been printed.</p>
<p>I quickly whipped out my oscilloscope and took a trace of Pin 2:</p>

<p>Data!</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p><em>While doing a similar job on a different Hit Clip (Who Let the Dogs Out by the Baha Men), I discovered different behavior. &nbsp;Connecting Pin 3 to ground did nothing while commenting pin 1 to&nbsp;ground toggled between data and no data. &nbsp;I'm not sure if there was a change in the Hit Clip design through generations, or if I took imprecise notes. &nbsp;The PCB layouts of the two clips is clearly different, and it looks like pin 3 is NC on the second clip.</em></p>
<p>I noticed an intermittent square wave with a period of almost exactly 24kHz and a duty cycle that varied with time. &nbsp;Pin 4 had similar data.</p>
<p>So there was definitely something going on here, and it was definitely digital somehow, but I needed some way to capture loads of digital data to later analyze. &nbsp;Fortunately, Santa gave me an 8 bit Saleae logic analyzer for Christmas:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="saleae" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>I actually picked up the Hit Clip while looking for a good project to test this thing out. &nbsp;It's a really nice device, and the Windows/Mac/Linux compatible software is really slick.</p>
<p>Anywho, with the Saleae connected to Pin 2 and Pin 4, I reactivated the circuit and took a trace at a 24MHz sample rate. &nbsp;I came up with this:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace.png"><img loading="lazy" title="saleae trace" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace.png" alt="" width="1647" height="986" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace.png 1647w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace-300x179.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace-1024x613.png 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace-500x300.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1647px) 100vw, 1647px"></a></p>
<p>It was strange at first to see how the two data lines appeared to take turns, but once I remembered that Hit Clips only output in mono, it made a lot more sense. &nbsp;These two lines are encoding the same mono stream of audio.</p>
<p>Looking closer at the low-going blips, I noticed that they were quantized. &nbsp;The length of each blip was always near some integer multiple of 0.3333<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s.</p>
<p>Knowing what I know about audio amplifiers, I theorized that these two outputs are meant to directly drive the push and pull FETs of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-D_amplifier">class D amplifier</a> in real time. &nbsp;In other words, a blip on one line pulls the waveform output voltage up while a blip on the other pulls it down. &nbsp;The width of the blip indicates how hard (or for how long) it pulls.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Redditor urquan points out that this kind of modulation is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-sigma_modulation">Sigma-Delta Modulation</a>.</p>
<p>While it's technically a digital output, it's encoded in such a way that it can be fed directly into an analog circuit.</p>
<p>I figured that if I could give myself a stream of this data, I could probably simulate the output digitally. &nbsp;To cut down on the number of samples, I exported the trace to a CSV file that only records timestamps when something changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output.png"><img loading="lazy" title="saleae output" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output.png" alt="" width="534" height="810" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output.png 534w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output-197x300.png 197w" sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px"></a></p>
<p>In order to make use of this data, I just needed to record how much time passed between a signal dropping low and rising up again, and I should have such data points arriving at almost exactly 24kHz. &nbsp;All of the data from one pin was given a positive value while the data from the other pin was given a negative value.</p>
<p>I also tried quantizing the data by dividing the time delays by 0.33333<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s, and while this worked for small numbers, I noticed that some of the larger numbers fell pretty far from a solid integer.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3.png"><img loading="lazy" title="divby3" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3.png" alt="" width="603" height="555" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3.png 603w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3-300x276.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3-325x300.png 325w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"></a></p>
<p>It looked like 0.33333<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s was a bad estimate of the actual quantization time. &nbsp;Thinking a little more critically, I noticed that a 24kHz wave has a period of 41.67<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s. &nbsp;When divided by my quantization time, this comes out to almost exactly 125 which is pretty darn close to 128, a power of two.</p>
<p>Changing my quantization time to 0.3255<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s or <span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_d7efcee3110178fb773e908bd2b03eda.gif" alt=""></span> yielded much better results:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255.png"><img loading="lazy" title="divby3255" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255.png" alt="" width="603" height="555" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255.png 603w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255-300x276.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255-325x300.png 325w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"></a></p>
<p>Now the question is what to do with these numbers.</p>
<p>My first attempt involved just pumping them into a WAV file and taking a listen. &nbsp;With this setup, all of the negative numbers were negative points on the waveform. &nbsp;Here's the first 400 samples:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.png"><img loading="lazy" title="straightwav" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.png" alt="" width="937" height="523" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.png 937w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav-300x167.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav-500x279.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 937px) 100vw, 937px"></a></p>
<p>I took these values, gained them up to fill a 16 bit WAV file and took a listen:</p>
<p><audio controls="controls"><source src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support the audio element</audio></p>
<p>Firstly, I was shocked to get anything even closely resembling audio. &nbsp;Especially something so recognizable. &nbsp;That being said, the audio quality isn't the best. &nbsp;The raw values out of the cartridge only extend from around -60 to +60 which leads me to believe that it's encoded as a 7-bit signed integer (-64 to +63). &nbsp;7-bit audio isn't exactly lossless, but I wasn't convinced that this was the best I could do.</p>
<p>I found two problems with the way I was decoding the audio:</p>
<h3>Empty samples</h3>
<p>I noticed looking at the Saleae trace that there were many periods in the 24kHz digital data stream where neither trace showed a blip.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip.png"><img loading="lazy" title="noblip" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip.png" alt="" width="1055" height="905" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip.png 1055w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip-300x257.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip-1024x878.png 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip-349x300.png 349w" sizes="(max-width: 1055px) 100vw, 1055px"></a></p>
<p>Because my script was only looking at the blips, I simply skipped passed these data points. &nbsp;The end result was that the music played slightly faster than it should have. &nbsp;This was obvious when my output WAV file was shorter than my original trace.</p>
<p>I modified the script to detect when more than <span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_e8eaa034768987e29c645972e4862a53.gif" alt=""></span> passed between consecutive blips and interpolate blips at the proper places by just repeating the previous value.</p>
<h3>Push Pull simulation</h3>
<p>I noticed later on that I wasn't really simulating the push-pull driver that the Hit Clip likely used. &nbsp;The digital encoding is actually more of a derivative of the output waveform rather than the waveform itself. &nbsp;In other words, a positive value doesn't guarantee that the output will be positive, but rather that it will have a positive slope. &nbsp;A larger value specifies a larger slope.</p>
<p>I modified my script to keep a running value starting from zero where the incoming value from the cartridge is added to the previous value to generate the next one. &nbsp;There was a problem of DC drift because the values don't all add up to zero. &nbsp;My first time through, I found that the largest value was 1 while the smallest value was somewhere around -50,000 which overflowed my signed 16 bit WAV output.</p>
<p>I solved this by …</p></div></div>

<h2>😠 Haters</h2>
<p><em>“Independent Micro-SaaS works with platforms.”<br></em>Some do. But they don’t <strong>depend</strong> on platforms.</p>
<p><em>“What about Medium-SaaS?”</em><br>Don’t take these definitions literally. These are heuristics. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fs.blog/2016/06/value-grey-thinking/" target="_blank">Think grey</a>.</p>
<p><em>“Integrated Micro-SaaS is maintenance hell.”</em><br>There’s no free lunch. The tradeoff is lower platform risk. Independent Micro-SaaS avoids platform risk. <em>And</em> distribution gains from ecosystems. Like <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Shopify's App Store (opens in a new tab)">Shopify’s App Store</a>.</p>
<p><em>“Everything has platform risk.”</em><br>Maybe <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematicrisk.asp" target="_blank">systematic risk</a>. Ever-present. It almost isn’t worth talking about. </p>

<p>"Everyone gets the experience. Some get the lesson." T.S. Eliot</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contributing to a project is not an easy task, especially if you're new to the project, new to coding in general, or
just not an active contributor.</p>
<p>I have been on both sides, the contributing side and the reviewing side. I've made mistakes on both. The mistakes I
regret the most are the ones I've made on the reviewing side. Some are obvious, some are not. All of them could have
made the contributor's life, whether a developer on the team, or a contributor in an open source project, much easier.</p>
<p>A critical point to make, and something that I personally do not accept as a manager or as a developer, are actions
taken on either side which are made with bad intent. So while innocent mistakes are fine, we all make them, knowingly or
not, doing bad by intent is not acceptable behavior at all. Following up on the previous point,
by making intentional mistakes, I mean following imperfect guidelines, or having a
false perception of what's important or how to convey it, in contrast with having malicious intentions with your
actions.</p>
<h2 id="insignificant-factors"><a href="#insignificant-factors" aria-label="insignificant factors permalink"></a>Insignificant factors</h2>
<p>There is a big waste of time and energy in trivial, non-significant feedback. This complies perfectly with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">Parkinson's Law of Triviality</a>. People spend a disproportional amount
of time bothering with trivial details that have almost nothing to do with code semantics. From arguing about style,
function names, property names, names in general, spaces (or tabs), indentation (or lack of), braces, splitting code to
modules (or joining separate modules), extracting constants (almost religiously).</p>
<p>People also love premature optimizations (Which are known to be the
<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization">root of all evil</a>). They do or suggest using LRU, sets instead of lists and
so many other factors, without any proven significant performance benefits, or that those are even needed. In general,
the program complexity seems to matter less than program correctness (or assumed correctness).</p>
<p>Why do we bother with such things?</p>
<ol>
<li>We underwent similar scrutiny when we were less experienced, and think it's great, or the correct path to becoming
better. Maybe it's simply something new trainees have to do.</li>
<li>People tend to spend less time thinking about the global effects of a change, and spend more time on the micro level.
This means reading and writing comments on a review as they process it. This prevents the reader from "Seeing the big
picture". Instead, we focus on tiny improvements, as if they were the important factor. "Improve this function's
name", "Extract this number as a constant.", all things we write that have almost no significant semantic code
impact. Why do we do them? They're easier to come up with, and they're also sometimes more obvious.</li>
<li>We didn't take the time removing any manual decisions about style from the review. Both the contributor and the
reviewer need to spend effort on reviewing style and this both wears them down, and simultaneously prevents them from
focusing on what matters. This is a key point I'll discuss later in <a href="#removing-obstacles">Removing obstacles</a>.</li>
<li>We find it hard to believe that
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/devops-at-microsoft/code-reviews-not-primarily-finding-bugs#code-reviews-rarely-find-functional-bugs">code reviews rarely catch bugs</a>.
Yes, it's kind of shocking, we were all taught that code reviews are an effective tool for this kind of things.
They're not. They are effective for other things, discussed later in <a href="#the-important-stuff">The important stuff</a>. The
overall theme of thinking too highly about code reviews is basically science fiction. We should be spending our
energy elsewhere.</li>
<li>It's a form of control. This is a bit sad to say, and I've been there myself. Teams tend to be overly defensive about
their code and apply harsh review to external (to the team) contributors. They also sometimes apply this to more
junior developers, partly as a training tool and partly a control tool. Software code control is mostly a virtual
dance around a code repository. The alleged last defense (besides code quality tooling and deployment) is the code
review. Teams really believe it is their job to "protect the code", whatever that means, and their belief is
reinforced when they have to wake up at night due to changes done by external team members. One can say they should
have built better protective measures, or that they also wake up at night to their own changes, but it's very easy to
fall into this "guardian" trap after the n-th time they get a pager from an external person's change.</li>
<li>A form of control, but the bad kind. A person or persons are either taking care of their job security, or making sure
you know who is the owner (boss). This is a form of territorial battle, where someone who has the last word wins and
thus receives virtual fame and confidence, at least on paper. This happens a lot more than one would think it
happens, but in the end, code is written (at least in present day) by humans, who are a talking animal, but still an
animal, with a social ladder and animal-like behavior. I've been there, it's ugly. If you're in a company that has
this kind of stuff going on a lot, I suggest you run away.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-important-stuff"><a href="#the-important-stuff" aria-label="the important stuff permalink"></a>The important stuff</h2>
<p>What should we use code-reviews for? To be perfectly honest, I'm not a big believer in pre-merge code-reviews (To be
explained later in <a href="#the-road-less-traveled">The road less traveled</a>). I've seen them weigh down development speed so
much, the added benefits might not be worth it. That said a code-review can be important when:</p>
<ol>
<li>The developer is new. Either entirely to the code-base or to coding. That developer is going to need feedback on both
how to code, how "we" code, and what's important to the team. In these regards, the code-review is being used as a
training class, and less than a device to add features. In a way, this is the asynchronous alternative to pair
programming or coding together.</li>
<li>Someone wanting to familiarize themselves with the code-base or changes made to it. That someone can be another
developer that you want to be aware of your new feature or changes, your tech lead or a senior engineer in the team.
A code-review helps them learn the inner-details of your new feature, that specific part of code that they don't
know, or just get better acquainted with the code-base. This means the code review is meant as an FYI to them, and in
most cases it shouldn't be blocking.</li>
<li>Reviewing system critical changes. Sometimes you do need or want an extra eye-ball on system critical changes.
Anything that can have a drastic effect on the system, from changing the way you run tests, to changing service
infrastructure, to super-hot code which is very performance oriented, to sensitive billing code. Those areas might be
worth the added blocking review, but I also assume those areas are less frequently edited.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a side, a lesser known point is that sometimes code-review are required as part of regulation policy the company is
complying with, such as SOC2. This makes code-reviewing changes required, though it doesn't make the insignificant
factors significant all of a sudden, so don't let that get in the way.</p>
<h2 id="removing-obstacles"><a href="#removing-obstacles" aria-label="removing obstacles permalink"></a>Removing obstacles</h2>
<p>As obvious as it may sound, you should be investing as much as you can in automating anything that can be automated in
code-reviews. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code formatting should be done automatically when developing and checked automatically on code-reviews. Not by a
human.</li>
<li>Automatic code linting (and any static analysis applied) should represent most of your style guide. In fact, I would
go further and say that if you can't build an automatic rule to at least warn about a style violation, you shouldn't
bring it up in code-reviews, ever. It's just not worth it. (This lesson I learned from a very smart friend who
enlightened me on this).</li>
<li>Testing, and quality assurance should both ease the pains for contributors, and increase confidence for maintainers.
If they don't - you should either delete or fix them. I've worked on code-bases where the tests would just slow down
the developer, never actually giving valid input. What are they useful besides wasting our time (or making it harder
to contribute)? Adding useful tests improves development speed and confidence, not slow it down. It also lowers the
blast radius, making errors less deadly in production (By allowing less brutal errors to pass through,
unintentionally).</li>
<li>Extending the previous points, I would go further and argue that any non-semantic review comments should be kept to a
minimum, preferably non-existent. Contributors should feel safe contributing, and know that even if they poorly named
their variable, everything is going to be ok, assuming their code still works. This can also be fixed in retrospect
(supporting post-merge workflows), as it has no semantic difference.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite all the above, it is in my experience that developers find it very hard to let go of old practices. I know I
did. Once you understand the enormous negative side-benefits of focusing on the trivial stuff, you understand they are
waste of time and energy. To all sides.</p>
<p>A question I get asked sometimes is why should you allow bad code practices to slip through to your code, especially if
you're the owner of it, and a contributor is just passing through. My answer is simple.
You want the code review to be effective and focus <strong>only on what's important</strong>. Critical stuff you
might have missed. Everything else is a distraction meant to make the code prettier, but probably not better.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about code style add a linter. Add static rules that prevent adding this bad change. Better yet,
prefer automatic fixing of code style (when possible). Style should be a solved problem,
and I don't care what style it is - as long as I don't have to actively think about it
when contributing (or reviewing).</p>
<p>A thought that I always try to propagate is to treat others (contributors) as a reviewer the same as you would like to
be treated when contributing.</p>
<h2 id="harmful-stuff"><a href="#harmful-stuff" aria-label="harmful stuff permalink"></a>Harmful stuff</h2>
<p>Review comments have a style of their own. A lot has been written on reviewer hostility, and I'd like to assume you
understand how comments should be styled.</p>

The following are benefits I've identified so far.</p><h3 id="heading-it-lessens-the-need-for-a-client-to-process-the-response">It lessens the need for a client to process the response<a href="#heading-it-lessens-the-need-for-a-client-to-process-the-response"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>In most situations, we have a client to request the data from the GraphQL server and transform it into the required format.</p><p>For instance, a website on the client-side can process the data with JavaScript, as to transform fields <code>title</code> and <code>date</code> into a description:</p><pre><code><span><span>const</span> desc <span>=</span> <span><span>`Post </span><span><span>${</span> response<span>.</span>data<span>.</span>title <span>}</span></span><span> was published on </span><span><span>${</span> response<span>.</span>data<span>.</span>date <span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span></span></code></pre><p>However, in some situations we may need to retrieve the data for a service that we do not control, and which does not offer tools to process the results.</p><p>For instance, a newsletter service (such as Mailchimp) may accept to define an endpoint from which to retrieve the data for the newsletter. Whatever data is returned by the endpoint is final; it can't be manipulated before being injected into the newsletter.</p><p>In these situtations, the query could use embeddable fields to manipulate the response into the required format. This could be particularly useful when accessing <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http">GraphQL over HTTP</a>.</p><h3 id="heading-it-can-help-declutter-the-schema">It can help declutter the schema<a href="#heading-it-can-help-declutter-the-schema"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>The use case above could also be satisfied by adding an extra field <code>Post.descriptionForNewsletter</code> to the schema. But this solution clutters the schema, and embeddable fields could be considered a more elegant solution.</p><h3 id="heading-it-improves-the-development-experience">It improves the development experience<a href="#heading-it-improves-the-development-experience"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>Embeddable fields could be compared to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_arrow_function.asp">arrow functions</a> in JavaScript, which is syntactic sugar over a feature already available in the language.</p><p>Arrow functions are not really needed, but they provide benefits:</p><ul><li>they shorten the amount of code needed to achieve something</li><li>they simplify the syntax</li></ul><p>As such, the feature becomes a welcome-to-have in the language, producing a better development experience.</p><h3 id="heading-the-if-condition-in-@skip-and-@include-can-become-dynamic">The <code>if</code> condition in <code>@skip</code> and <code>@include</code> can become dynamic<a href="#heading-the-if-condition-in-@skip-and-@include-can-become-dynamic"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>Currently, argument <code>"if"</code> for the <code>@skip</code> and <code>@include</code> directives can only be an actual boolean value (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) or a variable with the boolean value. This behavior is pretty static.</p><p>Embeddable fields would enable to make this behavior more dynamic, by evaluating the condition on some property from the object itself.</p><p>There is an issue to address: <code>if</code> is a <code>Boolean</code>, not a <code>String</code>, so to avoid type conflicts the GraphQL syntax may also need to accept the embedded field on its own, not wrapping it between string quotes:</p><pre><code><span><span>query</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  posts <span>{</span></span><br><span>	  id</span><br><span>    title <span>@skip</span><span>(</span><span>if</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>{</span> hasComments <span>}</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>  <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>Removing the need to wrap <code>{{ }}</code> between quotes <code>" "</code> would solve this issue for every scalar type other than <code>String</code>, not just <code>Boolean</code> (check the example below with <code>droid</code>, using embeddable fields to resolve an <code>ID</code>).</p><h3 id="heading-it-enables-to-code-templates-within-the-graphql-query">It enables to code templates within the GraphQL query<a href="#heading-it-enables-to-code-templates-within-the-graphql-query"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>Embeddable fields enable to embed a template within the GraphQL query itself, which would render the GraphQL service more configuration-friendly.</p><p>For instance, combined with the <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/174">flat chain syntax</a> and <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/252">nested mutations</a> (two other features also proposed for the spec), we could produce the following query, which sends an email to the user notifying that his/her comment was replied to:</p><pre><code><span><span>mutation</span>

      <article role="main">
        <p>This is going to be a painfully cliched, but imagine that the American science and technology system is an engine. It’s just not performing as well as it used to. It’s making a lot of noise and when we push the accelerator it’s sluggish. This bill assumes the solution is STEP ON THE ACCELERATOR HARDER. That is, it wants to slam more money through a system shot through with friction and bad incentives. Slamming on the accelerator when your engine has problems doesn’t often fix the problem. I’ve tried it, and it ended up with my car ‘<a href="https://www.cartalk.com/content/what-does-it-mean-throw-rod#:~:text=The%20motion%20of%20that%20piston,one%20of%20two%20things%20occurs.">throwing a rod</a>.’</p>

<p>Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.), Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Congressman Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), and Congressman Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) introduced “The Endless Frontier Act” a bipartisan bill to spend $100B to super-charge the National Science Foundation at the end of May. You can read an official announcement <a href="https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-schumer-unveil-endless-frontier-act-to-bolster-us-tech-leadership-and-combat-china">here</a> and Noah Smith’s summary on Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-06-01/the-u-s-gets-serious-about-catching-up-to-china-in-r-d">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some thoughts after reading through the actual text of the bill. (My eyes will bleed so yours don’t need to.)</p>

<p>This bill is proposing to give money with risk-averse restrictions to a risk-averse organization (the NSF) to be dispersed among other risk-averse organizations (Universities) into a system with increasingly risk-averse incentives.  Note that I’m not saying “it’s all fubar’d lets burn it to the ground!” but I am suggesting that instead of slamming on the accelerator, we should be asking “what would a tune-up and an oil change look like instead? “</p>

<h3 id="the-bill">The Bill</h3>
<p>The bill comes back to its  <code>Key Technology Focus Areas</code> throughout the document:</p>

<p>(i) artificial intelligence and machine learning;
(ii) high performance computing, semiconductors, and advanced computer hardware
(iii) quantum computing and information systems
(iv) robotics, automation, and advanced manufacturing
(v) natural or anthropogenic disaster prevention
(vi) advanced communications technology
(vii) biotechnology, genomics, and synthetic biology
(viii) cybersecurity, data storage, and data management technologies;
(ix) advanced energy
(x) materials science, engineering, and exploration relevant to the other key technology focus areas described in this subparagraph.</p>

<p>That list is pretty uncontroversial.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> And that should raise a flag. In other words, this is a list of “what are the top 10 hot technologies right now?” What if there is suddenly a huge opportunity in airship technology? Or underground construction? Or wormholes? It wouldn’t be too much of a problem but this list can only be changed <em>every four years</em>.  You could make the argument that these definitions are so broad that anything could fit in them - ok, then what’s the point of having the list in the first place?</p>

<p>The bill is heavy on bureaucratic requirements and light on science or organizational structure (“we’ll figure that out later.”)  Which reports need to be given to whom and when, how money can and can’t be spent, etc. I agree that this is the job of lawmakers, but it doesn’t feel like opening up an endless frontier, it feels like “here are the walls of your sandbox.”</p>

<p>We are very clear that the grant awards are going to happen on a competitive basis. The bill is shot through with the term <code>award grants, on a competitive basis</code> . This is code for “to get this money, amazing scientist, are going to need to spend a good chunk of your life writing grants” and interacting with websites that look like <a href="https://www.research.gov/research-web/">this.</a> or <a href="https://www.grants.gov/">this</a>.  Competition is good <em>when the output is valuable no matter who wins.</em> Failed grants are basically worthless except as the basis for other grant applications. Economist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=XwBP_pqkGJA">Mike Munger does a great job explaining how grants can often end up burning more value than they create</a>.  Months of grant writing is one of the things that makes people think twice about academia.</p>

<p>The bill specifies exactly what the money can be used for <code>may be used for the purchase of equipment, the support of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and the salaries of staff. </code> Like the key areas, this sounds eminently reasonable. However, it means that grant money, unlike normal money, is not fully fungible. You need to track all of it and where it goes in case you are audited. It also means that if the project runs into an expense that doesn’t fall into one of these buckets - say you need a specialized service from a company to do an experiment - you’re stuck. Chilling effects are hard to measure, but my research experience has been shot through with being forced to pay more for an inferior product through a web portal that made your eyes bleed because we had to prioritize “approved vendors” for accounting reasons tied to restrictions like these.</p>

<p>I don’t think it matters for this discussion but <code>$20B/year</code> is misleading - the actual bill specifies that the $100B will be backloaded: $2B in 2021, $8B in 2022, $20B in 2023, and $35B in 2024 and 2025.</p>

<h3 id="nstf">NS(T?)F</h3>
<p><code>“I share your feeling about this point,” I said with the fervor of conviction, “but then why not do something about the retardation of scientific progress?”</code></p>

<p><code>“That I would very much like to do,” Mark Gable said, “but how do I go about it?”</code></p>

<p><code>“Well,” I said, “I think that shouldn’t be very difficult. As a matter of fact, I think it would be quite easy. You could set up a foundation, with an annual endowment of thirty million dollars. Research workers in need of funds could apply for grants, if they could make out a convincing case. Have ten committees, each composed of twelve scientists, appointed to pass on these applications. Take the most active scientists out of the laboratory and make them members of these committees. And the very best men in the field should be appointed as chairmen at salaries of fifty thousand dollars each. Also have about twenty prizes of one hundred thousand dollars each for the best scientific papers of the year. This is just about all you would have to do. Your lawyers could easily prepare a charter for the foundation. As a matter of fact, any of the National Science Foundation bills which were introduced in the Seventy-ninth and Eightieth Congresses could perfectly well serve as a model.”</code></p>

<p><code>“I think you had better explain to Mr. Gable why this foundation would in fact retard the progress of science,” said a bespectacled young man sitting at the far end of the table, whose name I didn’t get at the time of introduction. It should be obvious,” I said. “First of all, the best scientists would be removed from their laboratories and kept busy on committees passing on applications for funds. Secondly, the scientific workers in need of funds would concentrate on problems which were considered promising and were pretty certain to lead to publishable results. For a few years there might be a great increase in scientific output; but by going after the obvious, pretty soon science would dry out. Science would become something like a parlor game. Some things would be considered interesting, others not. There would be fashions. Those who followed the fashion would get grants. Those who wouldn’t would not, and pretty soon they would learn to follow the fashion, too.”</code>
From <a href="https://judgestarling.tumblr.com/post/619829573132107776/a-short-story-by-martian-physicist-le%C3%B3-szil%C3%A1rd">The Marla Gable Foundation</a> by Nobel Prize winning Physicist Leo Szilard, published in 1948.</p>

<p>The core idea of the bill is to increase the National Science Foundation’s funding and expand its mandate to include technology development as well as science.</p>

<p>Roughly, the National Science Foundation - NSF (and the NIH) decide what to work on by getting some of the ‘top people’ in a field together in a room and asking them “what programs should we pursue?” This process depends first on being able to identify the top people in a field and convincing them to stay in a shitty hotel in Washington. So the agenda is being set by ‘the top people in a field who are willing to come to Washington and stay in a shitty hotel.’ Additionally, who entails the ‘top people’ is up to the program officers and since professors have long term relationships with their NSF program officers, chances are that the professors who have put the work into those relationships are going to be the most salient.</p>

<p>All the incentives are set up so people probably push for their lines of research. Even if they are being completely intellectually honest, researchers probably think that their area of research is the most important thing to fund. If they are slightly less intellectually honest, they realize that they’re more likely to be funded if their priorities line up with the NSF’s.</p>

<p>The process is inherently conservative because if you’re consulting the top people in a field on what to fund, the chances they’ll suggest the weird new thing are low.</p>

<h4 id="but-will-be-like-darpa">But will be like DARPA!</h4>

<p>DARPA has a great track record of enabling paradigm shifting technology - it had its fingers in the creation of personal computing, the internet, modern robotics, gps, and autonomous cars, to name a few. Riffing on DARPA’s model to emulate its success is a worthy goal. However, there is only one section in the entire bill that gives a head nod to the DARPA model:</p>

<p><code>The Director shall have the authority to carry out a program of personnel management authority for the Directorate in the same manner, and subject to the same requirements, as the program of personnel management authority authorized for the Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under section 1599h of title 10, United States Code, for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.</code>
<code>(B) PROGRAM MANAGERS.—The employees of the Directorate may include program managers for the key technology focus areas, who shall perform a role similar to programs managers employed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for the oversight and selection of programs supported by the Directorate. </code></p>

<p>DARPA’s program managers work because they are embedded in an organizational structure and culture that is tuned to empower them to explore high-risk opportunities. DARPA has ~125 staff and three layers of hierarchy while the NSF …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

        <p>Almost half a year after releasing <a href="https://nico.dorfbrunnen.eu/posts/2020/briar-alpha/">the first alpha release of Briar GTK</a>, today marks the day of its first beta release. Much has happened in the meantime and many people, including me, were able to test Briar GTK and use it in regular occasions. Let’s have a look at how this first beta release looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://nico.dorfbrunnen.eu/images/posts/2020/briar-beta/briar-gtk-screenshot-1.png"><img src="https://nico.dorfbrunnen.eu/images/posts/2020/briar-beta/briar-gtk-screenshot-1.png" alt="Briar GTK in conversation view with two contacts on the left in list and an option to delete the contact"></a></p>
<p>For those not knowing, <a href="https://briar.app/">Briar</a> is a messaging system that keeps information flowing all the time. Whether your internet connection has been cut due to natural disasters or because of governmental censorship, Briar will try its best to get your messages out there to your peers.</p>
<p>As you might already anticipate from the screenshot, it’s now much clearer which messages belong to which author. Additionally, on the left side you can see that Alice is online while Bob is offline. Support for this has landed in earlier alpha releases already. Another huge improvements to Briar’s UX is that you’re now able to copy content from messages. Beside being fully translated to German and Spanish and allowing to delete contacts, this beta release of Briar GTK also offers basic notification support. However, it depends on your desktop environment whether this will work for you.</p>
<p>Note that Briar GTK currently only supports private chats. Support for private groups and forums isn’t yet available in the <a href="https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar/-/tree/master/briar-headless">Briar Headless API</a> and therefore those features can’t be used in Briar GTK.</p>
<p>Updating to the new version is as easy as calling <code>flatpak update</code> or installing the new .deb files. If you’re new to Briar GTK, you might want to look at its <a href="https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar-gtk/-/blob/main/README.md#installation">installation instructions</a> to learn how to install it.</p>

Here are some highlights.</p><h2>Powerful chaos support</h2><p><a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> originated in the testing framework of <a href="https://pingcap.com/products/tidb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiDB</a>, a distributed database, so it takes into account the possible faults of a distributed system. Chaos Mesh provides comprehensive and fine-grained fault types, covering the Pod, the network, system I/O, and the kernel. Chaos experiments are defined in YAML, which is fast and easy to use.</p><p>Chaos Mesh 1.0 supports the following fault types:</p><ul><li>clock-skew: Simulates clock skew</li><li>container-kill: Simulates the container being killed</li><li>cpu-burn: Simulates CPU pressure</li><li>io-attribution-override: Simulates file exceptions</li><li>io-fault: Simulates file system I/O errors</li><li>io-latency: Simulates file system I/O latency</li><li>kernel-injection: Simulates kernel failures</li><li>memory-burn: Simulates memory pressure</li><li>network-corrupt: Simulates network packet corruption</li><li>network-duplication: Simulates network packet duplication</li><li>network-latency: Simulate network latency</li><li>network-loss: Simulates network loss</li><li>network-partition: Simulates network partition</li><li>pod-failure: Simulates continuous unavailability of Kubernetes Pods</li><li>pod-kill: Simulates the Kubernetes Pod being killed</li></ul><h2>Visual chaos orchestration</h2><p>The Chaos Dashboard component is a one-stop web interface for Chaos Mesh users to orchestrate chaos experiments. Previously, Chaos Dashboard was only available for testing TiDB. With Chaos Mesh 1.0, it is available to everyone. Chaos Dashboard greatly simplifies the complexity of chaos experiments. With only a few mouse clicks, you can define the scope of the chaos experiment, specify the type of chaos injection, define scheduling rules, and observe the results of the chaos experiment—all in the same web interface.</p><p><img alt="Chaos Dashboard" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-dashboard-0a1e48c54968d276f174801a1364ce21.gif"></p><h2>Grafana plug-in for enhanced observability</h2><p>To further improve the observability of chaos experiments, Chaos Mesh 1.0 includes a Grafana plug-in to allow you to directly display real-time chaos experiment information on your application monitoring panel. Currently, the chaos experiment information is displayed as annotations. This way, you can simultaneously observe the running status of the application and the current chaos experiment information.</p><p><img alt="Chaos status and application status on Grafana" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-status-460b054f3e2ee0898d2236a5137bc30e.png"></p><h2>Safe and controllable chaos</h2><p>When we conduct chaos experiments, it is vital that we keep strict control over the chaos scope or “blast radius.” Chaos Mesh 1.0 not only provides a wealth of selectors to accurately control the scope of the experiment, but it also enables you to set protected Namespaces to protect important applications. You can also use Namespace permissions to limit the scope of Chaos Mesh to a specific Namespace. Together, these features make chaos experiments with Chaos Mesh safe and controllable.</p><h2>Try it out now</h2><p>You can quickly deploy Chaos Mesh in your Kubernetes environment through the <code>install.sh</code> script or the Helm tool. For specific installation steps, please refer to the <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/installation/installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh Getting Started</a> document. In addition, thanks to the <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/interactiveTutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katakoda interactive tutorial</a>, you can also quickly get your hands on Chaos Mesh without having to deploy it.</p><p>If you haven’t upgraded to 1.0 GA, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v1.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.0 Release Notes</a> for the changes and upgrade guidelines.</p><h2>Thanks</h2><p>Thanks to all our Chaos Mesh <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributors</a>!</p><p>If you are interested in Chaos Mesh, you’re welcome to join us by submitting issues, or contributing code, documentation, or articles. We look forward to your participation and feedback!</p></section></div>]]>

Its terrible, and I'd hate to experience what the Kucoin owners would have felt seeing such a large volume go into the ether, but for us cryptocurrency users <a href="https://blockonomi.com/mt-gox-hack/">we've all seen this before</a>.</p><p>The typical security recommendations for holding cryptocurrencies tend to fall on deaf ears, as our human perception for risk management is pretty awful. Especially when you add the time factor on top - with enough time using a cryptocurrency exchange, the more complacent we become with the security of the system. This hack shows just how crucial it is to make sure you take the extra step to hold <em>outside</em> of exchanges, not in them, regardless of how much you trust them.</p><p>The power of cryptocurrency should always remain with the individual - that's why cryptocurrency exists in the first place. There's no need to hand give any power to 3rd parties, except if you need to make specific transactions like selling bitcoin for fiat currency (and even that might be a short-lived requirement with the fast-growing DeFi world).</p><p>We built <a href="https://signata.net/">Signata</a> to keep the power to yourself, the user. Signata is zero-knowledge when it comes to your cryptocurrency keys - we know we can't provide a guarantee that our service will never be compromised, so we've instead left the control to you. the user. Only you see your private keys, and only you control your crypto assets. We intentionally <strong>do not want to see your private keys </strong>- all that would ultimately achieve is putting a huge target on us.</p><p>Whilst I'm obligated to sell the product I've built to you on this blog, you still don't even need a service like Signata to keep yourself decentralised - <a href="https://signata.net/">Signata</a> is effectively a simplification of the paper wallet process with the ease-of-use of YubiKeys, but you can totally make <a href="https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/">paper</a> <a href="https://generatepaperwallet.com/ethereum/index.html">wallets</a> yourself, or use offline wallet software, transfer your assets to those, and then move them back into exchanges when you want to (assuming the exchanges will support importing private keys). Just make sure you take the additional steps on top to <em>back up</em> your wallets, otherwise something like a house fire or a failed hard drive could render you totally coinless.</p><blockquote>Note: those paper wallet links above are <strong>not endorsements </strong>of those services - do your own research into creating a paper wallet if you wish to do so, as you need to make sure the website you are using is not taking a copy of the keys that are generated.</blockquote><p>It's up to you as a cryptocurrency user on how much effort you want to take to protect your own assets, but at the very least I impore you to take action to move currency out of the control of exchanges. By all means keep <em>using </em>exchanges - there's no reason not to - but don't <em>hold </em>in exchanges. Hold in services that let you keep ownership of your assets, like <a href="https://signata.net/">Signata</a>.</p>

  <p><img src="https://www.matteomalvica.com/img/2020-17382/portal.jpg" alt="spider"></p><h2 id="preamble-why-are-drivers-still-a-valuable-target">Preamble - Why are drivers still a valuable target?</h2>

<p>Kernels are, no euphemism intended, complex piece of software and the Windows OS is no exception. Being one of the toughest to scrutinize due to its lack of source code and undocumented APIs, it is now being more documented thanks to the immense effort from the research community. Regrettably, during recent times, it has also increased in complexity and its mitigation way improved.
So why attacking drivers? Besides the ones shipped by Microsoft, third-party drivers are the only and more accessible means for third parties to get code execution into ring 0.
Starting from Windows 1607 Anniversary Update, only signed drivers through <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/windows-driver-signing-tutorial" target="_blank">WHQL</a> certification process are now allowed to be loaded and, as a consequence of that, crafting and shipping your own bug door is not <del>possibile</del> straightforward anymore.
More information on the whole driver signing process can be found <a href="http://wrogn.com/tag/driver-signing/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>In this post I would like to cover the “low-hanging fruits”; those hidden and still undiscovered vulnerabilities in signed and trusted production drivers which are, too often than not, widely deployed on consumers and enterprise endpoints.</p>

<p>An exploitable kernel driver vulnerability can lead an unprivileged user to SYSTEM, just because the vulnerable driver is locally available to anyone.
(Well, sometimes the vulnerable driver or kernel component can be owned even remotely - EternalBlue anyone? :)</p>

<p>My goal here is to illustrate a general approach on performing the initial bug analysis through IDA and WinDbg, run a simple fuzzing test and then construct the exploit bottom-up.</p>

<p>The exploit I build is based on <a href="https://www.coresecurity.com/core-labs/advisories/msi-ambient-link-multiple-vulnerabilities" target="_blank">this</a> vulnerability discovered by Lucas Dominikow from CoreSecurity which impacts the MSI Ambient Link driver.
Even though I managed to build a reliable, yet no so elegant, exploit for Windows 7 SP1, our focus we’ll be on Windows 10 only.</p>

<p>These are the two Windows 10 builds I have tested, for both 1709 and 2004 version:</p>

<pre><code>19041.1.amd64fre.vb_release.191206-1406
16299.15.amd64fre.rs3_release.170928-1534
</code></pre>

<p>I have decided not to publish the 2004 version as it’s just almost identical to the 1709 one, apart from the ROP gadgets offsets.
The PoC can be found <a href="https://github.com/uf0o/CVE-2020-17382" target="_blank">on my Github</a></p>

<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-driver">Anatomy of a driver</h2>

<p>In a different words, a driver is nothing but a loadable kernel modules, which means that, unless written to be fully independent, it will require some user land counterpart to interact with.
Before any real funk can commence, the user-mode application has to obtain a valid handle of the driver, which is just a safe way to communicate with ring0.</p>

<h3 id="device-objects">Device Objects</h3>

<p>As we’ll see shortly, the user application calls the <code>CreateFile</code> API to obtain a valid handle.
This function accepts a <em>symbolic link</em> which in our case is a <code>DEVICE_OBJECT</code> element. This <strong>device object</strong> is created by the driver itself as a communication channel available to any user application and, no surprise, it can increase the attack surface if not properly access controlled.</p>

<p>The actual device object is controlled by Windows I/O manager and once a valid request is made, it will return a valid handle to the user-mode application.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.matteomalvica.com/img/2020-17382/handle2.png" alt="handle">
                                                        <em>Obtaining a driver handle</em></p>

<h3 id="driverentry-and-driver-object">DriverEntry and Driver Object</h3>

<p>The <strong>DriverEntry</strong>, which is present in every driver, is the driver’s entry point. This can be seen as the “main” driver function, similar to the classic <em>main</em> of a user mode application.</p>

<p>The first argument accepted by the <code>DriverEntry</code> function is a <code>DRIVER_OBJECT</code>structure.
This structure, created by the kernel and not entirely initialized, is then passed to the DriverEntry routine.
After loading, the driver can fill in the structure with its own functionalities
The second argument, <code>RegistryPath</code>, is a just a pointer to a string in the Registry where we can pass configuration <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/introduction-to-registry-keys-for-drivers" target="_blank">parameters key</a> to the driver.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>NTSTATUS</span> <span>DriverEntry</span><span>(</span><span>_In_</span> <span>PDRIVER_OBJECT</span> <span>DriverObject</span><span>,</span> <span>_In_</span> <span>PUNICODE_STRING</span> <span>RegistryPath</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>From the snippet above we can also notice how the <code>DriverEntry</code> routine is responsible for creating the <code>DeviceObject</code> and the symbolic link, which is ultimately provided to the user application in order to communicate with the driver.
Notice the <code>Io</code> prefix of both the APIs used by the driver, <code>IoCreateDevice</code> and <code>IoCreateSymbolicLink</code>, which indicate membership of the I/O Manager realm.</p>

<h3 id="major-functions">Major Functions</h3>

<p>The functions that needs are required to be initialized by the driver are actually called <strong>Dispatch Routines</strong> which is a function pointers array inside the <em>MajorFunction</em> member of the <code>DRIVER_OBJECT</code> structure.
This array depicts which functions the driver supports; a brief list of the most common ones are listed below (more information <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-major-function-codes" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>

<pre><code>IRP_MJ_CREATE (0)
IRP_MJ_CLOSE (2)
IRP_MJ_READ (3)
IRP_MJ_WRITE (4)
IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL (14) 
IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL (15) 
IRP_MJ_PNP (31)
IRP_MJ_POWER (22)
</code></pre>

<p>We can view each one of these as a kernel mode counterpart of the user mode standard functions.
For example, <code>IRP_MJ_CREATE</code> is the equivalent of <code>CreateFile</code>, <code>IRP_MJ_CLOSE</code> of <code>CloseFile</code> and so on.</p>

<p>For the sake of our exploitation goals, we will now shift our focus to<code>IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL</code> as it’s used as a ‘function dispatcher’ to execute most of the internal driver functionality.
We can notice that each <em>Major Function</em> has a <code>IRP</code> prefix in the name: this is due to the fact that these functions are made for handling different kind of IRPs.
Cool isn’it? but we haven’t mentioned anything about IRP so far, right?</p>

<h3 id="irp-and-ioctls">IRP and IOCTLs</h3>

<p>As we saw earlier, interacting with a driver from user-land code is accomplished though exported DLL functions and the I/O manager, which is the ultimate authority for managing the requests to and from the drivers.
Upon each request, the I/O Manager crafts an I/O request packer (<strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_irp" target="_blank">IRP</a></strong>) that is an <em>opaque</em> structure partially documented on MSDN.
The driver will retrieve the IRP packet addressed to itself, and send it back to the IoManager once done with the routine.</p>

<p>As we saw earlier, once the user mode application obtains a valid driver handle it can start interacting with the driver by sending IRPs, which ultimately contains an IOCTL code that will call a specific driver routine.
The whole process can be simplified as follows:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.matteomalvica.com/img/2020-17382/flow.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Now that we have built some knowledge on driver internals, let’s try to dissect a vulnerable driver and see if we can weaponize it by leveraging a full exploit.</p>

<h2 id="msio64-sys-under-the-microscope">MSIO64.sys under the microscope</h2>

<p>Wearing our new toolbelt we can draw a general approach on what to look for when searching for vulnerabilities in drivers. The following are some points I recommend to check when dealing with them:</p>

<ul>
<li>Driver allows low-privileged users to directly interact with it.</li>
<li>Either <code>MmMapIoSpace</code> or <code>ZwMapViewOfSection</code> are present in the Import Address Table (IAT).</li>
<li>It has some customized <code>memmove</code> or well-known unsafe function</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: this is just a very basic starting point which can be surely expanded above and beyond.</em></p>

<p>To verify the first bullet we should check the driver’s discretionary access control list (DACL) we can use this very handy tool called <a href="https://www.osronline.com/article.cfm%5Earticle=97.htm" target="_blank">DeviceTree</a> from OSR.</p>

<p>We just need to search for the correct symbolic link and inspect the <code>DEV</code> tab nested under the <code>DRV</code> one.
From there we have to pop up the <code>Security Attributes</code> window, and check what kind of privileges has the <code>Everyone</code> group.
Good news here: the <code>MsIo</code> device object allows any kind of access between itself and any kind of user, meaning that the driver can be accessed even from a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/mandatory-integrity-contro" target="_blank">low integrity</a> process.
That’s a very good premise to begin with.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.matteomalvica.com/img/2020-17382/DACL.png" alt="DACL"></p>

<p>I would like to talk about the two critical functions <code>MmMapIoSpace</code> and <code>ZwMapViewOfSection</code>on another occasion, since they are not present in our target driver.
For now, it will suffice to say that they can be used to map kernel memory into a user’s process (and yeah, that can be utterly dangerous)</p>

<p>Next, any function that deals with user mode buffer has to perform bounds checking or else we will incur in a classic buffer overflow, which is the exact same bug that affects <code>MSIO64.sys</code></p>

<h2 id="reversing-and-debugging-the-driver">Reversing and debugging the driver</h2>

<p>Let’s pretend we have no clue about what the advisory is stating, except that we are dealing with a vanilla buffer overflow that will be triggered at some point, after a specific function matches a given IOCTL code.</p>

<p>Before jumping to IOCTLs hunting, we should start analyzing the driver from its very beginning, or in other words the <code>DriverEntry</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.matteomalvica.com/img/2020-17382/driverentry1.png" alt="driverentry1"></p>

<p>We immediately notice that this preliminary function it just a stub that points to the <code>RealDriverEntry</code> which I renamed aptly.
Let’s jump to that one:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.matteomalvica.com/img/2020-17382/1.%20IDA%20symbolic%20link%20driver%20string.png" alt="1. IDA symbolic link driver string"></p>

<p>From within <code>RealDriverEntry</code> we can grab the correct symbolic link string, which in our case is <code>\\\Device\\MsIo</code> and note it down. We can also take note of the fifth line where rdi‘s offset is pointing to the <code>DriverObject</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.matteomalvica.com/img/2020-17382/ida1.png" alt="ida1">
Moving on the next code block, we see that the address of the main function handler <code>sub_113F0</code> is copied into <code>rax</code> which is then referenced by <code>rdi/DriverObject</code> multiple times at different offsets, such as <code>0x68,0x70,0x80,0xE0</code>.
We can get the exact reference by verifying these offsets against the <code>DRIVER OBJECT</code> symbol in WinDBG</p>

<pre><code>0: kd&gt; dt _DRIVER_OBJECT
nt!_DRIVER_OBJECT
...
   +0x068 DriverUnload     : Ptr64     void 
   +0x070 MajorFunction    : [28] Ptr64     long 
</code></pre>

<p>We can already guess that the missing <code>0x80</code> and <code>0xE0</code> values are offsets within the <code>MajorFunction</code> routine itself, along with <code>0x70</code> which will be the first argument.
With <code>0x80</code> being 16 bytes away from the first argument we can then …</p></div></div>

    <div itemprop="articleBody" id="markdown">
      
      <p>In a <a href="https://youtu.be/rIQHws2_lQg">recent lang team meeting</a> we discussed
the upcoming
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures-core/0.3.5/futures_core/stream/trait.Stream.html"><code>Stream</code></a>
RFC. We covered both the steps required to land it, and the steps we'd want
to take after that. One of the things we'd want eventually for streams is:
"async iteration syntax". Just like <code>for x in y</code> works for <code>Iterator</code>, we'd
want something similar to work for <code>Stream</code>. For example JavaScript support
both
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of">sync</a>
and
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of">async</a>
iteration through <code>for..of</code> loops:</p>
<pre><span>// sync
</span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>num </span><span>of </span><span>iter</span><span>) {
  console.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>);
}

</span><span>// async
</span><span>for await </span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>event </span><span>of </span><span>emitter</span><span>) {
    console.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>);
}
</span></pre>
<p>However when talking about async iteration syntax in Rust one question has
come up repeatedly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Should async iteration be parallel or sequential by default?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this post I'd like to cover the challenges I see with parallel async
iteration, and make the case for, spoilers, defaulting to sequential
iteration semantics.</p>
<hr>
<p>However before we continue, the usual disclaimers: <strong>I'm not on the lang
team. I do not hold any direct decision making power about the Rust language.
I am a member of the Async Foundations WG, but I do not speak for anyone on
the team other than myself.</strong> This post is from my perspective only.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-space">The problem space</h2>
<p>So the core question we're trying to answer is: "should async iteration
default to sequential or parallel?" Putting this into code, it's a question
of what some hypothetical future "async iteration" syntax should compile down
to, and which semantics are provided:</p>
<pre><span>// This code...
</span><span>for</span><span> event.await in channel {
    dbg!(event);
}

</span><span>// ... should it lower into this? (sequential)
</span><span>while let </span><span>Some(event) = channel.</span><span>next</span><span>().await {
    dbg!(event);
}

</span><span>// ... or should it lower into this? (parallel)
</span><span>channel.</span><span>into_par_stream</span><span>().</span><span>for_each</span><span>(async |event| dbg!(event));
</span></pre>
<p>The "lowering" we're describing here is not the <em>precise</em> code we'd expect
the compiler to output. But hopefully it gets the point across. In the
"sequential" case we'd expect async iteration loops to behave much the same
as async <code>while let Some()</code> loops do today. And in the parallel case, we'd
expect something to work with semantics similar to those of
<a href="https://docs.rs/parallel-stream/2.1.1/parallel_stream/">parallel-stream</a>.</p>
<p>The main argument I've heard in favor of parallel async iteration semantics
is that in most cases it's what people want anyway. For example take the
following code:</p>
<pre><span>use </span><span>async_std::io;
</span><span>use </span><span>async_std::net::TcpListener;
</span><span>use </span><span>async_std::prelude::*;

</span><span>let</span><span> listener = TcpListener::bind("</span><span>127.0.0.1:8080</span><span>").await?;

</span><span>for</span><span> stream.await? in listener.</span><span>incoming</span><span>() {
    io::copy(&amp;stream, &amp;stream).await?;
}
</span></pre>
<p>Under sequential iteration semantics this loop would process at most 1 TCP
connection at the time, irregardless of system resources available. But under
parallel iteration semantics, this will have access to all resources
available. The idea is that parallel iteration semantics provide a language
level solution to this problem.</p>
<h2 id="control-flow-operators">Control flow operators</h2>
<p>The first issue that arises with parallel async iteration is that the <code>break</code>
and <code>continue</code> control flow operators will have different semantics, or need
to be disallowed altogether. Take the following code:</p>
<pre><span>use </span><span>async_std::io;
</span><span>use </span><span>async_std::net::TcpListener;
</span><span>use </span><span>async_std::prelude::*;

</span><span>let</span><span> listener = TcpListener::bind("</span><span>127.0.0.1:8080</span><span>").await?;

</span><span>// Let's pretend this is valid syntax..
</span><span>for </span><span>(i, stream?).await in listener.</span><span>incoming</span><span>().</span><span>enumerate</span><span>() {
    </span><span>if</span><span> i === </span><span>1000 </span><span>{
        </span><span>break</span><span>;
    }
    io::copy(&amp;stream, &amp;stream).await?;
}
</span></pre>
<p>Say we have a few dozen parallel requests open when we hit <code>break</code>. We should
probably stop accepting new requests. What should happen to the still open
connections?</p>
<p>There is no right answer. We may want to drop them. We may want to keep them
running. More likely the desired behavior may depend on what you're doing.
But the semantics will <em>always</em> be different than in regular for loops
<em>because</em> of parallelism.</p>
<p>Adding new semantics to a well-established concept is tricky, and may
actually lead to subtle translation issues when converting existing
algorithms to async Rust. The safest option will be to disallow these
keywords in this context altogether.</p>
<h2 id="consistency-with-non-async-rust">Consistency with non-async Rust</h2>
<p>We may want to think of "parallel iteration semantics" as something unique to
async Rust, but in fact non-async Rust faces very similar challenges. To
give a very literal example, the TCP example we used earlier would not be
parallelized in non-async Rust as well:</p>
<pre><span>use </span><span>std::io;
</span><span>use </span><span>std::net::TcpListener;

</span><span>let</span><span> listener = TcpListener::bind("</span><span>127.0.0.1:8080</span><span>").await?;

</span><span>for</span><span> stream in listener.</span><span>incoming</span><span>() {
    </span><span>let</span><span> stream = stream?;
    </span><span>let </span><span>(reader, writer) = &amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>(&amp;stream, &amp;stream);
    io::copy(reader, writer)?;
}
</span></pre>
<p>Networking in non-async Rust is not the best match, but for example a data
processing pipeline would be. And if we forget to parallelize at the right
points there, we'll face very similar issues.</p>
<p>The point being: I don't think "parallelism" is a problem unique to async
Rust. And because of that I don't think we should look for a solution that's
specific to async Rust, but instead look for a solution that can be applied
across domains. I think <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2930">RFC
2930 (<code>buf_read</code>)</a> is a great example of an
issue that was found in async Rust, but was determined to apply to non-async
Rust as well, and for which a solution was found that can be applied to both
domains.</p>
<h2 id="how-would-tasks-be-spawned">How would tasks be spawned?</h2>
<p>In order for tasks to be parallelized, they would need to be spawned on a
thread pool somehow. Which means a crucial step in enabling parallel
iteration at the language level is to have a notion of an executor as part of
the language.</p>
<p>C++ is <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0761r2.pdf">in the process of
adding</a>
to the language (estimate is C++23), so it's not unthinkable for Rust to do
the same. In fact Boats <a href="https://without.boats/blog/global-executors/">has written about adding a <code>#[global_executor]</code>
before</a>.</p>
<pre><span>// The lowered code from the previous example...
</span><span>channel.</span><span>into_par_stream</span><span>().</span><span>for_each</span><span>(async |event| dbg!(event));

</span><span>// ... would in turn lower into this
</span><span>while let </span><span>Some(event) = channel.</span><span>next</span><span>() {
    task::spawn(async </span><span>move </span><span>{
        dbg!(event);
    });
}
</span></pre>
<p>As you can see we're calling <code>task::spawn</code> for each event. That functionality
would need to come from somewhere, and because async iteration is a language
level concern this would mean that functionality would need to become part of
the language.</p>
<p>I think having a way to perform parallel iteration at the language level is a
<em>great</em> idea. And having a <code>#[global_executor]</code> hook with a default
implementation would solve a lot of issues the ecosystem currently has.</p>
<p>But if history is any indicator this would all take quite a while to shake
out. And I think making async iteration syntax depend on this landing (even
if unstable) would mean it might take a lot longer.</p>
<h2 id="parallelizing-send-streams">Parallelizing !Send streams</h2>
<p>Not all streams are <code>Send</code>, and async iteration should be able to work with
this as well. We can't <em>quite</em> propagate <code>!Send</code> the way we do for async
blocks; the global executor would need to support spawning <code>!Send</code> futures as
well. This is not a major hurdle as for example async-stc provides
<a href="https://docs.rs/async-std/1.6.3/async_std/task/fn.spawn_local.html"><code>spawn_local</code></a>
function. But it's part of the design space to consider.</p>
<h2 id="backpressure-concurency-control">Backpressure &amp; concurency control</h2>
<p>For all its warts something that Node.js streams got right was
<em>backpressure</em>. If for example writing to a file is slower than reading from
a file, the pipeline won't keep reading data if the writer isn't available.
This ensures your RAM doesn't fill up with bytes that are waiting to be written.</p>
<pre><span>const </span><span>fs = </span><span>require</span><span>('</span><span>fs</span><span>');

</span><span>const </span><span>reader </span><span>= fs.</span><span>createReadStream</span><span>('</span><span>file.txt</span><span>');
</span><span>const </span><span>compress </span><span>= zlib.</span><span>createGzip</span><span>();
</span><span>const </span><span>writer </span><span>= fs.</span><span>createWriteStream</span><span>('</span><span>file.txt.gz</span><span>');

</span><span>reader</span><span>.</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>compress</span><span>).</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>writer</span><span>);
</span></pre>
<p>In Rust sequential async iteration applies backpressure by default. A
translation of the above Node.js code would be somewhat like this:</p>
<pre><span>let</span><span> reader = fs::open("</span><span>file.txt</span><span>").await?;
</span><span>let</span><span> writer = fs::open("</span><span>file.txt.gz</span><span>").await?;

</span><span>for</span><span> buf in GzipEncoder::new(reader) {
    writer.</span><span>write</span><span>(buf).await?;
}
</span></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.rs/async-compression/0.3.5/async_compression/stream/struct.GzipEncoder.html#impl-Stream"><code>async-compression</code>'s <code>Stream</code>
types</a>
already work somewhat like this. Because we're performing sequential async
iteration here, reading data from the stream is constrained by the speed at
which we can write. But also vice-versa: the stream is paused if no new data
is available to be read.</p>
<p>If async iteration syntax was parallel by default we would lose backpressure
by default. Which means if no constraints are specified, <strong>by default
parallel async iteration will keep reading data even if there is no consumer
ready to process the data</strong>. Instead limits will always need to be manually
set:</p>
<pre><span>for</span><span> buf in GzipEncoder::new(reader).</span><span>limit</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>) {
    writer.</span><span>write</span><span>(buf).await?;
}
</span></pre>
<p>There is a third solution to backpressure we haven't discussed yet: set
<em>some</em> limit by default. Instead of async iteration having unbounded
parallelism by default, we could say, enable <code>1000</code> items by default. This
limit will however almost always be wrong, and really should be set with
knowledge of the workload.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>name</th><th>max throughput</th><th>backpressure?</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>sequential</td><td>1</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>bounded</td><td>n</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>unbounded</td><td>unlimited</td><td>no</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2 id="how-common-is-parallel-iteration">How common is parallel iteration?</h2>
<p>A large part of the argument in favor of parallel semantics by default for
async iteration is that it is the most commonly desired semantics. Perhaps
that may be true today within certain domains; but how true do we expect that
to be in the future for across all domains async Rust will cover?</p>
<p>If we want to get a sense of where async Rust might be headed we can take a
look at Node.js streams: they've been around for a decade longer than Rust
streams have. A common kind of stream in the Node.js ecosystem is the
<a href="https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_transform">transform
stream</a>: a
stream that takes an input stream and produces an output stream. Take for
example the <a href="https://github.com/mafintosh/csv-parser">csv-parser package</a>: it
takes a stream of CSV text, and produces an output stream of parsed elements:</p>
<pre><span>NAME,AGE
Daffy Duck,24
Bugs Bunny,22
</span></pre><pre><span>const </span><span>csv </span><span>= </span><span>require</span><span>('</span><span>csv-parser</span><span>')
</span><span>const </span><span>fs = </span><span>require</span><span>('</span><span>fs</span><span>')
</span><span>const </span><span>results </span><span>= [];

fs.</span><span>createReadStream</span><span>('</span><span>data.csv</span><span>')
  .</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>csv</span><span>())
  .</span><span>on</span><span>('</span><span>data</span><span>', (data) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>))
  .</span><span>on</span><span>('</span><span>end</span><span>', () </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
    console.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>results</span><span>);
    </span><span>// [
    //   { NAME: 'Daffy Duck', AGE: '24' },
    //   { NAME: 'Bugs Bunny', AGE: '22' }

through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.

It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!

In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond

The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network

one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.

The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been using Arch Linux since 2016. I got to understand the system better
since then, and installing Arch nowadays is rather a strain on my fingers than
on my brain. I automated my personal setup procedure to some extent with a
couple of shell scripts, which I'm adjusting as time goes and hardware changes.
I collect those scripts and setup instructions in a <a href="https://github.com/patrickbucher/docs/tree/master/arch-setup">GitHub
repo</a>.</p>
<p>Even though I've often taken my laptop with me, especially for
university, I never made the effort to encrypt my disk or a single partition
thereon. Sensitive data, such as passwords, are stored encrypted using GPG. And
my GPG private key is protected with a strong passphrase; so strong, that I
mistype it once in a while.</p>
<p>Having stored SSH keys on my laptop, however, is a risk in terms of data
protection. I do not protect most of my SSH keys with passwords. (<em>Not</em> having
to use passwords is one of the conveniences SSH gives you, after all.) But some
of those SSH keys are gateways to quite some important data, and therefore I
need to re-consider my security practices.</p>
<p>Protecting SSH keys with a passphrase is very inconvenient, especially if you do
a lot of <code>git push</code> operations via SSH. It's possible to use a password
protected SSH key for <code>git</code> only, but having to deal with multiple SSH keys is
inconvenient, too. (My rule is to use one SSH key per client machine.) So
encrypting the hard disk or at least some partitions of it might be the better
solution, because it only requires me to enter an additional password once
during startup, which is once or twice a day.</p>

<p>The Arch wiki provides an article on <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system">how to encrypt an entire
system</a>.
Such a setup is based on LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup), a disk encryption
specification, and dm-crypt, the Linux kernel's device mapper for encrypted
devices.</p>
<p>The wiki mentions different
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Overview">scenarios</a>
for disk encryption. The first option, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LUKS_on_a_partition">LUKS on a
partition</a>,
is very simple, but not ideal for me, because I'm not just using one giant root
partition, but separate partitions for <code>/var</code>, <code>/tmp</code> and <code>/home</code>. With this
setup, a process filling up my <code>/var/log</code> directory won't prevent me from
writing to <code>/home</code> or the root partition, which might be necessary to deal with
the issue.</p>
<p>One could argue that it's sufficient to just encrypt the <code>/home</code> partition,
which contains the most sensitive data, after all. However, it's possible that
some program logs sensitive data to <code>/var/log</code> or stores it under <code>/opt</code>, so
that an encrypted <code>/home</code> partition won't prevent sensitive data from being
leaked. An unencrypted root partition also makes it possible to tamper
programs, so that data is leaked later.</p>
<p>It's also possible to encrypt the partitions mentioned seperately, which would
require me to enter my password upon booting for every single partition. This is
highly impractical, and therefore I won't do it that way.</p>
<p>The second option, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LVM_on_LUKS">LVM on
LUKS</a>,
is a better fit for my purpose. Here, LUKS provides one single block device, on
top of which the encrypted partitions are created. The other, arguably more
sophisticated scenarios, are mostly useful when dealing with multiple disks, or
if an encrypted boot partition is required. So let's stick to scenario two: LVM
on LUKS.</p>

<p>My Lenovo Thinkpad X1 has a SSD with roughly 475 GB and 16 GB memory. This is
important when considering partition sizes. I usually create my partitions as
follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>A 256 MB <code>/boot</code> partition for the bootloader (FAT 32).</li>
<li>A 16 GB (the size of my memory) swap partition.</li>
<li>A 128 GB <code>/</code> (root) partition (ext4).</li>
<li>A 64 GB <code>/var</code> partition (ext4).</li>
<li>A 8 GB <code>/tmp</code> partition (ext4).</li>
<li>And a <code>/home</code> partition with the remainder of the space, i.e. roughly 260 GB
   in my case (ext4).</li>
</ol>
<p>The choice of partition sizes is subject to debate. Some prefer to have a swap
partition with twice the size of the physical memory. Some prefer to make the
root, <code>/var/</code>, and <code>/tmp</code> partitions smaller or bigger. But the above
partitioning scheme was never the cause of any trouble for me, so far.</p>
<p>With those decisions taken, let's proceed to the setup.</p>

<p>So let's go through the setup step by step.</p>
<h2>Prepare the Installation Medium</h2>
<p>First, I download the latest Arch amd64 image via BitTorrent <a href="magnet:?xt=urn:btih:db56a13a6555179990837759ca27274d0be49aca&amp;dn=archlinux-2020.09.01-x86_64.iso">Magnet
link</a>
from the <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/download/">download</a> page and verify its
checksum against the one on the website:</p>
<pre><code>$ sha1sum archlinux-2020.09.01-x86_64.iso
95ebacd83098b190e8f30cc28d8c57af0d0088a0
</code></pre>
<p>Then I copy the image on a USB dongle with a capacity of at least 700 MB:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo dd if=archlinux-2020.09.01-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sda bs=4M
$ sync
</code></pre>
<p>Then I unplug my USB dongle and plug it into the Thinkpad X1 I'd like to setup,
and boot from it (UEFI boot). Once the installation environment is loaded, let's
continue with the setup.</p>
<p>My Thinkpad X1 has a US keyboard, which I <a href="https://paedubucher.ch/articles/2020-09-16-compose-key-on-x.html">prefer to
use</a> nowadays.
However, it's possible to change the keyboard layout as follows (for Swiss
German), if wanted:</p>
<pre><code># loadkeys de_CH-latin1
</code></pre>
<p>Next, I establish a WiFi connection with <code>frzbxpdb5</code> being my network SSID, 
<code>wlan0</code> being my WiFi device, and <code>[topsecret]</code> being my password:</p>
<pre><code># iwctl --passphrase '[topsecret]' station wlan0 connect frzbxpdb5
</code></pre>
<p>Let's continue with the partitioning of the disk.</p>
<h2>Partitioning</h2>
<p>In order to partition the hard disk, one first needs to know the device name,
which can be found using <code>lsblk</code>:</p>
<pre><code># lsblk
</code></pre>
<p>This lists <code>sda</code>, the USB dongle, and <code>nvme0n1</code>, the 475 GB solid state drive
aforementioned.</p>
<h3>Filling the Disk with Junk Data</h3>
<p>As a first step, the disk shall be overwritten with random data.  Even though I
haven't used this laptop productively yet, and so there's no sensitive data
stored on it, it is still a good practice to fill it up once with random data.
This makes it harder for an attacker to distinguish between encrypted data and
random junk.</p>
<pre><code># shred --random-source=/dev/urandom --iterations=1 /dev/nvme0n1
</code></pre>
<p>In my case, using only one single iteration is sufficient. If there was actual
data stored on the disk, multiple iterations should be considered.</p>
<h3>Creating a Boot Partition</h3>
<p>Next, I create a new GPT partition scheme on that disk:</p>
<pre><code># parted -s /dev/nvme0n1 mklabel gpt
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not going to encrypt my boot partition, so I create it as I do for a regular
setup without encryption (as a FAT 32 boot partition, that is):</p>
<pre><code># parted -s /dev/nvme0n1 mkpart boot fat32 1MiB 257MiB
# parted -s /dev/nvme0n1 set 1 esp on
# mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/nvme0n1p1
</code></pre>
<p>I leave a gap of 1 MB at the beginning, so no matter what block size my SSD
uses, the boot partition will always be properly aligned. The <code>esp</code> flag
identifies the partition as a UEFI system partition.</p>
<h3>Creating a Partition for Encryption</h3>
<p>Now comes the crucial part. All the encrypted data is put into a single big
partition (<code>nvmen1p2</code>), taking up all of the remaining disk space, which is then
partitioned using a volume manager:</p>
<pre><code># parted -s /dev/nvme0n1 mkpart cryptlvm 257MiB '100%'
</code></pre>
<p>The encryption is set up on this partition:</p>
<pre><code># cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/nvme0n1p2
</code></pre>
<p>Enter "YES" if asked for confirmation, and pick a strong passphrase to be
entered twice. (At this point, remember exactly which keyboard layout you're
on!).</p>
<p>To further work with the encrypted partition, let's open it, which requires to
enter the password chosen before:</p>
<pre><code># cryptsestup open /dev/nvme0n1p2 cryptlvm
</code></pre>
<p>Now a physical volume for the volume mapping needs to be created:</p>
<pre><code># pvcreate /dev/mapper/cryptlvm
</code></pre>
<p>The partitions are going to be managed in a volume group, which I simply call
<code>volgrp</code> for the sake of brevity:</p>
<pre><code># vgcreate volgrp /dev/mapper/cryptlvm
</code></pre>
<p>Now everything is set up to create the remaining, i.e. the encrypted partitions.</p>
<h3>Creating the Remaining Partitions</h3>
<p>Those are created using <code>lvcreate</code> by setting a size (<code>-L</code>/<code>-l</code> parameter) and a
name (<code>-n</code> parameter):</p>
<pre><code># lvcreate -L 16G volgrp -n swap
# lvcreate -L 128G volgrp -n root
# lvcreate -L 64G volgrp -n var
# lvcreate -L 8G volgrp -n tmp
# lvcreate -l '100%FREE' volgrp -n home
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: As the user <em>fra-san</em> <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/611421/arch-linux-setup-with-encryption-lvm-on-luks">pointed
out</a>
in a comment on StackExchange, leaving some space open rather than using <code>-l
'100%FREE'</code> for the <code>/home</code> partition is useful when partition sizes should be
increased later.  Shrinking partitions requires to unmount them, whereas growing
them can happen with the affected partition still being mounted. (Check out
<code>lvresize</code> for details.)</p>
<p>The partitions are going to be formatted using the <code>swap</code> and <code>ext4</code> format,
respectively:</p>
<pre><code># mkswap /dev/volgrp/swap
# mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/volgrp/root
# mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/volgrp/var
# mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/volgrp/tmp
# mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/volgrp/home
</code></pre>
<p>For the actual setup, those partitions (and the <code>/boot</code> partition created
before) need to be mounted to <code>/mnt</code>:</p>
<pre><code># mount /dev/volgrp/root /mnt

# mkdir /mnt/boot
# mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot

# swapon /dev/volgrp/swap

# mkdir /mnt/var
# mount /dev/volgrp/var /mnt/var

# mkdir /mnt/tmp
# mount /dev/volgrp/tmp /mnt/tmp

# mkdir /mnt/home
# mount /dev/volgrp/home /mnt/home
</code></pre>
<p>Now the partitions are ready for a regular bootstrap installation. (Setting up
the boot loader will require some more specific instructions to disk encryption
later on.)</p>
<h2>Bootstrap Installation</h2>
<p>Now let's install the base system, together with the <code>lvm2</code> package:</p>
<pre><code># pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware lvm2
</code></pre>
<p>In order to get the mounting done automatically upon restart, let's save it in
the <code>fstab</code> file:</p>
<pre><code># genfstab -U /mnt &gt;&gt; /mnt/etc/fstab
</code></pre>
<p>When this is done, let's switch into the installed environment:</p>
<pre><code># arch-chroot /mnt
</code></pre>
<p>A password needs to be set for the <code>root</code> user:</p>
<pre><code># passwd
</code></pre>
<p>In order to have a WiFi connection after rebooting, let's install a couple of
networking packages (some of those specific to my Intel hardware):</p>
<pre><code># pacman -S iw wpa_supplicant dialog intel-ucode netctl dhcpcd
</code></pre>
<p>I set the time zone to Zurich (Europe), update and save the system time:</p>
<pre><code># ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Zurich /etc/localtime
# timedatectl set-ntp true
# hwclock --systohc
</code></pre>
<p>For language and locale, I simply use <code>en_US.UTF-8</code> and <code>en_US-UTF-8 UTF-8</code>,
respectively:</p>
<pre><code># echo 'en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8' &gt;&gt; /etc/locale.gen
# locale-gen
# echo 'LANG=en_US.UTF-8' &gt; /etc/locale.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Due to the lack of imagination, I call my laptop simply <em>carbon</em>:</p>
<pre><code># echo carbon &gt; …</code></pre></div></div>

          <p>GitHub <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2020-08-13-phishing-resistant-sms-autofill/">recently announced</a> it was adopting <a href="https://wicg.github.io/sms-one-time-codes/#origin-bound-one-time-codes">a draft standard for the format of SMS one-time passwords</a> (e.g. two-factor authentication codes) to help thwart phishing attacks.</p>
        </div><div>
          <p><strong>SMS Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Before we get to the details it’s important to note that using SMS for one-time passwords is <strong>less secure</strong> than using a dedicated app such as <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a> as the approach is susceptible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam">SIM-swap attacks</a>. They’re also l<strong>ess convenient</strong> – sometimes the messages take a while to arrive and won’t be received at all if the user is out of mobile phone range or has swapped their SIM card while traveling overseas.</p>
<p>That said, one-time passwords via SMS matter – they’re the most common way to deliver 2FA codes because they work with the technology that users already have. Downloading a dedicated app just to manage 2FA codes is beyond many users.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works</strong></p>
<p>The idea behind the standard is a predefined SMS (text message) format that looks like this:</p>

          <p>The last line <strong>must </strong>match the format above, starting with <code>@</code> and in the format <code> @origin #code</code>.</p>
<p>Devices can then interpret this as an unambiguous one-time password. On your web app, you specify:</p>

        </figure><p>The browser can match the origin of the site <code>(example.com)</code> against the message received, and then autofill this value for the user.</p><div><figure>

          <p>Some mobile browsers already do this (Safari, for instance) but do so via guesswork and without any guarantee that the one-time password (OTP) you just received belongs to the right site. Without the <code>origin</code>, a phishing site could simply implement the <code>autocomplete="one-time-code"</code> on a bogus site to collect the OTP.</p>
<p><strong>Status of the Standard</strong></p>
<p>This is a draft standard published by Apple and Google earlier this year. Support seems to be growing. <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2020-08-13-phishing-resistant-sms-autofill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub adopted it</a> earlier this month.&nbsp;Draft standards can and do change, so make sure to do an up-to-date assessment before you attempt to implement it. (And, if you haven’t already, consider using an identity provider to handle this concern for you. Designing and building secure authentication is hard to do well and often not what differentiates your app.)</p>

  <p>I show how two domain-specific type systems, information flow control and two-party communication protocols, can be implemented in Rust using type-level programming. I explain how interesting properties of these domains can be verified at compile-time. Finally, I construct a general correspondence between type operators, logic programs, and their encoding in Rust.</p>
  <p>Typestate is the concept of encoding state machines in a programming language’s type system. While not specific to Rust, typestate has been <a href="http://cs242.stanford.edu/f19/lectures/08-2-typestate">explored</a> <a href="https://yoric.github.io/post/rust-typestate/">elsewhere</a> <a href="https://blog.systems.ethz.ch/blog/2018/a-hammer-you-can-only-hold-by-the-handle.html">at length</a> in the context of Rust. Typestate boils down to four ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each state is represented as a unique type.</li>
  <li>State transitions are only available as methods for the corresponding state type.</li>
  <li>Taking a state transition returns a state machine of the new state type.</li>
  <li>State transitions invalidate old state.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, here’s a state machine for a send-then-receive channel:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Each state is a unique type</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Receiving</span><span>;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Sending</span><span>;</span>

<span>// The state machine is parameterized by the state</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>State</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>chan</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span><span>,</span>
  <span>_</span><span>state</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>State</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>// Methods for the state are uniquely associated with only the state</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Receiving</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// recv consumes ownership, ensuring old state is invalidated</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>recv</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Sending</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>msg</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.chan</span><span>.recv</span><span>();</span>
    <span>// The state type changes after executing a transition</span>
    <span>(</span><span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span> <span>transmute</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>},</span> <span>msg</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Sending</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>send</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>msg</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Receiving</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.chan</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>msg</span><span>);</span>
    <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span> <span>transmute</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#[test]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>channel_test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>c</span><span>:</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Sending</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>Channel</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>c</span><span>:</span> <span>Channel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Receiving</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>c</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>"hi"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>c</span><span>,</span> <span>msg</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>c</span><span>.recv</span><span>();</span>
  <span>// and so on</span>
<span>}</span>

  <p>For a discussion about the use of <code>unsafe</code> in this example and the rest of the article, see this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/gaxlm3/typelevel_programming_in_rust/fp2gjhg/">/r/rust</a> thread.</p>

<p>This pattern works effectively for simple finite state machines, where the logic to determine the next state is straightforward. In this note, I will explore situations where determining the next state is not so simple. In the process, we’ll talk about <strong>type-level programming</strong>, or how you can use Rust’s type system to encode <strong>computations on types</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Part of the goal of this note is to show the value of type-level programming in practice. These same mechanisms have already been used for more esoteric purposes like <a href="https://sdleffler.github.io/RustTypeSystemTuringComplete/">showing Rust’s type system is Turing complete</a>, but I think type-level programming can really help us design better systems!</p>

<h2 id="1-information-flow-control">1. Information flow control</h2>

<p>As a first example, consider a basic information flow control problem. In our program we have low security values (anyone can read them) and high security values (only authorized users can read them).</p>

<p>We represent this idea like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Each security level is a type</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>;</span>

<span>// An Item wraps an arbitrary type T, associating it with a Level</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Level</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>_</span><span>marker</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Level</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Constructors for building items of a particular security</span>
<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>low_sec</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Item</span> <span>{</span> <span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>),</span> <span>_</span><span>marker</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>high_sec</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Item</span> <span>{</span> <span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>),</span> <span>_</span><span>marker</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// For simplicity, a naked Item can be read by anyone</span>
<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Level</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Deref</span> <span>for</span> <span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Level</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Target</span> <span>=</span> <span>T</span><span>;</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>deref</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>T</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.t</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We would like to have a vector of these items with the following property:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If all of the items are low security, anyone can read any item.</li>
  <li>If any of the items are high security, only an authorized user can read any item.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, our vector should pass this test:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>lo</span> <span>=</span> <span>Item</span><span>::</span><span>low_sec</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>hi</span> <span>=</span> <span>Item</span><span>::</span><span>high_sec</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>v</span><span>.push</span><span>(</span><span>lo</span><span>);</span>         <span>// v is still low sec</span>
<span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>v</span><span>.get</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>   <span>// ok to read v</span>

<span>let</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>v</span><span>.push</span><span>(</span><span>hi</span><span>);</span>         <span>// v is now high sec</span>
<span>// assert_eq!(v.get(0), 1); // can't read any more, compiler error</span>

<span>let</span> <span>w</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span><span>::</span><span>login</span><span>();</span>
<span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>v</span><span>.get_secure</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>w</span><span>),</span> <span>2</span><span>);</span> <span>// can read after login</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A basic type-state attempt looks like this. We can create and read a low-security vector:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Level</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>items</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Level</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>_</span><span>marker</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Level</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>new</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>SecureVec</span> <span>{</span> <span>items</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(),</span> <span>_</span><span>marker</span><span>:</span> <span>PhantomData</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>T</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.items</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we can protect a high-security vector through a witness:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span><span>;</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// sprinkle some high-security authentication in here...</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>login</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span> <span>{</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>get_secure</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>witness</span><span>:</span> <span>HighSecWitness</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>T</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.items</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, to the main idea: how can we implement <code>push</code>? There are four possible state combinations: a high/low security vector with a high/low security item. While we can implement each combination as a separate method, it’s simpler to consider the underlying logic. <code>push</code> should return a vector of level <code>max(vec_level, item_level)</code> where <code>max(hi, lo) = hi</code>.</p>

<p>Our goal is to encode <code>max</code> as a <em>type-level computation</em>, i.e. an operator on types. The high-level idea:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Traits definitions are function signatures from types to types.</li>
  <li>Trait type parameters represent inputs and associated types represent outputs.</li>
  <li>Trait implementations define individual mappings from inputs to outputs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are those ideas in action to compute the max security level:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Self (implicitly) is the left operand, Other is the right operand,</span>
<span>// and Output is the output</span>
<span>trait</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Other</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>Output</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// These impls define the core computation</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span>  <span>for</span> <span>LowSec</span>  <span>{</span> <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>;</span>  <span>}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HighSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>LowSec</span>  <span>{</span> <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span>  <span>for</span> <span>HighSec</span> <span>{</span> <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HighSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>HighSec</span> <span>{</span> <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>

<span>// The type alias gives us a more convenient way to "call" the type operator</span>
<span>type</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>L</span><span>,</span> <span>R</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>L</span> <span>as</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>R</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>::</span><span>Output</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most confusing part is the <code>MaxLevel</code> alias. In brief: <code>L as ComputeMaxLevel&lt;R&gt;</code> says “treat <code>L</code> as the trait object <code>ComputeMaxLevel&lt;R&gt;</code>”. This is necessary since multiple computation traits may have associated <code>Output</code> with <code>L</code>, so the explicit cast disambiguates the <code>MaxLevel</code> computation from the rest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s an example of using the type operator:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>_</span> <span>:</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HighSec</span><span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>// ok</span>
<span>let</span> <span>_</span> <span>:</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LowSec</span> <span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>;</span>  <span>// ok</span>
<span>let</span> <span>_</span> <span>:</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LowSec</span> <span>,</span> <span>LowSec</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>HighSec</span><span>;</span> <span>// type error</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we can implement <code>SecureVec::push</code> in one method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>VecLevel</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>VecLevel</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>push</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ItemLevel</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>
    <span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span>
    <span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>Item</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ItemLevel</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>SecureVec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>MaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ItemLevel</span><span>,</span> <span>VecLevel</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
  <span>where</span>
    <span>ItemLevel</span><span>:</span> <span>ComputeMaxLevel</span><span>&lt;</span><span>VecLevel</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>self</span><span>.items</span><span>.push</span><span>(</span><span>transmute</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>));</span>
      <span>transmute</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice the usage of <code>MaxLevel</code> in the return type of <code>push</code>. This is the key use of the type operator as a type-level computation. The other main component is the <code>where</code> clause: when used generically (over any possible <code>ItemLevel</code>), we have to use a trait bound to ensure that <code>ComputeMaxLevel</code> can be “called” on <code>ItemLevel</code>.</p>

<p>Excellent! We’ve now used a type-level computation to more abstractly specify typestate in our information flow control API. Next, we’ll look at an example with a more complex type-level program.</p>

<h2 id="2-two-party-communication-protocols">2. Two-party communication protocols</h2>

<p>When two parties synchronously communicate with each other (e.g. a client and server exchanging information), that communication protocol can be modeled as a session type. We’re going to look at session types <a href="https://munksgaard.me/papers/laumann-munksgaard-larsen.pdf">implemented in Rust</a>. While their full implementation is beyond the scope of the post (see the linked paper or my <a href="http://cs242.stanford.edu/f19/lectures/09-1-session-types">course notes</a>), I will focus on the aspects of session types that showcase type-level programming.</p>

<p>Session types are a domain-specific language of state machines, described by this grammar:</p>



<p>For example, this session type describes a ping server that sends and receives a ping in a loop, exiting on demand. The label/goto scheme uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index">de Bruijn indices</a> to locally encode label names as integers.</p>



<p>The grammar, and this example, can be encoded in Rust like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Send</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>S</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>S</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>);</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Close</span><span>;</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The runtime communication API uses the type-state concept as a channel whose type changes as the protocol advances. Initially, a <code>Chan</code> is created for the server and the client (the “dual” of the server). Here’s an example where the type annotations show the change.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>example_ping_server</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>c</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>):</span> <span>(</span><span>Chan</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>PingServer</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
               <span>Chan</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>Dual</span><span>&lt;</span><span>PingServer</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>Chan</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>

        <span>let</span> <span>c</span><span>:</span> <span>Chan</span><span>&lt;</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>Recv</span><span>&lt;</span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span>_</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>c</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>Ping</span><span>);</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>c</span><span>,</span> <span>Ping</span><span>):</span> <span>(</span><span>Chan</span><span>&lt;</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>Goto</span><span>&lt;</span><span>_</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>c</span><span>.recv</span><span>();</span>
        <span>c</span><span>.goto</span><span>()</span>
      <span>},</span>

        <span>c</span><span>.close</span><span>();</span>
        <span>return</span><span>;</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that the <code>Chan</code> has two type arguments: an environment <code>Env</code> and a current action <code>Sigma</code>. The environment contains a list of session types generated by calls to <code>label</code>. When we <code>goto</code>, we look up the corresponding type in the <code>Env</code> list and make that the type of the current channel.</p>

<p>This is the last post in the series, now we’re going to design an <strong>edge computing platform</strong> using Lua, Nginx, and Redis cluster. Previously, we explained <a href="https://leandromoreira.com/2020/04/19/empowering-nginx-with-lua-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to add code, not dynamically, in nginx</a>.</p>







<p>The platform is meant to provide a way to attach Lua <strong>code dynamically</strong> into the edge servers. The starting point can be to take the authentication code and port it to this solution.</p>



<p>At the bare minimum, we need a Lua <strong>phase name</strong>, an&nbsp;<strong>identifier</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>Lua code</strong>. Let’s call this abstraction the&nbsp;<strong>computing unit (CU)</strong>.</p>



<p>If we plan to add a computing unit dynamically to the <a href="https://github.com/leandromoreira/nott/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NOTT</a>, we need to persist it somewhere. A fast data store for this could be Redis.</p>

<p>We also need to find a way <strong>to encode the computing unit</strong> into some of the&nbsp;<a href="https://redis.io/topics/data-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redis data types</a>. What we can do is to use the string to store the computing unit. The key will be the identity and the value will hold the Lua phase and code <strong>separated by the string “</strong>||<strong>“</strong>.</p>

<p>The platform needs to know all of the <strong>computing units</strong>, therefore, we need to <strong>list them</strong>. We could use the&nbsp;<a href="https://redis.io/commands/keys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keys command</a> but it can be very slow depending on how much data we have.</p>



<p>A somewhat better solution would be to store all the identities in a <a href="https://redis.io/topics/data-types#sets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set data type</a>, providing an <a href="https://redis.io/commands/smembers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">O(N) solution</a>, where N is the number of CUs.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>KEYS pattern</strong> would also be O(N) however with N being the total number of keys in the data store.</p></blockquote>

<p>To split a string we’ll use a function taken from Stackoverflow <img src="https://discordemoji.com/assets/emoji/6158_PepeLaugh.png" alt="PepeLaugh - Discord Emoji" width="19" height="19"> and for the <strong>code evaluation</strong>, Lua offers the <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loadstring</a> function.</p>



<p>But now some new questions arise, what happens if the code is <strong>syntactically invalid</strong> or when the <strong>CU </strong>raises an <strong>error</strong>? and how can we <a href="https://www.drdobbs.com/defensive-programming/184401915" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deal with these issues</a>?</p>

<p>To deal with <strong>syntax errors</strong>, we need to validate the returned values from the function loadstring where the first value is the function instance and the last is the error.</p>



<p>And to <strong>protect against runtime error</strong>, Lua has a builtin function called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/8.5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xpcall</a> (pcall meaning protected call) that receives a function to execute and a second argument which is an error handler function.</p>



<p>With all this in mind, we can <strong>develop the core of our platform</strong>. Somehow we need to get <strong>all the computing units</strong> from Redis, <strong>parse</strong> them to something easier to consume and finally, we can <strong>execute</strong> the given function.</p>



<p><strong>Before</strong> we start to code, we can create a <strong>prototype</strong> that will replicate the authorization token system we did before but now using Redis to add and fetch the computing unit as well as shielding the platform from broken code.</p>

<p><strong>To test</strong> these lines of code, we can go to the terminal and simulate calls to the proper nginx location. Therefore we can understand if the expected behavior is shown.</p>

<p>Since we’re comfortable with our experiment, we can start to <strong>brainstorm</strong> thoughts about the <strong>code design</strong> and <strong>performance trade-offs</strong>.</p>



<h2>Querying Computer Units</h2>



<p>The first decision we can take is about when we’re going to <strong>fetch all</strong> the computing units (<strong>CUs</strong>). For the sake of simplicity, we can gather all the CUs for <strong>every request</strong> but then we’re going <strong>to pay extra latency</strong> for every client’s request.</p>







<p>To overcome these challenges, we’ll rely on two known techniques, &nbsp;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caching</a></strong> and <strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_process" target="_blank" rel="noopener">background processing</a></strong>.</p>



<p>We’ll move the <strong>fetch</strong> and <strong>parse</strong> logic to run in the <strong>background</strong>. With that running periodically, we then <strong>store</strong> the <strong>CUs</strong> into a <strong>shared memory</strong> where the edge computing core can lookup without the need for additional network connections.</p>



<p>Openresty has a function called&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxtimerevery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ngx.timer.every(delay, callback)</a>, it runs a callback function every&nbsp;<strong>delay</strong>&nbsp;seconds in a “light thread” completely detached from the original request. This background job will do the fetch/parser instead of doing so for every request.</p>



<p>Once we got the CUs, we need to find a <strong>buffer</strong> that our fetcher background function will store them for later execution, openresty offers <strong>at least two</strong> ways to&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#data-sharing-within-an-nginx-worker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share data:</a></p>



<ul><li>a declared <a href="https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxshareddict" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared memory</a> (lua_shared_dict) with all the Nginx workers</li><li>encapsulate the shared data into a Lua module and use the <strong>require</strong> function to import the module</li></ul>



<p>The nature of the first option&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module/blob/master/src/ngx_http_lua_shdict.c#L604" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requires software locking</a>. To make it scalable, we need to try to avoid this lock contention.</p>



<blockquote><p>The Lua module sharing model also requires some care:</p><p><em>“to <strong>share changeable data</strong> among all the concurrent requests of each Nginx worker, there is <strong>must be no nonblocking I/O</strong> operations (including ngx.sleep) in the middle of the calculations. As long as you <strong>do not give the control back to the Nginx event loop</strong> and ngx_lua’s light thread scheduler (even implicitly), there <strong>can never be any race conditions</strong> in between. “</em></p><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#data-sharing-within-an-nginx-worker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a></strong></p></blockquote>



<h2>Edge Computing Bootstrapping</h2>



<p>The usage of this edge computing lua library requires you to <strong>start</strong> the background process and also to explicitly call an <strong>execution</strong> function for each location and lua phase you want to add it to.</p>

                  <li><span color="#333333">We humbly acknowledge that old games 
                    are always better because inventing games is one of two human 
                    activities <i>excluded from progress</i>. The other one is the brain 
                    activity of people who subscribe to that point of view.</span>

                  <li><span color="#333333">We're more committed to strategy games than to tactical ones. 
                    Here's the difference:<br>
                    Strategy games have strategies varied enough to allow different 
                    styles of play, tactics varied enough to induce their own 
                    terminology, and a structure that allows advantageous sub-goals 
                    to be achieved as <em>calculable</em> signposts along the 
                    way.<br>
                    Tactical games have strategies that are either fairly obvious (however deep), 
                    like Pente, or fairly opaque, like Othello.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Soumyabrata Roy/NurPhoto via AP</p></div><div data-component="BodyComponentRenderer"><p><span data-component="TextBlock"></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>CORK, Ireland â€” Facebook has threatened to pack up its toys and go home if European regulators donâ€™t back down and let the social network get its own way.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>In a court filing in Dublin, Facebook said that a decision by Irelandâ€™s Data Protection Commission (DPC) would force the company to pull up stakes and leave the 410 million people who use Facebook and photo-sharing service Instagram in the lurch.</p>
</span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>If the decision is upheld, â€œit is not clear to [Facebook] how, in those circumstances, it could continue to provide the Facebook and Instagram services in the EU,â€� Yvonne Cunnane, who is Facebook Irelandâ€™s head of data protection and associate general counsel, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yngcdv99irbm5sr/Facebook%20DPC%20filing%20Sept%202020-rotated.pdf?dl=0">wrote in a sworn affidavit</a>.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The decision Facebookâ€™s referring to is <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/v7gkgy/europe-ordered-facebook-to-stop-sending-user-data-to-the-united-states">a preliminary order handed down last month</a> to stop the transfer of data about European customers to servers in the U.S., over concerns about U.S. government surveillance of the data.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Facebook hit back by filing a lawsuit challenging the Irish DPCâ€™s ban, and in a sworn affidavit filed this week, the company leveled some very serious accusations about the Irish data-protection commissioner, including a lack of fairness and apparent bias in singling out Facebook.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Cunnane points out that Facebook was given only three weeks to respond to the decision, a period that is â€œmanifestly inadequate,â€� adding that Facebook wasnâ€™t contacted about the inquiry prior to judgment being handed down.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>She also raises concerns about the decision being made â€œsolelyâ€� by Helen Dixon, Irelandâ€™s data protection commissioner.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>â€œThe fact one person is responsible for the entire process is relevant to [Facebookâ€™s] concerns, in respect of the inadequacy of the investigative process engaged in and independence of the ultimate decision-making process,â€� Cunnane wrote.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Cunnane also complains that Facebook is being singled out, noting no other big tech company using similar methods to transfer data to the U.S. from the EU is under the same scrutiny.</p>
</span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>â€œThis gives rise to an apprehension that [Facebook] is not being treated equally,â€� Cullinane wrote. â€œIf [Facebook] alone is being investigated and subject to a suspension of data transfers to the U.S., this would be liable to create a serious distortion of competition.â€�</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The Irish DPC declined to comment to VICE News. Facebook denies that it is trying to force the regulator to change its decision with a threat with withdraw its services.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>â€œFacebook is not threatening to withdraw from Europe,â€� a Facebook spokesperson said, adding that the court filing simply lays out how â€œFacebook, and many other businesses, organisations and services, rely on data transfers between the EU and the US in order to operate their services.â€�</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>A judge last week allowed Facebookâ€™s challenge to go ahead and put a stay on the DPCâ€™s ban on data transfers â€” though the DPC can challenge that decision.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Besides threatening to close down Facebook and Instagram completely, Cunnane also points out that Facebook is an important tool for the freedom of expression of its 410 million EU users â€” it also reportedly generated â‚¬208 billion in sales for companies who use the platforms.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>What she failed to mention, though, is that the service has also been weaponized to sow disinformation and conspiracy theories, as well as being used to influence the results of votes across the region, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/cambridge-analytica-leave-eu-ukip-brexit-facebook/">including the U.K.â€™s decision to leave the EU</a>.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Facebookâ€™s entire business model relies on being able to easily and quickly transfer data across the globe so that it can better target users with ads. By disrupting that flow of data, the EU is threatening Facebookâ€™s revenue potential, and as this lawsuit shows, that is something the company takes very seriously indeed.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>But Facebookâ€™s ultimatum is little more than an empty threat, according to privacy experts.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>â€œThe idea that Facebook would withdraw from the European market is absurd brinksmanship that I donâ€™t think anyone truly believes,â€� Michael Veale, a technology policy researcher at University College London, told VICE News.</p>

You'd like to have time to code, but nobody else is onboarding the junior engineers, updating the roadmap, talking to the users, noticing the things that got dropped, asking questions on design documents, and making sure that everyone's going roughly in the same direction. If you stop doing those things, the team won't be as successful. But now someone's suggesting that you might be happier in a less technical role. If this describes you, congratulations: you're the glue.

September 25, 2020 | https://w3c.studio24.net/updates/on-not-choosing-wordpress/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://w3c.studio24.net/updates/on-not-choosing-wordpress/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div tabindex="0"> <div>  <div class="page"> <div id="main-content" role="main">  <p> <span>Updates</span> <span>CMS</span> </p>  <hr> <p>The W3C redesign project is an incredibly exciting one for us at Studio 24, it’s an honour to be working with an organisation we have looked up to for our whole career. But it’s also challenging, with many aspects coming under more scrutiny than we’re normally used to. It’s also made harder in this time of pandemic, with increased anxiety and challenges working effectively during this “new normal” we’re all living in.</p> <p>We’re happy to rise to this challenge. Yesterday a well written article was published by WordPress Tavern on <a href="https://wptavern.com/w3c-drops-wordpress-from-consideration-for-redesign-narrows-cms-shortlist-to-statamic-and-craft">W3C dropping WordPress from consideration</a> which I’d like to respond to.</p> <h2 id="in-context-of-the-project"> <a href="#in-context-of-the-project"></a> In context of the project </h2> <p>We’ve tackled a huge variety of work so far from initial Discovery, User Research, Information Architecture, Content Design and UX Design that has helped move the project forward.</p> <p>The CMS platform decision is just part of this and for the end website is one of the less visible aspects. As you can read from <a href="https://w3c.studio24.net/docs/cms-selection-report/">Marie’s report on the work we did to choose Craft CMS</a> you can see the steps we went through to help shortlist and choose a CMS.</p> <p>For us, and the requirements from W3C, the delivery of accessible HTML/CSS pages that meet user needs is the most important part of this project - and where we are focussing our time. All in, we spent around 15 days on the CMS platform choice. Enough to help evaluate a limited number of options, but not enough to do a thorough review of the state of accessibility in a wide range of CMSs.</p> <p>We were surprised by the accessibility issues that cropped up in CMS platforms after our <a href="https://w3c.studio24.net/docs/w3c-cms-selection-process-update/">initial CMS review</a>. This prompted us to prioritise accessibility above other requirements due to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission#principles">principles and values of W3C</a>.</p> <h2 id="challenges-of-gutenberg-for-now"> <a href="#challenges-of-gutenberg-for-now"></a> Challenges of Gutenberg (for now) </h2> <p><a href="https://www.studio24.net/">Studio 24</a> is a firm supporter of open source software and we use <a href="https://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> extensively for our client work. For this project we had committed to not selecting a CMS until we’d had the chance to better understand client requirements.</p> <p>An important consideration for WordPress was accessibility concerns with the new Gutenberg editor. Many have written about the <a href="https://www.marcozehe.de/my-thoughts-on-gutenberg-accessibility/">accessibility issues</a> the project has had as well as the positive <a href="https://www.marcozehe.de/whats-new-for-accessibility-in-gutenberg-7-2/">steps to improve accessibility in Gutenberg</a>.</p> <p>Gutenberg is an exciting and really interesting development. Many CMS vendors are looking at ways to allow editors to create more flexible content from compontents or blocks. However, this comes with huge challenges on how to make innovative user interfaces accessible. WordPress decided to use the JavaScript framework <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> to meet these needs.</p> <p>We <a href="https://medium.com/studio24/we-tried-converting-a-bespoke-website-design-in-wordpress-with-gutenberg-42e11986b05a">tested Gutenberg</a> six months before it was released in WordPress 5. Recently we worked on a project for the University of Cambridge creating a site for their <a href="https://magazine.alumni.cam.ac.uk/">Alumni magazine</a>. This launched in April 2020 and uses Gutenberg to manage content. This gave us a good idea of how Gutenberg works. In June, we reviewed the current accessibility issue backlog (<a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/labels/Accessibility%20%28a11y%29">issues</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/projects/25">a11y project</a>) and had some feedback from users with accessibility needs who had difficulties using the current user interface. This was a contributing factor in our decision that WordPress was not a good fit for this project.</p> <p>Given the importance the WordPress project has put on Gutenberg as the future of WordPress we did not feel it was reasonable to recommend using the Classic Editor if there is a good chance this will not be supported in the future. At present <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/07/classic-editor-plugin-support-window/">Classic Editor is slated for end of life in Dec 2021</a>.</p> <p>We look forward to the continued development of Gutenberg and applaud efforts to make it more accessible. We appreciate improvements have been made since our review and we’re very glad to see the <a href="https://wpaccessibilityday.org/">WordPress Accessibility Day</a> on 2nd October.</p> <h2 id="front-end-complexity"> <a href="#front-end-complexity"></a> Front-end complexity </h2> <p>From a business perspective I also believe Gutenberg creates a complexity issue that makes it challenging for use by many agencies who create custom websites for clients; where we have a need to create lots of bespoke blocks and page elements for individual client projects.</p> <p>The use of React complicates front-end build. We have very talented front-end developers, however, they are not React experts - nor should they need to be. I believe front-end should be built as standards-compliant HTML/CSS with JavaScript used to enrich functionality where necessary and appropriate.</p> <p>As of yet, we have not found a satisfactory (and profitable) way to build custom Gutenberg blocks for commercial projects. We won’t stop trying though and plan to do more R&amp;D with Gutenberg in the future. The W3C project, however, did not feel like the right place to do this. On a project as wide-ranging as this one, development time does become a factor.</p> <p>Drupal also has this complexity issue which makes developing sites harder than it needs to be, and is why we didn’t consider that platform either. I’ve talked to <a href="https://torchbox.com/blog/torchbox-has-dropped-drupal/">other agencies who have decided to drop Drupal</a> due to its complexity.</p> <h2 id="the-question-of-open-source"> <a href="#the-question-of-open-source"></a> The question of open source </h2> <p>The W3C embraces and supports the open web. However, as an agency we also have to be practical when it comes to the tools we use to build sites. From our review, which was focussed on PHP-based CMSs, Craft and Statamic came out as meeting all the key requirements and are both very developer-friendly platforms. An important consideration for a tool that we need to hand over to W3C to maintain in the future.</p> <p>While their <a href="https://github.com/craftcms/cms">source code</a> is open, they do have commercial licenses and cost money (though a modest sum). Charging money enables small teams to develop good software, so we’re not ideologically against this business model. Both platforms are well respected in the community and well-used by professionals, running sites such as <a href="https://media.netflix.com/en/">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/">Big Commerce</a> in Craft, <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/plus/">Spiegel Plus</a> and <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/">FreshBooks</a> in Statamic.</p> <p>We are using open source technology in the majority of this project (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Symfony). While Craft is a proprietary CMS, this has given us the advantage of direct access to the team developing the CMS which has helped improve accessibility in these CMSs. We hope this helps move accessibility forward in the CMS industry.</p> <p>Open tools will continue to be used to publish the standards of the web. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/">Technical Reports</a> page is powered by <a href="https://symfony.com/">Symfony</a> and specifications will continue to be published to <a href="https://github.com/w3c">GitHub</a> to facilitate open discussion. Nothing’s changing with how the W3C work in the open.</p> <h2 id="a-note-on-front-end-delivery"> <a href="#a-note-on-front-end-delivery"></a> A note on front-end delivery </h2> <p>One final note. We are currently considering a <a href="https://www.studio24.net/blog/what-is-a-headless-cms/">Headless CMS</a> option for front-end page delivery. This means using the CMS in a decoupled way to manage content but use a separate system to deliver front-end pages. Please note this solution would not be reliant on JavaScript (e.g. a single page app which is common with headless). Under this option we’d use Symfony to deliver front-end pages which is an established technology W3C already use across a lot of the site.</p> <p>This may give W3C better flexibility for the future, though comes at a cost of added complexity. The W3C site is already made up of a lot of different systems, the CMS is just one part of the what makes up the varied content on <a href="https://www.w3.org/">w3.org</a>.</p> <p>I hope this helps explain the thought process behind our decision a little more and addresses some of the valid concerns highlighted in the WordPress Tavern post.</p> <hr>  </div> </div> </div> </div></div>]]>

<blockquote><p>Go also happens to have a (rather insane, in my opinion) policy of
reinventing its own standard library, so it does not use any of the
standard Linux glibc code to call vDSO, but rather rolls its own calls
(and syscalls too).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ordinary non-C languages on Unixes generally implement a great many
low level operations by calling into the standard C library. This
starts with things like making system calls, but also includes
operations such as <code>getaddrinfo(3)</code>. Go doesn't do this; it implements
as much as possible itself, going straight down to direct system
calls in assembly language. Occasionally there are problems that
ensue.</p>

<p>A few Unixes explicitly say that the standard C library is the
stable API and point of interface with the system; one example is
Solaris (and now Illumos). Although they don't casually change the
low level system call implementation, as far as I know Illumos
officially reserves the right to change all of their actual system
calls around, breaking any user space code that isn't dynamically
linked to <code>libc</code>. If your code breaks, it's your fault; Illumos
told you that dynamic linking to <code>libc</code> is the official API.</p>

<p>Other Unixes simply do this tacitly and by accretion. For example,
on any Unix using <code>nsswitch.conf</code>, it's very difficult to always
get the same results for operations like <code>getaddrinfo()</code> without
going through the standard C library, because these may use arbitrary
and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/SystemdResolvedNotes">strange</a> dynamically loaded
modules that are accessed through <code>libc</code> and require various random
<code>libc</code> APIs to work. This points out one of the problems here; once
you start (indirectly) calling random bits of the <code>libc</code> API, they
may quite reasonably make assumptions about the runtime environment
that they're operating in. How to set up a limited standard C library
runtime environment is generally not documented; instead the official
view is generally 'let the standard C library runtime code start
your <code>main()</code> function'.</p>

<p>I'm not at all sure that all of this requirement and entanglement
with the standard C library and its implicit runtime environment
is a good thing. The standard C library's runtime environment is
designed for C, and it generally contains a tangled skein of
assumptions about how things work. Forcing all other languages to
fit themselves into these undocumented constraints is clearly
confining, and the standard C library generally isn't designed to
be a transparent API; in fact, at least GNU libc deliberately
manipulates what it does under the hood to be more useful to C
programs. Whether these manipulations are useful or desired for
your non-C language is an open question, but the GNU libc people
aren't necessarily going to even document them.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://marcan.st/2017/12/debugging-an-evil-go-runtime-bug/">Marcan's story</a> shows
that the standard C library behavior would have been a problem for
any language environment that attempted to use minimal stacks while
calling into 'libc', here in the form of a kernel vDSO that's
designed to be called through libc. This also shows another aspect
of the problem, in that as far as I know how much stack space you
must provide when calling the standard C library is generally not
documented. It's just assumed that you will have 'enough', whatever
that is. C code will; people who are trying to roll their own
coroutines and thread environment, maybe not.)</p>

<p>This implicit assumption has a long history in Unix. Many Unixes
have only really documented their system calls in the form of the
standard C library interface to them, quietly eliding the distinction
between the kernel API to user space and the standard C library API
to C programs. If you're lucky, you can dig up some documentation
on how to make raw system calls and what things those raw system
calls return in unusual cases like <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/SocketReturnAPIDesign"><code>pipe(2)</code></a>.
I don't think very many Unixes have ever tried to explicitly and
fully document the kernel API separately from the standard C library
API, especially once you get into cases like <code>ioctl()</code> (where there
are often C macros and <code>#define</code>s that are used to form some of the
arguments, which are of course only 'documented' in the C header
files).</p>

    <p>The Maersk Triple-E Class container ship is 1,300 feet long, carries over 18,000 containers across 11,000 miles between Europe and Asia, and… Its entire crew can fit inside a passenger van.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e84e2eff3c5307ee69a77b3313684a5a90aa0981/d7909/images/uploads/maersk-container-ship.jpg" alt="Maersk container ship"></p>

<p>As a former naval architect and a current <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/">marketing consultant to startups</a>, I found that the same principle that lets a 13-person crew navigate the world’s largest container ship to a port halfway around the world without breaking down also applies to startups working towards aggressive growth goals:</p>

<p><strong>Simple systems have less downtime.</strong></p>

<p>Ships contain simple systems that are easy to operate and easy to understand, which makes them easy to fix, which means they have less downtime. An important quality, considering that “downtime” for a ship could mean being stranded thousands of miles from help.</p>

<p>Take the ship’s steering system, for instance. The rudder is pushed left or right by metal rods. Those rods are moved by hydraulic pressure. That pressure is controlled by a hydraulic pump. That pump is controlled by an electronic signal from the wheelhouse. That signal is controlled by the autopilot. It doesn’t require a rocket scientist or a naval architect to find the cause of and solution to any problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the autopilot fails, steer the ship manually from the wheelhouse.</li>
  <li>If the electronic signals fail, go to the rudder control room to control the pump by hand, while talking with the bridge through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound-powered_telephone">simple sound-powered phone</a>.</li>
  <li>If the hydraulics fail, use the mechanically linked emergency steering wheel.</li>
  <li>If the mechanical linkage fails, hook a chain to both sides of the rudder and pull in the direction you want!</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4676c41bcb0133d35827e62d044f82c9511ffd21/bb56a/images/uploads/174.jpg" alt="Cartoon about redundancy"></p>

<p>Startups, like ships, can’t afford to stall from system downtimes. Extended downtime in sales, marketing, web, customer support, hiring, product, and other systems may cause irreparable damage to the growth rate.</p>

<p>(Although automation is prevalent on modern ships, it only affects the time it takes to do things and the attention required to monitor everything. The propulsion and auxiliary systems are more simple than ever, thanks to modern diesel and electric propulsion systems that replaced pipe-laden steam plants.)</p>

<h2 id="why-simplicity-leads-to-less-downtime">Why Simplicity Leads to Less Downtime</h2>

<h3 id="1-proficiency-takes-less-time">1. Proficiency takes less time.</h3>

<p>If the person responsible for the system leaves, falls overboard, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">gets hit by a bus</a>, or gets pulled into another project, another person can take over without much learning or training. That means more people are able to step in to troubleshoot and fix issues.</p>

<p>For example, an analytics dashboard built with Tableau is likely to have more qualified people to fix it than one built with a patchwork of custom scripts and APIs. Nobody should have to pull data scientists or product developers away from their work to fix a bar chart.</p>

<h3 id="2-troubleshooting-takes-less-time">2. Troubleshooting takes less time.</h3>

<p>In a system where the behavior of each component and its relationship to other comments is easily understood, ruling out issues and finding the broken component—the root cause—is more intuitive.</p>

<p>For example, if a company has many downloadable whitepapers on their website, and they’re all gated behind a single form—as opposed to a custom form for each one—then they need only troubleshoot one form and one automation workflow if the whitepaper downloads stop working.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/495bdd177c0618760025c9d94dcfc8129aa117f5/ec606/images/uploads/91.jpg" alt="Cartoon about a ship being stuck in Nebraska"></p>

<h3 id="3-more-alternative-solutions">3. More alternative solutions.</h3>

<p>When each part of the system has a clear function, alternatives are easier to find.</p>

<p>For example, imagine a Salesforce process that uses a mishmash of automation and third-party tools to score, filter, classify, and assign new sales leads. If that fails then there is no obvious replacement. Everything will be put on hold until the process is fixed or replaced with a similarly complex solution.</p>

<p>Now imagine a sales process in which the sales team is simply notified of each new sales lead along with pertinent details, letting them decide whether or not to follow up with the lead. If the Salesforce notification step fails, it’s easy to come up with a hundred other ways of getting that information to the sales team: Reports, Slack notifications, list exports, manual observation, or using Zapier to send an alert through virtually any medium. The downtime would last a few minutes, at most.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/26ba2a1619df8df60c6a56e3ec07a7b81478f644/75961/images/uploads/77.jpg" alt="Cartoon about boats grounding because of a broken lighthouse"></p>

<h2 id="startup-story">Startup Story</h2>

<p>One of my clients was using a legacy enterprise marketing automation platform (Marketo) with 629 automated processes built up over several years. When something broke or needed tweaking, there was only one person among the 150+ employees who could do it. Each issue took several days or even weeks to fix, all the while marketing campaigns stalled. And with each patch, the overall system only grew more complex.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c25f453aa08d83e439b8d4ad5240ea4842ff286f/421d6/images/uploads/127.jpg" alt="Cartoon about a sailor coming home drunk"></p>

<p>When that person left the company, there was nobody left to operate the system. With every passing week a new issue would come up, faster than we could find and fix them.</p>

<p>To keep the marketing operation from coming to a standstill, I rushed to migrate the company from Marketo to HubSpot, a more simple platform that would be easier to operate and troubleshoot.</p>

<p>The migration took just one week. Along the way, however, another complex system reared its head: Salesforce. There were 10 automated processes in Salesforce with over 100 combined operations, all dependent on various delicately timed automations in Marketo. It took two weeks—twice as long as the migration—to understand and integrate those processes with the new marketing platform.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/169a7904b8e2c26fd693968dbb2250d75eba25f3/7e08a/images/uploads/193.jpg" alt="Cartoon about being stranded on an island"></p>

<p>Overall, these two complex systems (in Marketo and in Salesforce) resulted in six weeks of downtime for the marketing team and three weeks of downtime for the sales team. That’s not counting the many weeks of downtime they experienced throughout the past few years, nor the many weeks of downtime they would experience in the future if we did not overhaul the underlying systems.</p>

<p>In the end, the system I put in place had 97% fewer processes (from 629 to 20) while providing all the same capabilities. A bug that was found a few days later got resolved in four minutes.</p>

<p>This experience made me wonder what principles startups can adopt to avoid the pitfalls of complex systems.</p>

<h2 id="principles-for-simple-systems">Principles for Simple Systems</h2>

<p>Rip-and-replace projects are painful and disruptive, even when the long-term benefits are worth it. Many startups—as with ships—don’t have the luxury of time and resources to perform overhauls once they’re underway.</p>

<p>Here are my three principles to follow when evaluating or implementing new systems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Features don’t justify complexity.</strong> What good is a complicated flight control system if it grounds an entire fleet of aircraft, or an enterprise marketing platform like Marketo if nobody can run a marketing campaign? Choose tools that are simple to operate over those that promise the most features. A frequent recommendation I give to startups is to choose HubSpot for their marketing platform instead of an enterprise platform like Marketo, Eloqua, or Pardot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Complex ideas lead to complex implementations.</strong> If it takes too long to explain or grasp an idea, then its implementation will be complex, and it will take too long to fix when something inevitably breaks. For example, a proposed sales process that requires an hour-long presentation will be a nightmare to maintain, regardless of how clever it seems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Modifications before additions.</strong> When new requirements come up, the tendency is to add layers on top of the existing system—by way of additional steps or integrations. Instead, see if the system’s core can be modified to meet the new requirements. The change may cause (planned) downtime upfront, as with my Marketo-to-HubSpot migration example, but less (unplanned) downtime over the long term.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="smooth-sailing">Smooth Sailing</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“… the more simple any thing is, the less liable it is to be disordered, and the easier repaired when disordered.” — Thomas Paine, Common Sense, 1776</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s no question things will break along the startup journey, just as surely as they do on a ship crossing the globe. However, if the onboard systems are simple, those issues won’t leave the startup drifting helplessly in the middle of the ocean.</p>

		<p>Owned and run by <strong>Kevin Beynon</strong>, its goal is to balance the monopolistic platforms of Amazon, Google, and Apple, with a service that is designed NOT to be tied to its own bookshop or e-reader (not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_integration" target="_blank">vertically-integrated</a>). In effect, supporting independent bookshops, publishers, and self-publishing authors, by providing readers with the same book management tools they would normally only get from big companies.</p>
		
		<h2>Why I built Libreture</h2>
		<p><strong>I'm an avid e-book reader and was once a Kindle-owner. After news of Amazon's UK tax-avoidance broke I decided to boycott them and look for alternative e-bookshops.</strong></p>

		<p>I concentrated on finding bookshops that sold DRM-free e-books, to ensure I could read them on any device. I also wanted to support small and independent publishers and bookshops. With this in mind, I compiled a list of <a href="https://www.libreture.com/bookshops">DRM-free bookshops</a>. The list is still growing and is now a key component of Libreture - readers record where they bought their DRM-free books, helping others discover new bookshops.</p>

		<p>A big part of Amazon's service is its book storage and management tools. To avoid these, I began using <em>Shelfari</em>, a library management website. Shelfari was a great tool, but in 2008, the owners <a href="http://shelfari.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/08/shelfari-joins-the-amazoncom-family.html" target="_blank">sold Shelfari to Amazon</a>. So I moved to <em>Goodreads</em>.</p>

		<p>When the owners of Goodreads also <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/413-exciting-news-about-goodreads-we-re-joining-the-amazon-family" target="_blank">sold their business to Amazon</a> in 2013, I had finally had enough. Many others felt the same way.</p>

		<blockquote>"What terrible news. Loss of an independent reader community, now another channel for the faceless machine to leech reader data to withhold from suffering publishers &amp; booksellers. If through this account Amazon has a record of my reading habits I will be deleting the account. Very sad."<br>
		<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/413-exciting-news-about-goodreads-we-re-joining-the-amazon-family#comment_70824525" target="_blank">Laura - 28/03/2013</a>
		</blockquote>

		<p>At that point I began building my own stable platform to store e-books, record reading activity, and promote DRM-free bookshops and publishers.</p>
		<p>I built the first version myself, and for myself. It soon became clear that others may find it useful too. Working with an external development company, we re-built Libreture from scratch.</p> 
		<p><strong><a href="https://www.libreture.com/blog/libreture-open-business/" target="_blank">Libreture launched to the public in March, 2017</a></strong></p>
		<p><strong>So far, readers are storing 8,069 e-books with Libreture.</strong></p>
		
		


		<h2>Price</h2>
		<p><strong>You can use Libreture absolutely free to store a limited amount of e-books, and you can upgrade to a paid plan to store much, much more.</strong></p>
		<p>Libreture doesn't offer a discounted annual rate that only saves money for those that can afford to pay up front. The fee is set for each plan and covers the cost of development, infrastructure, storage for your books, as well as a small profit margin. I believe each plan is as reasonable as possible while keeping Libreture sustainable (which means keeping me in tea and biscuits).</p>
		<p>Free and Paid plans ensure that costs are covered as soon as they happen, such as when readers upload large book collections. It also gives you the flexibility to switch plans to whatever suits you, or cancel whenever you want and only pay for the remainder of the month.</p>
		<p>The paid plans also exist to ensure that you, the reader, are always the most important part of Libreture. No advertising, no selling data, and no sellouts. It's just you, Libreture, and loads and loads of great books.</p>
		
		<h3>Tax</h3>
		<p><strong>I believe that tax is the price we pay for a civilised society.</strong></p>
		<p>Since I am a sole-trader and Libreture is not a limited company, I cannot become <a href="https://fairtaxmark.net/" target="_blank">Fair Tax Mark</a> accredited. But I have pledged to follow the guidelines laid down in the <a href="http://www.fairtaxpledge.uk/" target="_blank">Fair Tax Pledge</a>. While not legally binding in any way, I think it's a good indicator of an individual's commitment to comply with the spirit as well as the letter of the law when it comes to taxes.</p>
		<p><img src="https://www.libreture.com/static/images/FTP_cyan-small.png" alt="Fair Tax Pledge logo."></p>
		<p>More information about the Fair Tax Pledge:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Its aim is to help those people who believe in a fair society and playing by the rules to say so publicly; and in the process, to send a powerful message to those who cheat the system.</p>
			<p>It is designed for use by individual citizens and sole traders and produced by the Fair Tax Mark, the organisation behind the label for good taxpaying companies, but is an entirely distinct and separate project.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<h2>Privacy</h2>
		<p><strong>Data privacy is extremely important to me.</strong></p>
		<p>What you read says a lot about you. That's why Libreture reader's book collections, or libraries, are <strong>private by default</strong>. Members must actively choose make their library public before anyone else can see them.</p>
		<p>Even if they make their entire library public, members can still make individual books private. These books never appear publicly, regardless of the reader's library-wide setting.</p>
		<p>Readers don't even need to provide their real name when joining Libreture. An <em>avatar</em> is optional and is stored on Libreture. Details are stored in the UK.</p>

Downsizing the multi-boot image</h2>

<p>If the multi-boot image doesn't fit your 8GiB uSD card, because it's&nbsp;a tad
too big, you can downsize it a bit by using this script:</p>

<pre><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>set -e -x</span>

<span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> m
L<span>=</span><span>`losetup -P --show -f multi.img`</span>
mount <span>-o</span> <span>compress</span><span>-force</span><span>=</span>zstd <span>${L}</span>p2 m
btrfs filesystem resize <span>7000</span>M m
<span>echo</span> <span>",7000M"</span> <span>|</span> sfdisk <span>-N</span> <span>2</span> <span>${L}</span>
umount m
losetup <span>-d</span> <span>"</span><span>$L</span><span>"</span>

truncate <span>-s</span> <span>$((128+7000)</span><span>)</span>M multi.img
</pre>

<p>If something fails in the middle, you may need to recover by calling
<code>umount</code> and <code>losetup -d</code> yourself.
<code>losetup -l</code> can tell you if the image is still exported as a loop
device, and which&nbsp;one.</p>

<p>The image will have the size of 7128&nbsp;MiB after resize and this should fit
more „8“ giga something uSD cards, as there are obviously some other giga
units than gigabyte and gigibyte used by some manufacturers.</p>

<h2 id="toc-2020-09-20-some-ways-to-improve-pinephone-safety">2020–09–20:
Some ways to improve Pinephone safety</h2>

<p>This is a follow up on some issues from the previous article. On surface,
solutions to some of the previously presented issues can seem simple. Toggle a
few registers in PMIC, and we're mostly done. Trouble is that safety mechanisms
are barely ever triggered, by definition. Safety events occur rarely. That means
that the mechanisms are not regularly tested, and it is not known that
they&nbsp;work.</p>

<p>Also it's&nbsp;not clear which code's&nbsp;responsibility fixing the issues should
be. Bootloader, or kernel, or userspace? Finally, there are a bunch of devils in
the details, that complicate the upstreamability of any solution. And having
fixes upstream is necessary to make sure they reach the most&nbsp;users.</p>

<h3 id="toc-necessary-minimum">Necessary minimum</h3>

<p>Nevertheless, at least enabling some pre-existing PMIC functionality blindly
is better than nothing, so that's&nbsp;precisely what I&nbsp;decided to do <a href="https://megous.com/git/p-boot/commit/?id=db73ff85c60944207b7f7368e554003494148a05">in
p-boot</a>. It's&nbsp;the easiest place to start resolving these issues for me
personally, and for other p-boot&nbsp;users.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;fixed two issues:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I&nbsp;enabled the battery temperature monitoring and charging regulation based
	on temperature thresholds defined in the Pinephone battery specification.</li>

	<li>I&nbsp;enabled emergency shutdown when crossing the critical temperature
	of&nbsp;PMIC.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&nbsp;didn't measure the 3kOhm NTC used in Pinephone battery and third party
batteries I&nbsp;bought. I&nbsp;just used a table from some random 3kOhm NTC spec on The
Internet, that seemed like it could match. Hopefully it's&nbsp;close enough.</p>

<p>Trouble with the second fix is that it's&nbsp;a hard power cut-off, so data loss
may occur when PMIC overheats. There are three fixed temperature levels in
AXP803. On level 1&nbsp;the charging is limited, on level 2&nbsp;the interrupt is sent
to SoC, on level 3&nbsp;the PMIC shuts down if configured to do so (by default it
keeps running, and this is what my p-boot fix changes). Ideally, the crossing of
level 2&nbsp;would be handled by Linux to make it safely shut down the system, and
level 3&nbsp;forced power cut-off would never happen. Arguably, if charging was
source of the heating, crossing level 1&nbsp;will lead to resolving the issue, so
the next level will not be reached.</p>

<h3 id="toc-suggested-fixes-elsewhere">Suggested fixes elsewhere</h3>

<p>These fixes will reach a very limited audience. It would be nice to have
these fixes in U-Boot too, but that's&nbsp;not possible at the moment, because
U-Boot doesn't have access to&nbsp;PMIC.</p>

<p>Other places to put the fix is to ATF or Linux kernel. That can reach more
people faster, but there would have to be some generic mechanism to make the fix
upstreamable, otherwise it will not reach people using the mainline Linux kernel
or mainline&nbsp;ATF.</p>

<p>There are some ways to approach this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use battery description in DT from <a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware">ATF</a> to set up
	thresholds in PMIC (ATF has access to&nbsp;PMIC).</li>

	<li>Use battery description in DT from Linux's&nbsp;battery charger driver for
	AXP803 to set up thresholds in PMIC and stop disabling temperature
	monitoring.</li>

	<li>Use <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/supply/charger-manager.txt">charger
	manager</a> in Linux, but that looks like it's&nbsp;a completely software solution,
	that will be inferior to PMIC handling the regulation. And it seems it would not
	work in system suspend, anyway, because Linux is not running&nbsp;then.</li>

	<li>Detect Pinephone compatible string in either ATF or Linux and set up the
	thresholds to ad-hoc values for 3kOhm NTC. (easiest, unlikely to be acceptable
	upstream)</li>
</ul>

<p>First, the most generic solution would be to have a description of the
battery in DT describing the Pinephone. Sadly, the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9-rc5/source/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/supply/battery.yaml">current
bindings</a> don't include battery temperature limits.</p>

<p>Also converting from temperature to NTC resistance (which is necessary to
determine the code word from ADC for the limits used by the temperature monitor
logic in PMIC) is not straightforward. It is usually defined in NTC datasheet as
a table. Do I&nbsp;have NTC datasheet? No. I&nbsp;bought the batteries online from some
mobile phone service&nbsp;shop.</p>

<p>There are also equations that approximate the temperature&nbsp;– resistance
relationship for the NTC, which could be used instead of a fixed table, if one
knows the relevant coefficients. These can be calculated after measuring the
NTC's&nbsp;resistance at a few temperature points when we lack the datasheet.</p>

<p>So generic solution may look like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>DT contains battery temperature limits from the battery&nbsp;spec</li>

	<li>DT contains NTC coefficients (perhaps also on the battery&nbsp;node)</li>

	<li>some routine would use all this info from DT to calculate code words used by
	AXP803 ADC and program them to PMIC (either in ATF, or&nbsp;Linux)</li>
</ul>

<p>Kernel also has support for NTC devices, so maybe NTC can be described
outside of the battery node (even though it's&nbsp;part of the battery).</p>

<p>This may all fail to be upstreamed on one thing: the battery is user
swappable, so it's&nbsp;arguably not part of the Pinephone, and describing it inside
the pinephone DT will not be appropriate.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;don't have any plans implementing any of the above, atm. Maybe with the
exception of adding a 4th approach to the fix to my Linux kernel (the easiest
one ;)). I'd like to work on my multi-boot image. So these are mostly pointers
for somebody else who'd like to tackle&nbsp;this.</p>

<h3 id="toc-other-issues">Other issues</h3>

<p>Fast charging is not necesary in many situations, so having it as a default
is not great. User should be able to decide if he wants to trade off slower,
safer charging and battery longetivity over speed. This tradeoff can be realized
in many&nbsp;ways.</p>

<p>All this is already controllable from userspace via sysfs. Ideally there
would be some charging monitoring daemon that would take into account
users's&nbsp;wishes and select proper strategy for charging, based on preference for
battery longetivity or&nbsp;speed.</p>

<p>There are several trade offs the deamon would be able to handle:</p>

<ul>
	<li>0.2C charging all the way (slow, but safer)</li>

	<li>0.5C charging to 40% and 0.2C charging to 100% (middle ground)</li>

	<li>0.5C charging all the way to 100%</li>
</ul>

<p>All this is decision making that doesn't belong to the kernel.</p>

<p>Similar daemon could monitor power usage of the phone and try to limit it to
safer levels, or warn the user if that's&nbsp;not possible.</p>

Let's&nbsp;talk about safety of Pinephone</h2>

<p>My gf read me some articles about exploding phones today. :) I&nbsp;think there
needs to be some serious conversation about Pinephone safety. Safety needs to
become an important concern now, when more and more people are getting their
Pinephones every month. It's&nbsp;just a matter of time before the first major
safety incident hits this community, and it may be more than just a hacked
store. It's&nbsp;just a numbers&nbsp;game.</p>

<p>Pinephone is an interesting device in one way. You can run whatever software
you like on it (and you do!), and this software comes almost universally with
<strong>zero</strong> guarantees. Read the license to any of the program you run
on your Pinephone and it will almost certainly tell&nbsp;you:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ``AS IS'' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
	WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
	MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A&nbsp;PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY &lt;COPYRIGHT HOLDER&gt; AS IS AND ANY EXPRESS
	OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
	MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A&nbsp;PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO
	EVENT SHALL &lt;COPYRIGHT HOLDER&gt; BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
	INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
	ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
	FOR A&nbsp;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more
	details.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>In case of Pinephone you have to take these warnings <strong>very
seriously</strong>, because this software is not provided by the manufacturer
(Pine64), and as far as I&nbsp;know, there's&nbsp;no software related safety testing
going on at&nbsp;all.</p>

<h3 id="toc-some-skeletons-hiding-at-the-lower-levels">Some skeletons, hiding at
the lower levels…</h3>

<p>I'll give you a few reasons why things may not be so rosy, when it comes to
safety.</p>

<p>There's&nbsp;no unchangeable well tested guardian angel management engine that
safely manages battery, power supplies, thermal behavior, that is provided by
the manufacturer, and that is independent of the operating system.</p>

<p>Pinephone's&nbsp;SoC is quite bare when it comes to software/firmware
(that's&nbsp;why FOSS enthusiasts like it, no blobs, you know!). This has a dark</p></article></div>

		<p>KansasFest 2019 presentation, “Ready Player Two”</p>
<p><span><iframe type="text/html" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T3Qj0vnZx7Y?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>One of the first games I ever played on my family’s Apple IIe was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karateka_(video_game)">Jordan Mechner master work, Karateka</a>. Fight the bad guys, save the princess – it’s a simple but classic formula. My brother and I would take turns making our way through Akuma’s fortress. Even then, we wanted a two player version.</p>
<p>Fast forward more than 30 years, and I’ve taught myself 6502 assembly after getting back into the Apple II, through the thriving community online. The idea of a two player version of Karateka came back to me while at <a href="http://kansasfest.org/">KansasFest</a> a couple of years ago. I noodled a little on it back then, getting distracted by finding the code that created the <a href="https://github.com/option8/ksynth">unique music</a> in the game.</p>
<p>Long story short: I finally found the places in the game code that needed patching to allow a second player to control the enemies in the game, and create a functioning two player version of Karateka. The resulting patch is only 42 bytes long. <a href="https://archive.org/details/karateka-two-player">A DSK image is downloadable and playable online at the Internet Archive.</a></p>
<p><strong>[Update, August 20, 2018]:</strong> Some people seem to think I had access to the Karateka source code to make my edits. As far as I know, that source code is unreleased, still in Jordan Mechner’s archives somewhere. Instead, I fired up the game in my Apple II emulator of choice, <a href="http://virtualii.com/">Virtual ][</a>&nbsp;and froze the game state. Stepping through instructions, I followed the assembly as it built up each frame of animation, triggered events and eventually found where the player and enemy performed their attacks. By comparing memory states from before and after the enemy attacks, I found a handful of zero-page variables that, when I changed them manually, would trigger a punch or kick.</p>
<p>From there, it was a matter of finding the routines that read and wrote to those memory locations, and inserting my own code to listen instead for the keyboard to trigger each action.</p>
<p><strong>[Update, August 23, 2018]:</strong> Robin Harbron has ported the two-player patch over to the Commodore 64 port of Karateka. <a href="http://psw.ca/robin/?p=271">You can read Robin’s write-up here:&nbsp;http://psw.ca/robin/?p=271</a></p>
<p>Digging a little deeper than my original patches, Robin added the ability for the second player to move backward as well as forward. I’ll have to back-port that to my version.</p>

<h3>Player 1 controls:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Q,A,Z to punch</li>
<li>W,S,X to kick</li>
<li>C,V to move/run</li>
<li>SPACE to go from standing to fighting stance and back.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Player 2 controls:</h3>
<ul>
<li>N to kick</li>
<li>M to punch</li>
<li>&lt; to move left</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrnCRkPLoXXzTtWX9dBJsnA">Chris Torrence</a>, for helping spelunk the game’s memory layout; to <a href="https://www.brutaldeluxe.fr/">Antoine Vignau</a> for his clean DSK crack and a patch to skip the intro and get right into fighting; <a href="https://twitter.com/a2_4am">4AM</a>&nbsp;for inspiration and helping test.</p>
<h3>Patch Details:</h3>
<p>Addresses are locations in memory after the game finishes loading.</p>
<p>Before the enemy fighter punches, code loads the Accumulator with D7 then jumps to $6540. A kick is similar, but loads A with C5. I patched those pieces at $6C11 (punch) and $6C20 (kick) instead to read the keyboard buffer and load the appropriate byte into the Accumulator. Otherwise, it goes along to $6540 with 00, which does nothing.</p>
<ul>
<li>$6C11: D0 1C C5 21 D0 18 A9 00 85 29 A9 D7 -&gt; AD 00 C0 C9 CD D0 02 A9 D7 8D 10 C0 (M to punch, clears strobe)</li>
<li>$6C20: 20 95 6C C5 D7 B0 08 20 71 6C A9 C5 -&gt; AD 00 C0 C9 CE D0 02 A9 C5 8D 10 C0&nbsp; (N to kick, clears strobe)</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Code at $6B9B seems to check if the distance between fighters ($33) is too far, trigger the enemy to move closer. This happens with a JMP to 6C52. I read the keyboard ($C000) and check for the comma/less-than.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>$6B9B: A6 33 E0 0C 90 03 4C 52 6C E0 07 B0 02 -&gt; AD 00 C0 EA EA EA C9 AC D0 03 4C 52 6C&nbsp; (&lt;&nbsp; to move player 2)</li>
</ul>
<p>To be able to check the keyboard while the game is usually busy animating the enemy fighter, I had to find where the keyboard strobe ($C010) was cleared, and NOP it. This happens several places in the main loop, but patching at $6EA9 kept the keyboard buffer long enough for me to check it.</p>
<ul>
<li>$6EA9: 8D 10 C0 -&gt; EA EA EA (keep from clearing keyboard strobe)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the second player controls were working, I modified the first player controls so both players could huddle around the keyboard and not cross over each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>$6e8e: 88 -&gt; C3 (C to move left instead of ctrl-H/left arrow)</li>
<li>$6e98: 95 -&gt; D6 (V to move right instead of ctrl-U/right arrow)</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonus: Now defaults to keyboard controls without having to hit K at the beginning.</p>
<ul>
<li>$b9a8: A5 C4 D0 00 -&gt; A9 01 85 C4 (default to keyboard control, ignores joystick)</li>
</ul>

This is one of those emails with some adjustments for sharing publicly. </p><p>Let me be honest right off the bat; this won’t be one of those “coding rules! anyone who doesn’t code shouldn’t be listened to!” cult pieces. Quite the contrary.</p><p>There is something deeply satisfying about creating things that solve a problem -any problem- in a better way. I mean there’s something deeply satisfying about creating things period. I don’t know exactly what it is -and we can argue forever about the existential anxiety roots of craving problem solving as a form of meaning for life- but it’s definitely there. I personally find building technology that simplifies complex problems or streamlines unnecessarily convoluted processes to be the most satisfying flavor of that.</p><p>That’s why despite not having a lot of savings (long story), having a 1 Million dollar job at my hands (thus finally comfort and building “wealth”) and against the advice of everyone I know (well except my brother) I decided it’s time to build computer science skills. To code.</p><h2>The backstory</h2><p>I started out my career on the “business” side of things on the other side of the world (America being “this side”). Landed a couple of decent -and excruciatingly boring- corporate jobs at Fortune 500 companies’ local offices for a couple of years before I quit without a plan. I had to. If I had stayed one more day I would have walked into the office and started banging my head against a wall screaming “None of us has a real job” on repeat. I kept applying to jobs I thought at the time would be intellectually challenging and that can be a gateway to get me into the “technology space” in America (more on why later). By some whiff of good luck I got into management consulting at its most sought after name; McKinsey. A couple of years later I transferred to their New York office, started a full-time MBA at Columbia and was well on my way to do what I wanted to do. A few years after that I had founded a -failed- startup, advised on some very interesting technology &amp; strategy topics (when I went back to McKinsey) and worked at a leadership role at a dream company of mine; Amazon. I was super lucky.</p><p>Until October 2019 I had a great job at Amazon. I led a big team doing product management, marketplace growth &amp; data science for one of the e-commerce businesses. It had been 3 years in that role during which the business grew ~800% into multi-billion dollars of revenue which was super exciting. I loved my team, my boss and the company culture. We built things many people wanted. In short, many real -not vanity- metrics were checked for me. In addition, my Amazon stock compensation had skyrocketed in value so I was making great money.</p><p>Ironically, I started getting the “walk in and bang my head against the wall” urge again. This time I knew what the issue was though so I made a plan. In fact I had known one of the issues for quite a long time but the time to act on it hadn’t come -for many personal reasons- until now.</p><p>While I was finalizing that plan -it involved quitting the large corporate world at least for a while- a headhunter reached out about a very senior role at a Fortune 100. After some back and forth, I agreed to talk because “there’s nothing to lose and it would be good networking anyway”. They quickly made me an offer. Self delusion kicked in.</p><p>The three delusion flavors of that week were: 1. “You can’t pass on landing a C-level job at a Fortune 100 in your damn 30s! Remember where you started!” 2. “You can still build stuff. After all they are a technology company -albeit old school- and you’ll lead a turn-around there” and the world champion of delusions: 3. “I’ll do this for a couple of years then I can do my plan and take all the risk I want”.</p><p>Long story short, I took the offer and put my plan on hold.</p><p>This job was very different from my previous jobs which have all been in either tech (Amazon &amp; the startup I founded and ran for a few years out of New York) or management consulting (McKinsey). It was much more “cushy”, focused a lot more on corporate politics and was not as intellectually challenging. My compensation would have added up to more than $1 Million per year, I was leading a large organization with hundreds of people, etc. It <strong>checked a lot of “vanity metrics”.</strong> <strong>None of that matters and never should. </strong>Misery often comes out of comfort without purpose.</p><p><strong>8 weeks into this new cushy job I quit (most of the comp is in equity that vests over time so I didn’t make much of those big bucks 🤷🏻‍♂️) to go back to what I had originally intended to do.</strong> It sounds crazy because of the opportunity cost but that is actually sort of the point.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600965088871_5937"><div><h3>The why: Florence</h3><p>I immigrated to the US 10 years ago because I wanted to be part of building technology that solves problems and -as naive or cliche as this sounds I don’t care- builds the future. There are many many other reasons to love America but “technology &amp; entrepreneurship paradise” was the main one for me. I moved my entire life for that despite having a flourishing career that would have been even much more financially lucrative -if you think short to medium term- elsewhere (for starters I would have paid literally zero taxes the last 10 years while making very similar money 😂). For someone who did not grow up rich by any stretch of the word this was not an easy string of decisions.</p><p>Here’s how I found myself describing it to a close friend who’s in very similar shoes a while back: “I’m not entirely sure why but I feel like we have a role in Florence during the renaissance. It’s almost impossible to put a price on that”</p><p>Back to that “plan” that this post is all about. As I sat down to think about what I want to do towards the end of my time at Amazon I followed a simple framework:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600968647285_7975"><div><p>I had known for a long time that if I want to truly build things that make a dent in some problems (i.e. #2 on the list above) I need to learn how to code properly. After all <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">software is -truly- eating the world</a>. But it quickly hit me how interconnected the answers to all 4 questions are. <strong>Layering skills</strong> that help you <strong>become a builder</strong> of things and <strong>taking the risks that come with that</strong> in the process are (or lack thereof) the answer to all 4 questions.</p><p>A couple of years ago I watched Marc Andreessen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8QHeAv4_XE&amp;t=1442s" target="_blank">talk</a> about the best career advice he heard. He heard it from the creator of Dilbert; Scott Adams (who wrote it <a href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html" target="_blank">here</a>). Layering and combining skills. I can’t overstate how much I think this is spot on. If you’re a business person who knows data science you can accomplish 10x more than any other business person. If you’re an engineer who understands business &amp; customers you can be 10x more effective than any other engineer. Etc.</p><p>I layered quite a bit of “business” skills over the years. Yet all these things fall under what I call the Business Generalist umbrella (I wrote about this <a href="https://rightalot.com/blog/2020519-the-generalist-dilemma" target="_blank">here</a>). I believe that in order to make meaningful contributions to solving hard problems in technology you need some level of participation in computer science (actually it could be participation in any kind of physics and engineering). Being able to build (hence coding) yourself not just manage others to do so vastly expands your ability to experiment, spot good ideas, develop stronger intuition and most importantly it makes you have skin in the game (see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075HYVP7C/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Nassim Taleb</a>).</p><p>I dabble in coding (although I am far from a professional developer) and when I do -for work or fun- it doesn’t feel like work most of the time. It feels like a hobby. Like you’re actually rolling up your sleeves and <strong>making</strong> the idea in your head. I also never felt like I’m working while I worked on small teams with people I really like that are solving something with a missionary rather than a mercenary mindset. It was definitely the case when I started my own company where a team of 5 survived for 2 years on just $200K of funding because we all were focused on building. But I’ve had this experience in other situations too.</p><p>The things I’d regret the most (work-wise) when I’m 80 are risks I did not take. And as -Jeff Bezos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ" target="_blank">puts it</a>- minimizing regret is something I believe many of us should aim for. The only real risk is taking no risks. Failure isn’t the worst outcome. Mediocrity is.</p><h3>What’s next</h3><p>I just got into <a href="http://www.lambdaschool.com/" target="_blank">Lambda School</a> and I haven’t been this excited about something in a long time. I chose Lambda over other programs including a Masters in CS for many reasons but the main one was simply that they have what I believe to be the best approach. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600968647285_11960"><div><p>I’ll be writing a separate post on the quest for how to study CS properly and why I think Lambda is the best option.</p><p>I’m going full in. I’m starting Lambda full-time to build CS skills, I’m talking with a few small teams about ideas and I am starting to put all what I’ve learned about business skills into online courses/newsletter. My first goals are finishing Lambda School with a skillset that enables me to build products and to build a side part-time profitable business that enables me to have the peace of mind to continue experimenting with big ideas.</p><p>I tweet<a href="http://twitter.com/byadham" target="_blank"> @byadham</a>&nbsp;. You can follow me there as I document what I learned from my previous journey and what I’m learning from what I’m doing now. </p><blockquote><p>There’s an Arabic saying attributed to<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahlil_Gibran">&nbsp;Khalil Gibran</a>; the brilliant author of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prophet_%28book%29">&nbsp;The Prophet</a>&nbsp;that roughly translates to: “For they should learn that the rich man is not who owns more but who needs less”.</p></blockquote><p>Cheers</p></div></div></div>]]>

Since this knowledge is scarce, a hidden problem is trying to <em>find </em>the people who have this knowledge.

      &nbsp;</span>
      </td><td>
      	<p><span size="2" face="Arial">The advances described are 
		the result of my research carried on for many years with the chief 
		object of transmitting electrical energy to great distances.&nbsp; The first 
		important practical realization of these efforts was the alternating 
		current power system now in universal use.&nbsp; I then turned my attention to 
		wireless transmission and was fortunate enough to achieve similar 
		success in this fruitful field, my discoveries and inventions being 
		employed throughout the world.&nbsp; In the course of this work, I mastered 
		the technique of high potentials sufficiently for enabling me to 
		construct and operate, in 1899, a wireless transmitter developing up to 
		twenty million volts.&nbsp; Some time before I contemplated the possibility of 
		transmitting such high tension currents over a narrow beam of radiant 
		energy ionizing the air and rendering it, in measure, conductive.&nbsp; After 
		preliminary laboratory experiments, I made tests on a large scale with 
		the transmitter referred to and a beam of ultra-violet rays of great 
		energy in an attempt to conduct the current to the high rarefied strata 
		of the air and thus create an auroral such as might be utilized for 
		illumination, especially of oceans at night.&nbsp; I found that there was some 
		virtue in the principal but the results did not justify the hope of 
		important practical applications although, some years later, several 
		inventors claimed to have produced a "death ray" in this manner.&nbsp; While 
		the published reports to this effect were entirely unfounded, I believe 
		that with the new transmitter to be built, this and many other wonders 
		will be achieved.&nbsp; Much time was devoted by me to the transmission of 
		radiant energy, in various forms, by reflectors and I perfected means 
		for increasing enormously the intensity of the effects, but was baffled 
		in all my efforts to materially reduce dispersion and became fully 
		convinced that this handicap could only be overcome by conveying the 
		power through the medium of small particles projected, at prodigious 
		velocity, from the transmitter.&nbsp; Electro-static repulsion was the only 
		means to this end and apparatus of stupendous force would have to be 
		developed, but granted that sufficient speed and energy could be 
		realized with a single row of minute bodies then there would be no 
		dispersion whatever even at great distance.&nbsp; Since the cross section of 
		the carriers might be reduced to almost microscopic dimensions an 
		immense concentration of energy, irrespective of distance, could be 
		attained.</span></p>
		<p><span size="2" face="Arial">When I undertook to carry out this plan in practice, the difficulties 
		seemed insurmountable.&nbsp; In the first place, a closed vacuum tube 
		could not be employed as no window could withstand the force of the 
		impact.&nbsp; This made it absolutely necessary to project the particles 
		in free air which meant that each could hold only an insignificant 
		charge.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, no matter how high the potential of the 
		terminal, the force of repulsion would be necessarily too small for the 
		purpose contemplated. . . . But by the application of my discoveries and 
		inventions it is possible to increase the force of repulsion more than a 
		million times and what was heretofore impossible, is rendered easy of 
		accomplishment.&nbsp; The successful carrying out of the plan involves a number of more or 
		less important improvements but the principal among these include the 
		following:</span></p>
		<p><span size="2" face="Arial">1. A new form of high vacuum tube open to the atmosphere.</span></p>
		<p><span size="2" face="Arial">2. Provisions for imparting to a minute particle an extremely high 
		charge.</span></p>
		<p><span size="2" face="Arial">3. A new terminal of relatively small dimensions and enormous potential.</span></p>
		<p><span size="2" face="Arial">4. An electro-static generator on a new principle and of very great 
		power.</span></p>

		cemented to a metallic socket 3, and an outer conduit 2, which is 
		tightly screwed to the socket by a nut 4, and has on the open side a 
		taper with a cylindrical end 9, of the same inside diameter as conduit 
		1.&nbsp; The socket 3, is bored out to provide a large chamber around the 
		inner conduit and carries a pipe 7, through which thoroughly desiccated 
		air or other gas under suitable pressure is supplied.&nbsp; The open end of 
		the inner and the tapering part of the outer conduit are ground to form 
		an expanding nozzle 8, through which the air escapes into the atmosphere 
		thereby creating a high vacuum in the inner conduit.&nbsp; The socket 3 has a 
		small central hole and is provided with an inside extension 5, and a 
		threaded outside projection 6, the latter serving for connection to a 
		container supplying automatically suitable particles or material for 
		same while the former fulfill the purpose of charging them as they 
		emerge from the hole.&nbsp; The conduit 1 and 2, may be made of fused quartz, pyrex glass or other refractory material and it is obviously desirable 
		that all the parts of the apparatus have small and nearly equal 
		coefficients of thermal expansion especially when the working medium, 
		which might also be superheated steam,<br>
		is at an elevated temperature.</span></p>
		<p><span face="Arial" size="2">It will be observed that in this tube I do away with the solid wall or 
		window indispensable in all types heretofore employed, producing the 
		high vacuum required and preventing the inrush of the air by a gaseous 
		jet of high velocity.&nbsp; Evidently, to secure this result, the dynamic 
		pressure of the jet must be at least equal to the external static 
		pressure.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><span face="Arial" size="2">Expressed in symbols:</span></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><span face="Arial" size="2">V<sup>2</sup>w/2g = P</span></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><span face="Arial" size="2">Assuming equality:</span></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><span face="Arial" size="2">V = √2g P/w</span></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><span face="Arial" size="2">in which equation V is the 
		speed of the jet at its entrance to channel 8 in meters, g the 
		acceleration of gravity likewise in meters, P the external pressure in 
		kilograms per square meter and w the normal weight of the air in 
		kilograms per cubic meter.&nbsp; Now</span></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><span face="Arial" size="2">g = 9.81 meters</span></p>
			<p><span face="Arial" size="2">P = 10332.9 kilograms</span></p>
			<p><span face="Arial" size="2">w = 1.2929 kilograms</span></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><span face="Arial" size="2">These values give</span></p>

			<p><span face="Arial" size="2">V = 396 meters</span></p>

		</blockquote>

		<img src="http://www.teslaradio.com/images/teleforce_fig_2-500.jpg" width="500" height="296"></p>
		<p><span face="Arial" size="2">Some allowance should be made for the frictional loss in the nozzle and 
		the outlet channel and also for the deflection of the jet.&nbsp; For most 
		purposes, the velocity need not be much greater, but as the degree of 
		rarefaction depends on the square of V, it is desirable to obtain as 
		high a value as practicable.&nbsp; Usually, vacuums obtained by a mercury 
		vapor pump are considered very high.&nbsp; In those, the velocity is only 280 
		meters per second but the vapor is 6.9 times heavier than air.&nbsp; Therefore 
		to get the same vacuum in the air jet, its speed should be 280 x 
		[6.9]1/2 = 735 meters.&nbsp; With a working medium at high temperature and 
		pressure, both within practicable limits, this value can be attained and 
		even exceeded.&nbsp; Thus, a gaseous jet of very high velocity affords a means 
		for closing the end of the tube, more perfectly than any window that can 
		be made while at the same time permitting and facilitating the exit of 
		the particles.&nbsp; Referring to fig. 2., it shows schematically a modified form of my tube 
		intended for various scientific and practical uses when it may be 
		preferable or necessary not to discharge the jet through the open end.&nbsp; The construction of the device will be easily understood in view of the 
		foregoing description like parts being similarly designated.&nbsp; A 
		cylindrical conduit 1, is provided as in fig. 1, but the outer cone is 
		replaced by a block 2, of lava or other insulating material shaped as 
		indicated and firmly cemented to the conduit 1, which is hermetically 
		joined by a nut 4, to a metallic plug 3, having a central hole, and 
		extensions 3 and 6, serving the purpose stated above.&nbsp; The working fluid, 
		as compressed desiccated air, is supplied by means of a pipe 7, to a 
		large annular space around conduit 1, and escapes through an expanding 
		nozzle 8, formed by the tapering part of the block and the end of the 
		conduit, into a chamber connected by a pipe 10, to a vacuum pump of 
		large capacity - not shown on the drawing - for carrying off not only 
		the air issuing from the nozzle but also that rushing in from the 
		outside through the open end 9.&nbsp; In order to minimize the volume of the 
		latter, I avail myself of an invention of mine known as the "valvular 
		conduit" by providing the wall of the open end 9, with recesses as 
		indicated giving rise to whirls and eddies which use up some of the 
		energy of the stream and reduce its velocity.&nbsp; In this way, a pressure of 
		about 100 millimeters of mercury can be readily maintained in the 
		chamber increasing greatly the expansion ration of the air and its speed 
		through the nozzle.</span></p>
		<p><span face="Arial" size="2">It is hardly necessary to remark that my open vacuum tubes require 
		mechanical power for operation which may range from 10 to 20 h.p., but 
		this drawback is insignificant when considering the important advantages 
		they offer and I anticipate that they will be extensively employed.</span></p>
		<p><span face="Arial" size="2">It remains to be explained how such a tube is utilized for imparting to 
		a particle to be projected a very great charge.&nbsp; Imagine that the small 
		spherical body be placed in a nearly perfect vacuum and electrically 
		connected to the large sphere forming the high potential terminal of the 
		transmitter.&nbsp; By virtue of the connection, the small sphere will then be 
		at the potential of the large one no matter what its distance from the 
		same but the quantity of electricity stored on the small sphere will 
		vary greatly with the distance and be proportionate to the difference of 
		its potential and that of the adjacent medium.&nbsp; If the small sphere is 
		very close to the large one, this …</span></p></td></div></div>

			<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514OQW-WXvL._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="A Pocket Guide To CHINA: Including Milton Caniff Cartoon Strip: Milton Caniff, Various members Special Services Division, US Army: Amazon.com: Books" width="463" height="571"></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/hgp/id/681">Pocket Guide to China</a></strong> is a 64 page primer for American soldiers stationed in China during World War II written by unknown personnel of the Special Service Division of the Army Service Forces of the United States Army. The text offers insights into Chinese behavior, cultural values, food, cleanliness, social structure, military capabilities, and everything else an intrepid American spending years in the deep interior of a foreign land might need to know. The Guide is a charming time capsule of old-school liberalism, propaganda, and clunky-yet-earnest cultural tolerance, and while it’s too short for me to write a deep dive, I couldn’t help but do a quick write-up about it.</p>

<p>Much of the text is what you’d expect from a 1940s sociological analysis. There’s a lot of just-so generalizations which are probably good heuristics for behavior, but you can never quite tell if any particular advice is well-grounded, or just the vague sense of one random guy. For instance:</p>
<p>(I find it helps if you read all these quotes in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRp2u8d7lrg">old-timey newscaster voice</a>.)</p>
<blockquote><p>“Realize in advance that the Chinese, friendly and spontaneous and natural as they are, have a few special likes and dislikes. They do not like to be touched. They don’t like to be slapped on the back, or even to shake hands, although some of the modern ones have learned this form of salutation. So don’t put your hands on anybody, in fun or fury or affection, until you know the person very well indeed.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Or:</p>
<blockquote><p>“You may want to buy something to take home to the girl friend. It is customary for the shopkeeper to ask considerably more than an article is worth. If you pay what is asked, he will not respect you for it. If you argue him down too much, he would prefer not to sell to you at all. If you pay about half to two-thirds what he asks, he will admire you and enjoy the transaction. But above all keep good humored throughout. In China it is a sign of bad breeding to grow heated over a purchase whether it is made successfully or not.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Having spent quite a bit of time in China myself, it’s also hilarious how accurate some advice still is:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is usually wise, in personal dealings with a Chinese helper or assistant, to give him a problem and let him handle it in his own way. However, make sure that he understands you. You will rarely hear a Chinese say “I don’t know” when you ask him a question. “Yes” is a stock answer and this can make for no little confusion if you don’t watch out. But if you explain carefully and protect his self-respect you won’t have any trouble.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the potential over-generalizations, it’s all well-intentioned. For a random American soldier who had never been to Canada, let alone Asia, he could do a lot worse than following these guidelines when starting a multi-year stint in inland China.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yr3LeQd.png" alt="PHOTOS: American G.I.s' 'A Pocket Guide to China' circa 1943 is comedy gold – Thatsmags.com" width="701" height="428"></p>
<p>More importantly, the Guide tries to promote cooperation between Americans and their distant allies in the Orient. Thus the central paradigm of the Guide is that though Chinese people do lots of odd things, and look nothing like us, and know nothing about us… that doesn’t matter. We’re all on the same team.</p>
<blockquote><p>“…you have to show the Chinese that Americans treat the Chinese as we treat any of our allies, and that we respect them as human beings on an equality with ourselves. Sure, there are differences. So what? There are similarities too. If you forget the differences and think of them as neighbors, as people who eat, sleep, work, and raise families as we do, you’ll be over the first hurdle.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Discourage anyone who acts as though the Chinese are queer. They are not queer. After all, there are more people in the world eating Chinese food and wearing Chinese clothes than there are eating American food and wearing American clothes. They live their way and we live ours. If you respect them, they will respect you.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s especially emphasized that as strange as Chinese people may seem in so many different ways, they’re just like us on what really matters:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Of all the peoples of Asia, the Chinese are most like Americans. Those who know both people often remark at their likeness. One of the reasons, perhaps, is that we both live in countries where there is plenty of space and a great variety of climate and food. We are alike, too, because we both love independence and individual freedom.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The obvious subtext of a lot of these sections is that though the Guide itself preaches tolerance and charity toward our distant allies, the Guide authors are definitely expecting the average American soldier to be weirded out by the Chinese and automatically fall back on racism. But the Guide valiantly fights against that for moral, logical, and strategic reasons:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If you think of the Chinese as a yellow-skinned people of a totally different race from us, you probably will never get to know them. What’s more, you’ll be playing right into the hands of Hitler and the Japs. Japan will harp on about the color question first, last, and all the time. She will tell the Chinese what she has been telling them ever since Pearl Harbor – that Americans look down on non-white peoples and that the Chinese can never hope to be treated on terms of equality by America. ‘Why fight for the white man?’ Japan dins into Chinese ears.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Those [Chinese] you saw in America may have come from one small part in China – the city of Canton. Judging all Chinese by those who live in one small part of the country is like judging all Americans by the residents of Hoboken, New Jersey.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I found it pretty remarkable how wise and uplifting much of the Guide is. There are some legitimately great passages about showing charity to radically different ideas and searching for common values with a people not easily understood. It’s not what you’d expect from a sociological analysis written in the 1940s.</p>
<p>But… it’s still a sociological analysis written in the 1940s:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Another likeness is that we are both humorous people. The Chinese love a joke just as well as we do, and they laugh at the same sort of thing. Their stock jokes are the same as ours – about professors, and doctors, and Irishmen – the Chinese equivalent for the Irish being people from Hunan province.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Though it’s 64 pages long, the <strong>Pocket Guide to China</strong> is a short read (30+ minutes) and I recommend that anyone with an interest in China, the Asian front of WW2, or pre-civil rights era views on race and culture check it out. You can read the whole thing at this <a href="https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/hgp/id/681">link</a>.</p>

<p>This was a feature Apple prototyped but never shipped that was near and dear to my heart. The feature addressed two things.</p>



<p>First, people often remember the app they used to create a document or when they worked on it last. It’s harder to remember the name of the document or where they put it. I see people freeze up when the OS asks them where to file something and what to name it. I think this is still a great shortcoming in macOS.</p>



<p>In addition, there’s the question of why does it matter what the name or location of a file is? Why waste time naming and filing things away if you can find it because you remember you created it in MS Word yesterday?</p>



<p>Secondly, when it came to minimized windows, especially those minimized into the application icon—a feature that still exists today—I saw that people would perceive those windows as lost.</p>

<p>Now, this doesn’t seem quite as powerful as it should until you imagine that you are chatting in Messages and you want to open a Preview document. A click and hold gets you access to all open documents without leaving the context of Messages.</p>

<p>If you chose that option, you would see an arranged view of all the open windows for the application as well as minimized windows. Here are some variations on that theme.</p>







<h3>Recents</h3>



<p>Finally, there was a token effort to look at recents and here is the only screenshot I could find. Unfortunately, it’s very small. The idea is click-and-hold on any document-based application icon would show open windows and recently opened documents.</p>



<p>I think this was a far superior experience to opening an app and being dumped in a folder that may or may not contain the document you want. It may have documents going back years (yes you can sort them if you in the right view.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>



<p>I worked on a lot of great features that shipped that I’m proud of. But, the agony of seeing something die that you loved can be very painful.</p>



<p>On the positive side, sometimes bits and pieces or even a completely reimagined version of something you love sees the light of day.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><img alt="Chaos-Mesh-1.0 - Chaos-Engineering-on-Kubernetes-Made-Easier" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-mesh-1.0-22c3415bc75bde8501087d6c7c154cd5.png"></p><p>Today, we are proud to announce the general availability of Chaos Mesh® 1.0, following its entry into CNCF as a <a href="https://pingcap.com/blog/announcing-chaos-mesh-as-a-cncf-sandbox-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sandbox project</a> in July, 2020.</p><p>Chaos Mesh 1.0 is a major milestone in the project’s development. After 10 months of effort within the open-source community, Chaos Mesh is now ready in terms of functionality, scalability, and ease of use. Here are some highlights.</p><h2>Powerful chaos support</h2><p><a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> originated in the testing framework of <a href="https://pingcap.com/products/tidb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiDB</a>, a distributed database, so it takes into account the possible faults of a distributed system. Chaos Mesh provides comprehensive and fine-grained fault types, covering the Pod, the network, system I/O, and the kernel. Chaos experiments are defined in YAML, which is fast and easy to use.</p><p>Chaos Mesh 1.0 supports the following fault types:</p><ul><li>clock-skew: Simulates clock skew</li><li>container-kill: Simulates the container being killed</li><li>cpu-burn: Simulates CPU pressure</li><li>io-attribution-override: Simulates file exceptions</li><li>io-fault: Simulates file system I/O errors</li><li>io-latency: Simulates file system I/O latency</li><li>kernel-injection: Simulates kernel failures</li><li>memory-burn: Simulates memory pressure</li><li>network-corrupt: Simulates network packet corruption</li><li>network-duplication: Simulates network packet duplication</li><li>network-latency: Simulate network latency</li><li>network-loss: Simulates network loss</li><li>network-partition: Simulates network partition</li><li>pod-failure: Simulates continuous unavailability of Kubernetes Pods</li><li>pod-kill: Simulates the Kubernetes Pod being killed</li></ul><h2>Visual chaos orchestration</h2><p>The Chaos Dashboard component is a one-stop web interface for Chaos Mesh users to orchestrate chaos experiments. Previously, Chaos Dashboard was only available for testing TiDB. With Chaos Mesh 1.0, it is available to everyone. Chaos Dashboard greatly simplifies the complexity of chaos experiments. With only a few mouse clicks, you can define the scope of the chaos experiment, specify the type of chaos injection, define scheduling rules, and observe the results of the chaos experiment—all in the same web interface.</p><p><img alt="Chaos Dashboard" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-dashboard-0a1e48c54968d276f174801a1364ce21.gif"></p><h2>Grafana plug-in for enhanced observability</h2><p>To further improve the observability of chaos experiments, Chaos Mesh 1.0 includes a Grafana plug-in to allow you to directly display real-time chaos experiment information on your application monitoring panel. Currently, the chaos experiment information is displayed as annotations. This way, you can simultaneously observe the running status of the application and the current chaos experiment information.</p><p><img alt="Chaos status and application status on Grafana" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-status-460b054f3e2ee0898d2236a5137bc30e.png"></p><h2>Safe and controllable chaos</h2><p>When we conduct chaos experiments, it is vital that we keep strict control over the chaos scope or “blast radius.” Chaos Mesh 1.0 not only provides a wealth of selectors to accurately control the scope of the experiment, but it also enables you to set protected Namespaces to protect important applications. You can also use Namespace permissions to limit the scope of Chaos Mesh to a specific Namespace. Together, these features make chaos experiments with Chaos Mesh safe and controllable.</p><h2>Try it out now</h2><p>You can quickly deploy Chaos Mesh in your Kubernetes environment through the <code>install.sh</code> script or the Helm tool. For specific installation steps, please refer to the <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/installation/installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh Getting Started</a> document. In addition, thanks to the <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/interactiveTutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katakoda interactive tutorial</a>, you can also quickly get your hands on Chaos Mesh without having to deploy it.</p><p>If you haven’t upgraded to 1.0 GA, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v1.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.0 Release Notes</a> for the changes and upgrade guidelines.</p><h2>Thanks</h2><p>Thanks to all our Chaos Mesh <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributors</a>!</p><p>If you are interested in Chaos Mesh, you’re welcome to join us by submitting issues, or contributing code, documentation, or articles. We look forward to your participation and feedback!</p></section></div>]]>

		<p><em>There are many frameworks with which to evaluate unintended consequences. So far in my writing here I’ve looked at examples arranged around a theme (species introduction, food, government policy, human behavior etc) where there is a somewhat clear relationship between cause and effect (even if sometimes only in hindsight). I haven’t yet touched frameworks of complexity and won’t do so until I go deeper into more second-order effects.</em></p>
<p><em>This week I step back and look at basic categories of unintended consequences and call out potential new areas of exposure to second-order effects.</em></p>
<figure id="attachment_499" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-499"><img src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Unintended-Consequences-Categories-1024x742.png" alt="Unintended Consequences Categories" width="525" height="380" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Unintended-Consequences-Categories-1024x742.png 1024w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Unintended-Consequences-Categories-300x217.png 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Unintended-Consequences-Categories-768x556.png 768w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Unintended-Consequences-Categories.png 1390w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-499">General categories of unintended consequences</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Unexpected Benefits</strong> are, as the name describes, positive yet unplanned outcomes. I position the starting point (“Event”) differently since there was no related goal in these cases. In the chart above, the actual event (A) has happened and later on positive outcome (B) is found.</p>
<p>My earlier <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/what-are-unexpected-benefits/">post</a> calls into question some common examples of this category, such as no-man’s lands, sunken ships turning into reefs, and drugs producing unexpected benefits. And as we look for them broadly, benefits will always be found. Positive benefits are <strong>impossible to not find</strong> as long as you think broadly and creatively.</p>
<p>But my question is just how applicable the above common examples are as unexpected benefits. If we understand (or eventually understand) a cause and effect relationship, such as the reclamation of nature over a certain time in a new no-man’s land, then the benefit is <strong>predictable and even unavoidable</strong>. That doesn’t strike me as an unexpected. The new drug effect from above (where inter-reactions are not yet fully understood) is closer to a good example of this category. See my earlier <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/what-are-unexpected-benefits/">post</a> for details.</p>
<p><strong>Unexpected Drawbacks</strong>&nbsp;occur when an intended change in an item or group leads to a worsening in a different item or group.&nbsp;In the chart above, the goal was to improve (A) and later it is learned that (B) has been made worse.</p>
<p>Some of these drawbacks may be to populations smaller than the beneficiaries. For example, relatively larger passenger populations who benefit from rideshare companies do so while traditional taxi companies and taxi medallion owners suffer.</p>
<p>In addition to these examples, I believe a way to identify potential exposure to an unexpected drawback is to be aware of&nbsp;<a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/anything-at-scale/">anything new being done at scale</a>.</p>
<p>An example I have not yet written about is the change in media business models in the last couple decades. In general, in the past, access to national news media was limited and controlled in few popular TV networks and large-scale newspaper syndicates. With online distribution and the scattering of media sources from the above to include blogs, podcasts, social media, and more, the business model now revolves around fomenting arguments and taking sides in order to generate more views and shares, which then fuel ad revenue. Good for the media businesses that can do it, but it seems to be bad for media consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Perverse Results</strong> are often the most frustrating category, yet they are common.&nbsp;In the chart above, the goal was to improve (A) but what actually happens is (A) becomes worse.</p>
<p>We’ve discussed this category in <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/food-from-thought/">deep plow farming and agricultural subsidies</a>, <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/the-self-defeating-prophecy/">self-defeating prophesies</a>, <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/importing-risk-and-risky-regulations/">endangered species regulatory protection</a>, the <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/the-cobra-effect-redesigned/">cobra effect</a>, and more.</p>
<p>I do make the claim that in some situations (the animal examples of the cobra effect, especially) the solution is often built into the problem. In other situations, like in deep plowing, small tests could have prevented widescale adoption, but the issue was political, not scientific (or that science became political).</p>

<p>This is a short list of areas where there is potential for unintended consequences (though these have not yet become big problems and I hope they never will). I’ll cover this list and others in more detail in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/autonomous-vehicles-scaling-risk/"><strong>Autonomous vehicles</strong></a> (AVs). There is an expected class of social changes related to AVs that are linear in nature. That’s the problem with them… Traffic reduction (traffic might actually increase), accident reduction (yet there will then be exposure to systemic risk to hacking or bugs), and more.</p>
<p><strong>Cannabis legalization</strong>. If cannabis replaces alcohol as the intoxicant of choice, there will be different effects on health and behavior.</p>
<p><strong>CRISPR</strong>, the inexpensive gene editing technology was discovered and developed based on the process certain bacteria use. The potential for second-order effects comes from CRISPR’s low cost and availability and that changes made to organisms’ genes could mean that those changes are passed down to progeny.&nbsp;New unpredictable changes in future organisms could appear.</p>
<p><strong>Drones</strong>. As surveillance and military tools, drones change the risks shared between adversaries internationally. What will happen if the same technology is applied domestically in the US or other countries? Will the ease of drone weaponization mean that large outdoor gatherings will not be allowed (at least without anti-drone technology)?</p>
<p><strong>Education</strong>. The new need for endowment-building (I earlier did cover&nbsp;<a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/the-university-fundraising-arms-race/">university funding</a> as a forward-looking second-order effect) puts universities in a timing trade off (raise money now and potentially deal with more problems later).</p>
<p>Another potential effect: while the increase in STEM education has positive roots, what if the education as delivered actually bores students and turns them off to the sciences? Could STEM education have the reverse effect intended?</p>
<p>Also, the large growth in student loans, now at $1.4 trillion in the US, has the markings of a large potential problem waiting for a spark to set off defaults.</p>
<p><strong>Over-encouragement of startups</strong>. In some markets, startups are oversold as good choices for talent. But statistically, most of the time talent will earn less building a startup than working at a growth-stage or stable business. Then again, part of startup compensation comes from feeling excited about your work and the potential for asymmetric payoffs. In many markets, where startups are the most hyped, it is not the founders (who take more of the risk), but others who more regularly benefit. Groups more likely to benefit include investors who can spread their risk around, community organizers who build their own brand, and “sellers of shovels” to the startups themselves. So here the unintended consequence could be that by encouraging more startups, you actually make life more difficult for the startup founders.</p>
<p><em>OK, we stepped back this week and will be back with a new look at second-order effects next week.</em></p>
