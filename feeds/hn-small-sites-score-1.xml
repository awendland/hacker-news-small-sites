<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Hey team,</p>

<p>This is the continuation (and end) of the <em>Language(s) of Science</em> series that we started <a href="https://languagetools.io/forum/t/3191" target="_blank">here</a>. It's a long one, so let's dive right into it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/b6P7x4S/Part-II.png"></p><h3>English is the language of science</h3>
<p>Today, English is the dominant language of science. There are many factors - political, economic, social, or regulatory - that help explain this phenomenon. The geopolitical dominance of the British Empire and then of the United States in the last few centuries gave the language a head-start, and a momentum. Rich English-speaking countries are some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_scientific_and_technical_journal_articles" target="_blank">most prolific</a> in terms of scientific output. The quasi-totality of the <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php?type=j" target="_blank">most influential scientific journals</a> are English-language, and an <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-five-companies-control-more-than-half-of-academic-publishing" target="_blank">oligopolistic academic publishing sector</a> reinforces a monolingual scientific communication. English might be the <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/most-popular-languages-in-the-world.html" target="_blank">most widely spoken language</a> in the world, at more than 1 billion people. The "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_or_perish" target="_blank">publish or perish</a>" culture, where funding and tenure are conditional on publication performance above all else, and the incentive systems that result from this lead scientists to write in the language that will increase the likelihood of the article getting published, reaching a large readership, and garnering citations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Intentionally or not, the whole system seems to be clamouring for English to be <em>the</em> language in which science is done.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h3>The two sides of the mirror</h3>
<p>The existence of a <em>lingua franca</em> in science has undeniable advantages. It removes all linguistic barriers – except one – to communicating and accessing scientific developments the world over. It underpins the internationalisation of universities, which broadens the education and career prospects of students and professors worldwide. It further standardizes the production of knowledge, which facilitates organization of and access to knowledge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The factors listed above, be they implicit or explicit, could be described as high-level characteristics of the global system we inhabit, only tenuously related to science. However, as desirable as the resulting advantages are, their corollaries are no less hypothetical, if much less researched.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h3>Large scale effects...</h3>
<p>A bird-eye look at the dominance of English yields some striking insights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the scientific field, and the data one looks at, <a href="https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/leap.1089" target="_blank">up to 97% of scholarly publication</a> can be in English, with hard sciences being more monolingual than humanities. Even in countries with a large scientific output, articles are written in English-only, and <a href="https://www.researchtrends.com/issue-31-november-2012/the-language-of-future-scientific-communication/" target="_blank">increasingly so</a>. Journals that used to be plurilingual are increasingly <a href="https://blog.scielo.org/en/2016/05/10/the-adoption-of-english-among-scielo-brazil-journals-has-been-increasing/" target="_blank">becoming English-only</a>. Non-English-language journals are further hidden from view by their <a href="https://blog.scielo.org/en/2015/08/02/motion-to-repudiate-mr-jeffrey-bealls-classist-attack-on-scielo/" target="_blank">exclusion from leading journal indexes</a>. Scientific terminology often remains confined to English, making other languages potentially <a href="http://lcn.pascalobservatory.org/sites/default/files/joe_lo_bianco_-_language_place_and_learning_-_august_2007.pdf" target="_blank">inadequate for doing science</a>. The assumption that <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/english-language-science-can-cause-problems-180961623/" target="_blank">all important information is in English</a> biases understanding of science (the flu virus H5N1, which could have been a major pandemic, famously <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/430955a" target="_blank">went unnoticed for months</a> because it was first reported in Chinese, not in English).&nbsp;</p>

<p>At a time where science is suffering from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis" target="_blank">replication crisis</a> and a crisis of trust, it is desirable to facilitate discussion around each and every publication, and few languages have more speakers than English. But then again, a monolingual research produced for an exclusive (if heterogeneous) readership provides for little diversity in terms of perspective, and the perverse outcomes of an English-only science weaken the local nature of research communities and remove research cultures from the very contexts that nurtured them.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h3>...and their individual underpinnings</h3>
<p>English is so <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2018/03/13/domination-english-language-journal-publishing-hurting-scholarship-many-countries" target="_blank">deeply ingrained</a> in the metrics of science that it is more a requirement than a choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the costs of translation services are prohibitively high for most scientists, few of them can afford to produce two versions of their paper, so they often choose to write in English only. This includes humanities: researchers who are interested in fundamentally local topics (the Quechua language, or Bantu traditions, or Spanish history) are increasingly compelled to publish their work in English. Those scientists who can afford producing their papers both in English and their local language need to contend with bans on dual publication enforced by most journals, which forbid papers to be republished elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This situation is also profoundly unfair, because <a href="http://www.teljournal.org/article_66109_85c526124faf5bde548ad8bf65cf9eb3.pdf" target="_blank">proficiency in English is not evenly distributed and is dependent on socioeconomic status</a>: an English-only science provides a massive advantage to those who have English as their first language, or who have been able to access high-quality education in English.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And this disadvantage has a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/08/english-universal-language-science-research/400919/" target="_blank">compound effect</a>. Those with a poorer level of English are less likely to choose to study science, are more likely to lag behind, take longer to process their English-language material, incur more costs and take longer to produce research, are refused publication because of language mistakes, are more likely to face prejudice because of their poorer writing, are less likely to have good metrics and get funding, can even get snubbed in favor of their Anglophone collaborators in media. The list goes on. The effect is that less people do science, and a large majority of scientists work in a language they're less confident in, while those who choose to work in a language other than English have trouble making themselves visible.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h3>Potential solutions</h3>
<p>An English-first science <a href="http://eprints.rclis.org/23682/1/Current-socio-published-non-Sage-format.pdf" target="_blank">impedes the development of national and regional research communities and cultures</a>, limits both the quantity and quality of research, <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/english-language-science-can-cause-problems-180961623/" target="_blank">allows loss of knowledge</a>, and reduces science's diversity. While the final balance is unclear, it is undeniable that global research does not only stand to gain from a <em>lingua franca</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the criticisms presented here, the dominance of English in science is unlikely to be imperilled in the foreseeable future, because too many feedback loops within the systems that science exists in buttress this supremacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, some mechanisms push back against this, directly or indirectly. Open-access journals, which are becoming increasingly commonplace, have <a href="https://www.openaccess.nl/en/what-is-open-access/pros-and-cons" target="_blank">many advantages</a> over traditional journals and these qualities indirectly make the existence of non-English journals more viable. Machine translation, while still being inadequate for translating complex academic language, is constantly improving and lowering translation costs. Some of the largest journal indexes have started accepting non-English-language journals, and non-English indexes (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SciELO" target="_blank">SciELO</a>) are gaining ground, which in turn fuels their advocacy for a more diverse science.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But further efforts, big and small, are required. While there has not been enough discussion to identify what these could be, existing literature seems to converge on some ideas. National policies that <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2000933" target="_blank">financially support scientists to learn English, translate their work, and publish it</a> could strengthen national, and global, research. Dual publishing bans, which benefit journals at the expense of the community at large, need to be regulated away. Anglophone journals should make efforts to welcome multilingual research, and the metrics that scientists are evaluated against need to decouple themselves from English. The negative effects of an English-first science need to be more thoroughly researched. Finally, the <a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-10-english-lingua-franca-science.html" target="_blank">individual experiences</a> of those who have had to abandon science, who struggle against a system geared against them, experiences that are deeply human, harrowing, and relatable, need to become a focus of popular science writing, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/27/peru-student-roxana-quispe-collantes-thesis-inca-language-quechua" target="_blank">achievements</a> need to be celebrated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To quote <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/does-english-have-to-be-the-dominant-language-of-science/" target="_blank">another article</a>: "<em>The language we use when we speak science is as important as any other part in a methods section and should be deliberate and fair.</em>"</p>

November 22, 2020 | https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/israeli-queues | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/israeli-queues">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A queue is a data structure that holds up elements for a brief period of time until a peripheral processing system is ready to process them. The most common implementation of a queue is a FIFO queue - First In First Out - that evicts the element that was inserted the first i.e. it evicts the one that has spent the most time in the queue. There are other variations of Queues one of which is called Priority Queue.</p>
<p>In Priority Queue, every element is associated with a priority, usually provided by the user during enqueueing; This associated priority is used during eviction where the element with the highest priority is evicted first during dequeuing.</p>
<p>In this essay, we take a detailed look into a variation of Priority Queue, fondly called Israeli Queues, where the priority of the element is defined by the affinity of it with one of its "friends" in the queue. Israeli Queues were first introduced in the paper <a href="https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/2152975/632939.pdf">Polling with batch service</a> by Boxma, O. J., Wal, van der, J., &amp; Yechiali, U in the year 2007.</p>

<p>Queues in Israel are usually unorganized, due to which people tend to find their friends, who are already waiting, and instead of adhering to the usual protocol of joining at the back end, they cut through and directly join their friends. Israeli Queues mimic this behavior and hence get this <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15326340802427497">punny name</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99894937-fddc4380-2cac-11eb-8a73-a4dc5c490d2b.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99894937-fddc4380-2cac-11eb-8a73-a4dc5c490d2b.png"></p>
<p>Israeli Queues are a variation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue">Priority Queues</a> where instead of associating priority with the element to be enqueued, the priority is implicitly derived using the "friend" element and it joins right at the back end of the group that the friend belongs to. The function signature of the enqueue operation is as shown below, while other operations like <code>dequeue</code> and <code>peek</code> remains fairly similar.</p>
<pre><code>

<span><span>void</span> <span>enqueue</span><span>(israeli_queue * q, element * e, element * f)</span></span>;
</code></pre>
<h2>How could this help?</h2>
<p>Every Data Structures is designed to solve a niche use case efficiently and Israeli Queues are no different as they prove to be super-efficient where one could batch and process similar elements or where the <em>set-up</em> cost for a task is high.</p>
<p>Consider a system where a queue is used to hold up heterogeneous tasks and there is a single machine taking care of processing. Now if some of these tasks are similar and have a high <em>set-up or preparation cost</em>, for example downloading large metafiles, or spinning up a parallel infrastructure, or even setting up persistent connections with device farms, queuing them closer and processing them sequentially or in batch helps in reducing redundant processing and computation by promoting reuse.</p>
<h2>Issue of starvation</h2>
<p>By enqueuing elements in between Israeli Queues reduces redundant processing, but by doing that it makes itself vulnerable to the classical case of starvation. Elements stuck at the rear end of the list could potentially starve for longer durations if elements having "friends" in the queue keep coming in at high frequency.</p>
<p>The original implementation of Israeli Queues suggests batch processing where instead of processing tasks one at a time, it processes a batch (a group of friends) in one go. This proves to be super-handy when the time required to processes a single task is much lower than the set-up cost for it.</p>
<h2>Implementation Guidelines</h2>
<p>The best way to implement Israeli Queues is by using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list">Doubly Linked List</a> with a bunch of pointers pointing to the head and tail of groups within it. Insertion to an existing group happens at the tail of it while if the element has no friend element, then it goes at the tail end of the list and forms its own group.</p>
<p>A constraint that could be added during implementation is that the friend element should always be the leader (head) element of the group. Details of the implementation could be tweaked so long the core concept remains unaltered.</p>

<p>Israeli Queues were the outcome of a problem statement dealing with Polling Systems. Polling System usually contains <code>N</code> queues <code>Q1</code>, <code>Q2</code>, ..., <code>Qn</code> where the processing unit visits each queue in cyclic order processing one element at a time i.e. <code>Q1</code>, <code>Q2</code>, ..., <code>Qn</code>, <code>Q1</code>, <code>Q2</code>, ..., <code>Qn</code>, etc.</p>
<p>When the server attends a queue instead of processing just one element from it, it processes the entire batch present in the queue utilizing the setup-cost efficiently assuming that time to process an element from a queue is much lesser than the set-up cost.</p>

<p>I have mentioned that applications duplicate operating system's functionality.
How severe issue is it and what kind of consequences there are?</p>
<p><a href="https://gottcode.org/kapow/">Kapow punch clock</a> tracks hours and constructs reports.
Its author has done well in maintaining complexity.
The whole program is only 4171 lines (+594 lines of copyright headers),
with total 146kB of source code.
This post presents a program for Plan 9 that serves the same purpose.
Finally lets do some comparison.</p>
<p><img alt="kapow screenshot" src="https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/kapow.png"></p>
<p>The source code presented is attached: <a href="https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/task.zip">task.zip</a></p>
<h2>task entries</h2>
<p>The clock has this kind of a nice directory -tab.
I have seen this tool being used.
The tabs were used to track customer_project_day instead of projects.
The dialog looks like a file browser.</p>
<p>The 'task' program treats each task as a file.
For instance here's the '0.kapow.task'.</p>
<pre><code>Punch clock port experiment
</code><code>start: Sat Nov 21 11:00:06 GMT 2020</code></pre>
<p>This is a running task.
When I'm done, I append in the stop: -line.</p>
<p>The time stamps aren't using Finnish abbreviations for weekdays or months
and it is bit inconvenient for me.
Though they are slightly more convenient than unix timestamps
because I can type the hour there if I forget to mark it.</p>
<p>The system benefits from not needing a locale to parse dates.
If you don't like english dates, you can use ISO-8601 timestamps,
those should work as well and look like this:</p>
<pre><code>2020-11-21T20:16:49+00:00</code></pre>
<h2>task/start and task/stop</h2>
<p>To start a task you write a timestamp into a file and mark it to start the task.
Although it'd be easy to do it manually,
I add few convenience scripts so you don't lose an entry
just because you write &gt; instead of &gt;&gt;.
Here's task/start and task/stop.
They are used to mark a task completed or start a task.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>rfork e
</code><code>for (taskname in $*) { echo start: `{date} &gt;&gt; $taskname }
</code><code>
</code><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>rfork e
</code><code>for (taskname in $*) { echo stop: `{date} &gt;&gt; $taskname }</code></pre>
<p>You can consider these are up to you to configure,
they're for your convenience.</p>
<h2>task/span</h2>
<p>Next you need a tool to know task status. Here's the 'task/span':</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>if (~ $#* 1) {
</code><code>  if (test -f $1) {
</code><code>    rfork e
</code><code>    taskname=$1
</code><code>    start=`{sed -n 's/^start: (.*)$/\1/p' &lt;$taskname | xargs seconds}
</code><code>    stop=`{sed -n 's/^stop: (.*)$/\1/p' &lt;$taskname | xargs seconds}
</code><code>    if (~ $stop '') stop=`{date | xargs seconds}
</code><code>
</code><code>    dt=`{echo print $stop(1) - $start(1) | bc}
</code><code>    s=`{echo print $dt % 60 | bc}
</code><code>    m=`{echo print $dt / 60 % 60 | bc}
</code><code>    h=`{echo print $dt / 3600 | bc}
</code><code>    echo span: $h hours $m minutes $s seconds
</code><code>    }
</code><code>  if not { echo not a file: $1&gt;[1=2]; exit usage }
</code><code>  }
</code><code>if not { echo usage: $0 taskfile &gt;[1=2]; exit usage }</code></pre>
<p>It presents how many hours, minutes, seconds have been spent in the task.
If the task is still running, it uses the current time as range.</p>
<h2>task/report</h2>
<p>The 'task/report' sorts the tasks and builds a report out of them.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>rfork e
</code><code>tasks=`{for (t in $*) {
</code><code>  p=`{sed -n 's/^start: (.*)$/\1/p' $t | xargs seconds}
</code><code>  echo $p $t } | sort -n | awk '{ print $2 }'}
</code><code>
</code><code>for(taskname in $tasks) {
</code><code>  span=`{task/span $taskname | awk '{ print $2,$3,$4,$5 }'}
</code><code>  start=`{sed -n 's/^start: (.*)$/(\1)/p' $taskname}
</code><code>  stop=`{sed -n 's/^stop: (.*)$/(\1)/p' $taskname}
</code><code>  if (~ $stop '') { echo $span $start '*' }
</code><code>  if not { echo $span $start }
</code><code>  sed '/^start:|^stop:/d' $taskname | sed 's/^/  /g'
</code><code>  }
</code><code>
</code><code>total=0
</code><code>for(taskname in $tasks) {
</code><code>  d=`{task/span $taskname | awk '{ print $2,$4 }'}
</code><code>  total=`{echo print $total + ($d(1) '*' 60) + $d(2) | bc}
</code><code>}
</code><code>echo total: `{echo print $total / 60 | bc} hours `{echo print $total % 60 | bc} minutes</code></pre>
<p>When a task is ongoing, this utility shows a star on it's entry.
This script could be customized for different uses.
Right now it's a plaintext report.</p>
<h2>display</h2>
<p>Some people like to have a display that tracks what is going on.
The 'task/track' -script executes a command periodically every minute
and the window where it runs is cleaned every time it repeats.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>task/report `{rc -c $"*} &gt;/dev/text
</code><code>while (sleep 60) task/report `{rc -c $"*} &gt; /dev/text</code></pre>
<p>It again is merely a convenience.
All of this functionality composes with rest of what the system has to offer.
For instance if you want to see all tasks in some directory:</p>
<pre><code>while (sleep 1) {
</code><code>    echo -n &gt;/dev/text
</code><code>    for (x in *.task) {
</code><code>        echo -n $x: ' '
</code><code>        task/span $x }}</code></pre>
<p>Also here's a cool thing,
if you want completed task list to appear when you log into your terminal,
you can add this into the rio start script:</p>
<pre><code>window -r 2338 15 2853 345 task/track 'echo *.task'</code></pre>
<p>Ok, we're done now. Here's how the finished program looks like:</p>
<p><img alt="task screenshot" src="https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/task.png"></p>
<h2>tally</h2>
<p>The whole program suite is 48 lines and 1.5kB.</p>
<pre><code>cpu% wc bin/rc/task/*
</code><code> 21     119     703 bin/rc/task/report
</code><code> 18     100     578 bin/rc/task/span
</code><code>  3      11      73 bin/rc/task/start
</code><code>  3      11      72 bin/rc/task/stop
</code><code>  3      15     100 bin/rc/task/track
</code><code> 48     256    1526 total</code></pre>
<p>This is about 85 times less than kapow punch clock.</p>
<h2>apples and oranges?</h2>
<p>It may seem the comparison is unfair.
Are the programs equivalent in functionality?
The answer is no.
The 'task' implements much less functionality than the kapow punch clock.
It's barely considered bunch of scripts.
However the tasks are merely files and you edit them with existing tools,
this thing introduces very little to learn.
The manual is 1kB and I think I made it verbose.
Yet despite that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're able to search from your tasks.</li>
<li>Exporting/Importing of tasks is easy because they are files
and to use the program you have to know where they are.</li>
<li>Tasks can be interleaved with other contents on the system.</li>
<li>Tasks archive properly given your other files archive properly.</li>
<li>You can attach and receive tasks in the mail.</li>
<li>The status of the tasklist can be securely live-displayed
on a remote info board and shared with collaborators.</li>
<li>There are lots of customization options.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do wonder what the take-away from here is.
Despite this all, kapow punch clock, it's fine software.
I don't mind that it's been written.</p>
<h2>experiences</h2>
<p>I did this to try off this 'rc' and try to write a manual page.
I'm surprised how usable the 'troff' is once you don't assume it should be something familiar.
The 'rc' is equally incredible by having an actual structure that you can rely on.
Plan 9 is such an incredibly good operating system,
I constantly find things that surprise in a good way.</p>

<p>Hi, folks!</p>
<p>Every single program allocates memory. Byte buffers are at the core of many essential libraries which power the services the modern internet is built upon. If you’re building such a library, or even just copying data between different files, chances are you’ll need to allocate a buffer.</p>
<p>In Java, <code>ByteBuffer</code> is the class that allows you to do so. Once you’ve decided to allocate a buffer, you’ll be presented with two methods <code>allocate()</code> and <code>allocateDirect()</code>. Which one to use? The answer is, as always, it depends. If there were no tradeoffs, there wouldn’t be two methods. In this article, I’ll explore some of these tradeoffs, demystify this behaviour, and I hope that the answer will be clear for you by the end of it.</p>

<p>Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don’t matter right now. Sometimes they matter later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_two_buffers">Two buffers</h3>
<p>At first glance, the two methods <code>allocate()</code> and <code>allocateDirect()</code> are very simple. The <code>allocate()</code> allocates a buffer in the managed heap of the Java process, a part of this exact space which size is specified with the <code>Xmx</code> option. The <code>allocateDirect()</code> method allocates a buffer residing outside of the managed heap.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/server3.png" alt="server3"></span></p>
<p>This difference, however, creates a number of significant runtime implications, which I’m going to dive into here. But first, let me start by telling a debugging story where direct byte buffers were the murderer.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_the_story">The story</h3>
<p>Every story needs a protagonist. In this case, the protagonist was a Java application built on top of RSocket, a modern application protocol. Here’s the oversimplified version of the app which you can find on <a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect/blob/master/src/main/java/me/serce/allocatedirect/Main.java">Github</a>. Let’s call this app an echo app. The echo code isn’t trying to do anything complicated, it is a simple echo service built with an awesome <a href="https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-java">rsocket-java</a> library. All it does is spins up a client and a server, where the client sends messages, and the server echoes them back.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">var server = RSocketServer.create(echo) //...
var client = RSocketConnector.create() //...
while (true) {
  assert Objects.equals(client.send(), client.receive())
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
The supporting code for this article is available <a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect">on Github</a>. You can, and I highly encourage you to, choose to go through each step yourself by cloning the code and running each example with a simple bash script. All measurements were taken on an EC2 AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m5/">m5.large</a> instance. Unless specified otherwise, <em>Java 13</em> is used. The point of this article is not to show the numbers but rather demonstrate the techniques that you can use to debug your own application.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The code is useless if it’s just sitting in the repo and doing nothing, so let’s clone the repo and start the app.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect.git
cd allocatedirect &amp;&amp; ./start.sh</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The app starts, and you should see that the logs are flowing. As expected, now it’s processing a large number of messages. However, if the echo app was exposed to users, they would start noticing significant pauses every now and then. All Java developers know that the first thing to look at in the case of spurious pauses is GC.</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
You can find GC logs of the app are stored in <code>/tmp/${gcname}</code>. The example logs for each run are also available in the <a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect/tree/master/logs">repo</a>. In this article, gceasy.io was used for visualisation. It’s a great free online tool which supports the log format of multiple garbage collectors. Even though you can always visualise GC logs using a tool like gceasy, as we’ll see later, the raw logs often contain a lot more information than most of the tools can display.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Indeed, GC logs show that GC is to blame here. The application is running under G1, which is the default collector since JDK 9. There are multiple young GC pauses on the graph. Young GC is a stop-the-world pause in GC in G1. The application stops completely to perform a cleanup. For the echo server, the graph shows multiple young GC pauses that last for 100-130ms and occur every 10 seconds.</p>
<div>
<p>G1 GC</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/g1before.png" alt="g1before"></span></p>
</div>
<p>Luckily for us, in the last few years, there has been an amazing development in the GC space. There are not just one but two new fully concurrent garbage collectors, <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/zgc/Main">ZGC</a> and <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/shenandoah/Main">Shenandoah</a>.</p>
<p>While I’ve had <a href="https://twitter.com/SerCeMan/status/1246676501925224449">great success</a> with ZGC before, Shenandoah has a great advantage of being much friendlier to application memory consumption. Many applications, especially simple JSON in, JSON out stateless services are not memory-constrained. Some application, on the other hand, especially the ones that process a large number of connections might be very sensitive to memory usage.</p>
<p>Even though the echo app only has a single client and a server in its current state, it could as well handle tens of thousands of connections. It’s time to enable Shenandoah, and run the echo app again.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash">./start.sh shen # starts with -XX:+UseShenandoahGC</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>After enabling Shenandoah, the GC logs start showing an interesting picture. There is definitely a huge improvement in the pause frequency. The pauses now only occur every minute or so. However, the pauses are still around 90ms long, which is far away from the desired sub-millisecond pauses.</p>
<div>
<p>Shenandoah GC</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/shenandoah.png" alt="shenandoah"></span></p>
</div>
<p>Now that the symptoms are clear, and the problem is reproducible, it’s time to look at the cause. GC graphs don’t show much more information. Looking at the raw logs directly, on the other hand, reveals the cause which is clearly stated right on the pause line.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="log">...
[info][gc] GC(15) Pause Final Mark (process weakrefs) 86.167ms
...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Turns out, weak references are to blame. Put simply, weak references are a way to keep an object in memory until there is a demand for this memory. Large in-memory caches is a common use-case for weak references. If there is enough free heap, a weak reference cache entry can stay there. As soon as GC figures out that there is not enough memory, it’ll deallocate weak references. In most of the cases, this is a much better outcome than the application failing with an out of memory exception because of a cache.</p>
<p>A frantic search across the repository doesn’t show any usages of weak, soft or phantom references. Not even the search through the third party libraries can show anything. After staring at the metrics for a while, one of the graphs gives a clue! The long GC pauses correlate with a sudden drop in the number of direct byte buffers.</p>
<div>
<p>GC vs DirectByteBuffer count</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/jmc-gc.png" alt="jmc gc"></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>

You can get a similar graph by running the echo app and connecting to the JMX port. For this screenshot, I used Java Mission Control (JMC). The <a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect/blob/master/start.sh#L53">start.sh</a> script contains the options that you can enable to connect to an app with JMX remotely.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>At first, the correlation might not make any sense. Byte buffers are not weak references, are they? They are not weak references themselves. However, you might notice, that creating a new direct byte buffer gives you back a plain <code>ByteBuffer</code> interface which doesn’t have a <code>close</code> method or any other way of deallocating the buffer.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(42);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The underlying buffer needs to go away once the last reference to this buffer goes away. The modern API for this in Java is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/ref/Cleaner.html"><code>java.lang.ref.Cleaner</code></a>. As we can see, it’s exactly what <code>DirectByteBuffer</code> class uses to determine when the underlying buffer should be deallocated.</p>
<div>

<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">DirectByteBuffer(int cap) {
    // ...
    base = UNSAFE.allocateMemory(size); // malloc call
    UNSAFE.setMemory(base, size, (byte) 0);
    // ...
    cleaner = Cleaner.create(this, new Deallocator(base, size, cap));
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Yet, there are no usages of direct buffers in the code of the echo app either, so how could we find them? One way would be to search through the third party libraries using IntelliJ. The approach would work very well for the echo example but would completely fail for any real applications of a decent size. There are just way too many places where byte buffers are used. Looking at the graphs, one can notice that the number of created buffers per minute is huge, literally millions of them.</p>
<p>Instead of searching through the code to find all byte buffer references, it is easier to find the place at runtime. One way to find out where the majority of the buffers is created is to fire up the async profiler and profile the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html"><code>malloc</code></a> calls which are used by direct buffers to allocate memory.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"># async profiler can be downloaded from https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler
./profiler.sh -d 30 -f /tmp/flamegraph.svg $(pgrep -f java) -e malloc</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>While running, the profiler managed to sample more than 500000 malloc calls which non-ambiguously show where all of the buffers were created from.</p>

<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
The flame graph above visualises the code paths where most of the captured malloc calls occur. The wider the column is, the larger the number of times the code path appeared in the sample. This graph, as well as other flame graphs in this article, is clickable. You can read more on how to read flame graphs <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">here</a>.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>As it turned out, there was a place in the code which was using direct buffers. With this rich knowledge of where exactly the direct buffer allocations occur, creating a fix is easy. All that’s needed is to make a one line change and to replace <code>allocateDirect</code> with <code>allocate</code> and send a <a href="https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-java/pull/945">PR upstream</a>.</p>
<p>Running the same app on shenandoah after applying the single line change produces a completely different graph which pleases the eyes with sub-millisecond GC pauses.</p>
<div>
<p>Shenandoah GC</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/shenandoah-heap.png" alt="shenandoah heap"></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_the_costs">The costs</h3>
<p>The story revealed a dark side of direct byte buffers. If there is a dark side, there must be a bright side as well! There is. But before we look at the bright side, we need to explore a few more sides which also appeared to be grey.</p>
<div>
<h4 id="_allocations">Allocations</h4>
<p>Previously, we’ve observed implicit deallocations costs, so now it’s time to take a look at allocations. Could direct buffers be much cheaper to create? After all, going off-heap has been a performance trend for a while. A small benchmark can help to estimate the costs.</p>

<h2 id="integer-underflow"><a href="#integer-underflow">Integer Underflow</a></h2>
<p>
Let us talk a little bit about integer underflow and undefined behaviour
in C before we discuss the puzzle I want to share in this post.
</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i--)
        printf(".");
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>

<p>
This code invokes undefined behaviour. The value in variable
<code>i</code> decrements to <code>INT_MIN</code> after
<code>|INT_MIN| + 1</code> iterations. In the next iteration, there is a
negative overflow which is undefined for signed integers in C. On many
implementations though, <code>INT_MIN - 1</code> wraps around to
<code>INT_MAX</code>. Since <code>INT_MAX</code> is not less than
<code>6</code>, the loop terminates. With such implementations, this
code prints <code>|INT_MIN| + 1</code> dots. With 32-bit integers,
that amounts to 2147483649 dots. Here is one such example output:
</p>

<pre><samp>$ <kbd>gcc -std=c89 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic foo.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out | wc -c</kbd>
2147483649</samp>
</pre>

<p>
It is worth noting that the above behaviour is only one of the many
possible ones. The code invokes undefined behaviour and the ISO standard
imposes no requirements on a specific implementation of the compiler
regarding what the behaviour of such code should be. For example, an
implementation could also exploit the undefined behaviour to turn the
loop into an infinite loop. In fact, GCC does optimize it to an infinite
loop if we compile the code with the <code>-O2</code> option.
</p>

<pre><samp><kbd># This never terminates!</kbd>
$ <kbd>gcc -O2 -std=c89 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic foo.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out</kbd>
</samp></pre>


<h2 id="puzzle"><a href="#puzzle">Puzzle</a></h2>
<p>
Let us take a look at the puzzle now.
</p>

<div>
<p>
Add or modify exactly one operator in the following code such that it
prints exactly 6 dots.
</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i--)
    printf(".");</code>
</pre></div>

<p>
An obvious solution is to change <code>i--</code> to <code>i++</code>.
</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)
    printf(".");</code>
</pre>

<p>
There are a few more solutions to this puzzle. One of the solutions is
very interesting. We will discuss the interesting solution in detail
below.
</p>


<h2 id="solutions"><a href="#solutions">Solutions</a></h2>
<p>
<em><strong>Update on 02 Oct 2011:</strong> The puzzle has been solved
in the <a href="https://susam.in/blog/loopy-c-puzzle/comments/">comments</a> section. We will discuss the
solutions now. If you want to think about the problem before you see the
solutions, this is a good time to pause and think about it. There are
spoilers ahead.</em>
</p>

<p>
Here is a list of some solutions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; ++i)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; -i &lt; 6; i--)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i + 6; i--)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i ^= 6; i--)</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The last solution involving the bitwise XOR operation is not immediately
obvious. A little analysis is required to understand why it works. 
</p>


<h2 id="generalization"><a href="#generalization">Generalization</a></h2>
<p>
Let us generalize the puzzle by replacing \( 6 \) in the loop with an
arbitrary positive integer \( n. \) The loop in the last solution now
becomes:
</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0; i ^= n; i--)
    printf(".");</code>
</pre>

<p>
If we denote the value of the variable <code>i</code> set by the
execution of <code>i ^= n</code> after \( k \) dots are printed as
\( f(k), \) then

\[
  f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
      n                       &amp; \text{if } n = 0, \\
      n \oplus (f(k - 1) - 1) &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 1
    \end{cases}
\]

where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer, \( n \) is a positive integer,
and the symbol \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation on two
nonnegative integers.

Note that \( f(0) \) represents the value of <code>i</code> set by the
execution of <code>i ^= n</code> when no dots have been printed yet.
</p>

<p>
If we can show that \( n \) is the least value of \( k \) for which \(
f(k) = 0, \) it would prove that the loop terminates after printing
\( n \) dots.
</p>

<p>
We will see in the next section that for odd values of \( n, \)

\[
f(k) =
\begin{cases}
n &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is even}, \\
1 &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is odd}.
\end{cases}
\]

Therefore there is no value of \( k \) for which \( f(k) = 0 \) when \(
n \) is odd. As a result, the loop never terminates when \( n \) is odd.
</p>

<p>
We will then see that for even values of \( n \) and
\( 0 \leq k \leq n, \)

\[
f(k) = 0 \iff k = n.
\]

Therefore the loop terminates after printing \( n \) dots when \( n \)
is even.

<h2 id="lemmas"><a href="#lemmas">Lemmas</a></h2>
<p>
We will first prove a few lemmas about some interesting properties of
the bitwise XOR operation. We will then use it to prove the claims made
in the previous section.
</p>

<!-- Lemma 1 -->
<p>
<strong>Lemma 1.</strong>
<em>
For an odd positive integer \( n, \)

\[
n \oplus (n - 1) = 1
\]

where the symbol \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation on two
nonnegative integers.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
Let the binary representation of \( n \) be \( b_m \dots b_1 b_0 \)
where \( m \) is a nonnegative integer and \( b_m \) represents the most
significant nonzero bit of \( n. \) Since \( n \) is an odd number,
\( b_0 = 1. \)

Thus \( n \) may be written as

\[ b_m \dots b_1 1. \]

As a result \( n - 1 \) may be written as

\[ b_m \dots b_1 0. \]

The bitwise XOR of both binary representations is \( 1. \)
</p>

<!-- Lemma 2 -->
<p>
<strong>Lemma 2.</strong>
<em>
For a nonnegative integer \( n, \)

\[
n \oplus 1 =
  \begin{cases}
    n + 1 &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is even}, \\
    n - 1 &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is odd}.
  \end{cases}
\]

where the symbol \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation on two
nonnegative integers.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
Let the binary representation of \( n \) be \( b_m \dots b_1 b_0 \)
where \( m \) is a nonnegative integer and \( b_m \) represents the most
significant nonzero bit of \( n. \)
</p>
<p>
If \( n \) is even, \( b_0 = 0. \) In this case, \( n \) may be written
as \( b_m \dots b_1 0. \) Thus \( n \oplus 1 \) may be written as \( b_m
\dots b_1 1. \) Therefore \( n \oplus 1 = n + 1. \)
</p>

<p>
If \( n \) is odd, \( b_0 = 1. \) In this case, \( n \) may be written
as \( b_m \dots b_1 1. \) Thus \( n \oplus 1 \) may be written as \( b_m
\dots b_1 0. \) Therefore \( n \oplus 1 = n - 1. \)
</p>

<p>
Note that for odd \( n, \) lemma 1 can also be derived as a corollary of
lemma 2 in this manner:

\[
k \oplus (k - 1)
= k \oplus (k \oplus 1)
= (k \oplus k) \oplus 1
= 0 \oplus 1
= 1.
\]
</p>


<!-- Lemma 3 -->
<p>
<strong>Lemma 3.</strong>
<em>
If \( x \) is an even nonnegative integer and \( y \) is an odd positive
integer, then \( x \oplus y \) is odd, where the symbol \( \oplus \)
denotes bitwise XOR operation on two nonnegative integers.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
Let the binary representation of \( x \) be \( b_{xm_x} \dots b_{x1}
b_{x0} \) and that of \( y \) be \( b_{ym_y} \dots b_{y1} b_{y0} \)
where \( m_x \) and \( m_y \) are nonnegative integers and \( b_{xm_x}
\) and \( b_{xm_y} \) represent the most significant nonzero bits of \(
x \) and \( y, \) respectively.
</p>

<p>
Since \( x \) is even, \( b_{x0} = 0. \) Since \( y \) is odd,
\( b_{y0} = 1. \)
</p>

<p>
Let \( z = x \oplus y \) with a binary representation of \( b_{zm_z}
\dots b_{z1} b_{z0} \) where \( m_{zm_z} \) is a nonnegative integer and
\( b_{zm_z} \) is the most significant nonzero bit of \( z. \)
</p>

<p>
We get \( b_{z0} = b_{x0} \oplus b_{y0} = 0 \oplus 1 = 1. \) Therefore
\( z \) is odd.
</p>


<h2 id="theorems"><a href="#theorems">Theorems</a></h2>

<!-- Theorem 1 -->
<p>
<strong>Theorem 1.</strong>
<em>
Let \( \oplus \) denote bitwise XOR operation on two nonnegative
integers and

\[
  f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
      n                        &amp; \text{if } n = 0, \\
      n \oplus (f(n - 1) - 1)  &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 1.
    \end{cases}
\]

where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer and \( n \) is an odd positive
integer. Then

\[
  f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
      n &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is even}, \\
      1 &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is odd}.
    \end{cases}
\]
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
This is a proof by mathematical induction. We have \( f(0) = n \) by
definition. Therefore the base case holds good.
</p>

<p>
Let us assume that \( f(k) = n \) for any even \( k \) (induction
hypothesis). Let \( k' = k + 1 \) and \( k'' = k + 2. \)
</p>

<p>
If \( k \) is even, we get

\begin{align*}
f(k')  &amp; = n \oplus (f(k) - 1)  &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
       &amp; = n \oplus (n - 1)     &amp;&amp; \text{(by induction hypothesis)} \\
       &amp; = 1                    &amp;&amp; \text{(by lemma 1)},\\
f(k'') &amp; = n \oplus (f(k') - 1) &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
       &amp; = n \oplus (1 - 1)     &amp;&amp; \text{(since \( f(k') = 1\))} \\
       &amp; = n \oplus 0 \\
       &amp; = n.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
Since \( f(k'') = n \) and \( k'' \) is the next even number after
\( k, \) the induction step is complete. The induction step shows that
for every even \( k, \) \( f(k) = n \) holds good. It also shows that as
a result of \( f(k) = n \) for every even \( k, \) we get \( f(k') = 1
\) for every odd \( k'. \)
</p>

<!-- Theorem 2 -->
<p>
<strong>Theorem 2.</strong>
<em>
Let \( \oplus \) denote bitwise XOR operation on two nonnegative
integers and

\[
  f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
      n                        &amp; \text{if } n = 0, \\
      n \oplus (f(n - 1) - 1)  &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 1.
    \end{cases}
\]

where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer, \( n \) is an even positive
integer, and \( 0 \leq k \leq n. \) Then

\[
  f(k) = 0 \iff k = n.
\]
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
We will first show by the principle of mathematical induction that for
even \( k, \) \( f(k) = n - k. \) We have \( f(0) = n \) by definition,
so the base case holds good. Now let us assume that \( f(k) = n - k \)
holds good for any even \( k \) where \( 0 \leq k \leq n \) (induction
hypothesis).
</p><p>
Since \( n \) is even (by definition) and \( k \) is even (by induction
hypothesis), \( f(k) = n - k \) is even. As a result, \( f(k) - 1 \) is
odd. By lemma 3, we conclude that \( f(k + 1) = n \oplus (f(k) - 1) \)
is odd.
</p>

<p>
Now we perform the induction step as follows:

\begin{align*}
f(k + 2) &amp; = n \oplus (f(k + 1) - 1)
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
         &amp; = n \oplus (f(k + 1) \oplus 1)
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by lemma 2 for odd \( n \))} \\
         &amp; = n \oplus ((n \oplus (f(k) - 1)) \oplus 1)
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
         &amp; = (n \oplus n ) \oplus ((f(k) - 1) \oplus 1)
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by associativity of XOR)} \\
         &amp; = 0 \oplus ((f(k) - 1) \oplus 1) \\
         &amp; = (f(k) - 1) \oplus 1 \\
         &amp; = (f(k) - 1) - 1
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(from lemma 2 for odd \( n \))} \\
         &amp; = f(k) - 2 \\
         &amp; = n - k - 2
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by induction hypothesis).}
\end{align*}

This completes the induction step and proves that \( f(k) = n - k \)
for even \( k \) where \( 0 \leq k \leq n. \)
</p>

<p>
We have shown above that \( f(k) \) is even for every even \( k \) where
\( 0 \leq k \leq n \) which results in \( …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In the C++ application development, sometimes, we would like to hide the private methods and member variables so that the users will not try to get access to those member methods and variables.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to briefly discuss how to do it using abstract class declarations.</p>

<h3 id="abstract-class">Abstract Class</h3>

<p>An abstract class is a class that either defines or inherits at least one function for which the final overrider is pure virtual.</p>



<p>To understand virtual and pure virtual, we have to understand what C++ polymorphisms are. I have a blog post <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/CPP-Polymorphisms/">“C++ Polymorphisms”</a> on this topic. Some of its simple examples could also be found on <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/abstract_class">CPP Reference</a>.</p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>Here we would create a bot application which will simply introduce itself and say hello to the user. All the source code could be found on my <a href="https://github.com/leimao/CPP-Public-Header-Abstract-Class-Declarations-Example">GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>We would like to create an implementation for class <code>Bot</code>. The following declaration was used for building the library <code>libbot.so</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// bot.h</span>
<span>#include &lt;string&gt;
</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Bot</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>

    <span>Bot</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>botName</span><span>);</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>greet</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>

<span>private:</span>

    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span> <span>mBotName</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, sometimes, we don’t want the users to know the private methods and members. In more complex cases, the number of private methods and members could be huge. Only the public methods are designed to be useful for the users. If we provide the following simplified header to the users, and ask the users to use the header in their application implementations, the users will run into problems.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// public_bot.h</span>
<span>#include &lt;string&gt;
</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Bot</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>

    <span>Bot</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>botName</span><span>);</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>greet</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>
    
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is because C++ has to know all the methods and the members of an object during compile-time. The size of such object is thus determined during compile-time. Using an object declaration that does not contain the private methods and members that it should have will result in the building of an incomplete object during runtime. Thus running those applications will run into errors if any private methods and members were accessed by the public methods.</p>



<p>So what could we do if we would like to only expose the public methods and the program is still executable? We could use abstract class. The following header is used for building the library <code>libvirtual_bot.so</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// virtual_bot.h</span>
<span>#include &lt;string&gt;
</span>
<span>class</span> <span>IBot</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>greet</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>IBot</span><span>*</span> <span>createBot</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>botName</span><span>);</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Bot</span> <span>:</span> <span>public</span> <span>IBot</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>

    <span>Bot</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>botName</span><span>);</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>greet</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>override</span><span>;</span>

<span>private:</span>

    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span> <span>mBotName</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The following header is given to the user for creating the application.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// public_virtual_bot.h</span>
<span>#include &lt;string&gt;
</span>
<span>class</span> <span>IBot</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>greet</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>IBot</span><span>*</span> <span>createBot</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>botName</span><span>);</span>

<span>// The declaration of Bot is hidden.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this header, the users do not know the existence of <code>Bot</code> yet they can still call all the public methods of <code>Bot</code>. All they should deal with is the abstract class <code>IBot</code>. An instance of <code>Bot</code> could be created by calling the <code>createBot</code> method and returning a base <code>IBot</code> pointer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>Say you're about to build a new project. You're an expert in a few languages, and you have a sense of the ecosystem in general. How do you choose the language you build with? I wanted to share my decision framework with you. </p><p>Some requirements can eliminate entire categories of choices. Let’s use that to our advantage: start by narrowing down your choices. For example:</p><p><strong>Do you need extreme efficiency?</strong> This would mean your code may need to be compiled and that you can’t have run-time garbage collection. Well, that narrows down your choices quite a bit. </p><p><strong>Do you need math-level proofs that your code works as expected?</strong> This would mean you need an <em>extremely</em> strong type system. Bam, narrows choices down quite a bit </p><p><strong>Do you need concurrency?</strong> There are only a few VMs and a few languages that are known to be <em>excellent</em> for concurrency. Depending on what you need, this will narrow your choices down to a few families.</p><p><strong>Do you work in a larger environment?</strong> If you are building something, and your entire company is on one stack, there’s so much power to the existing ecosystem that this effectively narrows down your choice to the language of your environment.<sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Is your problem in a domain where the ecosystem in one language is strongest?</strong> If you’re in machine learning, the ecosystem in python is so powerful that it almost guarantees to narrow down your choice to that language.</p><p><strong>Is your problem a small script that needs to run everywhere?</strong> This narrows your choices down to the languages that are available by default on Linux</p><p>Now, there’s a leverage point here: constraints narrow down your choices in a significant way. If you add a constraint you didn’t need, you risk sacrificing a large set of options. For example, many think their system needs to scale from the get-go. This is rarely the case and kills some of the choices that contributed to the success of the biggest companies today <sup>2</sup></p><p>So pick your constraints carefully. Once you do though, you’ll be pleasantly surprised with how much clarity they give you: your choices will have gone through a significant filter.</p><p>The next filter is effectiveness. Choose the language that maximizes your output on a time scale you care about.</p><p>At this stage, there is often a tradeoff between what you’re comfortable with and what you need to discover. Say you’re comfortable in assembly, but don’t know any other languages. What should you do?</p><p>Well, for some very small problems, it <em>does</em> make sense to just write them in assembly. If they’re urgent, you have no other choice. But for any significant work, you’ll outstrip the productivity of assembly within a few days of ramp-up. </p><p>The same kind of spectrum exists in higher-level languages, but the differences take longer to show up. If you’re comfortable with Java, for example, you can get a lot done pretty quickly. But within <em>some</em> period, the productivity benefits pale in comparison to more powerful languages.</p><p>Making this choice is a bit of an art, but it works like this. You want to think about a time-frame that you’d like to optimize and pick the language that optimizes for effectiveness within that timeframe. </p><p>If you’re in a hurry, you have no choice but to use what you’re comfortable with, no matter how limiting. There are two ways to avoid the dilemma. You can either play with different languages before you start your project, so you have a wider array of comfortable choices to pick from, or give yourself a few months to ramp up and select the language that’s most effective for your problem.</p><p>With that, the question comes, <em>what time frame</em> should you optimize for? This is in itself an art. For startups, I would say about 8-12 months. Planning further than that is over-optimization. For larger companies, I’d think 2-5 years.</p><p>Now you’ve gone through two filters. Say you narrowed down to just a few choices, but you aren’t sure which one to take.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>Have all your habits back in the COVID ‘lock-down’ started to go away once the society opened up again? What seems like productive reading time in the morning reverted back to mindless commutes between work and home. I can relate and in november, this is my attempt to get back to my reading habits every single day.</p>

<p>Back in my previous article <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-07-20-articles-of-july/">Want to improve? You have got to read</a>, I’ve wrriten how improvement and personal development happens when you put in the time to read and learn. If personal development is important for you, prioritize time to read.</p>

</ul>

<p>For all developers whom are looking for direct alternatives to google’s tools. it is interesting to see the extent of inconvenience this community of non-googlers would go just not to use google. Privacy definitely has its importance; all the more paramount when its used in your disfavour.</p>

<p>The more time you spent building your product, your own furniture, or even your software will create this irrational love for it. Some call it the ikea effect where furnitures build by your own hands seems to have more worth than it actually has - an addition of sentimental worth.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s often effort that ultimately creates long-term satisfaction,” wrote Dan Ariely wrote in his book&nbsp;The Upside of Irrationality, after co-authoring the Ikea effect paper. “Greater labor leads to greater love.”</p>

<li><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design">Top 10 designs of good products</a></li>
</ul>

<p>While it is not entirely true, there are some good pointers to take away from this article. Coincidentally, I agree with point 2,4,6,8,10. A good design makes a product understandable. The design is supposed to make the product self explanatory. The classical example is how a 3 year old was able to understand how to use an iphone without any manual or explanation. That is a ton of genius packed into one small device.</p>

</ul>

<p>It is interesting how things that we take for granted are actually a solution to challenging problems that were faced by the previous generations. While it is a story back into history, here is a quote from John E. Warnock, the cofounder of Adobe.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“What industries badly need is a universal way to communicate documents across a wide variety of machine configurations, operating systems and communication networks. These documents should be viewable on any display and should be printable on any modern printers. If this problem can be solved, then the fundamental way people work will change.”  — John E. Warnock, the cofounder of Adobe</p>

While Apple is talking about saving the earth by producing less electronic waste, I would hope to see how they are backing up their attempts with statistics. Beyond that, I just think its ridiculous to say that and charging new charging brick and new charging wires at such an exorbitant price. One always wonder what would Steve Jobs do.</li>

</ul>

<p>Rather than to fight the slow fight to convince others to drive less and thus have less cars on the road, how about a radical alternative?</p>

<p>Give them an pleasant alternative, escooters. This can help to cover short distance travels, it also help us to see how the government can chart the way for a societal change in lifestyle. A step forward for countries to reduce in carbon footprint is to create bicycle lanes to encourage more bicycle as preferred mode of transport.</p>

<p>Give them space and time to work, free from distractions. Work from home’s top distractions are actually the consistent messages that keeps coming in while being physically around your coworkers.</p>

<p>Work from home allows you the socially acceptable approach to mute your employees so you can focus on the tasks before you. While WFH heightens the room for productivity, people are feeling more lonely than before.</p>

<p>The disconnection with their coworkers can also affect their productivity as their mental wellness can be affected with prolong isolation. Companies however feels that it is personal employee responsibility to get themselves connected. Essentially, while it is true to a large extent, companies can play its part to setup itself up for success; not by luck but by design. This includes digital engagements, interactive digital townhall, more frequent get togethers once in a while to bring people together.</p>

<p>Using null might be interesting if you care about property existence. If it is undefined, you wouldnt know if the variable foo might be undefined or if the object doesn’t have a property foo. If you want to explicitly communicate via types that property foo exists and might have a bottom value. Then null is one of your approach.</p>

<p>It is your experiences and achievements that shows how good a programmer you are. Flush those out.

<p>The secret to serving static video content is to use CDNs.<br>
<a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CDN.html">This</a> is a simple description of what is a CDN. This might be my an interesting topic to delve deeper to explore the science behind this magic.</p>

<p>Some of the CDNs includes Limelight, Level 3, Akamai, CloudFront, and CloudFlare. For Netflix, they created their own CDN call <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/">Open Connect</a>. This is definitely another tool to explore.</p>

<p>Here’s an overview of how Netflix uses the client to determine the *best CDN to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>The API signals that the content this person is trying to watch is on, say, 10 different CDN servers.</li>
<li>The client intelligence picks the CDN that it calculates to be best*</li>
<li>The client intelligence continually probes to find the best way of receiving content</li>

<li><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/">Cattle vs pet cloud mental analogy</a><br>
A short glimpse into what pet vs cattle systems are. The definitions based on the post has accurately described them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pets</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Servers or server pairs that are treated as indispensable or unique systems that can never be down. Typically they are manually built, managed, and “hand fed”. Examples include mainframes, solitary servers, HA loadbalancers/firewalls (active/active or active/passive), database systems designed as master/slave (active/passive), and so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cattle</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arrays of more than two servers, that are built using automated tools, and are designed for failure, where no one, two, or even three servers are irreplaceable. Typically, during failure events no human intervention is required as the array exhibits attributes of “routing around failures” by restarting failed servers or replicating data through strategies like triple replication or erasure coding. Examples include web server arrays, multi-master datastores such as Cassandra clusters, multiple racks of gear put together in clusters, and just about anything that is load-balanced and multi-master.\</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They can go down whenever, however. But they are always creating new server applications to ensure that the service is online.</p>
<br>

<br>
<h2>TLDR;</h2>

<p>Reading has this compounding effect with tangible effects budding months or even years of consistent practice. In technology, while it is easy to just chase the work and code, one of the most fundamental habits of x10 engineers is the habit of reading and immersing themselves in tech talks and discussions. May us all engineers develop this habit and make the world a better place; one piece of code at a time.</p>

			<p>Founded in 2020 amidst the pandemic, Minus Zero is on a quest to build indigenous fully Self Driving Car in India by late 2023, competing with the likes of Elon Musk’s Tesla, Google’s Waymo and others in the industry. It’s not long before India will have its own ‘Made in India’ autonomous vehicle able to drive itself with zero human supervision in a challenging traffic like India’s. Being one of the most rising use cases of Artificial Intelligence, this can make India a leader in global tech ecosystem.&nbsp;Minus Zero is a deep-tech start-up working to leverage the power of moon-shot innovation to an inclusive society at large.                <!-- <div class="PT10 TAC PB10"><div id="crt_728x90a"></div></div> -->

They have been gathering the best young minds from all across the country to work on these projects.&nbsp;“Our country’s youth has immense brain power, it’s high time that we align it in the right direction, to a bigger cause of making our country a technology leader. The road is tough, but we need to start somewhere.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You've validated your micro-SaaS idea and are ready to start building the product.</p><p>The obvious next questions are</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Which features should the product include in its first version?</li><li>How long should you take to build it?</li></ol><p>Through this post, I provide you with a framework to identify your initial product features, how to decide what to include or exclude from the first versions, and continue building upon it.</p><p>Before jumping into MLP, let's first understand what MVP&nbsp;is and why it's not enough in today's times.</p><h2>What is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ericries" target="_blank">Eric Ries</a> popularized the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank">minimum viable product</a> in his book <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/" target="_blank">The Lean Startup</a> as that version of a new product that is just usable enough by early customers who can then provide feedback to the team. This feedback should help the team generate validated learnings and guide them on future product development and features.</p><h4>When MVP still works</h4><p>MVP is not dead though. It still works, given the right kind of problem statements.</p><p>Suppose you're building something that simply doesn't exist in the world, and it's something that people really want and have no alternative to getting it except from you.</p><p>At this time, people will accept a textbook MVP, simply because they have no frame of reference to compare it with. Or better yet, because they have no alternative to replace your MVP with.</p><h4>Why MVP&nbsp;is not enough in 2021</h4><p>Over the past few years as smartphone penetration boomed, products matured, product design and user experience matured, people's expectations have increased.</p><p>No longer does a quickly thrown together prototype cut it. People expect a minimum level of good UX and ease-of-use, else they'll leave your app before even giving it a proper try.</p><p>In fact, in 2021 great UX might be one strong reason people pick your product over incumbents. That's what happened with <a href="https://transistor.fm/" target="_blank">Transistor.fm</a>, who made podcast hosting simple and easy.</p><p>People expect good aesthetics that make a first impression, simply because that's what they have become used to from the plethora of beautiful and well-designed apps out there in the world.</p><p>People expect products to be fully functional as advertised. Buggy products are not acceptable, and in fact people might quickly take to Twitter or social media to let others know that a product is unreliable.</p><p>The MVP mindset intensely focuses on building the bare minimum, and that often leaves users frustrated and drives them to seek alternative solutions. Stiffer competition means that people WILL compare your product to alternatives in the market, it's inevitable. And unless you provide something unique and valuable that nobody else does, people are likely to leave.</p><p>All these reasons and more make MVP&nbsp;a dated concept, especially in the context of SaaS products. But above all, I think the MVP mindset makes product builders think too heavily about the "minimum" and often so at the cost of "viable".</p><p>That's a common pitfall and to avoid that, I propose the MLP framework.</p><h2>What is a Minimum Loveable Product (MLP)?</h2><p>A great new concept that I've fallen in love with and personally follow in every product I build is MLP, or Minimum Loveable Product.</p><p>The term MLP was first coined by Brian de Haaff, the co-founder of Aha!, in his book <a href="https://www.aha.io/lovability" target="_blank">Lovability</a>.</p><p>Its definition is an extension of what Eric Ries already introduced to the world with MVP. With MLP though, you are trying to build the minimum "loveable" product, with a focus on no matter how small or feature-stripped the first version of your product is, it is sufficient to deliver a delightful experience to your user.</p><h4>Minimum Viable Product and the burnt pizza analogy</h4><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiaona/" target="_blank">Jiaona Zhang</a>, who is currently VP&nbsp;of Product at Webflow (this blog is built using Webflow) introduced the <a href="https://firstround.com/review/dont-serve-burnt-pizza-and-other-lessons-in-building-minimum-lovable-products/" target="_blank">burnt pizza analogy</a> to her students at Stanford.</p><p>“<em>Say you’re trying to test whether people like pizza. If you serve them burnt pizza, you’re not getting feedback on whether they like pizza. You only know that they don’t like burnt pizza. Similarly, when you’re only relying on the MVP, the fastest and cheapest functional prototype, you risk not actually testing your product, but rather a poor or flawed version of it.</em>"</p><p>A great practical example of Minimum Loveable Product is the Apple iPad. All the tablets that came before Apple's tablet were MVPs.</p><h2>MLP vs MVP</h2><p>If you're new to all these terminologies, I understand that it can be confusing. Bear with me, you'll wrap your head around it soon enough.</p><p>Build an MLP when you are solving a problem that's already understood by people, and an MVP when people don't easily understand a problem.</p><p>Build an MLP when you can clearly define and understand a market and you are trying to stand out from the existing tools. Build an MVP when you're trying to gauge if there even exists a market to serve.</p><p>An&nbsp;MLP can be built when you know exactly what customers want. An MVP is when you don't know what customers want, and therefore you want to throw things at the wall as quickly as possible and see what sticks.</p><p>An MLP is necessary if you are building in a market where several large and well-known alternatives already exist. An MVP is the right approach for a new market with barely any alternatives, or those solutions are not yet known by the masses.</p><p>While building an MLP, you make a dedicated effort to succeed with that idea. With MVP, you are trying to determine quickly whether the idea can succeed or whether it will fail.</p><p>Building an&nbsp;MVP means you're ready for failure and also ready to pivot quickly as you learn more about the market. Which means you should make tech and architecture decisions that help you move fast above anything else. Scalability or good architecture design is a concern to pay attention to while building an MLP.</p><p>Finally, the end goal of an MLP is that the customers who use it find it sufficient in functionality and experience to be able to "love" it. With an MLP, you're building just enough that a customer with (hopefully) a real pain point would "tolerate" and continue using your product while you validate your assumptions.</p><h2>Minimum Marketable Product, Minimum Remarkable Product, Minimum Launchable Product</h2><p>The what?</p><p>I know, I know. I came across these terms for the first time today while researching to write this post. And I went through the literature so that I can tell you to safely ignore it.</p><p>If you understand and embody the concept of MLP, you don't need to think about any other frameworks or terminologies that you may discover while researching on Google.</p><h2>How to build an MLP for your Micro SaaS idea</h2><p>Alright, let's put aside theory and dive right in.</p><p>Here are the steps you should loosely follow to building an MLP.</p><h4>1. Understand the #1 problem you're trying to solve</h4><p>What's the #1 reason someone would want to use your Micro SaaS product over existing alternatives?</p><p>Is it that existing options have poor UX?&nbsp;Great, create a well designed and easy-to-use product. You'd be surprised to know how often people switch to an easier to use tool, simply because they are fed up of the poor UX that they encounter repeatedly.</p><p>Is it that existing alternatives are very expensive?&nbsp;Carve out a minimum set of features that people are paying a lot of money for and charge 1/10th for your v1 product. This might not work for very large customers, but vast majority of customers who are small or mid-sized are always looking for affordable alternatives.</p><p>It might not just be raw quantum of pricing, but certain companies targeting Enterprise customers have very complicated pricing slabs and tiers that are designed to give their sales person more room. In such a case, coming out with a competitor product which has a simple, easy-to-understand pricing is how you attract customers.</p><p>Are existing alternatives lacking certain features that leaves a subset of users very dissatisfied?&nbsp;Great, your MLP should specifically address that problem by building functionality that attracts these dissatisfied users. Side note - This is perhaps one of the best ways to go about building a new product.</p><p>In all cases, it involves understanding the problem you are solving and the exact reason why someone would use your product.</p><h4>2. Design a simple product that solves the top customer needs satisfactorily</h4><p>Once you have identified the #1 reason, it's time to decide on a feature set for your product that solves your customer's top pain points satisfactorily.</p><p><strong>Let's take an example</strong> - People want to add a feedback tracking tool inside their product, so that they can collect user feedback automatically. However, the existing solutions don't allow them to embed the feedback tracker within their tool.</p><p>That's your entry point into providing value that customers seek, but are not getting as of today.</p><p>Having understood the #1 problem, you also have to understand other requirements that fall under the "minimum" set of things you need to do to build a "loveable" product.</p><p>These could be:</p><ul role="list"><li>existing solutions are all well designed and aesthetically pleasing =&gt;&nbsp;your minimum loveable product needs to be well designed too</li><li>existing solutions are affordably priced with a easy to understand pricing structure =&gt; your MLP also needs a simple pricing structure that's affordable</li></ul><p>In general, you want to analyze your competitors and understand </p><ol start="" role="list"><li>What they are doing well</li><li>What users value from among those things</li></ol><p>In your MLP, you need to cover the intersection of (what they are doing well) x (what users value from among those).</p><h4>3. Set a short timeline for building your MLP</h4><p>No matter what you build, building in isolation for too long is dangerous. The main reason for that is - you get to know too late whether your assumptions about what the user really values are on point or off course.</p><p><strong>"But Preetam, you just told me to build a Minimum Loveable Product. And now you're saying I got to build it quickly?"</strong></p><p>Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.</p><p>Short timeframe depends on what you are building, and the size of your team.</p><p>For example - with SuperLemon (WhatsApp plugin for Shopify), Sankalp and I built a MLP in 2 weeks time.</p><p>How?</p><p>We identified precisely the way we could do better - …</p></div></div>

<h2>C++ Vector</h2>
<p>A <b>vector</b> is a sequence container implementing array that can change in size. Unlike array, the size of a vector changes automatically when elements are appended or deleted. </p>
<p>Vector stores elements in contiguous memory location which enables direct access of any elements using <span>operator []</span>. To support shrink and expand functionality at runtime, vector container may allocate some extra storage. Hence, compared to array, vector requires more memory and in return it manage memory dynamically and efficiently.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Both are APIs for shared-memory programming. In C, OpenMP is a relatively high-level extension, providing compiler directives for parallelizing many programs with ease while some low-level thread interactions may be difficult to program. Pthreads provide some low-level coordination constructs that are unavailable in OpenMP, making other programs easier to parallelize while requiring explicit specification of the behavior of each thread, which may virtually be any that is conceivable.</p>
<p>Pthreads programs can be used with <em>any</em> C compiler, provided the system has a Pthreads library. OpenMP requires compiler support for some operations, which <em>many</em> compilers provide.</p>
<h3 id="area-under-the-curve">Area Under the Curve</h3>
<p>The program we are about to develop is oftentimes called the 'Hello world!' of parallel programming. We will be using the following formula for <cite>arctan(1)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></cite> in approximating the value for π.</p>

<p>Going through the serial version of the program in C, the value for above is calculated for each integer within range <strong>[1, N)</strong> and summed up within a loop. The resulting <strong>sum</strong> is them divided by <strong>N</strong> for getting an estimate of <strong>π / 4</strong>, before printing out the calculated <em>approximate</em> for π.</p>

<p>To compile above with <code>gcc</code>, use following.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">gcc -o &lt;outputname&gt; &lt;filename&gt;.c -f openmp -lm -Wall -g
</code></pre></div><h3 id="modifying-parallelized-code">Modifying Parallelized Code</h3>
<p>Before changing anything, it pays to understand whatever we want changed in the first-place. So, let us go through the above code. The function <code>omp_get_wtime()</code>, defined in <code>omp.h</code>, returns the amount of seconds since a previous <em>fixed</em> point in time (included for execution timing purposes). Setting the number of threads to spawn when running parallel code (code inside parallel scope, that is) done by <code>omp_set_num_threds</code>. Changing the <code>set</code> to <code>get</code> and calling from <em>within</em> a parallel section returns the number of threads in execution (<code>get</code> counterpart is available for most functions with <code>set</code>). However, due to resource constraints on the system, it is possible we ending up with a lower number of threads.</p>
<p>The directive <code>#pragma omp parallel</code> is for parallelizing the code–it is safe to assume if this is not present somewhere, the program will not be parallelized by OpenMP. The scope of code that needs to be executed in parallel may be defined the same way we do scoping in C, with <code>{}</code>, or without–whereas only immediately following code line will be considered in-scope. This is where new threads will be spawned and start running alongside the master thread, branching the execution.</p>
<p>Any variables created within the parallel scope are private for each thread (i.e. <code>sum_thread</code>), and will not contribute to race conditions. Therefore, the <code>for</code> loop incrementing <code>sum_thread</code> is divided among threads spawned. Please note the way threads divide the iterations among themselves can be handled up to some extent with specific directives, the default behavior is expected here by omitting them.</p>
<p>Critical sections may be scoped within <code>#pragma omp atomic</code> or <code>#pragma omp critical</code>. The former enables low level atomicity of execution (with higher performance) if available, and only accepts a single assignment statement (of an allowed form) within scope, while the latter can handle multiple statements. Both effectively serializes execution. If we end up with most of the code within the scope of either, our code is probably too poor for parallelization with OpenMP.</p>
<p>Outside the <code>#pragma omp parallel</code> scope, previously spawned threads will join the master thread, and it will continue executing similar to a serial program. It is worth mentioning that we may have as many parallel/serial sections as we please.</p>
<p>As should be apparent from above, OpenMP is designed to be easy to learn and can be used for parallelizing existing serial code with minimal modifications. What if we could further simplify the above code?</p>
<h3 id="reducing-the-parallel-code">Reducing the Parallel Code</h3>
<p>Modifying the <code>sum</code> variable at the end of the <code>for</code> loop in above code could be simplified with a reduction operation provided by OpenMP. That is, we can instruct OpenMP to synchronously add the <em>local sum</em> calculated by each thread (within loop) to the shared variable <code>sum</code> as shown in the parallel version below.</p>

<p>Here, we have a single statement <code>#pragma omp parallel for</code> that tells we want the immediately-following <code>for</code> loop parallelized, which is identical to having <code>#pragma omp for</code> immediately before a <code>for</code> loop <em>within</em> the scope of <code>#pragma omp parallel</code>. The <code>reduction(+:sum)</code> tells that we want the <code>sum</code> variable to contain the <em>sum</em> of each local sum calculated in each iteration only available locally to the thread that runs it. OpenMP does this by creating a private <em>sum</em> variable for each thread and initializing it to <strong>unit</strong> according to the operation (ex. <strong>0</strong> for <code>+</code>, <strong>1</strong> for <code>*</code>), this is how we use the <strong>reduction operator</strong> in OpenMP. The <code>shared(N)</code> tells that the <code>N</code> variable should be shared with all threads, this is fine since threads are only reading it–therefore no potential data races. Finally, the approximated values along with the time taken for calculations are printed.</p>
<p>Now that we went through the code, note that the  <code>omp_set_num_threads</code> is not mandatory when using OpenMP, the program defaults to spawning the maximum number of threads possible on the system at execution time.

      <p>The social sciences have witnessed a dramatic shift in the last 25 years. Rigorous research designs have drastically improved the credibility of research findings. However, while research designs have improved, less progress has been made in relating experimental findings to the views of the broader scientific community and policy-makers. Individual researchers have begun to gather predictions about the effects they might find in their studies, as this information can be helpful in interpreting research results. Still, we could learn more from predictions if they were elicited in a coordinated, systematic way.</p>
<p>This prediction platform will allow for the systematic collection and assessment of expert forecasts of the effects of untested social programs. In turn, this should help both policy makers and social scientists by improving the accuracy of forecasts, allowing for more effective decision-making and improving experimental design and analysis.</p>

<div>
<h3>Measuring and improving the accuracy of forecasts</h3>
<p>Collecting and evaluating a body of priors across members of an expert community can expose whether and how predictions are systematically biased or inaccurate, and can allow us to explore adjustments or corrections that yield more reliable forecasts. It can similarly allow us to identify circumstances that affect the accuracy of predictions and superforecasters, guiding the improvement of the accuracy of future forecasts.</p>
<p>Improving the accuracy of forecasts and identifying consistently accurate forecasters will be particularly valuable to policy makers who often must rely on expert predictions and scientific consensus when considering policy options, and particularly when investment decisions must be made in the absence of RCTs or other rigorous evidence. Many policy analysts already make and use predictions informally and could benefit from infrastructure that standardizes the sourcing and cataloguing of knowledge, similar to how the American Economic Association has systematized registration with the RCT Registry. If forecasts and their accuracy are tracked over time, they can also be combined with newer or crowdsourced predictions, giving more weight to those of superforecasters, to weed out interventions with a lower likelihood of success. There is clear demand from research organizations and funders for this kind of standardization.</p>
</div>


<div>
<h3>Mitigating publication bias</h3>
<p>In cases where null results are known to have been unexpected, we can treat them not as null results, but as rejecting previously held priors. We propose to use ex ante priors, such as the mean or median forecast, as an alternative hypothesis against which to test experimental results. Importantly, forecasts will need to be collected ex ante, given that it is all too easy to rationalize any result ex post (hindsight bias).</p>
</div>




<div>
<h3>Improving experimental design</h3>
<p>The collection of priors, much like pre-analysis plans, focuses attention on the hypotheses to be tested and helps to highlight which research questions have the highest value. It can also improve the efficiency of research by allowing for a more optimal allocation of participants across treatment arms or by focusing attention on those outcome variables for which more data would have the highest value of information.		</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock in this offering. The selling stockholders identified in this prospectus are offering to sell an additional
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares being sold by the selling stockholders. </p>
<p>We have two classes of authorized common stock, Class&nbsp;A common stock and Class&nbsp;B common stock. The rights of the holders of Class&nbsp;A common
stock and Class&nbsp;B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. Each share of Class&nbsp;A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class&nbsp;B common stock is entitled to twenty votes per share
and is convertible at any time into one share of Class&nbsp;A common stock. Following this offering, entities affiliated with David Baszucki, our Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chair of our board of directors will hold all
outstanding shares of our Class&nbsp;B common stock representing approximately &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, Mr.&nbsp;Baszucki will be able to significantly influence any action
requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all
of our assets or other major corporate transaction. Also as a result, we believe we are eligible for, but do not intend to take advantage of, the “controlled company” exemption to the corporate governance rules for New York Stock
Exchange-listed companies. </p> <p>Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our Class&nbsp;A common stock. It is currently estimated that
the initial public offering price per share will be between $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. We intend to apply to list our Class&nbsp;A common stock on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol “RBLX.” </p> <p>We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of
2012 and, as such, we have elected to comply with certain reduced public company reporting requirements for this prospectus and may elect to do so in future filings. </p> <center>

<ul>
<li><strong>Completely serverless</strong>: I don’t want to manage any infrastructure</li>
<li><strong>(almost) Free</strong>: It should cost close to $0 for my use-case which I will talk about below.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-step workflows</strong>: Currently, Zapier’s free tier only lets you perform one action for a particular trigger. I wanted the ability to perform multiple actions (for e.g. send an email and a slack message) for a particular trigger.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks support</strong>: I’m a big fan of <a href="https://zapier.com/page/webhooks/">Zapier’s webhooks</a> functionality and want to replicate that.</li>
<li><strong>Polling-based workflows</strong>: Ability to poll an API endpoint and take action if there is new data available</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The following section will provide an overview of the system based on the requirements we came up with.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-workflow">What is a workflow?</h3>
<p>A workflow can be defined as a Trigger and a series of actions that are taken as a result of the Trigger. The trigger can be based on webhooks or polling.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/workflow.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/workflow.png"></p>
<p>There are various ways to model a workflow. Some of the most common ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using code</strong>: In a system like <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Airflow</a>, a workflow (called a DAG) is defined in Python using Airflow specific abstractions.</li>
<li><strong>Using config files</strong>: A workflow engine like <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/projects/argo/">Argo</a>, which is built on top of Kubernetes, uses YAML to define workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep our system simple, we will define our workflows using JSON. JSON is natively supported in Python (my language of choice) along with many other programming languages.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-trigger">What is a Trigger?</h3>
<p>A trigger is the root node of a workflow. We will support two types of triggers in our system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Webhooks</strong>: The workflow will expose a webhook that can be used to initiate this particular workflow. The webhook will accept POST requests.</li>
<li><strong>Polling:</strong> The workflow will specify an API endpoint which will be polled at a regular interval. If new data is available, then specified actions will be run</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-an-action">What is an Action?</h3>
<p>An action is performed as a result of a workflow being triggered. We will support two types of actions in our system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email</strong>: Send an email with the data coming from the trigger</li>
<li><strong>Slack</strong>: Send a slack message with the data coming from the trigger.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="designing-the-system">Designing the system</h2>
<p>In the following section, we will take a look at the various services we will be using to build the system based on our requirements.</p>
<h3 id="creating-webhooks">Creating Webhooks</h3>
<p>Since one of the main requirements for the system is to be serverless, we will leverage API Gateway and Lambda to support webhooks. API Gateway will create a single endpoint that we can use to send webhooks and we will do the filtering in our Lambda function.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/webhooks.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/webhooks.png"></p>
<h3 id="supporting-polling-based-triggers">Supporting Polling-based Triggers</h3>
<p>Polling triggers are slightly more involved. The system comprises of the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-cloudwatchevents-expressions.html">Lambda function scheduled</a> at a regular frequency. This lambda function will go through all the workflows that are polling-based and put them in an SQS queue. The benefit of decoupling the scheduling of the workflow from the processing of the workflow is that we will be communicating with external services that could be unreliable. If there is a failure, we want to isolate it to a particular workflow.</li>
<li>Lambda function which gets triggered whenever there is a new workflow has been enqueued. This function is responsible for executing the trigger i.e. querying the API endpoint and checking if there is any new data available.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/polling-trigger.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/polling-trigger.png"></p>
<h3 id="de-duplication">De-duplication</h3>
<p>We only want to execute our actions for the polling-based workflows when there is new data. To support this, we will use a de-duplication identifier similar to <a href="https://zapier.com/help/create/basics/data-deduplication-in-zaps">Zapier</a>. We will use DynamoDB to store the identifiers we have already processed for a particular workflow. Since our data model is pretty straightforward, DynamoDB is a good fit for us.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/deduplication.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/deduplication.png"></p>
<h3 id="performing-actions">Performing Actions</h3>
<p>Since we want to support workflows where a single trigger could lead to multiple actions, we will use SQS to decouple the trigger from the action.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lambda function which processes the trigger and if there are any actions to run, enqueue them to SQS.</li>
<li>Lambda function which runs the actions as a result of messages being enqueued to S3.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the benefits of this architecture are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actions are isolated from each other. If one action fails, other actions won’t be affected. We could even use a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html">Dead-Letter queue</a> to debug and process failed actions.</li>
<li>Trigger and action are decoupled. Since there could be multiple actions that could take a variable amount of time, processing everything in a single Lambda function could lead to Lambda timeouts.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/action.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/action.png"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="cost">Cost</h2>
<p>Now that we have a rough idea of how to build such a system, let’s look at what it will potentially cost us. I came up with a rough estimate of how this system would be used based on my current usage of Zapier:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run 5 workflows</strong>: 3 of them are webhooks based, the rest are polling-based. For simplicity, let’s assume each of these workflows have 2 actions.</li>
<li>The webhooks based workflows are triggered roughly 10 times a day. Thus, the total number of webhooks-based workflow executions would be <strong>30/day</strong>.</li>
<li>The polling workflows would run once <strong>every 12 hours</strong> and they would check for any new data in the API endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, let’s look at the pricing of the various AWS services we are planning to use.</p>
<h3 id="aws-lambda">AWS Lambda</h3>
<p>AWS Lambda has a pretty generous free tier which includes 1M free requests per month and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month.</p>
<p>These are the Lambda functions that we currently have in the system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: This function accepts any incoming webhooks and if a matching workflow exists, enqueues downstream tasks to SQS.</li>
<li>Polling Trigger: There are two lambda functions to support polling triggers. The first one runs once every 12 hours and enqueues any poll-based workflows whereas the second function runs once for each poll-based workflow and checks if any new data is available.</li>
<li>Actions: We run one Lambda function for every action in a workflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on our previous assumptions of usage, the number of Lambda requests we would have every month are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: 30 requests / day * 2 actions / workflow = 60 / day = 1800 / month</li>
<li>Polling: 2 requests / day + 2 workflows * 2 actions / workflow = 6 / day = 180 / month</li>
</ul>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, we can assume that our Lambda functions on average run for 30 seconds (probably much lower than this) and they take 1024 MB of memory.</p>
<p>Using these assumptions, our total compute will be (1024 MB * 30s * 1880 request) / 1024 = 56400 GB-seconds per month. We are under the free tier limit on Lambda.</p>
<p>Cost for Lambda (using free tier): <strong>$0 / month</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled.png"></p>
<p>Cost for Lambda (assuming we aren’t eligible for the free tier): $0.20 + <strong>56400 * $0.0000166667 = $ 1.14 / month</strong></p>
<h3 id="sqs">SQS</h3>
<p>Similar to Lambda, SQS also has a pretty generous free tier. The first 1 million monthly requests are free. Every API action counts as a request.</p>
<p>A rough estimate of the number of requests we would make to SQS are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: For every webhooks request we get, we would enqueue the actions for the workflow to SQS. Then, Lambda functions which execute the actions would dequeue these actions and run them.</li>
<li>Polling-based: Every time a polling-based workflow is scheduled, we would first enqueue all the polling-based workflows into SQS. Then, a Lambda function would dequeue these workflows and then enqueue any actions in these workflows to a different SQS queue which would eventually get dequeued by the Lambda function which runs the actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the description above, the number of SQS requests we would make are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: 30 requests / day * 2 actions / workflow (enqueued) * 2 actions / workflow (dequeued) = 120 requests / day = 3600 requests / month</li>
<li>Polling-based: 2 requests / day * 2 polling-based workflows (enqueued) * 2 polling-based workflows (dequeued) * 2 actions / workflow (enqueued) * 2 actions / workflow (dequeued) = 32 requests / day = 960 requests / month</li>
</ul>
<p>Total number of requests to SQS in a month: ~5000 requests / month</p>
<p>Cost for SQS (regardless of tier): <strong>$0 / month</strong></p>
<h3 id="api-gateway">API Gateway</h3>
<p>The API Gateway will only be used by our webhooks workflows. Based on our assumptions above, we will make roughly 900 requests/month to our API Gateway.</p>
<p>Cost for API Gateway: <strong>~$0 / month</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%201.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%201.png"></p>
<h3 id="dynamodb">DynamoDB</h3>
<p>DynamoDB has the most complicated pricing model out of all the services we are planning to use. More details about pricing is available <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We will be using DynamoDB only for polling-based workflows to ensure we can deduplicate any data.</p>
<p>The schema for our table would look like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span>
    <span># primary_key
</span>    <span>"workflow_id"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"S"</span><span>:</span> <span>"my_workflow"</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>"processed_keys"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"SS"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>"1234"</span><span>,</span> <span>"1235"</span><span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
<li>Primary key would be the name of the particular workflow</li>
<li>We would also store the set of processed unique identifiers for the data. For the sake of simplicity, we can assume these identifiers would be approximately <strong>10 characters</strong> in length.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on our usage model, we expect to make the following requests to DynamoDB:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read requests</strong>: 2 polling workflows * 2 triggers / day * 1 read request = 4 requests/day or 120 requests/month</li>
<li><strong>Write requests</strong>: A Write request would only be made when there is new data available in the API. Let’s assume we will have new data every time the workflow is triggered: 4 requests/day or 120 requests/month.</li>
</ul>
<p>I used this pricing calculator for DynamoDB and used conservative estimates that we calculated above.</p>
<p>Cost for Dynamo: ~<strong>0.50 / month</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%202.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%202.png"></p>
<h3 id="total-cost">Total Cost</h3>
<p>If we assume that we are within the limits of the free tier usage for Lambda and SQS, this system will cost us ~<strong>$0.50 / month.</strong></p>
<p>If we include the cost for Lambda, our system will cost us <strong>~$1.64 / month</strong>.</p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25174048">Hacker News discussion.</a></p>
<hr>
<p>This week's post is about Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module. You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binning">Statistical data binning</a> with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a>.</li>
<li>Adding new data to a sorted list with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module is to allow you to efficiently search and
update sorted lists. To this end, it provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a> implementation, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a>.</li>
<li>An "insert" -- as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort">insertion sort</a> -- implementation, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binning">statistical data binning</a>, you have data that you want to group into "bins". E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>You have data on different fruits and want to group "lemon" and "orange" into
"citrus".</li>
<li>You have data on students' grades and want to group scores between 80 and 90
into "B", scores between 90 and 100 into "A", etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, a straightforward approach is to write a function that computes the bin.
E.g., binning fruits:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def bin_fruit(fruit):
    if fruit in ["lemon", "orange"]:
        return "citrus"
    elif fruit in ["apple", "pear"]:
        return "malinae"


import random

data = random.choices(
    ["lemon", "orange", "apple", "pear"], k=10
)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['lemon',
 'lemon',
 'apple',
 'apple',
 'apple',
 'lemon',
 'apple',
 'apple',
 'lemon',
 'pear']
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_fruit(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['citrus',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'malinae',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae']
</code></pre>
<p>E.g., turning test scores into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States">letter grades</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def bin_score(score):
    if 90 &lt;= score &lt;= 100:
        return "A"
    elif 80 &lt;= score &lt; 90:
        return "B"
    elif 70 &lt;= score &lt; 80:
        return "C"
    elif 60 &lt;= score &lt; 70:
        return "D"
    elif score &lt; 60:
        return "F"


import random

data = [random.randint(50, 100) for _ in range(10)]
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[78, 87, 93, 78, 53, 92, 64, 70, 75, 60]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_score(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['C', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'F', 'A', 'D', 'C', 'C', 'D']
</code></pre>
<p>For a dataset of <var>n</var> records and <var>m</var> bins, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time
complexity</a> of this approach tends to be</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">O</a>(<var>m</var><var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because binning one record takes O(<var>m</var>) time -- O(<var>m</var>)
if-statements are checked -- and <var>n</var> records need to be binned.</p>
<p>If the number of bins <var>m</var> is constant, then the overall time
complexity is simply O(<var>n</var>).</p>
<p>But what if the number of bins <var>m</var> is large enough that the
straightforward approach is too slow?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable">discrete data</a>, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionaries</a>. E.g., binning
fruits:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>bins = {
    "lemon": "citrus",
    "orange": "citrus",
    "apple": "malinae",
    "pear": "malinae",
}

def bin_fruit(fruit):
    return bins[fruit]


import random

data = random.choices(
    ["lemon", "orange", "apple", "pear"], k=10
)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['lemon',
 'pear',
 'lemon',
 'lemon',
 'apple',
 'orange',
 'apple',
 'orange',
 'pear',
 'apple']
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_fruit(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['citrus',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'malinae']
</code></pre>
<p>Binning one record this way takes O(1) time -- regardless of the number of
bins <var>m</var> -- because <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionaries</a> are implemented using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash tables</a>. And creating the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionary</a> take O(<var>m</var>) time --
one entry for each bin. Thus, the overall time complexity, for <var>n</var>
records and <var>m</var> bins, is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>m</var> + <var>n</var>).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>And, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable">continuous data</a>, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a>. E.g., turning
test scores into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States">letter grades</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>score_bins = [60, 70, 80, 90]
score_letters = ["F", "D", "C", "B", "A"]

import bisect


def bin_score(score):
    i = bisect.bisect(score_bins, score)
    return score_letters[i]


import random

data = [random.randint(50, 100) for _ in range(10)]
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[60, 100, 88, 98, 55, 52, 52, 94, 71, 85]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_score(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['D', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'A', 'C', 'B']
</code></pre>
<p>Binning one record this way takes O(logÂ&nbsp;<var>m</var>) time, because
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a> uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a> to navigate <code>score_bins</code>. And
creating <code>score_bins</code> takes O(<var>m</var>) time. Thus, the overall time
complexity, for <var>n</var> records and <var>m</var> bins, is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>m</var> + <var>n</var> log <var>m</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NOTE: If you are able to use 3rd-party libraries, such as <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> or
<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, then look at these functions: <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.digitize.html">numpy.digitize</a>,
<a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.searchsorted.html#numpy.searchsorted">numpy.searchsorted</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.searchsorted.html">pandas.Series.searchsorted</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.qcut.html#pandas.qcut">pandas.qcut</a>,
<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.cut.html">pandas.cut</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In this scenario, you have a sorted list of data and you want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_statistic">order statistics</a> (e.g. compute the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median">median</a>).</li>
<li>Add new data.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you can imagine having a temperature sensor that regularly reports
the temperature. You want to regularly report the median temperature, as well
as be able to incorporate new temperature data as it arrives.</p>
<p>To me, a straightforward approach is to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-types">list.append</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.median">statistics.median</a>. E.g., monitoring temperatures:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def add_new_measurement(data, temperature):
    data.append(temperature)


def median(data):
    return statistics.median(data)


import random
import statistics

data = [random.randint(93, 100) for _ in range(10)]
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[98, 94, 97, 94, 94, 98, 98, 94, 94, 95]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>94.5
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>add_new_measurement(data, 97)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[98, 94, 97, 94, 94, 98, 98, 94, 94, 95, 97]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>95
</code></pre>
<p>For a dataset of <var>n</var> records, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of this approach
tends to be</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computing median:</strong> O(<var>n</var>) or O(<var>n</var> log <var>n</var>) --
depending on how the median is computed.</li>
<li><strong>Adding new data:</strong> O(1).</li>
</ul>
<p>So if the workload requires frequently adding new data and infrequently
computing the median, this approach works well.</p>
<p>But what if the workload is inverted? For example, if temperature measurements
are received every couple of minutes, but the median must be computed every
couple of seconds.</p>
<p>In that scenario, I think we would be better suited by speeding up computing
the median, even at the expense of slowing down adding new data.</p>
<p>Computing order statistics can be done in O(1) time if the data is already
sorted. So a straightforward way to handle this workload would be to sort the
data after appending and use the fact that the data is sorted to efficiently
compute the median:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def add_new_measurement(data, temperature):
    data.append(temperature)
    data.sort()


def median(data):
    n = len(data)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return (data[(n // 2) - 1] + data[n // 2]) / 2
    else:
        return data[n // 2]


import random

data = sorted(random.randint(93, 100) for _ in range(10))
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[93, 94, 94, 96, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 100]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>96.5
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>add_new_measurement(data, 97)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[93, 94, 94, 96, 96, 97, 97, 98, 99, 100, 100]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>97
</code></pre>
<p>For a dataset of <var>n</var> records, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of this approach
tends to be</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computing median:</strong> O(1).</li>
<li><strong>Adding new data:</strong> O(<var>n</var> log <var>n</var>).</li>
</ul>
<p>But I think that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> for adding new data can further be
improved by using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a>, which runs in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's Python code that does that:</p>
<pre><code>import bisect


def add_new_measurement(data, temperature):
    bisect.insort(data, temperature)
</code></pre>
<p>Doing this changes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of adding new data from</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var> log <var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this week's post you learned how to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module for
statistical data binning and adding new data to sorted lists.</p>
<p>For further reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>Algorithms that process input piece-by-piece -- like the temperature sensor
scenario -- are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm">online algorithms</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a> can be used to implement an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort">Insertion sort</a>. Insertion
sort is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm">online algorithm</a> and -- along with Python's built-in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort">timsort</a> -- is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_sort">adaptive sorting algorithm</a> because it takes
advantage of data that is partially sorted.</li>
</ul>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module provides "left"- and "right"-variants of
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a>: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort_left">bisect.insort_left</a>,

<p>Read the documentation and figure out what the difference between the "left"-

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <section id="main_content">
        

<p>Some days back I assembled a top of the line(ish) workstation for working on hobby projects and gaming. I bought the latest and greatest processor (Ryzen 3900x - 12 Core 24 Threads) from AMD and 32 GB of RAM for a no-compromises experience. I assembled the PC and it was blazing fast. I configured the system to run Windows and Linux (PopOS) using dual booting. I already had an SSD from a previous build that had the Linux OS installed and configured. I had my Twitter crawls set up on it and other services set up and working on it. I used Linux for Productivity and Windows mostly gaming as is the custom.</p>

<p>After some time, I realized this arrangement came with a very obvious drawback. Whenever I used to game, my Twitter crawls and other services in Linux, were effectively shut down. To solve this issue, I changed the boot order to set the Linux OS to boot by default. Even then, I wasn’t ready to accept this tradeoff when I had a processor that was more than capable of handling both of these OSes at the same time. If I were to somehow manage, to virtualize the existing Linux installation I had, the CPU I bought wouldn’t even break sweat handling both my OSes at the same time. I am also lazy and found it very hard to switch off a running OS and switch to the other one frequently. I just wanted to reduce my overhead.</p>

<p>So summarizing the above, I wanted to boot the already existing Linux installation I had on a different SSD as a guest VM in windows. I already had a Windows 10 Professional version so, the choice of hypervisor was easy, as this particular version of Windows comes with Hyper-V. The challenge here is booting from an actual hard disk instead of a virtual hard disk. The problems with the above approach are</p>

<ol>
  <li>Passthrough the hard disk (having Linux installation) directly to the VM</li>
  <li>Boot from this hard disk by using virtualized GRUB media</li>
  <li>Solve other issues for smooth operation</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="enabling-virtualization-and-hyperv">Enabling virtualization and HyperV</h2>

<p>The first step in this process is to activate Virtualization features from the BIOS and enable it in Windows. In my case, it was a simple setting in BIOS called Secure Virtual Machine Mode (SVM) which when enabled allows you to use HyperV in Windows. Enabling HyperV in Windows is then straight forward. Follow the below steps to activate HyperV.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Search Windows Features in the Windows search bar.</li>
  <li>Click the checkbox near Hyper-V. Press OK and you should be done.</li>
  <li>Windows will restart once to enable this feature.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/images/enableHV.PNG" alt="EnableHyperV"></p>

<h2 id="passing-through-the-ssd-to-vm">Passing through the SSD to VM</h2>
<p>The next challenge here is to make sure the actual media (SSD in my case) is passed through without interference to the VM we create. You have to make sure Windows is not using this media and forwards it cleanly to our target VM.</p>
<h3 id="make-the-device-offline-in-windows">Make the device offline in Windows</h3>
<p>To make sure that the media we are passing to the new VM is not being used by the host OS, we need to make sure the disk is offline. You can do that by doing the following steps.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Disk Management tool by searching for it in the Windows search bar.</li>
  <li>All your disks should appear at the bottom along with all the partitions in the bottom.</li>
  <li>Go to the Linux media you want to forward (the drive which has Linux installed on it) and left-click on it. You’ll get an option to make this device offline, click on it. Now the disk should be offline and the UI should be reflecting the change.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/images/offlineHDD.PNG" alt="offlineHDD"></p>

<h3 id="create-a-vm-using-hyperv">Create a VM using HyperV</h3>
<p>Once you complete the above step, you need to create a VM using HyperV. Go to HyperV Manager and create a new VM. Create a new VM with all the necessary configurations like memory and CPU cores. While creating a new VM make sure that you select generation 2 (No specific reason just seems newer and better suited to me) in the Specify Generation section and in the Connect Virtual Hard disk section select the “Attach a Virtual Hard disk later” option. Once you do that your VM should be created. To mount our Linux media and make sure we can boot to it we need to do a device passthrough to the VM.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the settings of the newly created VM, under the SCSI controller section you need to add a Hard disk.</li>
  <li>In the media section your Linux HDD should show up under the Physical Hard disk section. Select the Hard disk and click apply.</li>
  <li>Mount any other disks if needed.</li>
  <li>Download the SuperGrub 2 disk image from <a href="https://www.supergrubdisk.org/super-grub2-disk/">here</a></li>
  <li>In the DVD drive under the SCSI section select the recently downloaded ISO as an image file. 
<img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/images/HDD.PNG" alt="VMHDDConfiguration"></li>
</ol>

<p>SuperGrub2 helps us to solve the issue of not finding the GRUB partition as we are booting in a VM. We use SuperGrub2 to boot into our Linux install.</p>

<p>Once you are done, keep the DVD drive boot priority highest.</p>

<h2 id="disable-snapshots">Disable Snapshots</h2>

<p>HyperV won’t allow you to boot the created VM as the HyperV Manager cannot create a snapshot. This is because our installation media is an actual HDD instead of a virtual one. You can disable Snapshotting by going to the VM settings -&gt; Management -&gt; Checkpoints and deselect the “Enable Checkpoints” check box.</p>

<h2 id="boot-into-the-linux-vm">Boot into the Linux VM</h2>

<p>Once you are done with the above steps you can spin up the VM and you should be able to boot into the SuperGrub Menu. In this menu select the “Detect and show boot methods” entry.</p>

<p><img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/dualbootasVM/imagesgrub.PNG" alt="superGrub"></p>

<p>You should then be able to select your Linux version and be able to boot into it.</p>

<h2 id="configure-the-display-driver">Configure the display driver</h2>
<p>If you were using Nvidia proprietary drivers on the existing Linux installation you’ll need to remove them. Once you do that you need to install the xserver-xorg-video-fbdev package to make xorg server work.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt-get <span>install </span>xserver-xorg-video-fbdev 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I also added an x11 configuration file which might or might not have helped. Adding it just in case this might help someone. Create a new file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-hyperv.conf and add the below snippet to it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Section <span>"Device"</span>
 Identifier <span>"HYPER_V Framebuffer"</span>
 Driver <span>"fbdev"</span>
EndSection
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I wasn’t able to boot into the GUI (though CLI is still accessible) without the above fixes. Once you do that and reboot you should be able to boot into the Linux GUI.</p>



<p>Congratulations! you now have a Virtualized version of your Linux Installation which can be accessed inside your Windows OS. The advantage of this approach is you can still normally boot into the Linux OS and all your changes are consistent across both VM and the actual Linux system as the media is the same. The only problem I can see is enabling GPU drivers. In the future maybe I can dynamically switch the display drivers based on the context.</p>

<p>This method also won’t work if your Linux install exists on the same Hard disk. I feel in that case just converting the whole partition to a VHDX file would be easier. This method has its own drawbacks like the data won’t be consistent across both instances.</p>

					<div><p>PASK – Pianists for Alternatively Sized Keyboards – is an international movement committed to achieving change in relation to piano keyboard size.</p><p>Specifically, PASK aims to convince piano manufacturers to begin producing piano keyboards in three standard sizes. Purchasers of new pianos will then have a choice of keyboard size. In addition to the current ‘large’ size, we need two additional sizes with <u>narrower keys</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The current piano keyboard has prevailed since the 1880’s and was not designed for the physical capabilities of the population at large. It has been assumed that the current size is suitable for all, whereas in fact it is isn’t. The keys are too wide for the majority of pianists, considering men, women and children of all nationalities and across all age groups.</p><p>The current keyboard size and key width suits people with large hands, generally adult males with average to above average spans. However, for those with smaller hands, today’s piano increases technical difficulties and learning time. It limits musical expression and prevents access to a large amount of the piano repertoire. Worst of all, it can cause debilitating pain and injury.</p><p>A simple analogy illustrates the point. Does it make sense that all men in an athletics race should have to wear the same size shoes? And that female athletes have to run in the same size shoes as the men? And that children have to run in the same size shoes as adults?</p></div>

					<div><p>The<strong> long term goal of PASK </strong>is for acoustic and digital piano manufacturers to offer a choice of three standard keyboard sizes in accordance with the DS standards. These are: DS5.5® (7/8) and the DS6.0® (15/16) as well as the current ‘large’ DS6.5<em>&nbsp;</em>keyboard. They need to be&nbsp;mass-produced and marketed worldwide in such a way that the new alternative sizes are readily available and naturally accepted options for all pianists and teachers.&nbsp;</p><p>For this to happen, we need to focus on both building the demand from the piano world as well as encouraging supply from manufacturers. Clearly, these are interdependent.&nbsp;</p><p>Pianists with smaller hands must create a united voice and demand access to keyboards with narrower keys. Piano teachers, universities and conservatoriums need to recognise their benefits. Competitions and concert venues should provide a choice of keyboard for performers.</p><p>Alternatively sized keyboards are currently only available from a limited number of sources, are expensive and often involve long wait times for customers. The major piano manufacturers need to take up this challenge.&nbsp;A key factor in creating change will be public support from prominent pianists, academics and teachers around the world.</p><p>There are three main strategies required to achieve this goal:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raising awareness of the benefits of reduced size keyboards for those with smaller hands.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating opportunities for pianists to experience the difference in playing on narrower keys.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breaking down barriers and resistance to change.</p></div>

					<p>PASK is not a formally constituted organisation, but a network of people working towards a common goal.

There are three founders of PASK:

Ms Erica Booker from Sydney, Australia – Graduate of the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music, pianist and piano teacher. Erica is also a Suzuki teacher trainer and leading advocate for alternatively sized piano keyboards:<a href="https://ericabookerpiano.com/%E2%80%8B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://ericabookerpiano.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ericabookerpiano.com</a>

Dr Carol Leone from Dallas, Texas – Chair of Keyboard Studies at SMU Meadows School of the Arts in Dallas, internationally recognized performing artist, teacher, lecturer, and author. Carol is one of the world’s leading researchers and proponents of ergonomic piano keyboards to promote a pianist’s wellness:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.carolleone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.carolleone.com</a>

Ms Rhonda Boyle from Melbourne, Australia – Former government policy analyst/strategic planner with qualifications in physics, environmental science and urban planning. Rhonda is a pianist, independent researcher and author of peer-reviewed articles relating to hand size and piano playing:

<span>These three founders have no financial connections with any piano or keyboard manufacturers.</span>

The PASK network is gradually growing and now includes many others around the world who support the PASK goals and who are actively engaged in encouraging change.

					<div><p>The term ESPK (ergonomically scaled piano keyboard) is now mostly used in the academic community when referring to keyboards smaller than the current ‘standard’ size i.e., with 6.5 inch octave. The term ‘reduced-size keyboard’ has also been used in some literature. &nbsp;Also note that the DS5.5®<em>&nbsp;</em>is often referred to as the ‘7/8 keyboard’ as the key widths are close to (but not exactly) 7/8 of the ‘standard’ keyboard. Likewise, the DS6.0®<em>&nbsp;</em>is often referred to as the 15/16 keyboard. ESPK is a generic term that also includes keyboards of other sizes, i.e. that do not conform to the DS standards.&nbsp;</p><p>The ‘DS’ abbreviation stands for Donison-Steinbuhler. (Chris Donison and David Steinbuhler pioneered the introduction of piano keyboards with narrower keys for acoustic pianos, mainly in North America.) &nbsp;The PASK movement (Pianists for Alternatively Sized Keyboards) generally uses the term ‘alternative sizes’ to avoid confusion as ‘reduced size’ could imply fewer than 88 keys.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

      <p><i>4<sup>th</sup> November, 2016</i></p>

      <p>
	<q>SVG 2 is on life support.</q>
      </p>
      
      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>
	About a month ago the W3C's SVG staff contact person (Doug
	Schepers) relayed some very alarming news... that the SVG
	Working Group charter was not going to be renewed when it
	expired at the end of October, 2016. This was quite shocking
	as the group had worked quite hard to get the SVG 2
	specification to
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#Reports"><i>Candidate
	Recommendation</i></a> status. If the charter is not renewed,
	it would mean <span>an immediate end to
	SVG 2</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
	While shocking and unexpected, it didn't come out of left field.
	The active participation in the working group has dropped to
	just a handful of people, none representing any of the browser
	vendors. In fact, the last two "face-to-face" meetings had
	attendance of just three regular participants, one from Canon
	(which is dropping membership in the W3C as the end of the year)
	and two <q>invited experts</q> who are working for free. The weekly
	teleconferences were down to four or five participants (with
	representatives from KDDI and the W3C).
      </p>

      <h2>Recent Developments</h2>

      <p>
	The working group appealed to the browser vendors for support
	in renewing the charter. A teleconference was organized with
	multiple representatives from each of the major browser
	vendors as well as a number of other interested parties
	(Adobe, Canon, KDDI, etc.). The general consensus from the
	browser vendors is that SVG 2 should be finished but that it
	should be restricted to <q>fixing</q> the problems with SVG
	1.1 2nd edition along with a few choice selected new features
	(like 'paint-order') which have already been implemented by
	multiple browsers. <span>New features
	(meshes, hatches, etc.) should be removed and pushed into
	a <a href="https://wicg.io/">WICG group</a>.</span> (Wrapped
	text was not discussed.) (See
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/10/06-svg-minutes.html">minutes</a>.)
	A resolution was made to <q>Re-charter SVG WG for one more year
	with a focus on moving SVG 2 to REC with only the features that
	have implementer experience.</q> Note that this is a WG resolution
	and not a W3C agreement to continue the group.
      </p>
      <p>
	With a focus on a limited SVG 2 specification, the W3C has
	agreed to extend the current SVG Working Group charter until the
	end of January in order to give the group a chance to sort out a
	new charter. Any new charter will focus on completing SVG 2 by
	developing a test suite and in pushing for implementations.
      </p>
      <p>
	An additional discussion by the WG was that all joint CSS/SVG
	specifications will be completely taken over by CSS. This
	includes
	<a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms/">Transforms</a>,
	<a href="https://drafts.fxtf.org/filters/">Filters</a>,
	<a href="https://drafts.fxtf.org/css-masking-1/">Masking and Clipping</a>,
	<a href="https://drafts.fxtf.org/compositing-1/">Compositing and Blending</a>,
	etc. This completes the long process of CSS
	<span>stealing</span>
	absorbing the most interesting SVG features.
      </p>

      <h2>Future</h2>

      <p>
	The future is pretty cloudy at the moment. Here are some observations:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    There are only two browser implementations of importance:
	    Blink (Chrome/Opera) and Gecko (Firefox). Of these, only
	    Blink has the resources to fully implement new features
	    quickly although Gecko has implemented more of SVG
	    2. Chrome commands a huge lead in browser market share
	    (almost 75%). Google has a habit of unilaterally removing
	    features it doesn't like from Blink, basically dictating
	    that those features are removed from specifications.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Two other significant browser implementations, WebKit
	    (Safari) and Edge, are more followers than leaders and
	    have relatively little market share (5% and 4%
	    respectively).  For example, Microsoft explicitly stated
	    that they would not even look at SVG 2 until the
	    specification was a Candidate Recommendation (while the
	    other browser vendors have implemented a limited set of
	    SVG 2 features such as 'paint-order', see
	    <a href="https://nikosandronikos.github.io/svg2-info/svg2-feature-support/">SVG
	    2 Feature Support</a> for current status of SVG 2
	    implementation).
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    There seems to be a disconnect between the browser vendors
	    and the content creators. Even Adobe has expressed
	    frustrations with the current status (and they have
	    significantly reduced their involvement with W3C as a
	    result).
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    Moving things into a WICG is not a viable strategy.
	    Without browser vendor buy-in, things are likely to never
	    emerge from a WICG group. In addition, a WICG group is
	    intended to develop new ideas to the point where the
	    browser vendors can have a look at them. Both meshes and
	    hatches are already well developed with Inkscape
	    supporting full rendering for several years. (Note that
	    the browsers already have code to render meshes as they
	    all support meshes in PDF.)
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    Despite the large turnout for the SVG WG meeting where we
	    discussed the future of SVG 2, we have received almost no
	    feedback (after requesting it several times) from the
	    browser vendors on which SVG 2 features they are likely to
	    implement. This seems to be indicative of the low interest
	    they have in implementing SVG 2.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    Even the CSS working group, which has a much larger active
	    participation, is having trouble getting their specifications
	    out. Both SVG and CSS seem to be <q>passé</q>. The new
	    darling of the browser vendor set is
	    <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/03/houdini-maybe-the-most-exciting-development-in-css-youve-never-heard-of/">Houdini</a> which offers lower level
	    access to browser internals. This is not unexpected as
	    browsers continue on the path to being the new OS.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    The most important long term observation is that browser
	    vendors respond to demand. I've been told SVG would never
	    have been part of HTML5 if it wasn't for Inkscape which
	    allowed the production of tons of SVG's used in the
	    Wikipedia. Browser vendors keep track of the use of
	    various features. <span>Features with
	    more use get more attention.</span>
	  </p>
	</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What should Inkscape do?</h3>

      <p>
	Given the above observations, if we really want mesh, hatches,
	etc. to remain part of SVG 2 and to be supported by
	browsers <span>we must generate content that
	uses those features</span>; content that gets people excited
	enough to put pressure on the browser vendors to implement
	them.  We've already started to do this in a limited way by
	enabling the use of 'paint-order' which is supported by three
	of the four major browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
	Of course this means that some artwork created using Inkscape
	won't be viewable directly on the web. We should accept this
	as a necessary (and hopefully temporary) step. We can provide
	warnings in Inkscape when artists use features that are not
	widely supported. We can advise artists of work-arounds, i.e.
	converting a mesh to an internal image when exporting. And we
	can provide
	<q><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill">polyfills</a></q>
	that replace internal browser functionality with JavaScript
	implementations. (I've already started work on a mesh gradient
	polyfill.)
      </p>
      <p>
	I've been working on improvements to the mesh gradient
	GUI. This work has been back-ported to 0.92. We plan on
	enabling mesh gradients by default in the 0.92 release. This
	will start generating public content that uses mesh gradients.
      </p>

<h2>Backbone of Functional Programming</h2>
<p><code>map</code> &amp; <code>flatmap</code> form the backbone of Functional Progamming. It is very important be comfortable with these two concepts and this guide will help you develop an intuition for them.</p>
<p>This guide is language agnostic but I expect you to be familiar with basic programming concepts like functions, types, data type/objects and list. </p>
<h3>Nomenclature</h3>
<p>Let me introduce you to some basic terms we will be using to talk about <code>map/flatmap</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Type</code>s are data constructs and they can be <code>Basic Types</code> like Int, String etc.</li>
<li>
<code>Container</code> is a special <code>type</code> which contains another <code>type</code>. For example a List of Ints.</li>
<li>
<code>Function</code> is a function whose input is of Type 1 and output is of Type 2. Type 1 &amp; Type 2 can be same type.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Visualize</h3>
<p>Though I have defined three terms it will be easier to think about them visually.</p>
<h4>
<code>Basic types</code> (Int, String etc) will be represented by shapes</h4>
<p><img alt="Basic Types" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/basic-types.png">.</p>

<hr>
<h4>
<code>Containers</code> will be represented by shapes</h4>
<p><img alt="Empty Containers" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/empty-containers.png"></p>
<p>In reality, we will always use</p>
<h4><code>Container for a Type</code></h4>
<p><img alt="Square for Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/full-containers.png"></p>
<p>etc.</p>
<h4>
<code>Functions</code> will be denoted as</h4>
<p><img alt="f : Triangle -> Star" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/fun.png"></p>
<h3>Verbalize</h3>
<p>Let's see how to verbalize these terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Square for Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/t-sq.png"> Container for Triangle</p>
<p><img alt="Square for Circle for Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/t-crl-sq.png"> Square for Circle for Triangle</p>
<p><img alt="f : Triangle -> Star" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/fun.png">  f is a function from Triangle to Star</p>
<p><img alt="g : Triangle -> Square for Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/g-fun.png"> g is a function from Triangle to Container of Triangle</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Fundamentals</h2>
<p>In this section, I want to introduce one basic concept along with <code>map/flatmap</code>.</p>
<h3>Function Composition</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Function Composition</code> is chaining two or more functions such that output of one function feeds into to the input of second function and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Derivation of g . f : Triangle to Container of Reverse Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/gof-derive.png"></p>
<h3><code>map</code></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><code>map</code> is a function that takes a Container (C1) &amp; a Function (F) as input and returns a new Container (C2) for Function's (F) output type.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Rules for <code>map</code>
</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Type contained by Container (C1) has to match Function's (F) input type.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="map : (f : Triangle -> Reverse Triangle, Container for Triangle) -> Container for Reverse Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/map.png"></p>
<h3><code>flatmap</code></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><code>flatmap</code> is a function that takes a Container (C1) &amp; a Function (F) as input and returns a new Container (C2) for Function's (F) output type.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Rules for <code>flatmap</code>
</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Type contained by Container (C1) has to match Function's (F) input type.</li>
<li>Function (F) has to return a Container (C2)</li>
<li>C1 == C2. This is very important to remember as many people trip up on this.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="flatmap : (f : Triangle -> Container for Reverse Triangle, Container for Triangle) -> Container for Reverse Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/flatmap.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: As you can see, both <code>map</code> &amp; <code>flatmap</code> have the same written definition but the strictness is in the rules it has to adhere to.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Exercise Problems</h2>
<p>Let's conclude with a few exercise problems.</p>

<strong>FreeBSD - a lesson in poor defaults</strong>
<hr>

<p>
Last updated: 09/25/2020. 
<small><a href="https://twitter.com/blakkheim">@blakkheim</a></small>

</p><p>
This page lists some of the changes I make to a vanilla install of FreeBSD
for security hardening. Some changes to increase network performance or make
things a bit more more sane are also included. It only covers basic changes
that a sysadmin can make to a running system.

</p><p>
It could also be considered a commentary piece on the state of security in
FreeBSD's development ecosystem, highlighting their strong resistance to
change and unwillingness to replace old cruft with modern alternatives.

</p><p>
The project's
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/security.html">security page</a>
says the following:

</p><blockquote><em>
FreeBSD takes security very seriously and its developers are constantly
working on making the operating system as secure as possible.
</em></blockquote>

<p>
But is that really true? Let's find out.

<h2 id="openssh">OpenSSH Modifications</h2>

FreeBSD has a history of making "interesting" choices with regard to the
version of OpenSSH they bundle in the base system, often deliberately going
against upstream in the name of retaining backward compatibility or to gain
perceived performance improvements. Disabling or ignoring security features
in favor of performance seems to be a recurring theme, as we'll see later on.

<p>
It is my belief that quite a few poor decisions have been made in this area.
As a primary example, they insisted on maintaining the
<a href="https://www.psc.edu/hpn-ssh">HPN-SSH</a> patchset and enabling it
by default for quite a long time.

</p><p>
You might say "Well OK, but what's actually <em>wrong</em> with those patches?"

</p><p>
OpenSSH increased the channel limits enough to support a cross-country gigabit
connection without slowdown years ago. For most users, this means that the HPN
patches are an unnecessary complexity with little or no benefit. In addition
to that, they would frequently hold FreeBSD back from updating their version
of OpenSSH because of HPN backporting and manual refactoring of the patchset.

</p><p>
Support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_Wrappers">tcp_wrappers</a>
was abandoned long ago in OpenSSH upstream, but FreeBSD still
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=294328">patched it back in</a> and enabled it for everyone.

</p><p>
The same was true for weak DSA host keys, which they
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=294495">switched back on</a> for compatibility with older clients.

</p><p>
FreeBSD also
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=296634">re-enabled</a>
insecure encryption ciphers in their build after they were disabled upstream,
with backward compatibility apparently being more important to them than the
security of their users.

</p><p>
If we don't deprecate insecure options bit by bit somewhere in the ecosystem,
we end up with a situation like OpenSSL. Pressure has to be applied somewhere.
One can be part of that team, or one can play against them. In this case,
FreeBSD is the team trying to increase the risk.

</p><p>
They've made local changes to their OpenSSH build and its default config files
that left their users vulnerable when other platforms were unaffected. Here's
a (possibly incomplete) list of examples:

</p><ul>

</li></ul>

<p>
And the PAM issues in these two:

<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-15:22.openssh.asc">FreeBSD-SA-15:22.openssh</a>
</li></ul>

<p>
A list of FreeBSD's modifications to both the code and config files can be
seen
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/crypto/openssh/FREEBSD-upgrade?view=markup#l93">here</a>
for the base system (possibly outdated/unmaintained) and 
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/security/openssh-portable/files">here</a>
for the ports version.

</p><p>
Thankfully, as hinted above, it's fairly easy to install OpenSSH from ports
with all the FreeBSDisms removed. Their
<a href="https://www.freshports.org/security/openssh-portable">openssh-portable</a>
port has a hefty set of options you can toggle:

</p><pre>BLACKLISTD      FreeBSD blacklistd(8) support
BSM             OpenBSM Auditing
DOCS            Build and/or install documentation
FIDO_U2F        FIDO/U2F support (security/libfido2)
HPN             HPN-SSH patch
KERB_GSSAPI     Kerberos/GSSAPI patch (req: GSSAPI)
LDNS            SSHFP/LDNS support
LIBEDIT         Command line editing via libedit
NONECIPHER      NONE Cipher support
PAM             Pluggable authentication module support
TCP_WRAPPERS    tcp_wrappers support
XMSS            XMSS key support (experimental)
MIT             MIT Kerberos (security/krb5)
HEIMDAL         Heimdal Kerberos (security/heimdal)
HEIMDAL_BASE    Heimdal Kerberos (base)
</pre>

<p>
Besides the modifications mentioned above, two other patches in particular
have been popular with FreeBSD users: threaded AES-CTR and the "NONE" cipher.

</p><p>
Threaded AES-CTR, as the name might imply, introduces threads to the code.
OpenSSH developerss have publicly said threads are too risky and won't be
added. What's more, it's largely obsoleted by AES-NI in modern CPUs and the
fact that ChaCha20-Poly1305 (the current default cipher) is even faster
when taking the message authentication code (MAC) into consideration.

</p><p>
The NONE cipher is somewhat of a misfeature, removing the encryption bits
and only keeping the data integrity. It allows users to accidentally shoot
themselves in the foot pretty easily. The trade-off in performance isn't
really worth it either, as the bottlenecks one might experience have a lot
more to do with the MAC than the actual encryption overhead.

</p><p>
I recommend disabling all of the port options. The majority of users don't
need the extra risk that any of these non-standard patches introduce.

</p><p>
As for the <code>/usr/local/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> file, I would recommend
enabling only modern crypto. However, cryptography is a very complicated and
important topic, so you would be better served to research each algorithm and
come to your own conclusions instead of just taking my word. Thankfully,
upstream OpenSSH cares about security and continues to remove old, broken
algorithms as time goes on. FreeBSD can't keep patching them back in and
maintaining their backports. It's simply too much work.

</p><p>
This isn't meant to be an entire SSH tutorial, but consider changing your
default port to something other than 22 if you want less spam in your logs,
set up public keys and disable password authentication... the usual stuff.

</p><p>
The following config lines are just to revert FreeBSD's local changes that
introduce new risks:

</p><pre>ChallengeResponseAuthentication no         
UsePAM                          no 
VersionAddendum                 none  # Prevent some OS information from being
                                      # leaked by your sshd, another one of
                                      # FreeBSD's "enhancements" in both the
                                      # base system and ports version.
X11Forwarding                   no        
</pre>

<p>
In addition to improved security, using the port of OpenSSH allows you to
upgrade to newer versions much faster than waiting for a new release of the
base system. As an example, FreeBSD has comically been limited to "upgrading"
their base OpenSSH to a release that's
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=357926">three versions behind the current one at the time</a>
because of their local patches. Note that you may need further configuration
changes if using the bundled OpenSSH, as its options aren't as easily fixable.

</p><h2 id="mail">Mailer Daemon</h2>

FreeBSD includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendmail">Sendmail</a>
in the base system and enables it by default.

<p>
I'd like to share a quote from one of the earliest security advisories FreeBSD
ever published:

</p><blockquote><em>
The sendmail mail transfer agent has a rather poor reputation
for security related problems.  FreeBSD ships a version of
sendmail that has all known security problems fixed, but this
doesn't mean there won't be more found in the future.
</em></blockquote>

And it turns out whoever wrote that
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-96:03.sendmail-suggestion.asc">back in 1996</a>
wasn't wrong.

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-01:57.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-01:57.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:04.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:04.sendmail</a>
</li><li>

</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:11.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:11.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:13.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:13.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-06:13.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-06:13.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-06:17.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-06:17.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-14:11.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-14:11.sendmail</a>
</li></ul>

There are
<a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vendor/31/Sendmail.html">many more</a>
where those came from.

<p>
Even with Sendmail's reputation, FreeBSD has kept it around and left it on
by default for all their users.

</p><p>
To make matters worse, FreeBSD sometimes imports
<a href="https://marc.info/?l=sendmail-announce&amp;m=159394546814125&amp;w=2">sendmail updates</a>
with
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=363233">no mention</a>
of the included security fixes. As you might guess, this means no advisory
is published, and most users don't get those security fixes for a long time,

</p><p>
I think most users will agree that this old program is mostly just a bother.
A full mail server, especially one that's been full of holes since the 90s,
shouldn't be in the base system at all if you ask me. Something simple for
local mail delivery should be enough.

</p><p>
I stop all the related services because it makes startup slower and I'd like
as few things running in the background as possible. The lines needed to
disable Sendmail will be in the rc.conf section later on.

</p><p>
If you actually run a mail server, there are better options like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postfix_(software)">Postfix</a> or
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/opensmtpd">OpenSMTPD</a>.
If you only need to send mail through a third party provider like
Gmail, <a href="https://marlam.de/msmtp/">msmtp</a> is a another
lightweight alternative. All three are in ports.

</p><h2 id="firewall">Firewall</h2>

There are three firewalls included with FreeBSD: IPFW, PF, and IPFilter.
None of them are enabled by default.

<p>
I don't know anything about IPFilter, nor do I know anyone that uses it,
so we'll pretend it doesn't exist. IPFW is the native firewall.
It was written by FreeBSD, for FreeBSD, with their usual coding standards.
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-20:10.ipfw.asc">The</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-20:12.libalias.asc">result</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-20:13.libalias.asc">is</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-06:04.ipfw.asc">about</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-05:13.ipfw.asc">what</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-01:53.ipfw.asc">you</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-01:08.ipfw.asc">might</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-96:14.ipfw.asc">expect</a>.
PF is the OpenBSD firewall. It was ported from OpenBSD to FreeBSD. Which one
you use mostly comes down to preference. Since I'm more familiar with PF,
that's what I use. Unfortunately, the version of PF included with FreeBSD
hasn't been synced with upstream <strong>since 2009</strong>. Do you want
such a critical component of your OS or network device left largely
unmaintained?

</p><p>
Check the documentation for whichever firewall you decide to use for proper
configuration instructions.

</p><h2 id="portspkg">Ports and Packages</h2>

Other than just manually compiling things yourself, there are three main ways
to install software on FreeBSD:

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg">pkg</a> tool (with binary packages built by the project infrastructure)
</li><li>The <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/ports-using.html">ports</a> system, allowing for custom options in many applications

        <p>
            <cite><a href="https://sanctum.geek.nz/">Tom Ryder</a></cite>, 27 Oct 2017<br>
            Last updated 12 October 2019
        </p>
        <p>
            I host all my own code on my <a href="https://sanctum.geek.nz/cgit/">cgit instance</a>. I do have <a href="https://github.com/tejr">an account on GitHub</a>, but only because it’s a requirement to contribute to certain projects and even to log into some websites. I avoid using the account where possible, and I don’t host code on it anymore since June 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary reason I host code on my own domain is a practical one: I can retain control over its location via <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> redirects if it needs to move, including redirects to another site if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I also dislike the tacit acceptance of GitHub as the dominant free software hosting platform for a decentralised version control protocol, when it is itself centralised, proprietary, for-profit, closed-source, and politically active. These things make it vulnerable to the same issues and abuse that affected <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/05/sourceforge-grabs-gimp-for-windows-account-wraps-installer-in-bundle-pushing-adware/">SourceForge</a>. I feel that the free software and open source communities turn a blind eye to this massive liability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regardless of your position on individual cases, the fact that so much controversy results from any censorship activity from GitHub should be considered a warning sign that too much depends on their service. Some examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151208143727/https://github.com/opal/opal/issues/941">https://github.com/opal/opal/issues/941</a> [archive]
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/12/19/feminist_software_foundation_c_plus_equality/">https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/12/19/feminist_software_foundation_c_plus_equality/</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150802/20330431831/github-nukes-repository-over-use-word-retard.shtml">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150802/20330431831/github-nukes-repository-over-use-word-retard.shtml</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The issue here is not political correctness, it’s centralisation. If GitHub were not in this monopolistic position, nobody would care so much about any of the above.  The overwhelming monopoly that GitHub has as a code host is a problem that the free software community chooses to ignore.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Rules of acquisition
        </h2>
        <p>
            GitHub has investors who do not care a whit for free software principles, and eventually <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-03/microsoft-is-said-to-have-agreed-to-acquire-coding-site-github">the company <em>will</em> get acquired</a>—maybe tomorrow, maybe next year—and as we all know, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLWbp3w2eqM">money changes everything</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don’t leave your project’s nerve center—its primary address, its means of contribution, its issue tracker, its website, its primary documentation, its continuous integration, everything—in a way you can’t redirect!—at the mercy of people who merely want a return on their investment, and do not care about the principles of a minority of angry nerds.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Using Git does not require GitHub!
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you are managing a free software project, <em>please do not host it on GitHub</em>, or at least allow a method of contributing that does not depend on using it or any other proprietary code hosting platform:

            Since this page was published, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/">Microsoft has acquired GitHub</a>, and there’s been a small exodus to third-party hosting on GitLab, proving as a community we still aren’t really learning our lesson about third-party code hosting. That said, at least the core software for GitLab is open source, so it’s a marginal improvement, but we could be doing so much better.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you’re reading this because you’re angry about the acquisition and pondering a move to GitLab, I advise you instead to take the plunge and self-host your code repositories, even if you use the resource-hungry GitLab to do it. It is not as hard as you think, and once done, this problem will never bite you again.

November 21, 2020 | http://blog.benwiener.com/economics/2020/11/19/vaccine-delays.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://blog.benwiener.com/economics/2020/11/19/vaccine-delays.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I keep hearing about small delays in the vaccine development process that I don’t understand given how urgent the need is. I read a perfect example today. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/health/pfizer-covid-vaccine.html">A New York Times article</a> sharing good news about the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine mentioned that the company would be applying for emergency use authorization “within days”. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/16/health/Covid-moderna-vaccine.html%22">A similar article</a> cited a period of weeks for the Moderna vaccine. This progress is great news. It made me wonder, though, why not today? What prevented these companies from being ready to file with the FDA right away?</p>

<p>By all accounts, the rapid progress of COVID-19 vaccine candidates has been miraculous. Still, I’m confused by the apparent lack of urgency in certain parts of the process. Most of the vaccine development work is probably difficult to speed up. For example, it isn’t possible to speed up the rate at which trial participants get exposed to the virus so that effectiveness can be proven<sup id="fnref:hcc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hcc">1</a></sup>. But what prevents Pfizer and Moderna from pre-writing their application to the FDA while the trial is running and netting a few days or weeks? Even just a few days has serious value. Of course, the data is still coming in so there would be some uncertainty about what should be written in the application. But they must have a pretty good sense of how the trial is going. They could even pre-write two or three versions to cover the most likely scenarios. And of all possible trial outcomes, why would these companies both be unprepared for best-case scenarios where their vaccines are proving to be highly effective?</p>

<p>Getting a bit more speculative, why aren’t scientists at Pfizer and Moderna already in conversation with decision makers at the FDA so that the evaluation process can be started based on preliminary data? Then they could be possibly be ready to issue emergency use authorization immediately once the trial concludes. If there is an unexpected change in the latest data regulators should of course be prepared to reassess. To be clear, I am not suggesting that the approval process be less rigorous. I just want it happening in parallel with the trial as much as it can. Given how ridiculously destructive this pandemic is, I sure hope COVID vaccines are the FDA’s top priority.</p>

<p>This possibility reminds me of the mechanics of my thesis defense. My adviser, the main decision maker, was already very familiar with my work. Little information was actually transmitted to him that day. He already knew what he needed to know to make his decision. In fact, we wouldn’t have even gone forward with the defense if he wasn’t ready to pass me. He didn’t take a month after the defense to closely read my thesis, consider all the arguments, check the math, and then deliberate. That process occurred while the data was coming in. Maybe some parallelization of the approval process like this is happening for the COVID vaccines, but I’ve never read anything that gives the sense that it is.</p>

<h3 id="possible-answers-to-my-own-questions">Possible answers to my own questions:</h3>
<h4 id="why-werent-the-eua-applications-ready">Why weren’t the EUA applications ready?</h4>

<p>Maybe a document like this is <em>way</em> more complicated than I’m imagining and the drug companies are writing them as fast as possible. This sort of suggests that writing the application is a similar challenge to developing the vaccine. I hope that’s not right.</p>

<p>Maybe the drug companies <em>are</em> already working with the FDA, and the timing of the application isn’t important. As I mentioned above, I’ve never seen anything that suggests this.</p>

<p>Maybe these companies aren’t incentivized to actually get the vaccine to market as fast as they can. Off the bat this didn’t seem right to me, but could the advance purchase agreements that Moderna and Pfizer signed with governments eliminate their urgency?</p>

<h4 id="why-arent-the-drug-companies-working-with-the-fda">Why aren’t the drug companies working with the FDA?</h4>

<p>Maybe this just isn’t the way the FDA usually works and they weren’t able to adapt to this extraordinary situation.</p>

<p>Obviously scientific integrity is important here. Maybe the scientists are intentionally kept separate from other parts of Pfizer and from the FDA to prevent some kind of academic dishonesty. I wonder about the relative dangers involved, but I could imagine an explanation like this.</p>

<h3 id="answers-that-other-people-have-suggested">Answers that other people have suggested:</h3>

<p>Commenters on Hacker News and Reddit have suggested that the things I want to happen are already happening. I’ve looked into this a little bit, and I’m unsure. Both Moderna and Pfizer have been granted the FDA’s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/fast-track">Fast Track status</a>. This sounds great. It apparently means these companies have the opportunity for closer collaboration with the FDA, at least on clinical trial design. Some have suggested that the companies would also already be sharing advance results from their studies, but I haven’t found any reference saying that.</p>

<p>Fast Track also gives them the opportunity to participate in Rolling Review, which allows them to submit sections of their applications as they become ready. The references I’ve found discussing this are mostly <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-submit-emergency-use-authorization">press releases by the companies</a> or closely based on them. They discuss participation in Rolling Review in Europe and elsewhere, but I haven’t seen that they are doing this in the US.</p>

        <p><span>After Steve Jobs was forced out of Apple
        in 1985, everyone wanted to know what Steve would do
        next.... so NeXT was what he did.
        <p>
        
        In 1988 his NeXT team launched a new kind of computer for
        it's time, built on standards with a Unix core but with a
        user experience "my grandma could understand". It was well
        ahead of it's time, so naturally, it was not embraced by
        main stream consumers... a classic "Crossing the Chasm"
        issue. But many saw it for what it was, a breakthrough
        product as innovative as today's iTunes, iPod and iPhone.
        </p><p>
        
        Building upon NeXT's hardware and more importantly, their
        software development environment, many third party NeXT
        developers added their own magic dust to create
        revolutionary products, like the world's first web browser,
        or a new form of spread sheet, Lotus Improv or WebObjects,
        the foundation upon which the iTune store is built, to name
        only a few. Some of these ground breaking products may
        never be repeated. Most contained innovations embraced by
        future applications, with a clear lineage back to NeXTSTEP.
        </p><p>
        
        During the relatively short time of NeXT ascendency
        (1985-1996), Apple was bleeding red ink from repeated
        financial losses and two hugely expensive attempts to
        create a follow on Operating System. Apple's third
        president since Steve's departure, Gil Amelio saw the
        merits of Steve, his team and their technology. In December
        1996 Apple bought Next. Then the Next team took over Apple.
        The result is their hugely successful Mac OS X, built on
        the foundations of the NeXTSTEP OS.
        </p><p>
        
        While NeXT is no more, as a product or a stand alone
        company, it's impact on the industry will be felt for years
        to come. We should remember it, perhaps even study it. In
        decades to come, it will be understood as a watershed of
        innovation. Current Mac and iPhone users will be astonished
        to see how many of their beloved Mac OS X innovations had
        their roots in NeXTSTEP. There are many lessons about
        product innovation, market acceptance, and the creative
        people involved, that have yet to be uncovered.
        </p><p>
        
        This web site details part of our unique collection of NeXT
        related products and assorted items which grew up around
        NeXT Computer ecosystem, including of course NeXT hardware
        but also those rare items such as dealer sales kits, logo'd
        clothing, NeXT jewelry, banners, training tapes for
        servicing NeXT computers and printers, developer guides,
        plus third party software and hardware products.
        </p><p>
        
        While the site describes only part of the actual
        collection, the site does cover over 800 NeXT and third
        party products, many with multipage brochures and white
        papers. If you were to print all the html and PDF documents
        it would be over 3,000 pages.
        </p><p>
        
        This site describes what may well be the most extensive
        NeXT related collection available today.
        </p><p>
        
        It's history worth preserving.

<p>I've been a developer for over fifteen years and I've loved almost every minute of it. I can't imagine doing anything different but there are moments when I think back to starting out and how different the development landscape was, especially when it comes to learning how to code.</p>
<p>I'm really <em>not</em> that old, but things in the tech world move fast and there weren't as many resources around to help people get into frontend development and learn how to build something from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. There wasn't as many great communitys like Dev or Hashnode or WeStryve, not learning platforms such as Free Code Camp or The Odin Project.</p>
<p>So a lot of my early career felt like fumbling around for me, picking up everything I could from senior developers, hoping that they knew what they were doing, reading as many books as a I could and practicing my craft.</p>
<p>It's fair to say there were quite a few things I wish I'd known a lot earlier in my career that could have helped me progress faster or just develop both my coding skills, as well as my more complimentary skills, such as dealing with people or learning <em>how</em> to learn.</p>
<p>Hopefully, with this article I can distill what I've learned to date and share some things to watch out for and take on board to help you with your career as a frontend developer.</p>
<p><em>(Pssst -- If you like this article, come</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/kendalmintcode"><em>find me on Twitter</em></a> <em>where I post regular helpful content every day)</em></p>
<h2>Start writing a blog</h2>
<p>This very blog you're reading now (whether it's on my own website or my Dev or Hashnode accounts) has grown quite popular and that's great. But I really wish I'd started much earlier and written more frequently.</p>
<p>Honestly, blogging is such a great way to cement what you've learned <em>as you're learning it</em>. You absolutely do not have to be a developer with X years in the business, nor do you have to be an expert.</p>
<p>All you need is a curios mind and to think about writing for your past self: write the article you wish you'd had on the subject.</p>

<p>As a bonus, if you fix something particularly tricky, you'll be able to refer back to your own article to help you solve it in the future!</p>
<p>My friend Catlin Pit has a couple of recommended articles on blogging too:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://catalins.tech/should-you-start-a-blog-as-a-developer" title="Catlin Pit's article on starting a developer blog">Should you start a blog as a developer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://catalins.tech/how-to-start-your-blog-as-a-developer" title="Catalin Pit's article on how to start a blog">How to start a blog</a> - a common question after 'what do I write about?'</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ask more questions!</h2>
<p>This seems obvious, but in my experience it's really not. A lot of developers, especially those early on in their careers are easily intimidated by more experienced devs or just those that have been around longer, and this can prevent them from speaking up.</p>
<p>But you know what? That's how you learn: you ask questions, you get answers (and, back to the previous point, you now have content for a blog article!).</p>
<p>Never be afraid of asking questions, especially if you're stuck on something. There are no stupid questions, but I'm not going to lie, you will at some point come across arrogant or unhelpful people who will make you feel otherwise. My advice, ignore them and find more open and helpful people.</p>
<h2>Be honest on what you're passionate about</h2>
<p>If you love what you do and are fortunate enough to get to do that regularly, especially as a full time career then you've hit the jackpot.</p>
<p>However, I see a lot of people stuck in places and in roles that they just don't have the passion or drive for. I'm well aware that not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to pick and choose, but as developers we have long held a valuable position in the job market where there are more jobs than there are developers.</p>
<p>But this is really about having a truthful discussion with your inner dev and being both honest about what you <em>really</em> enjoy doing/not doing, and realistic about how to start a role doing this.</p>
<p>For example, if you really really really don't like PHP, then take care when interviewing or seeking out roles in development agencies where WordPress is heavily featured.</p>
<p>This advice is especially true for those seeking, perhaps, their first development roles. Be honest and candid about what's right for you and (if you're able to), don't just jump at the first opportunity that comes your way.</p>
<p>The more you can discover what direction you want to travel, the better aligned you'll be down the line in your career.</p>
<p>With all of the above said, please don't put pressure on yourself to decide too early. Sometimes you have to experience what you <em>don't</em> want to know what <em>is</em> right for you.</p>
<h2>Get a coding mentor</h2>
<p>I was supremely fortunate to have worked with some amazing developers back when I started. They were experienced, knowledgable, helpful and humble and really took me under their wing. I'll never be able to thank them enough.</p>
<p>Therefore, I'd highly recommend getting yourself a mentor to help with your development journey.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f095de9a3d4e32487247b46342959b1cc2f8e9d1/3c273/img/people-2569234_640.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is different from a teacher or tutor (although there is overlap at the edges of the roles): a mentor is a guiding light to help give you focus and direction, to answer questions and point you along the right path for your particular journey.</p>
<p>I'd recommend taking a look at <a href="https://codingcoach.io/" title="Coding Coach website">Coding Coach</a> or my very own <a href="https://robkendal.co.uk/mentorship" title="Rob Kendal coding mentorship programmes">mentorship programmes</a> to find a mentor that's right for you.</p>
<h2>Mentor others</h2>
<p>Following on from the last point, you too can be a mentor and again, you don't have to have coded for decades or be an absolute expert.</p>
<p>Think about where you are on your journey and how far you've come. Even if you're 6-8 months into learning to code, there are people only 1-2 <em>weeks</em> into theirs; these are the people you can definitely help out.</p>
<p>That said, if you <em>are</em> quite experienced, then all the more reason to help someone else who's just starting out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Become the guide you wish you'd had when you started</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's rewarding beyond measure, and a win win situation: someone getting started is helped and guided, and you learn so much in the process, believe me.</p>
<h2>You don't get what you don't ask for</h2>
<p>I'm from Yorkshire in the UK and there's a saying in this North East part of the world: Shy bairns get nowt.</p>
<p>In essence we're really saying that 'you get nothing by keeping quiet'.</p>
<p>It's easy to look at seemingly successful developers and popular Twitter personas and assume that everyone has lucky breaks and opportunity just falls from the sky.</p>
<p>To be honest, this does happen to a small number of people, but most of the successful people you'll know are a combination of trying (a lot), keeping their eyes open for opportunities and only a little sprinkle of luck.</p>
<p>Most of the time it's about asking for what you want. Now I'm not suggesting you just go kicking your boss' door in a demanding a raise, but in all seriousness, if you think you deserve a pay rise, prove it and then <em>ask for it</em>!</p>
<p>Want to switch up your career? Ask about training programs at your current workplace. Want to talk to someone on LinkedIn about their career? Ask them.</p>
<p>The worst that will happen is you get a 'no'. In which case, time to move on and try something else.</p>
<h2>Keep track of all your wins</h2>
<p>This is a big one for me. It's very easy as a human to skew towards the negative. Even if you've just launched five features on a product used by millions, I would bet that it's that single tiny error that happened that you'll be thinking about, right?!</p>
<p>I keep a notebook of little victories and compliments I've received and look through them from time to time, especially when the <a href="https://robkendal.co.uk/blog/2019-05-10-fighting-imposter-syndrome-as-a-developer" title="Fighting imposter syndrome as a developer">imposter syndrome</a> kicks in from time to time.</p>
<p>It's not about ego or vanity, but it's about celebrating your victories and remembering how far you've come.</p>
<h2>You don't have to know everything</h2>
<p>The world of deveopment is HUGE. I mean seriously almost infinite. Between languages, frameworks, patterns, platforms, frontend, backend, the list goes on.</p>
<p>When you're starting out there can be an overwhelming urge to have to know everything all at once. But I'm here to tell you that you don't need to know everything and, in reality, you can't or won't ever know it all q-- the landscape is just too vast.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3f6e59a451413441a9a9f410a3dd2bf527cf301f/b6003/img/magic-cube-1976725_640.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Of course, as a frontend developer starting out, I'd recommend focussing on the three core pillars of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but once you're getting into the swing of things, start to add bits and pieces to your knowledge depending on what takes your fancy.</p>
<h2>Senior doesn't mean encylopedia</h2>
<p>Just because someone is a senior developer or an architect or principle, or has been programming for 100's of years, does not automatically make them the all knowing beasts you think they may be.</p>
<p>I'll let you into a secret: I've been developing in a fullstack fashion for over fifteen years and I still have to look up some of the most trivial snippets of code; I still miss semicolons out of things and I still make mistakes.</p>
<p>Sure, I know a lot about a lot, but there's oceans of knowledge I haven't even sailed upon. Just because people have been around the block doesn't directly equate to an infallible, all-knowing knowledge. Neither does it mean they're always automatically right or know better.</p>
<p>The point I'm driving at here is that just because you're less experienced or starting out doesn't mean your ideas are less valuable or that you have less to contribute.</p>
<p>It's also why adopting a life long approach to learning is so important as a developer.</p>
<h2>Titles don't really mean much in the long run</h2>
<p>Another thing to bear in mind is that some people get caught up in a title race and it's easy to think that becoming a 'principle developer' or 'lead architect' is the end goal. Yes, titles and recognition are nice and there's money and rewards that come with more senior titles, but they don't always reflect the abilities of the holder nor</p>
<p>I'm not saying that it's not OK to have 'become a lead developer' as a goal, but don't set your standards by the titles that you, or others, hold. It's your attitude, actions, and what you contribute to the development community that will ultimately shape your legacy.</p>
<h2>Networking is essential!!</h2>
<p>It really is <em>who you know</em> not always <em>what you know</em>.</p>
<p>I wish I'd spent more time making connections with other developers, recruiters, leaders, and makers …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>As Bitcoin approaches a new price record after 3 years delay a new wave of its popularity and advertisement is expected. In such waves all the risks, downsides, pitfalls are usually hidden and the bright future is pleasantly described. I want to highlight all those dark corners and also to give my view of this field.</p>

<h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

<p>As the first decentralized digital currency Bitcoin’s main purpose was to serve as a digital money service that requires no trust in a central authority, and that will be free from control. But with an extreme raise of its value it gained another purpose — as an investment asset. Current data suggests that the second purpose greatly supersedes the original one.</p>

<p>In accordance with those two purposes, we’ll consider two types of downsides and risks — technical and economical.</p>

<h3 id="technical-downsides"><strong>Technical downsides</strong></h3>

<p>Two main technical downsides of Bitcoin are inefficiency and limited scalability.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/">Bitcoin energy consumption index</a>, as of the time of writing, one single transaction consumes 700 kWh of energy, a huge waste. And this consumption will only increase with the growth of the network.</p>

<p>But increasing energy consumption isn’t the biggest problem since the growth of the total number of transactions is limited due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_scalability_problem">Bitcoin scalability problem</a>. It is estimated that the whole Bitcoin throughput can’t be more than 7 transactions per second on average. This is the dead-end for its original purpose.</p>

<p>While the absolute majority of other cryptocurrencies are useless imitators or straight-up scams, some of them indeed have slight improvements or useful extensions. It’s hard to create something perfect from the first shot, after all. Technology advancement is an evolutionary process.</p>

<p>I find this risk the most important — an emergence of a novel cryptocurrency that will contain a critical mass of improvements and extensions. Or, it could be just decent cryptocurrency, but backed by strong financial institutions (though it’s unlikely that some government will ever release a truly decentralized currency).</p>

<h3 id="economic-picture"><strong>Economic picture</strong></h3>

<p>Bitcoin proponents will argue that technical limitations are not an issue. They like to compare Bitcoin with gold, and gold isn’t transporting on the left and right. What they don’t say is that gold is a <em>natural</em> resource that has a lot of different uses in electronics, medicine, or even in food. Also, it’s naturally hard to obtain, it’s produced only in rare cosmic events, like supernova explosions or neutron stars collisions. And what is Bitcoin without its original purpose?</p>

<p>Well, it’s certainly a masterpiece, the first of a kind. But in this perspective it’s comparable with works of arts. They also have value, but no particular, instrumental purpose.</p>

<p>Thus, Bitcoin value will be pure speculation in the future with more advanced technologies. But in its current price there is also a huge amount of speculation. With no doubt the majority of people “invest” in Bitcoin just to raise a fortune, not to use it as payment. Though, I wouldn’t call it an investment. A typical investment is supposed to be spent on the production of new value. But no new value is produced when you buy Bitcoin. This is why it looks just like a financial pyramid — newcomers are the only reason for the price growth.</p>

<h3 id="a-huge-oxymoron"><strong>A huge oxymoron</strong></h3>

<p>Finally, I want to address the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>

<p>Despite imperfections, Bitcoin was built with great ideals in mind.
Decentralization and freedom are the values that humankind must pursue, I believe.</p>

<p>But the ecosystem that arose around Bitcoin is mostly ignorant of those ideals.</p>

<p><strong><em>Exchanges</em></strong></p>

<p>A huge part of the cryptocurrency world is the exchanges. 
But they are centralized! They are in control of your funds. You have to trust them. So there is no difference with an ordinary financial institution. Well, actually, there is. A cryptocurrency exchange found on the internet can be run by a high-school kid just for fun.</p>

<p>Exchanges possess a great value in cryptocurrencies and are responsible for a big part of all Bitcoin transactions. They are entities that have the power and resources to play with the market.</p>

<p>The problem of exchanges can’t be solved since truly decentralized exchanges are impossible or impractical.</p>

<p><strong><em>Mining pools</em></strong></p>

<p>A mining pool is a clever way to unite the computational resources needed for mining new blocks. But again, they are centralized and as a single miner you have to trust them. There are pools that require no trust in a coordinator, but they don’t propose additional incentives for a single miner.</p>

<p>A dozen mining pools generate around 75% of new Bitcoin blocks according to <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/pools">these stats</a>. Control them — and you can control the network. Note that big exchanges have their own mining pools. Yeah, decentralization…</p>

<p><strong><em>Mixers</em></strong></p>

<p>Bitcoin mixer is a way to hide a transaction sender and receiver. The story is the same as with exchanges and pools. They are centralized in nature and this can’t be solved.</p>

<p><strong><em>Stable cryptocurrencies</em></strong></p>

<p>This is the most ridiculous part and the best indicator of all of this farce. For me “stable cryptocurrency” is just an oxymoron. Operators of such mimic currencies are not only centralized and you have to trust them — they do not even comply with the laws of countries that print original currencies. They are worse than ordinary banks.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">coinmarketcap</a>, Tether, a USD mimic, is in the third place by a total market value and largely exceeds Bitcoin in transactions volume. A clusterfuck in the world of cryptocurrencies, in my opinion. Decentralization? What decentralization?</p>

<h3 id="the-future"><strong>The future</strong></h3>

<p>While I’m a big proponent of decentralization, I don’t believe in the longtime future of Bitcoin. The only reason for its future survival is the respect of its users. I have no idea what price it can achieve, but I’m 100% sure the price will have a speculative nature.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about corporate knowledge management systems recently.</p>



<p>If we think about a company as an organism, then a knowledge management system is essentially the (collective) brain that keeps that organism alive and running. A corporate knowledge management system should contain every single bit of codifiable information within the company resulting in a library of all projects, processes and procedures.</p>



<p>In an ideal state, it is the single source of truth that helps to inform every individual in the firm about what everyone else is up to. Information should be easy to add (input) as well as easy to search and find (output) resulting in quick knowledge transfer between different employees.</p>



<p>In reality, however, this hardly ever is the case. As anyone who has ever worked at a larger company can attest to, company knowledge bases always end up being a huge mess. </p>



<p>What starts with a neatly organized Confluence wiki, over time morphs into a multi-headed monster consisting of millions of notes and documents that live across Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, Asana and half a dozen different wiki tools. Most docs will be outdated, some will contradict others and the one you are really looking for only shows up on page 14 of your search results.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/monster-4.png"></p><p>It seems like things usually start to fall apart once a company surpasses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar number</a> of 150 employees. This is probably when people start to realize that all the different documents of <em>explicit knowledge</em> they were amassing over the years have been held together with <em>implicit knowledge</em>. </p>



<p>It’s easy to find – and understand – the right documents when you know every other person in the company, but once you’re past that point, you need a system to organize all the data so that people can make sense of it.</p>



<p>The idea behind tools like Notion is to solve this problem by using just one tool for all your different knowledge documents. Instead of Google Docs AND Asana AND Trello AND Airtable, you just do everything in Notion. This reduces complexity because you don’t have to switch and search across different apps. At the same time, Notion forces you to think about a system that makes information easy to find with its folder-like structure and links between different databases.</p>



<p>I’ve never used Notion with more than half a dozen people myself, but from what I’ve heard from people at larger companies, Notion knowledge bases also don’t scale very well beyond a certain number of users. Once too many people start contributing to it, things become bloated and unnavigable.</p>



<p>A friend at Stripe recently suggested – half-jokingly – that we should hire a librarian to organize all our internal data and documentation. The more I think about it, the more I like the idea. Perhaps every company should hire a Chief Notion Officer once it hits 100 employees?!</p>



<p>An alternative approach to Notion is a knowledge management system that can live across different tools and without active manual curation because it’s based on really powerful search. The folder structure of your Google Drive, for example, doesn’t <em>really</em> matter because looking up documents via search is faster and more convenient. Meta search tools like <a href="https://usefyi.com/">FYI</a> are supposed to offer the same but across different productivity tools.</p>



<p>But again I’m skeptical that this really works beyond a certain amount of users (and thus documents). I remember even Google’s internal search engine doing only a mediocre job of surfacing the most relevant documents (and even if it did you weren’t sure if there wasn’t a better or more up-to-date version of it).</p>



<p>I’m sure we’ll get there eventually, but until then we probably need a mix of automated search and manual human help – which is where Slack comes in. I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1097940802737704960">always thought</a> Slack plus Notion plus <a href="https://www.atspoke.com/">Spoke</a> would make a really powerful product (and I’m surprised Slack hasn’t made any major acquisitions in this space).</p>



<p>If you think about it, Slack is basically a search engine powered by humans: Most Slack messages are just questions. <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">It’s 911 for when everything else fails</a>. So if Slack had access to your entire knowledge base, it could answer at least the most commonly asked questions automatically. The rest would still get answered manually by the channel participants. Or your Chief Notion Officer.</p>

The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine has been theorized to provide protection against COVID-19. In a new study published in mBio, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology researchers provide further proof of this theory.</p><div id="text">
<p>Researches have shown, in new study <a href="https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/6/e02628-20">published in mBio</a>, that mumps IgG titers, or levels of IgG antibody, are inversely <strong>correlated</strong> with severity in recovered COVID-19 patients previously vaccinated with the MMR II vaccine produced by Merck. MMR II contains the <strong>Edmonston strain of measles</strong>, the Jeryl Lynn (B-level) strain of mumps, and the Wistar RA 27/3 strain of rubella.</p>
<p>"We found a statistically significant inverse correlation between mumps titer levels and COVID-19 severity in people under age 42 <strong>who have had MMR II vaccinations</strong>," said lead study author Jeffrey E. Gold, president of World Organization, in Watkinsville, Georgia. "This adds to other associations demonstrating that <strong>the MMR vaccine may be protective against COVID-19</strong>. It also may explain why children have a much lower COVID-19 case rate than adults, as well as a much lower death rate. The majority of children get their first MMR vaccination around 12 to 15 months of age and a second one from 4 to 6 years of age."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found a statistically significant inverse correlation between mumps titer levels and COVID-19 severity in people under age 42 who have had MMR II vaccinations</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the new study, the researchers divided 80 subjects into 2 groups. The MMR II group consisted of 50 U.S. born subjects who would primarily <strong>have MMR antibodies from the MMR II vaccine</strong>. A comparison group of 30 subjects had no record of MMR II vaccinations, and would primarily have MMR antibodies from other sources, including prior measles, mumps, and/or rubella illnesses. The researchers found a significant inverse correlation (rs = -0.71, P &lt; 0.001) between mumps titers and COVID-19 severity within the MMR II group. There were no significant correlations between mumps titers and disease severity in the comparison group, between mumps titers and age in the MMR II group, or between severity and measles or rubella titers in either group.</p>
<p>Within the MMR II group, mumps titers of 134 to 300 AU/ml (n=8) were only found in those who were functionally immune or asymptomatic. All with mild COVID-19 symptoms had mumps titers below 134 AU/ml (n=17). All with moderate symptoms had mumps titers below 75 AU/ml (n=11). All who had been hospitalized and required oxygen had mumps titers below 32 AU/ml (n=5). Titers were measured by Quest Diagnostics using their standard diagnostic protocol.</p>
<p>"This is the <strong>first immunological study</strong> to evaluate the relationship between the MMR II vaccine and COVID-19. The statistically significant inverse correlation between mumps titers and COVID-19 indicates that there is a relationship involved that warrants further investigation," said coauthor David J. Hurley, PhD, professor and molecular microbiologist at the University of Georgia. "The MMR II vaccine is considered a safe vaccine with very few side effects. If it has the ultimate benefit of preventing infection from COVID-19, preventing the spread of COVID-19, reducing the severity of it, or a combination of any or all of those, it is a very high reward low risk ratio intervention. Maximum seropositivity is achieved through two vaccinations at least 28 days apart. Based upon our study, it would be prudent to vaccinate those over 40 regardless of whether or not they already have high serum MMR titers."</p>

<p>The <a href="https://asm.org/">American Society for Microbiology</a> is one of the largest professional societies dedicated to the life sciences and is composed of 30,000 scientists and health practitioners. ASM's mission is to promote and advance the microbial sciences.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Ever since I came to know about the <code>doskey</code> command in MS-DOS, I could barely stop myself using it. Not many Windows developers are familiar with this command, but this is a very powerful command to have in the arsenal of any Windows developer who frequently works on command line. If you type <code>doskey /?</code>, here is what you will see:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
Edits command lines, recalls Windows commands, and creates macros.

DOSKEY [/REINSTALL] [/LISTSIZE=size] [/MACROS[:ALL | :exename]]
  [/HISTORY] [/INSERT | /OVERSTRIKE] [/EXENAME=exename] [/MACROFILE=filename]
  [macroname=[text]]
vvv 
  /REINSTALL          Installs a new copy of Doskey.
  /LISTSIZE=size      Sets size of command history buffer.
  /MACROS             Displays all Doskey macros.
  /MACROS:ALL         Displays all Doskey macros for all executables which have
                      Doskey macros.
  /MACROS:exename     Displays all Doskey macros for the given executable.
  /HISTORY            Displays all commands stored in memory.
  /INSERT             Specifies that new text you type is inserted in old text.
  /OVERSTRIKE         Specifies that new text overwrites old text.
  /EXENAME=exename    Specifies the executable.
  /MACROFILE=filename Specifies a file of macros to install.
  macroname           Specifies a name for a macro you create.
  text                Specifies commands you want to record.

UP and DOWN ARROWS recall commands; ESC clears command line; F7 displays
command history; ALT+F7 clears command history; F8 searches command
history; F9 selects a command by number; ALT+F10 clears macro definitions.

The following are some special codes in Doskey macro definitions:
$T     Command separator.  Allows multiple commands in a macro.
$1-$9  Batch parameters.  Equivalent to %1-%9 in batch programs.
$*     Symbol replaced by everything following macro name on command line.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I will not be explaining all the features of this command, but will elaborate on very important feature called <code>MACROS</code>. This command lets you create a shorthand alias for your command. Once you create an alias, you can trigger that command using the alias. The alias can also take the command line parameters that you would have otherwise passed to the original command.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Let’s say that you frequently execute command <code>findstr /sin &lt;search string&gt;</code> to search a string in a directory, you could set an alias for that command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt;doskey find=findstr /sin $*

C:\&gt;find abc

&lt;&lt;results of findstr&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, I have created an alias <code>find</code> and mapped it to the DOS command I want to execute i.e. <code>findstr /sin</code> in this case. The parameter <code>abc</code> to the alias is forwarded to the DOS command that is mapped to that alias.</p>

<p>However, I find <code>doskey</code> more useful in triggering various development commands too like build, run, copying files, opening debugger, etc. To give an example, the command to build dotnet’s <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/workflow/building/coreclr/README.md">coreclr</a> is <code>&lt;repo_root&gt;\build.cmd -subset clr -configuration checked -arch x64</code>. I have mapped <code>bclr</code> alias to this command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\runtime&gt;doskey bclr=pushd .&amp;C:\runtime\build.cmd -subset clr -configuration checked -arch x64&amp;popd

D:\some_dir&gt;bclr

&lt;&lt;triggers build for x64 checked&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now imagine you need to trigger the <code>bclr</code> command for other architectures and configurations. You could pass the arguments in the form of <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code> and so forth to the alias. For that, you need to configure alias to accept parameter.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>D:\some_dir&gt;doskey bclr=pushd .&amp;C:\runtime\build.cmd -subset clr -configuration $2 -arch $1&amp;popd

D:\some_dir&gt;bclr arm64 checked

&lt;&lt;trigger build for arm64 checked&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="my-favorite-aliases">My favorite aliases</h2>

<p>Here are some of my favorite aliases that I have configured and use frequently.</p>

<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>

<p>Below are some of the aliases I set for navigating between various directories while on DOS command line.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt;doskey ..=..\$*
C:\&gt;doskey ...=..\..\$*
C:\&gt;doskey mydir=cd /d C:\this\is\mydir

C:\deep\down\dir\structure&gt;..
C:\deep\down\dir&gt;
C:\deep\down\dir&gt;..anotherdir
C:\deep\down\anotherdir&gt;
C:\deep\down\anotherdir&gt;mydir
C:\this\is\mydir&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="development-commands">Development commands</h3>

<p>You can set alias to perform your development activities like building, opening your favorite IDE or debugger.</p>

<p>To open your project using appropriate version of Visual Studio:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt;doskey worksln="C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe" C:\git\work\somedir\work.sln
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To trigger build command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt;doskey buildall=pushd C:\git\work&amp;buildir\build.cmd x64 checked&amp;popd 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To configure windbg with favorite settings:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt;doskey dbg=C:\debuggers\windbg.exe -o -y C:\git\work\bin\symboldirPDB -srcpath C:\git\work $*
C:\&gt;dbg work.exe hello world
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To set the environment variables:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt;doskey jitasm=set COMPlus_JitDisasm=$*

C:\&gt;jitasm HelloWorld
C:\&gt;set COMPl
COMPlus_JitDisasm=HelloWorld
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="getfindopen-aliases">Get/Find/Open aliases</h3>

<p>You can also configure some aliases that can help you manipulate the aliases that you have already set.</p>

<p>To list all the aliases set so far:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>c:\&gt;doskey allkeys=doskey /macros

c:\&gt;allkeys
find=findstr /sin $*
buildall=pushd C:\git\work&amp;buildir\build.cmd x64 checked&amp;popd
bclr=pushd .&amp;C:\runtime\build.cmd -subset clr -configuration checked -arch x64&amp;popd
..=..\$*
jitasm=set COMPlus_JitDisasm=$*
worksln="C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe" C:\git\work\somedir\work.sln
dbg=C:\debuggers\windbg.exe -o -y C:\git\work\bin\symboldirPDB -srcpath C:\git\work $*
...=..\..\$*
mydir=cd /d C:\this\is\mydir
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To search for an alias or command, you could set below alias inside a macro file (see below for macro file)</p>

<div><div><pre><code>c:\&gt;doskey getkey=doskey /macros | findstr /i $*
c:\&gt;getkey asm
jitasm=set COMPlus_JitDisasm=$*
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="macro-file">Macro file</h2>

<p>Instead of setting individual aliases using <code>doskey</code>, you could have all aliases in a text file and import it in at once using <code>/macrofile</code> switch.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt; more myaliases.txt
find=findstr /sin $*
bclr=pushd .&amp;C:\runtime\build.cmd -subset clr -configuration checked -arch x64&amp;popd
worksln="C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe" C:\git\work\somedir\work.sln
buildall=pushd C:\git\work&amp;buildir\build.cmd x64 checked&amp;popd 
dbg=C:\debuggers\windbg.exe -o -y C:\git\work\bin\symboldirPDB -srcpath C:\git\work $*
jitasm=set COMPlus_JitDisasm=$*
..=..\$*
...=..\..\$*
mydir=cd /d C:\this\is\mydir

C:\&gt;doskey /macrofile=myaliases.txt

&lt;&lt; all aliases registered &gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want to update the aliases and re-import it, you could do something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Open the macro file imported
c:\&gt;doskey okeys=notepad c:\myaliases.txt 

# Re-import macro file
c:\&gt;doskey updatekeys=doskey /macrofile=C:\myaliases.txt

# Now you could update and re-import the aliases

c:\&gt;okeys
&lt;&lt; update aliases.txt &gt;&gt;

c:\&gt;updatekeys
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>

<p>I usually have my aliases in a file <code>myaliases.txt</code>.  I wanted a way that every time I open my command prompt, all the aliases should be registered without me having to run the <code>doskey /macrofile</code> command manually. For that, I <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/run-command-prompt-commands-desktop-shortcut/">created a DOS command prompt shortcut</a>. Then, I opened the “Properties” of that shortcut and as shown below, in the “Target” section, execute the <code>doskey /macrofile</code> command.</p>

<p><img width="70%" height="70%" src="https://kunalspathak.github.io/assets/img/doskey/command-shortcut.JPG"></p>

<p>Here is the complete command that I have in “Target” section:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k "set reporoot=c:\git\runtime&amp;&amp;set BuildArch=arm64&amp;&amp;set BuildType=Debug&amp;&amp; doskey /MACROFILE=C:\myaliases.txt"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you see above, I also set some environment variables like <code>reporoot</code> and <code>BuildArch</code>. I use these environment variables inside <code>myaliases.txt</code> and so I make sure that they are set before I import the <code>myaliases.txt</code> file as a <code>doskey macro</code>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p><code>doskey</code> proved to be a very productive command for me and I realized that there is no limit on how creative you could get with it. I hope you find some good use of this command to make your day-to-day DOS commands productive.</p>

<p>Namaste!</p>

		</div>
		<dl>
			<dt>-d ${class_dir}</dt>
			<dd>Directory for generated class files</dd>
		</dl>

		<h3>① Path to Dependencies</h3>
		<p>Tell the compiler where to find your dependencies' JARs:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>--class-path, -cp ${path}</dt>
			<dd>Path to JARs, separated by : (🐧) or ; (<em>⊞</em>), e.g.
				<code>--class-path libs/foo.jar:libs/bar.jar</code>.
				Alternatively, add all JARs in a directory with <code>--class-path 'libs/*'</code>.</dd>
			<dt>--module-path, -p ${path}</dt>
				<dd>Like class path but with first-level support for directories: <code>--module-path libs</code>.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>Usually, regular JARs go on the class path and modular JARs on the module path, but that's not a hard rule.</p>

		<!-- <h3>&#9313; More Options</h3>

		<p>There are many options. Here are a few of them - they relate to the

		<dl class="cheat-modules-options">
			<dt>--release ${release}</dt>
			<dd>Compile for a specific VM version. Supported targets: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11</dd>
			<dt>-source ${release}</dt>
			<dd>Provide source compatibility with specified release</dd>
			<dt>-target ${release}</dt>
			<dd>Generate class files for specific VM version</dd>
		</dl> -->

		<h3>② Source Files</h3>
		<p>Tell the compiler which source files to compile. There are various options:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Manually list all source files (possibly including <code>module-info.java</code>), separated by space</li>
			<li>Automatically determine all source files with <code>`find ${path_to_src} -name *.java`</code>
				(include backticks, replace <code>${path_to_src}</code> with actual path; 🐧)</li>
			<li>Use <code>--source-path</code> or <code>--module-source-path</code> (not covered here)</li>
			<!-- <li>See alternative box <span class="cheat-modules-reference">Source Path</span></li> -->

		<p>If <code>${class_dir}</code> contains a <code>module-info.class</code>, the JAR will be modular.</p>

		<h3>① More Options</h3>
		<p>Option of particular interest when packaging modules:</p>

		<h3>① Path to JARs</h3>
		<p>Tell the compiler where to find your application's JARs.
			Works exactly as during compilation, but remember to include your JARs.</p>

		<h3>② More Options</h3>
		<p>Option of particular interest when running modules:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>--show-module-resolution</dt>
			<dd>During JVM startup, log messages that show module resolution</dd>
			<dt>--illegal-access ${value}</dt>
			<dd>Define whether code in unnamed modules can use inaccessible types/members in named modules;
				<code>${value}</code> can be <code>permit</code>, <code>warn</code> (default on Java 11), <code>debug</code>, or <code>deny</code></dd>
		</dl>

		<h3>③ Main Module or Class</h3>
		<p>Tell the JVM how to launch the application. If the main class is on the class path:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fully qualified name of the main class</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If the main class is in a JAR on the module path:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>--module ${module}</code> if <code>jar</code> recorded <code>${module}</code>'s main class</li>
			<li><code>--module ${module}/{main_class}</code> to specify or override <code>${module}</code>'s main class</li>

Why you would need to do that?
Because building modules from the command line is the best way to get to know them.

<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a>, a constant-time compare function implementation in <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, is a great case to demonstrate the <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/language-design/#0008401">predictable performance of OCaml’s compiler</a>. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal of a constant-time compare function is to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack">timing attacks</a>, which requires fully deterministic and predictable runtime performance.</li>
<li>Usually, cryptography functions are written in assembly to have total control of resulting binary and avoid unneeded optimization by the compiler.</li>
<li>However, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a> showed us that you can write clean OCaml and get simple and predictable resulting assembly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>This is the first issue of <a href="https://learnocamlthehardway.substack.com/welcome">Learn OCaml the Hard Way</a>. A publication about learning OCaml from the ground up.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="about-garbage-collection">About Garbage Collection</h2>
<p>It’s hard to have a stable runtime performance for languages that comes with a garbage collector. To have a predictable runtime performance characteristic in these languages, the following rules are usually required to be followed religiously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid garbage collections by avoiding memory allocations.</li>
<li>Avoid boxed values to generate assembly as low-level as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, the resulting code are usually unidiomatic and hard to maintain.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-explorer">Compiler Explorer</h2>
<p><a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a> is a handy tool for exploring compilers and its assembly output. It has built-in OCaml support and removes boilerplate automatically. I recommend you to test the following example with it.</p>

<p><code>String.unsafe_get</code> works like <code>String.get</code> but without bound-checking. It’s unsafe for most use-cases but it’s used here to <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml#L3">avoid jumping to exception</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OCaml provides a FFI <code>external</code> for <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/intfc.html">interfacing with C</a>. Here we use it to call a primitive function provided by OCaml’s runtime <code>%caml_string_get16u</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>external</code> is always unsafe and should be really take care about.</li>
<li>Primitives are not stable. For example: <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36">https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>n asr m</code> shifts <code>n</code> to the right by <code>m</code> bits. This is an arithmetic shift: the sign bit of <code>n</code> is replicated. The result is unspecified if <code>m &lt; 0</code> or <code>m &gt; Sys.int_size</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ref</code> creates a <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/imperative-programming.html">reference cell</a> and allows in-place replacement with <code>:=</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pred x</code> is <code>x - 1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>lor</code>, <code>lxor</code>, and <code>land</code> are logical bit-wise <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>, and <code>and</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the OCaml code is quite low-level (and not very functional). It’s still cleaner than most constant-time compare functions implemented in assembly.</p>

Similar to their syndicates, AngelList is powering a new generation of Venture Capital Funds known as Rolling Venture Capital Funds. This will be an interesting evolution in the venture investing landscape. With a ongoing funding model and a diverse set of LPs, can emerging GPs use this new model to bring new forms of Venture Investing to help better serve startups?</p><p>With a quarter-to-quarter funding model, these Rolling Funds will have cashflow similar to that of their startup compatriots. Recurring money in, recurring expenses out. A lot of the new GPs that are emerging to start these funds are former startup founders who have been part of a recurring revenue business. </p><p>Venture capital funds have traditionally operated in a singular investing model, equity. As startups begin to grow and require capital to help do so, VC funds step in and provide capital in return for equity in the business. Given the risk involved, VC typically need to maximize their equity positions so that they companies that emerge as winners can return enough capital to cover their losses. The issue is that the model in which these companies grow isn’t so stepwise, they don’t get huge chunks of revenue dumped on them like &nbsp;in a funding round, their growth is gradual, with deferred revenue meaning that their revenue and customer base can often outgrow their capabilities with the burn rate they set based on their funding round.</p><p>With a new rolling venture capital model could we find new ways to adapt this? With fresh capital available to rolling fund GPs each quarter, could we find ways to inject capital and liquidity into startups on a more rolling basis, just like the subscriptions in these new funds. With more consistent access to capital, could we help more portfolio companies become winners as they use this capital to help grow faster and gain traction? Can we take these new tools and help innovate access to capital for startups the same way founders and entrepreneurs innovate products and service?</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<img src="https://postgres.ai/assets/images/thumbnails/dle-2.0-blog.png" alt="Database Lab 2.0 release">
</p>
<h2 id="database-lab-engine-2-0-for-postgresql-released">Database Lab Engine 2.0 for PostgreSQL released</h2>
<p>The Postgres.ai team is proud to announce version 2.0 of Database Lab Engine (DLE) for PostgreSQL, a modern database tool for building powerful development and testing environments based on <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/questions-and-answers#what-is-thin-cloning-thin-vs-thick-clones">thin cloning</a>. Using Database Lab API or CLI (and if you are using Database Lab SaaS, GUI), on a single machine with, say, a 1 TiB disk, you can easily create and destroy dozens of database copies of size 1 TiB each. All these copies are independently modifiable and created/destroyed in just a few seconds. This can become a game-changer in your development and testing workflow, improving time-to-market, and reducing costs of your non-production infrastructure.</p>
<p>This release continues our strategy to automate all routine tasks such as initialization of the PostgreSQL data directory, data transformation, and snapshot management. In DLE 2.0, all these tasks can be flexibly configured in a single configuration file. As a result, building dev&amp;test environments for projects with many databases (such as those that adopted microservice architecture) becomes much easier.</p>
<p>The previous versions of the Database Lab introduced the core technology: thin clone provisioning, based on either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a> (default) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_(Linux)">LVM</a>. It was already possible to provision full-sized multi-terabyte database clones in just a few seconds and use them for a broad spectrum of tasks such as database schema changes verification, SQL query analysis, or general application testing.</p>
<p>Version 2.0 speeds up and empowers the initialization of DLE itself. Instead of using custom scripts for initial and continuous data retrieval, it is now possible to configure everything in a declarative manner to get the data and be up and running.</p>
<h2 id="updates-in-dle-2-0">Updates in DLE 2.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automated data retrieval: specify the source and the method of initializing the data directory and how it is to be updated</li>
<li>Both physical (pg_basebackup, WAL-G, more) and logical methods (dump/restore, Amazon RDS, Heroku Postgres, more) are supported (see the guide <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/guides/data">Database Lab Engine data sources</a>)</li>
<li>Any managed cloud PostgreSQL offering is now supported, with additional features for Amazon RDS (see <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/tutorials/database-lab-tutorial-amazon-rds">DLE tutorial for Amazon RDS</a> and the guide <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/guides/data/rds">Data source: AWS RDS</a>)</li>
<li>For continuously updated physically initialized data directory (which effectively makes your DLE a specialized replica), snapshot management is fully automated: snapshots are created and destroyed based on the schedule defined in the configuration file (see the reference <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/database-lab/config-reference#job-physicalsnapshot">Job physicalSnapshot</a>)</li>
<li>Basic data transformation and masking supported: specify any custom script that will be applied each time a new snapshot is prepared (option <code>preprocessingScript</code> in both <code>logicalSnapshot</code> and <code>physicalSnapshot</code> jobs, see the <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/database-lab/config-reference">Configuration reference</a>)</li>
<li>License changed to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">AGPLv3</a></li>
<li>The documentation is significantly extended: 3 tutorials, 26 user guides, 6 references, and counting: <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs">http://postgres.ai/docs</a></li>

      <p>
        WireGuard has gained traction over the past few years due, in part, to its high performance. We wondered how fast it really is, and realized that since we're already tracking VPN performance metrics for our <a href="https://vpnintel.com/unit-prices">VPN unit price index</a>, we could use the same data to answer the question, <strong>"how much faster is WireGuard than OpenVPN?"</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        We focused on Windscribe, Mullvad, and NordVPN, three providers that support both WireGuard and OpenVPN, and built a <a href="https://vpnintel.com/wireguard-vs-openvpn">dashboard</a> to visualize their comparative download speeds. We've embedded the charts for the week ending November 20, 2020 below along with some commentary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that all data on this page represent speedtests between U.S.-based speedtest servers and VPNs. Our methodology section below has more on this.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      <h2>Windscribe</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      For the week ending November 20, 2020, Windscribe's average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>134 Mbps</span> and its average download speed over WireGuard was <span>363 Mbps</span>. This means that by simply toggling the WireGuard option, Windscribe users can get a free 2.7x speed boost!
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://vpnintel.com/assets/news-dfd25285653d0eb57e648315d449e97092408746e1412f7bc9b4ed13395df2ab.svg">
       As of November 24, 2020, our 7-day Windscribe averages are 339 Mbps for WireGuard and 144 Mbps for OpenVPN.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        Windscribe's Wireguard speeds are almost always in the 300-400 Mbps ranges. Dig deeper into performance and pricing info on our dedicated pages for <a href="https://vpnintel.com/windscribe-wireguard">Windscribe WireGuard</a> and <a href="https://vpnintel.com/windscribe">Windscribe OpenVPN</a>.
      </p>

    <p>
      <h2>Mullvad</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mullvad was one of WireGuard's earliest commercial supporters. For the week ending November 20, 2020, Mullvad's average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>258 Mbps</span> and its average download speed over WireGuard was <span>672 Mbps</span> – a free 2.6x performance boost for Mullvad's WireGuard users!
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://vpnintel.com/assets/news-dfd25285653d0eb57e648315d449e97092408746e1412f7bc9b4ed13395df2ab.svg">
       As of November 24, 2020, our 7-day Mullvad averages are 675 Mbps for WireGuard and 273 Mbps for OpenVPN.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        Mullvad's WireGuard speeds consistently land in the 600-700 Mbps range. Take a closer look at the pricing and performance data on our dedicated pages for <a href="https://vpnintel.com/mullvad">Mullvad WireGuard</a> and <a href="https://vpnintel.com/mullvad-openvpn">Mullvad OpenVPN</a>.
      </p>

    <p>
      <h2>NordVPN</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        NordVPN launched support for WireGuard via its NordLynx product in Spring 2020. For the week ending November 20, 2020, Mullvad's average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>395 Mbps</span>. If the only number you remember from this page is NordVPN's average WireGuard download speed, you'll have the idea: a ridiculously fast <span>777 Mbps</span>, a 1.9x boost over its OpenVPN service.
      </p>
    <p><img src="https://vpnintel.com/assets/news-dfd25285653d0eb57e648315d449e97092408746e1412f7bc9b4ed13395df2ab.svg">
       As of November 24, 2020, our 7-day NordVPN averages are 778 Mbps for WireGuard and 416 Mbps for OpenVPN.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        You can see that NordVPN actually exceeds gigabit speeds on occasion. Its WireGuard speeds have a bit more variance than the other providers, but is uniformly well above 500 Mbps. For a deeper dive into NordLynx pricing and performance, check out our dedicated pages for <a href="https://vpnintel.com/nordvpn-wireguard">NordVPN WireGuard/NordLynx</a> and <a href="https://vpnintel.com/nordvpn">NordVPN OpenVPN</a>.
      </p>

    <p>
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>
        For the week ending November 20, 2020, our global average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>251 Mbps</span> and <span>583 Mbps</span> over WireGuard – WireGuard outperformed OpenVPN by an incredible 230%!
      </p>
      <p>
        All the more incredible is that customers of these services get this speed boost for free simply by selecting the WireGuard option.
      </p>
      <p>
        NordVPN's 1.9x ratio is a little lower than the other providers', but it still has a massive raw speed advantage. If NordVPN can get its WireGuard speeds up to the 2.5x+ ratios held by Windscribe and Mullvad, then it will be consistently serving gigabit speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's it for now! We think this stuff is interesting, so we'll probably make this a monthly or quarterly report. If you'd like to know when we launch new tools and publish reports like this, please join our newsletter:

       As of November 24, 2020, WireGuard clocks in at 597 Mbps to OpenVPN's 287 Mbps, a 2.1x speed boost.
    </p>

    <div>
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        Our system is fully automated which lets us take thousands of readings a day. The data on this page represents speedtests conducted between servers based in the U.S. and VPN servers also based in the U.S. – the speeds shown here are likely to be faster than what you would experience at home.
      </p>

      <p>
        All speedtests are done over UDP with the native OpenVPN and WireGuard Linux clients except for NordVPN's NordLynx/WireGuard service which uses the NordVPN Linux client since NordVPN does not provide WireGuard configuration files.
      </p>

      <p>
        At least as of November 20, 2020, you'll see some lumps shared across the three charts which may reflect resource usage patterns for our own hosting provider. We will report back on this.

          <a name="topofpage"></a>
          <p>Throughout my career, I’ve developed some <em>opinions</em>. Some have worn particularly deep ruts,
reinforced by years of experience. I tried to figure out what these
had in common, and it’s
the idea that <strong>code in production is the only code that matters</strong>. Staging doesn’t
matter, code on your laptop doesn’t matter, QA doesn’t matter,
only production matters. Everything else is debt.</p>

<p>This perspective probably comes from years sitting in between
operations and product development. I strongly
believe that teams should optimize for getting code to production as quickly as
possible as well as responding to incidents in production.</p>

<p>This idea, and a lot of the practices it implies, can be
counter-intuitive or controversial, so I want to dive into them a little
further. What follows is a set of practices and principles I believe are true,
considering my underlying belief that code working in production is the only
code that matters.</p>

<h2 id="engineers-should-operate-their-code">1. Engineers should operate their code.</h2>

<p><strong>Engineers are the subject matter experts for the code they write and should be
responsible for operating it in production</strong>. In this context, “operating” means
deploying, instrumenting, and monitoring code as well as helping to resolve
incidents related to or impacting that code. The responsibility of operating
code aligns incentives - it encourages engineers to write code that is
observable and easy to debug, and connects them to what customers really care
about. It encourages them to be curious about how their code is performing in
production. Importantly, engineers should be on-call for their code - being
on-call creates a positive feedback loop and makes it easier to know if their
efforts in writing production-ready code are paying off. I’ve heard people
complain about the prospect of being on-call, so I’ll just ask this: if you’re
not on-call for your code, who is?</p>

<p>If you’re not currently on-call for your code but want to be, and can help
influence this decision, there are some things you can do. Set up PagerDuty (or
similar) schedules for each group of engineers responsible for specific
services or parts of your code. A good schedule has 6–8 engineers. There are
plenty of variations, but a typical template is to have one-week rotations,
where you’ll be on-call for secondary for a week and then primary for a week.
Configuring alerts is a separate topic, which probably deserves it’s own blog
post entirely, but focus on things that impact your customers (see:
Symptom-based alerting) and remember that you’re ultimately responsible for how
you respond to alerts, which means you can change them.</p>

<p>There are two talks I’d recommend watching that touch on the topic of
configuring alerts: Liz Fong-Jones talks about SLOs in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4jbUzEVL0">Cultivating Production Excellence</a> and Aditya Mukerjee does a great job talking about techniques for
managing alerts in <a href="https://vimeo.com/274820572">Warning: This Talk Contains Content Known to the State of California to Reduce Alert Fatigue</a>.</p>

<h2 id="buy-almost-always-beatsbuild">2. Buy Almost Always Beats&nbsp;Build</h2>

<p><strong>If you can avoid building something, you should.</strong> Code is the most expensive
way to solve a problem that isn’t addressing a core area of your business. For
most small to mid-sized companies, there are open source or better yet, hosted
solutions that solve a wide range of common problems. I mean things like git
repository hosting (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc), observability tooling
(Honeycomb, Lightstep, etc), managed databases (Amazon RDS, Confluent Kafka,
etc), alerting (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc) and a whole host of other commodity
technologies. This even applies to your infrastructure - if you can help
it, don’t roll your own Kubernetes clusters (side note: do you even need to use
Kubernetes?), don’t roll your own load balancers if you can use Amazon ELB or
ALBs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH</a> syndrome is very real and some companies get burned badly by
this. I’ve seen teams light time and money on fire reinventing components when
better, more battle-tested alternatives exist in the market. Those same teams
almost always end up spending years contending with the resulting technical
debt. If you’re on such a team and have the will and ability to impact change,
start rolling back these decisions one by one. Migrate your databases to a
managed provider, migrate your feature flagging system to a SaaS tool (i.e.
LaunchDarkly). Keep going until the only software you maintain yourselves is
the software that delivers value to your customers. You’ll be much, much better
off for it.</p>

<h2 id="make-deployseasy">3. Make Deploys&nbsp;Easy</h2>

<p>Deploying should be a frequent and unexciting activity. <strong>Engineers should be
able to deploy with minimal manual steps and it should be easy to see if the
deploy is successful</strong> (this requires instrumenting your code for observability,
which - tada - is covered above), and it should be easy to roll back a deploy
if something doesn’t go well. Deploying frequently implies that
deploys are smaller, and smaller deploys are generally easier, faster and
safer.</p>

<p>Many teams implement periods where deploys are forbidden - these can be
referred to as code freezes, or deploy policies like “Don’t deploy on Fridays”.
Having such blackout periods can lead to a pile-up of changes, which increases
the overall risk of something going very wrong.</p>

<p>If you’re on a team that fears deploys, dedicate a percentage of your
engineering time to improvements in your deployment pipeline until the fear is
gone. On a recent team I worked with, we were able to improve deploy times from
3 hours to 30 minutes, which drastically improved the teams’ confidence in the
deploy process. A natural side effect of this was that engineers started
deploying much more frequently instead of waiting for changes to pile up enough
to warrant a “release” (which was synonymous with a deploy).</p>

<p>The book
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339">Accelerate</a>
has been getting a lot of attention. If you haven’t read it, I’d recommend it.
The team behind it also publishes the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/devops/">State of DevOps</a>
reports, which are full of well-researched information about what various
companies in the industry are doing. It’s not a coincidence that two of the
four key metrics that the book focuses on are directly related to this (Deploy
Frequency, Change Lead Time). Shipping is <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/o11ycast/ep-12-speed-of-deployment-with-rich-archbold-of-intercom/">your company’s heartbeat</a>.</p>

<h2 id="trust-the-people-closest-to-theknives">4. Trust the People Closest to the&nbsp;Knives</h2>

<p><strong>The people who work with a system are the ones who understand it best.</strong> This
applies to any part of the socio-technical systems within which we all work. In
the case of software systems, the engineers who deploy every day and are
on-call for critical services understand the level of risk they operate in. A
sad trend is that managers tend to overestimate their teams’ progress on
certain transitions - i.e. cloud-native, DevOps, etc. The higher up the
management chain, the larger this overestimation tends to be. Engineers who
deploy and get paged when things break know where the bodies are buried and
they know what needs the most work. They should, therefore, be the primary
stakeholders responsible for prioritizing technical work.</p>

<p>Another manifestation of this principle applies to platform or services teams.
If you’re responsible for building some shared component that’s used within
your organization (i.e. a messaging system, ci/cd infrastructure, shared
libraries or services) there’s an uncomfortable truth lurking for you: the
people who use your work know more about it than you do in many cases. They
understand implicitly how it serves customers and they know what contortions or
hoops they have to jump through to get it to work. Listen to them for
clues on how to improve the UX of your services and tools.</p>

<h2 id="qa-gates-make-qualityworse">5. QA Gates Make Quality&nbsp;Worse</h2>

<p>Many teams have a manual QA step that gets performed before deploys. The idea,
I guess, is to have someone run automated or manual tests to verify that a set
of changes are ready to be released. This sounds like a comforting
idea - having a human being (or team of human beings) “verify” a release before
it goes out - <strong>but it falls victim to several false assumptions and creates
some misalignments that do more harm than good.</strong></p>

<p>First of all, if there’s manual work that needs to be done before a deploy can
go out, that creates a bottleneck - if you’re making deploys easy, and
deploying small changes frequently, no QA team is going to be able to keep up
testing every deploy, and will inevitably block teams from deploying. That’s no
good. If you have manual tests, automate them and build them into your CI
pipeline (if they do deliver value).</p>

<p>Secondly, the teams doing QA often lack context and are under time pressure.
They may end up testing “effects” instead of “intents”. For example, I’ve seen
QA teams burn time testing that when something happens in a UI, something
related happens in a database. What happens when an engineer refactors that UI
component and changes the underlying data model? The functionality works, but
the test breaks. Because two teams are involved, this takes coordination and
time to fix. Similarly, I’ve seen QA teams block deploys because of failing
tests when caching was introduced at the CDN layer - a TTL of 5 seconds on an
activity feed may not ever be noticed by a user but it might break QA tests
causing unnecessary conflicts between product and QA engineers.</p>

<p>Luckily, solving this one is easy. Instead of having a dedicated QA team work
on creating manual and automated test cases that run in a fictitious QA
environment, reassign that team to work on continuous testing in production.
Instead of being a gate for deploys, a QA team could continuously verify that
production is working as expected. QA teams are also well situated to lead
Chaos Engineering initiatives, where faults are intentionally injected in
production. QA engineers could also work on making the CI/CD pipeline more
reliable, so that deploys are no longer a nightmare.</p>

<section id="mc_embed_signup">

</section>
<p>I was reading another engineer’s story this week about <a href="https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/data-point-for-job-seeking-devs">his 65-day job hunt</a>. I’ve avoided traditional job applications and interviews since I graduated from college, but a few things struck me from this post:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instead of targeting <em>every</em> job, Matt Dupree selectively applied at <strong>only 16 companies</strong> and withdrew applications when he thought the company was a bad fit. I love this advice.</li>
<li>Matt has built side projects, spoken at conferences, and blogged consistently for years. <strong>He walked into interviews with a trust level much higher than random applicants.</strong> I have said this before: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/code-notenough-karl-l-hughes/">coding skills are not enough to build a resilient career</a>.</li>
<li>Technical interviews still tell employers very little about an engineer’s ability (that’s a <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/hiring-process">whole other blog post</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Not everyone has the luxury of choice when it comes to choosing their next job, but if you’re a software engineer, you should be able to get there. There’s more demand for our skillset than there is supply, but you have to be intentional if you want to build a resilient career.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-resilient-career">What is a “resilient career”?</h2>
<p>People with resilient careers don’t fear an economic downturn because they have been able to put a little money aside. They don’t fear losing their job because they probably have half a dozen offers they’ve declined in the past year. They don’t stress about financial concerns because they likely have one or two side hustles bringing in a little extra cash flow.</p>
<p>I mentioned at the top that I’ve haven’t applied for a job since college. Skipping this step in the job search has been possible because I’ve approached my career very differently from most software engineers. Here are my rules for creating a resilient career:</p>
<h3 id="1-only-work-for-companies-that-need-and-trust-you">1. Only work for companies that need and trust you</h3>
<p>I skipped the job application process with all three of my jobs since college by doing the work that companies wanted before I officially started working for them.</p>
<p>No, I don’t mean you should work for free. Here’s how it played out for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uloop hired me to start their blog because I spent my free time in college building a blog, recruiting writers, and learning to code. I worked as a contractor for Uloop while I finished college, and when I graduated, bringing me on full-time just meant signing a W2.</li>
<li>Packback hired me because I stayed in touch with the founder for about nine months before they had any funding. When they were looking to hire a full-time engineer, they gave me a project from their roadmap. I did it as a freelancer, then joined full-time after I turned it in.</li>
<li>The Graide Network brought me on months after I started building a relationship with their founder. Instead of interviewing, I began as a consultant a couple of nights per week before they had the funding to bring me on.</li>
</ul>
<p>During each of these test periods, I got to see how much the company needed someone with my skill set, build trust with them, and get a trial run of the day-to-day. If I ever look for a job again, I’ll keep using the same approach because it works well.</p>
<h3 id="2-your-network-is-your-biggest-asset">2. Your network is your biggest asset</h3>
<p>You might also notice that two of my three of these career moves involved knowing my boss for months before joining. Notice that I didn’t run into them at a Meetup one night and get hired the next day.</p>
<p>For some reason, Engineers hear “you should network more,” and think that means they should go out and meet new people. That’s not how it works. Relationships take months or years to cultivate. You <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/the-key-to-networking-keeping-in-touch">have to stay in touch</a> if you ever want them to pay off.</p>
<p>Spend maybe 25% of your time meeting new people and 75% of your time staying in touch with people who you genuinely like. Personal relationships are founded on common interests, goals, or experiences, so find a mix of people who are both ahead of and behind you in your journey.</p>
<h3 id="3-cultivate-a-variety-of-interests-and-potential-revenue-generators">3. Cultivate a variety of interests and potential revenue generators</h3>
<p>I have always had a side project or two - mostly learning opportunities - but in the past three years, I’ve realized that you can generate revenue and build a network from them. Over the years, my side projects have led to consulting gigs, job offers, freelance opportunities, and a lot of high-quality connections around the world.</p>
<p>For example, CFP Land makes <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/cfp-land">a couple hundred dollars per month in profit</a>, which is fine, but the connections I’ve made from running it are worth orders of magnitude more. My previous side project, <a href="https://github.com/jobapis">Job APIs</a>, brings me multiple consulting offers per month (99% of them aren’t worth doing, but still, it’s nice to know they’re there).</p>
<p>My point is, anything I do in my free time is an investment in making my career more resilient.</p>
<h3 id="4-learn-on-your-employers-dime">4. Learn on your employer’s dime</h3>
<p>I was talking to a friend recently about his job search. He was lamenting that after five years of working hard for his employer and being let go, he was struggling to find another company that used the same tech stack.</p>
<p>“How much time did you spend learning new tools, libraries, or frameworks each week while you were at your prior job?” I asked.</p>
<p>“There wasn’t time for that,” he lamented, “We were always pushing to the max to get stuff done on time.”</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that my friend’s employer let him go. He wasn’t growing and when the company needed fewer resources in his engineering realm, he was too specialized to move into another area. He was seen as a resource that had to be let go. I used to think you could <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/be-indispensable">be indispensible</a> by being the best at one thing, but I’m starting to move away from that belief.</p>
<p>Any employer I work for gets me working ~35 hours per week on the projects we plan and ~5 hours per week learning new things. My value to my employer only increases as I become a more well-rounded engineer, so learning is non-negotiable. Now I bake this into my team’s weekly retrospectives - we share what we’re learning with each other - so we can hold each other accountable for learning new things.</p>
<h2 id="make-the-journey-your-own">Make the journey your own</h2>
<p>Finally, what works for me won’t necessarily work for you. My journey has involved working for early-stage startups - which you might hate - and being a software development generalist. Still, I think the fundamental goal should be the same: to build a resilient career.</p>

<p>This post is hard to write, both in the emotional sense but also in the “I would
have written a shorter letter, but I didn’t have the time” sense. Hence, please
assume the best of intentions when reading it—it is not my intention to make
anyone feel bad about their contributions, but rather to provide some insight
into why my frustration level ultimately exceeded the threshold.</p>

<p>Debian has been in my life for well over 10 years at this point.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I have visited some old friends at the Zürich Debian meetup
after a multi-year period of absence. On my bike ride home, it occurred to me
that the topics of our discussions had remarkable overlap with my last visit. We
had a discussion about the merits of systemd, which took a detour to respect in
open source communities, returned to processes in Debian and eventually
culminated in democracies and their theoretical/practical failings. Admittedly,
that last one might be a Swiss thing.</p>

<p>I say this not to knock on the Debian meetup, but because it prompted me to
reflect on what feelings Debian is invoking lately and whether it’s still a good
fit for me.</p>

<p>So I’m finally making a decision that I should have made a long time ago: I am
winding down my involvement in Debian to a minimum.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h2>

<p>Over the coming weeks, I will:</p>

<ul>
<li>transition packages to be team-maintained where it makes sense</li>
<li>remove myself from the <code>Uploaders</code> field on packages with other maintainers</li>
<li>orphan packages where I am the sole maintainer</li>
</ul>

<p>I will try to keep up best-effort maintenance of the
<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/">manpages.debian.org</a> service and the
<a href="https://codesearch.debian.net/">codesearch.debian.net</a> service, but any help
would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, please treat me as permanently on vacation. I will
try to be around for administrative issues (e.g. permission transfers) and
questions addressed directly to me, permitted they are easy enough to answer.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>When I joined Debian, I was still studying, i.e. I had luxurious amounts of
spare time. Now, over 5 years of full time work later, my day job taught me a
lot, both about what works in large software engineering projects and how I
personally like my computer systems. I am very conscious of how I spend the
little spare time that I have these days.</p>

<p>The following sections each deal with what I consider a major pain point, in no
particular order. Some of them influence each other—for example, if changes
worked better, we could have a chance at transitioning packages to be more
easily machine readable.</p>

<h3 id="change-process-in-debian">Change process in Debian</h3>

<p>The last few years, my current team at work conducted various smaller and larger
refactorings across the entire code base (touching thousands of projects), so we
have learnt a lot of valuable lessons about how to effectively do these
changes. It irks me that Debian works almost the opposite way in every regard. I
appreciate that every organization is different, but I think a lot of my points
do actually apply to Debian.</p>

<p>In Debian, packages are nudged in the right direction by a document called the
<a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/">Debian Policy</a>, or its programmatic
embodiment, lintian.</p>

<p>While it is great to have a lint tool (for quick, local/offline feedback), it is
even better to not require a lint tool at all. The team conducting the change
(e.g. the C++ team introduces a new hardening flag for all packages) should be
able to do their work transparent to me.</p>

<p>Instead, currently, all packages become lint-unclean, all maintainers need to
read up on what the new thing is, how it might break, whether/how it affects
them, manually run some tests, and finally decide to opt in. This causes a lot
of overhead and manually executed mechanical changes across packages.</p>

<p>Notably, the <strong>cost of each change</strong> is distributed onto the package maintainers in
the Debian model. At work, we have found that the opposite works better: if the
team behind the change is put in power to do the change for as many users as
possible, they can be significantly more efficient at it, which reduces the
total cost and time a lot. Of course, exceptions (e.g. a large project abusing a
language feature) should still be taken care of by the respective owners, but
the important bit is that the default should be the other way around.</p>

<p>Debian is <strong>lacking tooling for large changes</strong>: it is hard to programmatically
deal with packages and repositories (see the section below). The closest to
“sending out a change for review” is to open a bug report with an attached
patch. I thought the workflow for accepting a change from a bug report was too
complicated and started <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2016-07-17-mergebot/">mergebot</a>, but only Guido
ever signaled interest in the project.</p>

<p>Culturally, reviews and reactions are slow. There are no deadlines. I literally
sometimes get emails notifying me that a patch I sent out a few years ago (!!)
is now merged. This turns projects from a small number of weeks into many years,
which is a huge demotivator for me.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, you can see artifacts of the slow online activity manifest
itself in the offline culture as well: I don’t want to be discussing systemd’s
merits 10 years after I first heard about it.</p>

<p>Lastly, changes can easily be slowed down significantly by holdouts who refuse
to collaborate. My canonical example for this is rsync, whose maintainer refused
my patches to make the package use debhelper purely out of personal preference.</p>

<p>Granting so much personal freedom to individual maintainers prevents us as a
project from raising the abstraction level for building Debian packages, which
in turn makes tooling harder.</p>

<p>How would things look like in a better world?</p>

<ol>
<li>As a project, we should strive towards more unification. Uniformity still
does not rule out experimentation, it just changes the trade-off from easier
experimentation and harder automation to harder experimentation and easier
automation.</li>
<li>Our culture needs to shift from “this package is my domain, how dare you
touch it” to a shared sense of ownership, where anyone in the project can
easily contribute (reviewed) changes without necessarily even involving
individual maintainers.</li>
</ol>

<p>To learn more about how successful large changes can look like, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrC6ROeV4GI">my
colleague Hyrum Wright’s talk “Large-Scale Changes at Google: Lessons Learned
From 5 Yrs of Mass Migrations”</a>.</p>

<h3 id="fragmented-workflow-and-infrastructure">Fragmented workflow and infrastructure</h3>

<p>Debian generally seems to prefer decentralized approaches over centralized
ones. For example, individual packages are maintained in separate repositories
(as opposed to in one repository), each repository can use any SCM (git and svn
are common ones) or no SCM at all, and each repository can be hosted on a
different site. Of course, what you do in such a repository also varies subtly
from team to team, and even within teams.</p>

<p>In practice, non-standard hosting options are used rarely enough to not justify
their cost, but frequently enough to be a huge pain when trying to automate
changes to packages. Instead of using GitLab’s API to create a merge request,
you have to design an entirely different, more complex system, which deals with
intermittently (or permanently!) unreachable repositories and abstracts away
differences in patch delivery (bug reports, merge requests, pull requests,
email, …).</p>

<p>Wildly diverging workflows is not just a temporary problem either. I
participated in long discussions about different git workflows during DebConf
13, and gather that there were similar discussions in the meantime.</p>

<p>Personally, I cannot keep enough details of the different workflows in my
head. Every time I touch a package that works differently than mine, it
frustrates me immensely to re-learn aspects of my day-to-day.</p>

<p>After noticing workflow fragmentation in the Go packaging team (which I
started), I tried fixing this with the <a href="https://go-team.pages.debian.net/workflow-changes.html">workflow changes
proposal</a>, but did not
succeed in implementing it. The lack of effective automation and slow pace of
changes in the surrounding tooling despite my willingness to contribute time and
energy killed any motivation I had.</p>

<h3 id="old-infrastructure-package-uploads">Old infrastructure: package uploads</h3>

<p>When you want to make a package available in Debian, you upload GPG-signed files
via anonymous FTP. There are several batch jobs (the queue daemon, <code>unchecked</code>,
<code>dinstall</code>, possibly others) which run on fixed schedules (e.g. <code>dinstall</code> runs
at 01:52 UTC, 07:52 UTC, 13:52 UTC and 19:52 UTC).</p>

<p>Depending on timing, I estimated that you might wait for over 7 hours (!!)
before your package is actually installable.</p>

<p>What’s worse for me is that feedback to your upload is asynchronous. I like to
do one thing, be done with it, move to the next thing. The current setup
requires a many-minute wait and costly task switch for no good technical
reason. You might think a few minutes aren’t a big deal, but when all the time I
can spend on Debian per day is measured in minutes, this makes a huge difference
in perceived productivity and fun.</p>

<p>The last communication I can find about speeding up this process is <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2008/12/msg00014.html">ganneff’s
post</a> from 2008.</p>

<p>How would things look like in a better world?</p>

<ol>
<li>Anonymous FTP would be replaced by a web service which ingests my package and
returns an authoritative accept or reject decision in its response.</li>
<li>For accepted packages, there would be a status page displaying the build
status and when the package will be available via the mirror network.</li>
<li>Packages should be available within a few minutes after the build completed.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="old-infrastructure-bug-tracker">Old infrastructure: bug tracker</h3>

<p>I dread interacting with the Debian bug
tracker. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbugs">debbugs</a> is a piece of software
(from 1994) which is only used by Debian and the GNU project these days.</p>

<p>Debbugs processes emails, which is to say it is asynchronous and cumbersome to
deal with. Despite running on the fastest machines we …</p></div></div>

                    <!-- Main content -->
                    <p>As I talked about in my post <a href="https://retrylife.ca/blog/2020/10/24/corepack-development">about Minecraft modpack development</a>, I got back in to playing Minecraft earlier this year. I primairly play on a server full of friends, where the server owner has <a href="https://github.com/webbukkit/dynmap">dynmap</a> installed. Dynmap is a handy tool that provides a near-real-time overview of the minecraft world in the form of a webapp. I always keep Dynmap open on my laptop so I can chat with whoever is online, and see whats being worked on.</p>

<p>While dynmap has a built-in chat log, and the ability to send chats, the incoming chat messages do not persist, and the outgoing chat messages don’t always show your in-game username (but instead, your public IP address). Since I always have an IRC client open, I figured that making use of my IRC client to generate a persistent chat log in the background would be a good solution. Unfortunately, I could not find anyone who has ever built a <code>Minecraft &lt;-&gt; IRC</code> bridge. Thus my project, <a href="https://github.com/Ewpratten/chatster">chatster</a>, was born.</p>

<p>The most basic IRC server consists of a TCP socket, and only 7 message handlers:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Message Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>NICK</code></td>
      <td>Handles a user setting their nickname</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>USER</code></td>
      <td>Handles a user setting their identity / username</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>PASS</code></td>
      <td>Handles a user authenticating with the server</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>PING</code></td>
      <td>A simple ping-pong system</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>JOIN</code></td>
      <td>Handles a user joining a channel</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>QUIT</code></td>
      <td>Handles a user leaving a channel</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>PRIVMSG</code></td>
      <td>Handles a user sending a message</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>On the Minecraft side, the following subset of the <a href="https://wiki.vg/Protocol">in-game protocol</a> must be implemented (I just used the <a href="https://github.com/ammaraskar/pyCraft"><code>pyCraft</code></a> library for this):</p>

<ul>
  <li>User authentication</li>
  <li>Receiving <a href="https://wiki.vg/Protocol#Chat_Message_.28clientbound.29"><code>clientbound.play.ChatMessage</code></a> packets</li>
  <li>Sending <a href="https://wiki.vg/Protocol#Chat_Message_.28serverbound.29"><code>serverbound.play.ChatMessage</code></a> packets</li>
</ul>

<p>The whole idea of chatster is that a user connects to the IRC server using their <a href="https://account.mojang.com/">Mojang account</a> email and password at their IRC nickname, and server password. The server temporarily stores these values in memory.</p>

<p>Connecting to a server is done via specific IRC channel names. If you wanted to connect to <code>mc.example.com</code> on port <code>12345</code>, you would issue the following IRC command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>/JOIN #mc.example.com:12345
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Upon channel join, the server opens a socket to the specified Minecraft server, and relays chat messages (along with their sender) to both Minecraft and IRC. This means that ingame users show up in your IRC user list, and you can send commands and chats to the game.</p>

<p>The positive response to my post about <a href="https://blog.ceos.io/2020/11/14/why-i-teach-vim/">“Why I Teach vim”</a> has been extremely appreciated and the most common question I have received is “OK, but <em>how </em>do you teach vim? This is a much more difficult question to answer in a blog post as I have repeatedly found trying to explain teaching methods in writing is difficult. With that said, sometimes perfect is the enemy of good enough and let me see if I can take a shot at it. </p>



<p>I will even complicate things further and try to simultaneously teach teachers to teach vim as well as perhaps help a few programmers who want to take vim for a spin (maybe even who have been previously frustrated by it).</p>



<div><p>I must begin with a bit of <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/08/05/where-vim-came-from.html">historical context</a>. vi (the father of vim) was <a href="http://www.linfo.org/vi/history.html">invented</a> in 1976 by Bill Joy at the University of California, Berkeley. The potential user of vim needs to be aware that in 1976 many people used not monitors but printers to interact with a computer. As such, the most common way to edit text was with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_editor">line editor</a> which, as you might guess by the name, edited text one line at a time. vi was different than a line editor, vi was a visual editor and, ultimately, the name vi came from VIsual.</p><p>By 1976, people (really companies) were starting to be able to afford more <a href="https://www.tpub.com/incs/6.htm">CRT terminals</a>, think your parent’s (or grandparent’s) old style TVs. There were no mice, except in prototype computers at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)">Xerox PARC</a>, and the programmer had only the keyboard to interact with their text editor. CRT terminals were a huge advantage for programmers used to line editors and literally reams of printer paper to do their work and it was time for a visual editor to take advantage of these wonderful CRT terminals allowing people to edit an entire screen of text at the same time!</p></div>



<div><p>Let me digress for a second on the assumption most 2020 humans make about using a text editor. Modern text editors (and word processors) are all, of course, visual, but are also called modeless. The computer figures out what you want to do by the way you interact. Start typing? The computer assumes you want to insert text. Click somewhere in the text? The computer assumes you want to move the location of insertion. Menus give you all sorts of commands and the computer knows by the nature of your mouse (or trackpad, if you prefer) actions and movements what you want to do and when you want to do it.</p><p>But Bill Joy’s computer did not have a mouse. His great insight was to recognize that the computer with visual interaction couldn’t automatically recognize all these modes (remember, no mouse) and rather had to be instructed through the keyboard as to which mode needs to be used at what time and thus the modal editor called vi (originally the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">visual part of the line editor ex</a>) was born.</p><p>It is important to note that as frustrating as modern modeless text editors find the modal aspect of vi, this was such a huge leap beyond line editors that people flocked to it with glee. Those interested in context, and I don’t do this with my students, should consider playing a bit with <a href="https://www.howtoforge.com/linux-ed-command/">ed</a> on their favorite Linux or UNIX system. Then imagine doing this with a line printer. You can even get somewhat of a feel for both line editing and a printer terminal on old school UNIX with this <a href="http://aiju.de/code/pdp11/">web based PDP-11 emulator</a>.</p><p>Please note this historical context is vitally important as students rarely think about how their modeless editors work and throwing them into a modal editor without knowing about modes is one of the primary reasons so many students find vim so impenetrable. All the commands in the world won’t help if you do not understand <em>why</em> there are modes. This is even more further compounded by the fact that switching modes is something that is almost entirely unseen when a teacher is using vim in front of students. As both an undergraduate and graduate student, I have had the experience of watching a teacher just start using vi or vim and explicitly or implicitly telling students to figure it out. This. Rarely. Works. In fact, as the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25097788">discussion on my original post</a> points out, this can be recipe for bias against students who lack outside resources. vim is not difficult, but it does have to be explicitly taught.</p><p>At this point, I will go into a bit of how I teach the mechanics of vim. I am assuming the student can ssh into a command line machine now (or open up a command prompt on their machine). I am also assuming they can change their password (passwd), make a directory (mkdir),  and change into that directory (cd). I then ask them to type:</p></div>



<pre><code>vi hello.txt</code></pre>



<p>vi is almost always mapped to vim. If you end up with vi, which is easy enough to tell because vi doesn’t do syntax coloring of your favorite programming language and vim does, you may need to install vim on your particular system. Happily, if you only have vi, besides the color syntax, this guide will work just fine. Certainly consider reading more about the <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/08/05/where-vim-came-from.html">history of vi and vim</a>, if you are interested.</p>



<p>At this point, <em>you are in command mode</em>.</p>

<p>And here is where we get into the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/25x8bm/finally_found_a_vim_joke/">running joke</a> about how impossible it is to exit vim. Students must understand they are in <em>command mode</em>. Absolutely nothing interesting (yet) can happen in command mode, so we have to give it a command. The first command we will learn is i. Yes, just the letter i. This puts us in <em>insert</em> <em>mode.</em></p>

<div><p>The obvious question is, of course, how do we now save it? This is a perfect time to remind students that vim is <em>modal</em> and that we are in insert mode right now. If we using a modeless text editor, we could click on maybe the file menu and choose save. What ever shall we do?</p><p>Why, switch modes, of course! To exit insert mode and reenter command mode we simply type the esc key (be careful, students will sometimes literally type e… s… c…). Notice that by pressing the esc key we lose the — INSERT — in the lower right hand corner and move back into command mode.</p></div>

We don’t need no stinkin’ menus! We typed esc for command mode!</figcaption></figure>



<p>At this point, I explain that in lieu of menus we use the : character (and not the ; character, English teachers all over the world will thank you for explaining that there is, indeed, a big difference and, for my young students, I always make a point of encouraging them to ask their English teacher what the difference is).</p>

<p>This now allows us to choose commands. I always start with the w command (for write file… s for save would have made life more easy for future people teaching vim, but s is used for <a href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_and_replace">substitute</a> – not covered in this guide). I then have students type w and then hit enter/return.</p>

<p>I then have them repeat the sequence esc, :, followed by q (to quit) and return/enter. Experienced vim users will point out the esc is unnecessary (we are already in command mode), but an extra esc here or there to reinforce this idea of command mode seems to be very helpful to students new to vim. Experienced vim users will also point out you can chain commands i.e. esc followed by :wq. I do share this later on, but prefer to associate each command with the equivalent menu selection for beginners. This ability to chain commands is one of most important reasons why people like vim, though, and is something I definitely cover in the long run. Who wants to do File-&gt;Save, File-&gt;Quit with the mouse when you can do esc, :wq return?!</p>



<p>At this point I teach the students the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cat-command-in-linux-with-examples/">cat</a> command and ask them to type to see the fruits of their labor:</p>



<pre><code>cat hello.txt</code></pre>



<p>Finally, to reinfornce everything we have done so far, I ask them to type:</p>



<pre><code>vi hello.txt</code></pre>



<p>and then change the Hello, World! text to something of their own creation by first going into insert mode (i) and then saving (writing, if you prefer) it (esc, :w, return – remember that the esc moves you to command mode!), and then quitting (esc, :q, return). Students are then asked to cat their new hello.txt to be sure they saved what they wrote.</p>



<div><p>Repetition is the key to learning all this and I quickly follow up by giving them a C hello world program and asking them to vi hello.c and input it. <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a> will quickly tell them if they have made any typical mistakes!</p><p>More about why and how I teach C at a later date, but the key trick here is to give them a very text intensive first programming assignment. I often have students write a program that prints out their class schedule. The secret here is that the goal isn’t so much printf in C but rather practicing vim to the point of reasonable automaticity. </p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was doing some research at work for tracing and observability for microservices, when I came across <a href="https://pixielabs.ai/">Pixielabs</a>. This tool advertises that you can instantly troubleshoot applications without any instrumentation or special code inside the apps, which sounded ✨magical✨ to me. So naturally I wanted to know a little more about what enables this technology to work, and after scrolling through the site, under the “No Instrumentation” section was this acronym <strong>eBPF</strong>.</p><p>After some further digging on the internet, reading the <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">design papers</a> and watching several videos, it was safe to say this technology caught my attention, so I wanted to write some notes on it and I hope this post will spark some further interest in you as well.</p><h2 id="so-what-is-ebpf-exactly">So what is eBPF exactly?</h2><p>The TL;DR version is that this technology enables sandboxed user space applications to run in the Linux kernel itself. In a way it makes the kernel <em>programmable</em> which unlocks tremendous possibilities.</p><p>You can pick <strong>any function</strong> from the kernel and execute the program every time that function runs. Running a program that “attaches” to network sockets, tracepoints and perf events can be extremely useful. Developers can debug the kernel without having to re-compile it. There are plenty of use cases such as:</p><ul><li>Application performance &amp; troubleshooting</li><li>Networking &amp; security</li><li>Runtime security</li><li>Application tracing</li><li>Observability</li></ul><p>That’s what enables tools like Pixie to do blackbox analysis, without requiring any tinkering inside the applications that we’re trying to debug.</p><p>Originally BPF was <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">designed</a> for capturing and filtering network packets that matched specific rules, discarding any unwanted packets. That’s why it was called the “Berkeley Packet Filter”. If you’ve ever used <strong>tcpdump</strong> you’ve probably already used it. Nowadays eBPF can be used for many different things and not just packet filtering but the name stuck for some reason.</p><p>This architecture of network monitoring was vastly superior to the current existing packet capture technologies in terms of performance, mainly because the filtering was done in the kernel instead of copying all of the packets in user space and doing
the calculations there. But with the advancement of processors it didn’t hold up so well with it’s initial design. That’s why the <strong>extended BPF</strong> (eBPF) design was introduced, to take advantage of the modern processing power.</p><p>Initially eBPF was to be also used as a network packet filtering solution, but the ability to run user-space programs inside the kernel proved to be very powerful. The new design extended what the BPF virtual machine could do, which was to allow it to run on all kinds of events, not just packets, and also do certain actions instead of just the ability to filter things.</p><h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2><p>An eBPF program is just a sequence of 64-bit instructions. The virtual machine’s instruction set is fairly limited and it has two goals in mind:</p><ol><li>The code needs to be executed as fast as possible.</li><li>All BPF instructions must be verifiable at load time to ensure the safety of the kernel.</li></ol><p>Okay so, eBPF code is run in a safe virtual machine inside the kernel. Writing these programs is done with the help of some frameworks (like <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">bcc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace">bpftrace</a>) and the program bytecode is then loaded via the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><code>bpf</code></a> system call.</p><p>To nullify the security and stability risks when running a user space program inside the kernel, several checks are performed
to ensure that the code we run is safe and that it terminates so our computer won’t freeze up.</p><p>Firstly, to even be able to run a user program which loads eBPF code, it needs root privileges to do so, unless unprivileged eBPF is enabled, in which case the process can load a program with a reduced functionality. Secondly, there’s the eBPF verifier which all eBPF programs must go through before they can be executed.</p><p>The verifier runs several checks on the code that safeguards the kernel. The first check ensures that any unbounded
loops which could freeze up the kernel are prohibited. The second check, which is more extensive, simulates the execution of the code making sure that all paths of the code run to completion, no out of bounds memory is accessed and overall the state of the virtual machine is valid.</p><p>The last step of the verification process involves restricting the eBPF program abilities, which kernel functions are callable and which data it can access. The verifier knows how to apply those restrictions because of the <strong>program type</strong>. The program type is determined when we associate the program with a certain event.</p><p>After the verification process is done, the BPF bytecode is then interpreted, or compiled by a JIT compiler, into native instructions that run efficiently whenever an event happens in the kernel.</p><h2 id="kprobes--uprobes">kprobes &amp; uprobes</h2><p>We can create and insert kernel probes or kprobes for short to virtually any function in the kernel, and attach an eBPF program so that it executes each time that function is invoked.</p><p>Here’s a simple hello world example from the <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/examples">bcc</a> repository:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> bcc <span>import</span> BPF

</code></pre></div><p>The eBPF program is written in a pseudo-C code and it’s placed in the variable <code>prog</code> as a string. The bcc framework does all the heavy lifting of generating the bytecode, loading the programs and all that stuff, which makes writing these programs a bit easier.</p><p>In this example, the hello function invokes a bpf helper function called <code>bpf_trace_printk</code> which outputs a “Hello, World!” trace. Then we load the program and we attach a kernel probe for the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><code>clone</code></a> event, basically saying that we want to call the <code>hello</code> program each time <code>clone</code> is called.</p><p>After that the script waits for new traces to arrive, fetches the fields and prints the values to the screen.</p><p>Let’s try running it:</p><pre><code>$ sudo python3 hello-ebpf.py
TIME(s)            COMM             PID    MESSAGE
</code></pre><p>The script has successfully loaded the program and now we wait for the traces to arrive. The next thing to do is to try and invoke the <code>clone</code> syscall. We can run any command on the terminal, such as <code>ls</code> and a child process will be created. Since I had firefox running, it created some child processes in the meantime and traces started to show up:</p><pre><code>611.247475000      firefox          5378   Hello, World!
</code></pre><p>As we can see, the message “Hello, World!” is printed on the screen along with the other trace fields. Super cool!</p><p>Besides attaching to kernel functions, we could also observe functions invoked in user space, such as <strong>malloc</strong> or <strong>strlen</strong>. This is possible via another Linux kernel feature - <strong>uprobes</strong>.</p><p>Here’s an interesting script that counts frequencies of strings by tracing strlen() and using a hash map to store the strings along with the count of their recurrence: <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/examples/tracing/strlen_count.py">https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/examples/tracing/strlen_count.py</a></p><h2 id="helper-functions">helper functions</h2><p>Since arbitrary kernel functions are prohibited to be called by ebpf programs, there are several helper functions which the kernel provides for us, such as the <code>bpf_trace_printk</code> function. We can use them to:</p><ul><li>Get the current time</li><li>Interact with eBPF maps</li><li>Manipulate network packets</li><li>Print debugging messages</li></ul><p>Note that each program can only use a subset of these helpers because of the different contexts the programs can run in. Here’s the extensive <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bpf-helpers.7.html">list</a> of bpf helpers.</p><h2 id="map-storage">map storage</h2><p>To write more complicated programs you’ll need some type of data store, and that is where <strong>maps</strong> come in. They are an important part of the BPF internal system, which allows programs to store information that can be accessed from userspace.</p><p>BPF supports different <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#maps">types</a> of data stores - you can use a hash map, an array, or even a stack or a queue, depending on the use case of course.</p><h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2><p>eBPF opens up all kinds of possibilities for observability.

<p>
I don’t usually talk about money, but a friend asked me what it was like to get rich, and he wanted to know specifics, so I told him my story.
</p><p>
I had <a href="https://sive.rs/xn">a day job</a> in midtown Manhattan paying $20K per year — about minimum wage.
On weekends I would earn $150 per day performing circus shows for kids, though I’d spend about $50 in bus fare to get to the gigs.
I was sharing a three-bedroom apartment with two other roommates in Queens, so our rent was $333 per month each.
I made peanut butter sandwiches for three meals a day, and at night maybe some eggs.
I never ate out, and never took a taxi.
<strong>
My cost of living was about $1000/month, and I was earning $1800/month.
I did this for two years, and saved up $12,000.
</strong>
I was 22 years old.
</p><p>
Once I had $12,000 I could quit my job and become a full-time musician.
I knew I could get a few gigs per month to pay my cost of living.
So I was free.
<a href="https://sive.rs/nq">I quit my job</a> a month later, and never had a job again.
</p><p>
When I finished telling my friend this story, he asked for more.
I said no, that was it.
He said, “No, what about when you sold your company?”
</p><p>
I said no, that didn’t make a big difference in my life.
That was just more money in the bank.
The difference happened when I was 22.
</p><p>
It’s not how much you have.
<strong>
It’s the difference between what you have and what you spend.
</strong>
If you have more than you spend, you’re rich.
If you spend more than you have, you’re not.
If you live cheaply, it’s easy to be free.
</p><p>
Magicians wave one hand around to get your attention, while the other hand does the trick.
To be smart, watch the other hand.

November 21, 2020 | https://blog.tawhidhannan.co.uk/meta/pagination-in-zola/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.tawhidhannan.co.uk/meta/pagination-in-zola/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I've been experimenting with Zola, a static site generator. The documentation for pagination is pretty good from an anatomical perspective, but I thought there was room for something a little more 'recipe' like. So, this is how I personally implemented pagination on my Zola site, aiming to demonstrate the nuts and bolts in action. This demonstration will be correct for zola binaries compatible with 0.12.0.</p>
<h2 id="the-goal">The Goal<a href="#the-goal" aria-label="Anchor Link For: the-goal">
    
</a></h2>
<p>Imagine a homepage, much like the one <a href="https://blog.tawhidhannan.co.uk/">for this site</a>. Let's assume there's 15 posts, sorted by most recent posts first, but we don't want to overwhelm the user or have them scroll forever, so we'd like to display a maximum of five posts at once. We need to be able to click on the posts themselves to get to the articles, but also we want to make it possible to see beyond the most recent five posts.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-the-index-page">Configuring the index page<a href="#configuring-the-index-page" aria-label="Anchor Link For: configuring-the-index-page">
    
</a></h2>
<p>These index pages are configured by markdown frontmatter. So at the root of your content directory, you'll want a file, <code>_index.md</code>, who's sole purpose is to configure how to render a particular section. Now by creating this file at the root of the entire content directory, the 'section' is essentially all of the content in the site - perfect for a homepage.</p>
<p>The frontmatter of this markdown page, is a set of attributes that must come at the start of every markdown file that Zola renders. These attributes are specified between two rows of three <code>+</code> characters, which Zola uses as the bookends for the frontmatter.</p>
<pre><code><span>+++
(ATTRIBUTES GO HERE)
+++
</span></code></pre>
<p>One attribute available to use is the <code>paginate_by</code> attribute, enabling us to specify how many posts per page should be rendered. In accordance with the goals set, we can make that 5.</p>
<pre><code><span>+++
paginate_by = 5
+++
</span></code></pre>
<p>To ensure the pages are sorted by date, we can also specify how to sort these pages. Let's do that.</p>
<pre><code><span>+++
sort_by = date
paginate_by = 5
+++
</span></code></pre>
<p>According to the documentation, the semantics of specifying the <code>sort_by</code> attribute to <code>date</code> are <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/section/#date">as follows</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This will sort all pages by their date field, from the most recent (at the top of the list) to the oldest (at the bottom of the list). Each page will get page.earlier and page.later variables that contain the pages with earlier and later dates, respectively.</p>

<p>At this point, all the configuration is in place to leverage pagination. However, before pagination actually works, we need to render this list of posts in a template. Now, we can specify the template in the frontmatter, but by default, for the root <code>_index.md</code> file, this will resolve to the root <code>index.html</code> file.</p>
<h2 id="rendering">Rendering<a href="#rendering" aria-label="Anchor Link For: rendering">
    
</a></h2>
<p>As a foundation, we'll build up the following template.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that this is an incredibly simplified template, with the goal of illustrating pagination. Your template probably will look different.</p>
<p>Zola makes certain variables available to each html template file. The variables we're concerned with are <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/templates/pagination/">variables within the <code>paginator</code> namespace</a>. Now, the paginator namespace isn't guaranteed to be available to the template - if the <code>_index.md</code> file the template is rendering doesn't have any pagination settings enabled, the namespace won't exist.</p>
<h3 id="safety-measures">Safety measures<a href="#safety-measures" aria-label="Anchor Link For: safety-measures">
    
</a></h3>
<p>As a precautionary measure, we can check if it exists before trying to do anything with it. In Zola, we can run any templating logic between curly braces with percentage symbols inside, like so:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
      {% if paginator %}
      {% endif %}
    &lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><h3 id="listing-pages">Listing Pages<a href="#listing-pages" aria-label="Anchor Link For: listing-pages">
    
</a></h3>
<p>We can now write any and all logic related to pagination between these two added lines, and safely interact with the paginator namespace. There exists a variable on the paginator, <code>pages</code>, which corresponds to an array of pages. We can list these pages out 'iterator' style - let's just list out some basic links with the corresponding dates. It should look like the code below:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
      {% if paginator %}
      &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% for post in paginator.pages %}
        &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;{{post.date}}&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ post.permalink }}"</span><span>&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
        &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% endfor %}
      &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
      {% endif %}
    &lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>At this point, the homepage renders up to 5 posts at once, with the most recent posts first. Great start, but we need to enable users to get to the older pages should they so desire - this is the actual pagination part!</p>

<p>The <code>paginator</code> namespace exposes pretty much all the variables we need for this. It would be good to display the current page, and some links to the next and previous pages if there are any. If there aren't, we can either leave off the buttons entirely or go with disabling them - I'm going to render disabled buttons. To achieve all this, we're going to need three variables from the <code>paginator</code> namespace - <code>previous</code>, <code>next</code> and <code>current_index</code>.</p>
<p>Let's get these done in order.</p>
<h4 id="previous-page">Previous Page<a href="#previous-page" aria-label="Anchor Link For: previous-page">
    
</a></h4>
<p>The <code>paginator.previous</code> variable corresponds to a link to the previous page, if such a page exists - so we'll check if it exists, and if it exists, render a link to the page with the text 'previous', and if it doesn't exist, display a disabled version of the same link. For the disabled version, instead of linking to the page,</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
      {% if paginator %}
      &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% for post in paginator.pages %}
        &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;{{post.date}}&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ post.permalink }}"</span><span>&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
        &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% endfor %}
      &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
      {% endif %}
      {% if paginator.previous %}
        &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ paginator.previous }}"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;lt;</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
      {% else %}
        </span><span>&amp;lt;
</span><span>      {% endif %}
    &lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><h4 id="current-page">Current Page<a href="#current-page" aria-label="Anchor Link For: current-page">
    
</a></h4>
<p>This is pretty easy - we pretty much just render <code>paginator.current_index</code> into the page.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
      {% if paginator %}
      &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% for post in paginator.pages %}
        &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;{{post.date}}&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ post.permalink }}"</span><span>&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
        &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% endfor %}
      &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
      {% endif %}
      {% if paginator.previous %}
        &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ paginator.previous }}"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;lt;</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
      {% else %}
        </span><span>&amp;lt;
</span><span>      {% endif %}
      &lt;</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;{{ paginator.current_index }}&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><h4 id="next-page">Next Page<a href="#next-page" aria-label="Anchor Link For: next-page">
    
</a></h4>
<p>Here, we can pretty much do what we did with the 'previous' page example.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
      {% if paginator %}
      &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% for post in paginator.pages %}
        &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;{{post.date}}&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ post.permalink }}"</span><span>&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
        &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% endfor %}
      &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
      {% endif %}
      {% if paginator.previous %}
        &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ paginator.previous }}"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;lt;</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
      {% else %}
        </span><span>&amp;lt;
</span><span>      {% endif %}
      &lt;</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;{{ paginator.current_index }}&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;
      {% if paginator.next %}
        &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ paginator.next }}"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;gt;</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
      {% else %}
        </span><span>&amp;gt;
</span><span>      {% endif %}
    &lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><h2 id="calling-it">Calling It<a href="#calling-it" aria-label="Anchor Link For: calling-it">
    
</a></h2>
<p>This is a minimal implementation for a homepage that renders up to five pages, and allows clicking through to view other pages, using Zola. This should be sufficient as a starting point for expanding on, customising and styling. I'm looking to move this blog to something Zola flavored, and I'll talk about why in the future - suffice to say, I'm pleased with how easy pagination is to roll out.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you run any kind of moderately successful website, it's not long before these types of emails
start showing up in your inbox:</p><p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/blog/link-building/toptal-email.jpg" alt="Link building email"></p><p>You might wonder to yourself, "Why is someone who works at Toptal suggesting that I link to a random article from one of my blog posts?"</p><p>The answer is that this person is doing something called <strong>link building</strong>.</p><p>When it comes to SEO, having external links pointing to your website or article can help you rank higher
in Google. In a big way.</p><p>In this example, Toptal is trying to rank an article about PHP hiring. And the reason they asked me to include
a link to that in that specific article isn't because they actually think it's a great post.</p><p>It's because my article about being a junior developer has a bunch of external links to it. These are called "backlinks".</p><p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/blog/link-building/tech-blog-best-pages-by-links.jpg" alt="My tech blog's top pages by links"></p><p>Whether you're an indie hacker trying to get organic traffic to your SaaS, info product, or service, or
a developer trying to get visitors or freelance clients on your tech blog, this article will put you on the
path to do just that.</p><p>You are about to learn <strong>how to build these coveted backlinks to your blog or website</strong>,
why they are so important for SEO, how to figure out which websites and pages
offer links that actually help you rank, and 17 <em>specific</em> strategies for
building them that work.</p><p>Most importantly, you'll be able to do all this without suggesting irrelevant resources
or creating more spam in bloggers' inboxes (sorry, Toptal).</p><h2>Why backlinks are so important for SEO</h2><p>Backlinks are important for SEO because Google treats links from external websites like an "upvote" for the quality of the content.</p><p>The more authoritative a website is (in large part, how many backlinks it has and from whom), the more "votes" it bestows upon
the websites that it links to.</p><p>This is a bit of an oversimplification, but let's take a look at a concrete example.</p><p>Think about how many articles have been written on the topic of "ReactJS Tutorial". </p><p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/blog/link-building/reactjs-tutorial-query-results.jpg" alt="ReactJS tutorial search results analysis"></p><p>Google has over 7 million articles indexed on the topic.</p><p>How does it decide which articles are worthy of being on the first page of the search results, much less
which deserves to be number one?</p><p>Backlinks are part of the answer.</p><h2>How Google chooses which articles to rank (as far as we know)</h2><p>Google uses <a href="https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors" target="_blank">over 200 ranking factors</a> to
determine which article gets the top spot.</p><p>These include things like the presence of the keyword in the title
tag and H1 tag, site speed, freshness (how recently the content was published or updated), and many other factors.</p><p>But not all factors are equally weighted.</p><p>However, time and again we observe that backlinks (especially backlinks from different domains) strongly correlate with higher rankings in Google.
They may not be <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-links-not-most-important-google-ranking-factor-29868.html" target="_blank">the most important factor</a>, but they are important <!-- -->—<!-- --> and the data shows that.</p><p>One <a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank">study</a> of 11.8 million search results found this:</p><p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/blog/link-building/backlink-position-correlation.png" alt="Backlink position correlation graph"></p><blockquote><p>Pages with lots of backlinks rank above pages that don’t have as many backlinks. In fact, the #1 result in Google has an average of 3.8x more backlinks than positions #2-#10. (<a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Here are three reasons why links can be an effective way for Google to determine which article
among millions is the best:</p><ul><li><strong>They're hard to get.</strong> Quality backlinks from authoritative websites are difficult to obtain (meaning, difficult to manipulate). You can't just email the New York Times and ask for a link to your blog.</li><li><strong>They pass along useful context.</strong> If I run a website about web development, a backlink from CSS Tricks or Mozilla Developer Network reinforces to Google that my site is about web development.</li><li><strong>Natural links represent a human's opinion.</strong> If someone links to an article just because they find it handy, that represents to Google that it probably contains quality information.</li></ul><p>Let's look at the backlinks for the top-ranking articles for "ReactJS Tutorial":</p><p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/blog/link-building/reactjs-tutorial-backlinks.jpg" alt="Backlinks to articles ranking for ReactJS tutorial"></p><p>You can see that the #1 article is on the official ReactJS website and has over 9,000 backlinks from 2,000+ different domains.</p><p>This makes perfect sense: it's the official documentation, making it naturally the most relevant, authoritative, and linked-to
article about "reactjs tutorial".</p><p>But what about topics that don't have a clear entity behind them?</p><p>Let's look at the kinds of queries you might pop into Google on a regular basis: CSS properties.</p><p>Have you ever wondered why W3 Schools would <em>ever</em> show up above MDN when you google for these?</p><p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/blog/link-building/w3schools-vs-mdn.jpg" alt="W3 Schools vs MDN by backlinks"></p><p>Here's one possible explanation for you.</p><p>For fun, let's look at one last example: Toptal's article about PHP hiring.</p><p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/blog/link-building/hiring-php-developers-rankings.jpg" alt="Rankings for search term 'hiring php developers'"></p><p>They have clearly been building links to this page, and are able to rank higher than sites
like Indeed and Upwork for this search query.</p><p>Ignoring any on-site factors, it could be hard for the other sites to outrank
Toptal without building more links themselves for "hiring php developers".</p><p><strong>In effect: Backlinks have likely helped Toptal obtain their ranking for this query.</strong></p><p>You can also imagine that the people searching for "hiring php developers" are exactly
the type of people Toptal would like to convert into clients. It makes sense.</p><p>Notably, they don't rank #1 for relevant search terms with higher volume like "php developer",
but I'm sure they're working on it ;)</p><p>Now the question is <!-- -->—<!-- --> how can we boost <em>ourselves</em> to the top of the search results for terms
that will bring readers or clients to our website, at least in part through backlinks?</p><h2>The most important SEO tactic that most developers have never heard of before</h2><p>It's not adding a ton of obscure meta tags or making your website load faster (believe it or not, neither schema nor pagespeed appear to <a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank">correlate</a> with higher rankings).</p><p>It's <strong>link building</strong>. What is that exactly?</p><blockquote><p>Link building is the deliberate effort to gain external links to your website, usually
through content marketing, outreach, PR campaigns, and creating "link-worthy" articles, graphics, and tools.</p></blockquote><p>Toptal's email to me is an (unsuccessful) attempt at link building.</p><p>They wrote me an outreach email, asking me to edit one of my existing articles to include
a link to their website.</p><p>While the official word from Google is that you should just "create great content" and
links will come, most of us are in agreement <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/marketers-say-most-of-googles-public-statements-are-false-or-misleading/" target="_blank">that's not how it works</a> in the real world, especially for new websites.</p><p>It takes a concerted effort to get links.</p><p>I'll be honest: it's a lot of work.</p><p>But think about it like this: Imagine you could write an article and feel <em>pretty confident</em>
it would drive revenue for your indie product, clients for your freelancing business,
or bring you readers that will subscribe to your newsletter, follow you on Twitter, or even offer you a job...</p><p><strong>All without you paying for ads or relying on a massive social media following.</strong></p><p>That's why SEO in general, and link building in particular, is so powerful and important.</p><p>And while I'm the first to bemoan the fact that <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/the-dirty-secret-to-ranking-1-on-google-part-1-of-3/" target="_blank">Google is making our lives harder</a>  when it comes to visibility in search, it's still
one of the most cost-effective and scalable ways to drive traffic to a website.</p><p>And to do that, there are specific strategies you can use to get links from great websites.</p><p>Links that will, in turn, signal to Google that your content is excellent and worth showing
to searchers.</p><p>I'll get to those specific strategies shortly, but first it's important to give you
a few <strong>techniques for determining whether a backlink from a website will be valuable for you</strong>.</p><p>That way you don't waste your time chasing links that won't move the needle.</p><h2>Why all backlinks are not created equal</h2><p>Imagine that Google treated the internet like a democracy: every link from every website has one, equal vote.</p><p>If you wanted a bunch of links to your website, you could just go create a repo on GitHub with
a markdown file and "send backlinks" to each page on your website you want to rank.</p><p>You could create dozens or even hundreds of repos to boost your rankings.</p><p>Or, hundreds of Tumblr pages, Twitter profiles, blogspot websites, you get the idea.</p><p>That doesn't make sense, does it? We both know you could probably code a script to automate that in less than a day (which is basically what people did).</p><p>This is similar to how Google's original <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/pagerank/" target="_blank">PageRank algorithm</a> used to work.</p><p>Instead of just looking at the content of your website, it also looked at how
many external links pointed to the website or web page (and how many links
pointed to those web pages, and so forth).
How many, but not necessarily the quality of the referring website.</p><p><strong>What it meant is that it was easy to build links (and rank your website) through spam</strong>: spam comments on blogs,
on forums, low quality sites created as so-called "link farms".</p><p>That's why Google introduced measures to rank based on the <strong>quality of links</strong>, starting with
the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Penguin" target="_blank">Penguin Update</a> in 2012.</p><p>Today, if you want links that are likely to improve your website's rankings, you should look at
a few factors first.</p><h2>How to tell if a backlink is useful for your website (or a waste of your time)</h2><p>Since I told you that building links is a lot of work, I want to make sure you're spending your time
efficiently and getting the most out of your effort.</p><p>We're going to look at backlink strategies, but it's important that for each strategy you apply, you <strong>look at the specific
website</strong> you'd be earning the link from and evaluate it.</p><p>Here are some of the most important factors to consider when deciding to pursue a backlink opportunity.</p><p>Some confirmed by Google, some denied (but that <a href="https://twitter.com/randfish/status/1288982615110725632" target="_blank">doesn't necessarily mean</a> they aren't accurate). </p><ul><li><strong>Relevance</strong> <!-- -->—<!-- --> Is the website covering the same topic as yours? Again, a link from CSS Tricks to my article
about "CSS Grid" would probably be more valuable than a link from, say, a link from Webflow. But both are
more relevant than a link from, say, the Financial Times, even if the latter is highly reputable (of course, don't turn down a link from the FT either).</li><li><strong>Domain-level Authority</strong> <!-- -->—<!-- --> Does the website linking to you have a lot of backlinks themselves? And if so, what's the
quality of those backlinks? One useful metric for estimating this is <a href="https://ahrefs.com/website-authority-checker" target="_blank">Ahrefs Domain Rating (DR)</a> (bearing in mind, this is a third-party metric
not actually included in Google's algorithm).</li><li><strong>Page-level …</strong></li></ul></div></div>

<p>Ubiquiti’s UniFi product line consists of routers, switches, and WiFi access points.</p>
<p>These devices do not have any local management, instead relying on controller software<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> running locally or hosted remotely.</p>
<p>Devices discover their controller<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> through a combination of broadcast traffic on the local network, DHCP option 43, and trying to resolve the hostname <code>unifi</code>.
In the case of option 43 or resolution of the <code>unifi</code> hostname, the device will attempt to communicate with the controller by sending a HTTP POST request to <code>[ADDR]:8080/inform</code>.</p>
<p>This POST request contains a JSON payload<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and is repeated every 30 seconds. Controllers respond with a JSON payload containing configuration data, commands, or instructions to check in at a later time.</p>

<p>When sending JSON-encoded data to an API endpoint, one might expect to see a MIME type of <code>application/json</code> combined with HTTP over TLS. This is not the case.</p>
<p>Instead, the JSON payload is encrypted with AES in GCM or CBC mode depending on the combination of device and firmware version, wrapped with a bespoke binary protocol<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and transferred without benefit of TLS<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The encryption key used prior to adoption by a controller is the md5sum of <code>ubnt</code><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>During the adoption process, the controller generates a new key and sends it to the device as a inform response along with any other initial configuration data. Consequently, anyone observing network traffic during the adoption process can observe any future traffic between the device and controller.</p>
<p>Operators have been questioning<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Ubiquiti’s decision to not utilize TLS by default for several years. Eventually Ubiquiti removed<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> the ability for operators to force usage of TLS for inform traffic.</p>

<p>Network configuration data by itself can be considered sensitive but does not directly impact user privacy.
Unfortunately, inform traffic also contains data that can identify specific devices in place and time. With a UniFi router, it can associate browsing activity with a device’s mac and IP addresses.</p>
<h2 id="switches">Switches</h2>
<p>Switch tables contain MAC addresses of user devices and can be used to associate a user with a location.</p>
<p>See: <a href="https://jade.wtf/words/unifi-l3inform-crypto/inform-switch.json">example inform</a> from a USW-PRO-24 running firmware 4.0.64.10823.</p>
<h2 id="wifi-access-points">WiFi Access Points</h2>
<p>MAC addresses of users, data on neighboring WiFi AP signal strength provides sufficient information to geolocate the AP<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> using commonly available services.</p>
<p>See: <a href="https://jade.wtf/words/unifi-l3inform-crypto/inform-ap.json">example inform</a> from a UAP Flex HD running firmware 4.0.42.10433.</p>
<h2 id="routers-unifi-security-gateway">Routers (UniFi Security Gateway)</h2>
<p>Router inform contains DPI, DHCP, and ARP tables that can be used to associate a device with usage of specific applications such as Facebook and Spotify.</p>
<p>Exerpt showing DPI update for a host (<code>app</code> and <code>cat</code> correspond to application and category identifiers used in the controller dashboard):</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Reliance on symmetric encryption means that anyone that possesses the key can observe inform traffic. This traffic contains information that, if disclosed, could have an adverse effect on users of the network.</p>
<h2 id="surveillance-and-targeting">Surveillance and targeting</h2>
<p>An aid worker installs a UniFi switch in a refugee camp. They use a UniFi controller hosted in a cloud VM for remote monitoring and management.
It’s easy for an adversary to monitor<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> these internet connection. The adversary gathers end-user device MAC addresses<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> from the switch table data contained in the inform message. How parties to a conflict could use such data is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<h2 id="location-discovery-via-passive-observation-or-dns-hijacking">Location discovery via passive observation or DNS hijacking</h2>
<p>Someone acquires a UniFi WiFi access point (AP) and installs it on their home network. They didn’t realize that a controller was required and order a UniFi cloud key controller, but did not unplug the AP while waiting for the controller to arrive.</p>
<p>Their internet provider uses wildcard DNS monetization<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> to show ads on domain names that do not exist. This leads to the <code>unifi</code> hostname resolving to the monetization provider’s server. Because of privacy regulations the ISP is prohibited from giving detailed information (such as physical location) to the ad provider, so the ad provider is incentivized to find ways to geolocate clients to deliver more targeted ads.</p>
<p>The neighboring networks / interference avoidance data included in the AP’s inform message contains sufficient information to utilize WiFi-based geolocation to associate the IP address with a physical address.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the feasibility of information extraction, I built a tool to automate information extraction from Unifi inform packets: <a href="https://github.com/jda/pixiedust">pixiedust</a>.</p>
<p>In key extraction mode, pixiedust follows inform traffic and learns keys as devices are provisioned or reconfigured.</p>

<h2 id="short-term">Short-term</h2>
<p>Operators should ensure that traffic between UniFi devices and controllers is protected by a site-to-site VPN when traversing untrusted networks.</p>
<h2 id="long-term">Long-term</h2>
<p>Use TLS. Even self-signed certificates are better than the current state because you can log certificate IDs to detect MITM.</p>
<p>Inform messages should contain the minimum information necessary for adoption until after the device has been paired with a controller to prevent inadvertent disclosure of network configuration and personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>All UniFi devices to date are affected, except for the UniFi Dream Machine (UDM) product line (including UDM Pro).
The UDM series are not affected because they run a local instance of the controller software and cannot use a remotely hosted controller,
so there is no opportunity for an attacker to eavesdrop on UDM🡘controller communication.</p>

<h3 id="grayscale-image">Grayscale image</h3>
<p>A grayscale image where the image is represented as only the shades of grey. The intensity of the various pixels of the image is denoted using the values from 0 to 255. i.e., from black to white in terms of an 8-bit integer. It uses only one channel.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605961674942/27LWVNKGa7.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="grayscale.png"></p>
<h3 id="colour-image">Colour image</h3>
<p>Coloured images are constructed by combining red, green and blue (RGB) colours in variable proportions. These 3 colours and hence they are called the primary colours. The colour image pixels contain three channels: The R channel, G channel and the B channel, each having its own intensity values ranging from 0 to 255.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-convolution">What is a convolution</h3>
<p>Convolution is the process of multiplying each pixel with the corresponding pixel value of the filter and then adding all of the products to get the result. These combinations of result give the output image representation.</p>
<p>Now let us look at an example of convolution.</p>
<p>We pass a 6x6 input through a filter (Here we are using a vertical filter). We get a 4x4 output.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605962078416/cZYoBa6Y8.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="convolution total operation.png"></p>
<p>Now let us look at how each of the entries in the output is obtained.</p>
<p>We place the filter on top of the input starting from the top left corner till we reach the bottom right corner. Then we perform the process of convolution (multiply the corresponding entries and add them together). The obtained result is the corresponding output entry. Here we take stride value as 1. That is we jump 1 step to the right after each calculation. When we reach the column end, we jump 1 row below. This process goes on till we reach the bottom right corner.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Sensitive files can be secured using different methods. It is important to understand the pros and cons of each in order to pick the best tool for your needs.</p>

<p>Most archival software has the capability to add a pass phrase for archive protection. Different tools use different encryption algorithms. It is important to also look for authenticated encryption or AEAD. It provides extra integrity verification that ensures the archive hasn’t been tampered with. Some of the tools that support archival encryption are:</p>
<ul>
<li>7-zip</li>
<li>WinZip</li>
<li>WinRaR</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Widely available</li>
<li>Difficult to manage pass phrases for many different archives</li>
<li>Most archival software doesn’t support authenticated encryption</li>
<li>Can be slow to add new files to an existing large archive</li>
</ul>

<p>Basic encryption tools don’t provide archival capabilities. Their main purpose is to encrypt a file. Each file is encrypted with its own pass phrase or your public key. There is support for file compression. Some of them are cross-platform and run on most operating system.</p>
<ul>
<li>PGP</li>
<li>AxCrypt (not open source)</li>
<li>AES Crypt</li>
<li>openssl (for advanced users)</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.secure-monkey.com/the-future-of-file-utilities-encryption-hashing-and-compression-in-the-browser/">Open Source File Encryption Tools in the Browser</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to install and use</li>
<li>Difficult to manage different pass phrases for each file</li>
<li>PGP is complex and requires careful understanding of its configuration</li>
<li>Some of the tools in this category don’t support authenticated encryption</li>
</ul>

<p>Some applications provide their own file protection as part of their interface. The protection mechanisms vary between different applications. In the past various applications were having issues protecting files. For example the encryption of Word documents before Office 2003&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_password_protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noreferrer">was insecure</a>. Examples of application specific encryption:</p>
<ul>
<li>Password protected Word, Excel, PowerPoint files</li>
<li>Password protected PDFs</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>These applications already support encryption so it is convenient to use it out of the box</li>
<li>It is hard to manage passwords for different files</li>
<li>Some applications provide very weak security by using old and vulnerable algorithms
<ul>
<li><strong>NOTE:</strong> The encryption of Word documents before Office 2003 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_password_protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noreferrer">is insecure</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There can be version mismatch where a file is encrypted with different version of the software and can’t be opened</li>
</ul>

<p>Encrypted volumes are much easier to work with. The volume is just a flat file on your disk so you can move it anywhere. When mounted the volume appears as a regular drive on your operating system. You can add/delete/edit files with ease. The user needs a single pass phrase to mount the volume and this applies to all added files. Volumes can be mounted and umounted at any time.</p>
<ul>
<li>VeraCrypt</li>
<li>TrueCrypt (deprecated)</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a single password to open the volume can simplify working with many encrypted files</li>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Fixed size of each volume that can’t grow dynamically can be frustrating</li>
<li>Not optimized for cloud storage – if a single file changes then the whole contents of the volume needs to be synced to the cloud</li>
</ul>

<p>Full Drive Encryption is great for preventing a stolen drive or laptop from being accessed without the passphrase. It depends what drive is encrypted. If it is the boot drive then as soon as the drive is booted into the operating system it is no longer protected as a logged-in user has complete access to all the files. The only way to protect your encrypted boot drive is to shutdown your computer. If a partition is encrypted then once it is “mounted” it appears as a drive on your OS. Most modern operating systems already have support for FDE and it is fairly simple to turn on. It does add a pace of mind that your data is protected if you lose your laptop. Some tools allow for hidden partitions that can add additional security to your files.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bit Locker (Windows)</li>
<li>Veracrypt (Cross-Platform)</li>
<li>File Vault (Mac OS X)</li>
<li>dm-crypt (Linux)</li>
<li>PGP Full Disk Encryption</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Doesn’t protect files that are copied out of the encrypted disk</li>
<li>Doesn’t protect files on mounted volumes for the logged-in user</li>
<li>Not applicable to cloud storage as it only works on the physical disk or partition</li>
</ul>

<p>Encryption tools that are optimized for the cloud provide many additional benefits over the previously discussed tools. First, they are optimized for synchronization to cloud storage. Only the changed parts of the encrypted files are uploaded to the cloud. Second, they are using modern security algorithms such as authenticated encryption and public key cryptography. They allow managing and sharing encrypted files with ease. They work with different cloud storage providers so you’re not locked into one of them. They also provide local file protection.</p>
<ul>
<li>SecureMyFiles – <a href="http://www.secure-monkey.com/">www.secure-monkey.com</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>BoxCryptor</li>
<li>Cryptomator</li>
<li>GoCryptFs</li>
<li>KeybaseFS</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>State of the art encryption</li>
<li>Cloud integration</li>
<li>Efficient network synchronization</li>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Can support large files</li>
<li>Allow easy password management and file sharing using public key encryption</li>
<li>Protect local and cloud files</li>
</ul>

<p>Secure Cloud Providers can offer various encryption mechanisms. The best ones use client-side encryption that protects your files before they are uploaded to the cloud. But the files are not encrypted on the client computer but rather only when uploaded to the cloud provider. Once the files are on the cloud server they stays encrypted at rest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sync.com</li>
<li>pCloud</li>
<li>Tresorit</li>
<li>ShareFile</li>
<li>NextCloud</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide backup capabilities as well as encryption</li>
<li>Can be used to share files securely</li>
<li>Can be used to synchronize files across multiple devices</li>
<li>Requires a separate account</li>
<li>Doesn’t work with existing cloud providers such as Dropbox or Google Drive</li>
<li>Force you to purchase secure file storage from them</li>
<li>Don’t encrypt the files on the client computer</li>
</ul>

<p>Secure File Sharing can take the form of a secure cloud storage provider or as a specialized tool aimed directly at file sharing. Different tools provide different capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox Send (depricated)</li>
<li>Citrix ShareFile</li>
<li>Signal</li>
<li>Wire</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be used to easily and securely send files to other users</li>
<li>Some of them have size limitations</li>
<li>Additional complexity in managing users</li>
<li>Don’t provide encryption at rest</li>
</ul>

<p>Securing email is hard. It is an old protocol that doesn’t natively support encryption. The best way to secure your emails is to use an extra mail plugin that runs in Outlook or Thunderbird or use a secure email provider. Nowadays secure email providers provide much better user experience with many options to secure your messages.</p>
<ul>
<li>ProtonMail</li>
<li>PGP plugin for Outlook/Thunderbird</li>
<li>Hushmail</li>
<li>Mailfence</li>
<li>Tutanota</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/MIME" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noreferrer">S/MIME</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Popular mean for sharing files</li>
<li>Can encrypt the body and attachments of emails</li>
<li>The password for decrypting the file has to be communicated using another method (out of band)</li>
<li>The user needs to have the same tools in order to decrypt the message</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to realize that we have the ability to manufacture our own fate when we want to. We can… proceed when things look bad, or we can find plenty of reasons to quit if we don’t want to go forward.</p>
<p><br>– Eric Haney, Inside Delta Force</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This post was inspired by&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/3jS2BK6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Inside Delta Force</a>, written by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_L._Haney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eric Haney</a>.&nbsp;Detailed notes and quotes can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/inside-delta-force-haney/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Unattributed quotes below are from Haney’s writing.</em></p>
<p>After numerous terrorism incidents in the 1970s, the United States realized its armed forces had a blind spot when it came to counterterrorism. Green Beret <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Alvin_Beckwith" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Colonel Charlie Beckwith</a>, who had served alongside the British Army’s counter-terrorism unit the Special Air Service (also known as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SAS</a>“) in Malaysia, had been pushing for such a group since the 1960s. Now that the opportunity to be proactive had passed, the U.S. Army decided it was a good time to commission its own SAS-like force – namely, <a href="https://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/this-long-forgotten-unit-was-the-direct-predecessor-to-delta-force#:~:text=The%20US%20Army's%20highly%20secretive,American%20counterterrorist%20force%20in%20existence." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Delta Force</a>.</p>
<p>That brings us to Eric Haney. Haney had a successful start to his career, joining the army straight out of high school and progressing to platoon sergeant in the Army Rangers. In 1977, he was fretting that he would wind up as an instructor given his combat experience could be put to use training subsequent Ranger generations. After jumping out of an airplane as part of a drill, he stumbled into the opportunity to try out for one of the first Delta Force squadrons.</p>
<p>These tryouts are a continuous string of examples showcasing the often-said-not-often-followed truism that hard work and persistence are the bare minimum qualities required to achieve anything meaningful. There were run-of-the-mill running tests, an 18-mile hike with 40 pounds on your back, solo navigation drills across mountains and valleys ad nauseum, and it all culminated with a 40-mile mountain hike starting at 2am. And to top it all off, the testing officers were constantly encouraging the soldiers to quit along the way while never telling you how close to the finish line you were.</p>
<p>And what a beautiful metaphor for life that is. Your destination is never truly known, it requires unending effort to achieve things worth achieving and along the way you can easily find sources of negativity telling you to voluntarily remove yourself from the challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What was the lesson here? Simple. Don’t quit. Never quit no matter what. Keep going until someone tells you to sit down. Keep going as long as you’re able to move, no matter how poorly you think you may be doing. Just don’t quit.</p>

<p>– Eric Haney, Inside Delta Force</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, how did Haney do? He succeeded by focusing on the task at hand and ignoring the things around him that didn’t matter. Everytime he was close to quitting, he would push himself a little further, get his second wind and keep on trucking. He would “just keep [his] mouth shut, [his] eyes and ears open, and respond to whatever came up. It’s the system [he’d] always used in new situations, and so far it had served [him] well.”</p>
<p>Additionally, as he attacked what was in front of him he pushed away the temptation to look around and worry about comparing himself to other applicants. Some were faster. Some were stronger. Some seemed to mind the pain less than he did. But, to Haney, “the men in the other group weren’t my concern, and as for me, I’d know the destination when I got there.” And he got to the destination while many others did not.</p>
<p>And as you think through how impossible these challenges sound, you are are met with the realization of how quickly you would fail participating in the same. But then you have to be honest with yourself – you wouldn’t just fail, you would, in fact, die. You would get lost in the mountains. You would fall off a cliff. You would try to make the 40-miles and breakdown before you ever got to the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this highlights another useful truth – unending resolve is not enough to ensure success. You must also be competent. All the perseverance you can muster today won’t do anything for you if you haven’t lived a life up to today that has prepared you for the task at hand – <a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/habits-maketh-the-man-and-un-maketh-him-too/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who you are today is a lagging indicator of your</a><a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/habits-maketh-the-man-and-un-maketh-him-too/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> habits </a>.</p>
<p>This means that success can only come after persistent preparation. The 163 men selected for the tryouts had lived lives that prepared them to take the unique, once-in-a-lifetime Delta Force opportunity and try. Without preparation, they could not even hope to try.</p>
<p>This is not unique to the military – <a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/invert-always-invert-avoid-failure-to-succeed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie Munger</a> consistently shares the idea that there are only a few opportunities in life that define you. To take advantage of them, you prepare so that “step by step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/27/charlie-mungers-career-advice-for-young-people.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">But you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts</a>.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Step by step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. But you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts.</p>

<p>– Charlie Munger</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, even with preparation you will make mistakes. Haney did just that on the final 40-mile hike. He got lost. He went 7 miles off course in the wrong direction. And had to backtrack. And then keep going. He turned a 40-mile hike into more than a 50-mile hike, but he finished. After 18 hours of hiking, he made it to the finish line despite the setback.</p>
<p>This is another lesson – it is rare that failure is a permanent state. After failure, you have the option to keep going. You can treat failure as only a stop on your journey. You don’t have to let it be the destination. Many people treat getting knocked down as a reason to stay down. Like Haney, we don’t have to.</p>
<p>And it is important in life that you don’t define failure as failure to achieve only one specific goal. You can show up prepared and still not cross a specific finish line. 163 men participated in the Delta Force trials, but only 12 were ultimately accepted into the program. Those 151 men were not failures – not even close. They just had to accept that this Delta Force finish line wasn’t one they were going to cross and instead start progressing towards the next.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>This post was prompted by a tweet by Frank Harrell yesterday asking:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In this post I'll say a little bit about trying to answer Frank's question, and then a little bit about an alternative question which I posed in response, namely, how does the interpretation change if the interval is a Bayesian credible interval, rather than a frequentist confidence interval.</p>



<h2>Frequentist confidence intervals</h2>



<p>A frequentist 95% confidence interval is constructed such that if the model assumptions are correct, if you were to (hypothetically) repeat the experiment or sampling many many times, 95% of the intervals constructed would contain the true value of the parameter. I made a short video last year which performs a simulation in R to demonstrate this definition/idea:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="1125" height="633" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IGXg6L98lJM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>Frank asked how one interprets a particular realised confidence interval (0.72,0.91). The difficulty (as he is well aware!) is that all a frequentist can say is that this particular realised interval either does or does not contain the true parameter value, and they cannot tell you if it does or doesn't. All they can say is that if modelling assumptions are correct, in hypothetical repetitions 95% of the intervals constructed using this procedure contain the true value.</p>



<h2>Bayesian credible intervals</h2>



<p>Let’s now suppose that we’ve done a Bayesian analysis. We’ve specified a prior distribution for the parameter, based on prior evidence, our subjective beliefs about the value of the parameter, or perhaps we used a default ‘non-informative’ prior built into our software package. We use the same model as before, and Bayes theorem gives us the posterior distribution. A Bayesian posterior credible interval is constructed, and suppose it gives us some values. For the sake of simplicity, I’ll assume the interval is again 0.72 to 0.91, but this is not done to suggest a Bayesian analysis credible interval will generally be identical to the frequentist's confidence interval.</p>



<p>How should we interpret this credible interval? A Bayesian would I think say say something like it is an interval for which there is a 95% chance or probability the true parameter lies. At this point we must ask, what do they mean by 95% probability?</p>



<p>We could interpret it as a classical long run frequentist probability, but this means interpreting it like a confidence interval. In fact Bayesian procedures often have good frequentist properties. For example see <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/343/2013/03/large-sample.pdf" target="_blank">Wang and Robins 1998</a> for an analysis of the frequentist properties of multiple imputation for missing data, or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0962280216667764" target="_blank">Bartlett and Keogh 2018</a> for a simulation investigation of the frequentist properties of Bayesian approaches for handling covariate measurement error. In fact, under certain conditions, Bayesian procedures achieve the same frequentist properties of maximum likelihood methods when the sample size gets large - see Chapter 4 of Gelman <em>et al</em>'s excellent<a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Bayesian Data Analysis book</a>.</p>



<p>But conceptually we do not choose to do a Bayesian analysis simply as a means to performing frequentist inference. We choose it because it (hopefully) answers more directly what we are interested in (see Frank Harrell's '<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fharrell.com/post/journey/" target="_blank">My Journey From Frequentist to Bayesian Statistics</a>' post). Namely, it enables us to make probability statements about the unknown parameter given our model, the prior, and the data we have observed. So what is the interpretation of the 95% chance or probability for a credible interval? </p>



<p>I don't know the no doubt large literature on this topic well at all, but the Bayesian's interpretation or definition of probability isn't that clear to me. The Wikipedia entry on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability" target="_blank">Bayesian probability</a> says:</p>



<blockquote><p>Broadly speaking, there are two interpretations of Bayesian probability. For objectivists, who interpret probability as an extension of logic, probability quantifies the reasonable expectation that everyone (even a "robot") who shares the same knowledge should share in accordance with the rules of Bayesian statistics, which can be justified by Cox's theorem.[2][8] For subjectivists, probability corresponds to a personal belief.[3] Rationality and coherence allow for substantial variation within the constraints they pose; the constraints are justified by the Dutch book argument or by decision theory and de Finetti's theorem.[3] The objective and subjective variants of Bayesian probability differ mainly in their interpretation and construction of the prior probability.</p><cite>Wikipedia entry on Bayesian probability</cite></blockquote>



<p>Section 1.5 'Probability as a measure of uncertainty' of <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bayesian Data Analysis</a> talks about the way Bayesian analysis uses probability as a measure of uncertainty, but to my mind it doesn't really define the concept. This is not a criticism. As Gelman et al say earlier in their book:</p>



<blockquote><p>Rather than argue the foundations of statistics—see the bibliographic note at the end of this chapter for references to foundational debates—we prefer to concentrate on the pragmatic advantages of the Bayesian framework, whose flexibility and generality allow it to cope with complex problems.</p></blockquote>



<p>If part of the appeal of Bayesian inference is that it answers the question we really want (i.e. conditional on what we've seen, what do we know / believe about the parameter(s)), it seems to me that the interpretation or definition of prior/posterior probabilities should be relatively straightforward and clear to us. But for me at least, it isn't. I am quite confident (whatever I mean by that!) that this reflects my ignorance on the topic. Part of my motivation for writing this post is the hope that people will help me understand better how to unambiguously define what is meant by a Bayesian prior/posterior probability. Please write a comment if you can help in this regard.</p>



<p>The above does not mean I don't like Bayesian methods. Indeed much of the last 10 years I have been working with and using methods like multiple imputation for missing data whose development take place in the Bayesian paradigm. For me this is fine because I know that methods like multiple imputation have good frequentist properties, and while there are definitely interpretational issues with things confidence intervals, I at least think I understand what they claim to do/be.</p>



<h2>22nd November 2022 postscript</h2>



<p>This evening there was further discussion of this topic on Twitter. As part of this Frank Harrell offered an interpretation for the Bayesian credible interval as follows:</p>

<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Under data model F and prior P, [0.72, 0.91] is the shortest interval such that the probability the unknown OR generating our data is in that interval is 0.95 (highest posterior density interval).</p>— Frank Harrell (@f2harrell) <a href="https://twitter.com/f2harrell/status/1330633833713111040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>I followed up with him as to the nature of the probability being referred to here, since it is clear that the probability notion being invoked is broader or distinct than the relative frequency notion of probability. Frank helpfully pointed me in the direction of the entry for 'probability' in his course glossary of terms, which can be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf" target="_blank">accessed here</a>. Part of this entry says:</p>



<blockquote><p>The&nbsp;meaning&nbsp;attached to the metric known as a probability is up to the user; it can represent long-run relative frequency of repeatable observations, a degree of belief, or a measure of veracity or plausibility.</p><cite>https://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf</cite></blockquote>



<p>and</p>



<blockquote><p>There are other schools of probability that do not require the notion of replication at all. For example, the school of&nbsp;subjective&nbsp;probability (associated with the&nbsp;Bayesian&nbsp;school) “considers probability as a measure of the degree of belief of a given subject in the occurrence of an event or, more generally, in the veracity of a given assertion” (see P. 55 of5). de Finetti defined subjective probability in terms of wagers and odds in betting. A risk-neutral individual would be willing to wager $P&nbsp;that an event will occur when the payoff is $1 and her subjective probability is&nbsp;P&nbsp;for the event.</p><cite>https://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf</cite></blockquote>



<p>As I wrote in the original post, I do not know the extensive literature on this topic well at all. But what Frank has summarised here is really useful in aiding my understanding of what the interpretation should be of the 95% probability statement attached to a 95% credible interval. It seems to me the notion of probability being invoked when interpreting a 95% credible interval has to be the subjective probability / degree of belief one described in the previous quote. Whether this definition/interpretation meets the criterion of being 'exact', as required by Frank in his tweet at the top of this post when asking for the exact interpretation of a particular realised frequentist confidence interval, I leave readers to decide.</p>

	<h2><strong>Social Media = Public Square</strong></h2>
<p>Presenting ourselves to the world comes with inherent risk. With every piece of ourselves we share online, we risk compromising our personal privacy and security. We show our faces, share our feelings, and sometimes engage in difficult discussions. The beauty of social media is that the global community can, for the first time in history, engage in the same discussion all at once. The new connections we make and old ones we maintain through social media more often than not outweigh the risk.</p>
<p>Yet, scrutiny and periodic reevaluation of the platforms we use to share our lives is vital to maintaining an open and trusted medium of communication. If the last decade has taught us anything, it’s that social media platforms of yore are no longer providing a beneficial service that outweighs the immense damage they’ve caused to our privacy.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-tracy-le-blanc-607812.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-tracy-le-blanc-607812.jpg 1280w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-tracy-le-blanc-607812-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-tracy-le-blanc-607812-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-tracy-le-blanc-607812-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>The primary cause of the harm associated with social media is related to the centralized nature of current platforms. When a platform is centralized, it means all the content on said platform is controlled by a single party. Users of a centralized platform are subject to the actions taken by the single party controlling the platform. These centralized social media platforms generate revenue through the exploitative collection and sale of user data.</p>
<p>With a revenue model dependent on the sale of ads, centralized platforms are incentivized to maximize the value of the data sold by manipulating and censoring user content.</p>
<p>To illustrate the downsides of centralized social media platforms, I will focus on three of the biggest: Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.</p>
<h3>Data Collection</h3>
<p>Data collection is the engine that drives the revenue train for centralized platforms. Every user interaction is recorded and sold to target ads at very distinct groups of people.</p>
<p>Facebook’s privacy record leaves much to be desired. In my opinion, Facebook is no longer a social media platform and instead has become an efficient data mining operation. Facebook’s collection activities occur both inside and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/01/28/off-facebook-activity-page/">outside the application </a>itself. As recently as July 10th of this year, apps with Facebook integration through Facebook’s software development kit, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21319784/ios-apps-crashing-spotify-tiktok-pinterest-tinder-facebook-sdk-certification-issue">SDK</a>, were shut down due to bugs within the development kit.</p>
<p>Facebook’s SDK is a part of their data mining operations. Every time an app integrates Facebook’s SDK, it pings Facebook’s servers any time a user logs into that application through their <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/03/27/zoom-ios-update-removes-feature-that-sent-user-data-to-facebook">Facebook account</a>. Through this SDK, Facebook collects user data from apps with said SDK integration.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pexels-freestocksorg-744464.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pexels-freestocksorg-744464.jpg 1280w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pexels-freestocksorg-744464-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pexels-freestocksorg-744464-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pexels-freestocksorg-744464-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>With their major acquisitions of Instagram, WhatsApp, and more recently Giphy, Facebook’s native data collection net is wider than ever. The intrusive collection of user data has reached a point of negative return versus the social interactions made through their services. Facebook data collection policy is by no means unique. However, it presents the most poignant example of the lengths to which centralized social media platforms will go to harvest as much data as possible.</p>
<h3>Revenue Model</h3>
<p>The principal purpose centralized platforms like Facebook and Twitter collect user information is to sell that information to advertisers. Revenue generated by these sites is directly proportional to the correlation between data harvested and user engagement. The detrimental effects of a social media platform with an engagement driven revenue model can be seen clearly on Twitter and Facebook through the ads and content promoted by the platform, often through the use of algorithms. Twitter’s engagement algorithm has been accused of spurring <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/22/tech/twitter-algorithm-political-rhetoric/index.html">extreme political rhetoric</a> as recently as 2019.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-kaboompics-com-6335.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-kaboompics-com-6335.jpg 1280w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-kaboompics-com-6335-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-kaboompics-com-6335-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-kaboompics-com-6335-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>The most concerning aspect of Twitter’s algorithm is how easily it can be manipulated by bots. Bots are computer-run accounts that automatically generate content through links and standard phrases on Twitter. With a deluge of content generated by these bots, Twitter’s algorithm is often manipulated to promote content often categorized as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldurkheimer/2018/04/16/on-the-internet-bots-have-already-overrun-humans-what-do-they-want/#1e48831776f8">propaganda and fake news</a>.</p>
<p>Yet, for all of Twitter’s shortcomings, Facebook retains the title of most reckless, through its egregious, and often times dangerous, algorithmic content manipulation. Facebook’s algorithm has promoted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/opinion/facebook-cancer-ads.html?searchResultPosition=9">fake treatments </a>to cancer patients, has been accused of <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/04/03/facebook-ad-algorithm-race-gender/">discriminatory</a> ad delivery practices, and stoking <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-political-ad-system-designed-polarize/">political partisanship</a>. I’m sure almost everyone has a story about a creepily specific ad showing up on their timeline. Creepy is precisely what Facebook’s proprietary, and therefore secret, algorithm is.</p>
<h3>Censorship</h3>
<p>Censorship across centralized social media platforms is rampant and affects all ideologies across every platform. To discuss censorship I will focus primarily on YouTube and how its approach exemplifies the problematic nature of centralized platform content moderation. Since its acquisition by Google in 2006, YouTube has become one of the most visited sites on the internet. This centralized platform houses mainstream and niche content, with one set of rules governing it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-markus-spiske-2990644-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-markus-spiske-2990644-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-markus-spiske-2990644-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-markus-spiske-2990644-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-markus-spiske-2990644.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>All centralized social media platforms have a fundamental problem with content moderation. Effective content moderation requires a “scalpel”, not a “hammer”. With large centralized platforms like YouTube, there is no way to perform nuanced moderation. As a result, YouTube uses the hammer approach through automated content moderation tools. What results from the hammer approach to content moderation is the censorship of certain groups on the platform who follow the rules set forth by YouTube themselves. For example, LGBTQ YouTube creators’ videos were flagged and demonetized by <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/10/10/20893258/youtube-lgbtq-censorship-demonetization-nerd-city-algorithm-report">YouTube’s algorithm</a> because of the algorithm’s inability to distinguish non-sexual queer content from sexually explicit “mature” content. Where large centralized social media platforms are fighting against misinformation on their platforms, a “hammer” approach to censorship is both ineffective and potentially dangerous.</p>
<h3>Decentralized Social Media</h3>
<p>The issues of data collection, revenue models, and censorship in social media are related to the centralized nature of these platforms. Fortunately, decentralized and open source alternatives are available. Three examples of decentralized social media platforms are <strong>Mastodon</strong>, <strong>Pixelfed</strong>, and <strong>Peertube</strong>.</p>
<p>Decentralized social media platforms operate differently from centralized platforms. For example, if you wanted to communicate with anyone on Facebook, you must have an account on the Facebook server (i.e. have a Facebook account). However, with a decentralized platform like Mastodon, there is no central “Mastodon server” like Facebook. There are multiple servers (called <em>instances</em>) all running Mastodon separately. Now, if you wanted to communicate with someone on Mastodon, you just need an account on any instance running Mastodon. Anyone can run an instance and each instance is then administrated and moderated by whoever hosts the instance. This instanced approach allows for the “scalpel” approach to content moderation that centralized platforms are incapable of implementing. With volunteer moderators managing the content on specific instances, and migration from one instance to another made easy, users can find or even create an instance that caters to the specific moderation practices they desire.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/activitypub.png" alt="" width="474" height="291" srcset="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/activitypub.png 1012w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/activitypub-300x184.png 300w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/activitypub-768x471.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"></p>
<p>Instances “speak” to each other through protocols like <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a>. Through ActivityPub, users on one instance can talk to users on another instance, creating a social media network that is both open and closed. Posts from users on other instances are visible on ones feed, but those posts can be separated from posts from users on their local instance.</p>
<p>Mastodon, Pixelfed, and Peertube are open source, meaning anyone can examine the code and run an instance themselves. With no centralization, there is no dragnet collection and sale of user data. Instances may have a Patreon or other monetary support system in place to help finance the upkeep of an instance.</p>
<p>Decentralized social media is supported by the community, for the community, and as such there are no ads or algorithms. Social Media feeds are in chronological order, and “likes” and “favorites” are not recorded and used to push intensely personal ads. Building communities and sharing our lives on these decentralized social media platforms brings the value of connection through online platforms back to reasonable and appropriate levels.</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, the biggest player in the centralized social media space is also the most exploitative. I strongly believe deleting ones Facebook account is the biggest and most effective step one can take in reclaiming their privacy. Untangling oneself from Facebook’s many arms is difficult, but starting with the base app is the best place to start. Mastodon and Pixelfed provide great platforms to begin building an online community anew, one friend at a time.</p>

November 21, 2020 | https://secbytes.net/implant-roulette-part-1:-nimplant/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://secbytes.net/implant-roulette-part-1:-nimplant/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3><p>When creating an implant what language first comes to mind? Of course, the answer is it depends;
however, typically it is one of the following languages: C, C++, C#, Rust, Go, maybe even Python.
While those languages are all dandy, they are not the only programming languages that exist.
Throughout this series, I will be exploring different languages and seeing what
they bring to the table for implant &amp; offensive tool development.
The first language that will be examined is <a href="https://nim-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nim</a>.</p><h3 id="what-is-nim">What is Nim</h3><p>If we visit <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nim’s Github page</a> there is a concise definition of what Nim is,
“Nim is a statically typed compiled systems programming language. It combines successful concepts from mature languages like Python, Ada and Modula.”
Some of the “big” benefits of Nim are:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>* Cross-Platform: Generated executables support Windows, Linux, BSD, and macOS.</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>* Nim can compile to C, C++, Objective-C, and JavaScript.</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>* Nim binaries are small and the compiler toolchain allows for a lot of optimizations</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>* Nim can interface with other languages through Nim's foreign function interface (FFI) [1]</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>* Nim syntax is very quick to pick up and is reminiscent of Python.</span></p></pre></div><p>[1]<!-- -->: <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/backends.html#interfacing-nim-code-calling-the-backend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://nim-lang.org/docs/backends.html#interfacing-nim-code-calling-the-backend</a></p><p>Of course, these aren’t the only benefits of the language, more will reveal themself as time goes on.</p><h3 id="a-simple-injector">A Simple Injector</h3><p>Let’s get hands-on with Nim and see how to develop a simple injector.
Below is an implementation of a typical CreateRemoteThread injector:
Instead of having to manually interop with the Windows API via the FFI there
are <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nimble</a> packages that contain some Windows API
definitions. The one I tend to use is <a href="https://github.com/khchen/winim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Winim</a>.
Winim can also <a href="https://khchen.github.io/winim/com.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">interop with COM</a>.</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/c9d6d68b96f6495705555553bc886dba/fa827/crt_injector.png" alt="crt_injector"></p>
      
    <p>Let’s compile, run the program:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>nim c --run crtinjection.nim</span></p></pre></div><p>and make sure everything works. By default when you compile Nim code it generates
C code. In the latter section “Integrating into Existing Tooling” verification shall
ensue.</p><p>As an aside, if you do not want to use 3rd party packages that is fine if you examine
what Winim does under the hood for example when <a href="https://github.com/khchen/winim/blob/d300192c588f73dddef26e3c317f148aa23465c3/winim/inc/winbase.nim#L1942" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">calling CreateRemoteThread</a>.
It is simply importing the function for us as denoted by the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#foreign-function-interface-importc-pragma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">importc pragma</a>
as that allows us to import a proc or a variable from C. Also, available for importing
from foreign languages are: <code>.importcpp</code>, <code>.importobjc</code>, and <code>importjs</code>.</p><p>CreateRemoteThread proc:</p><p><code>proc CreateRemoteThread*(hProcess: HANDLE, lpThreadAttributes: LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES, dwStackSize: SIZE_T, lpStartAddress: LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE, lpParameter: LPVOID, dwCreationFlags: DWORD, lpThreadId: LPDWORD): HANDLE {.winapi, stdcall, dynlib: "kernel32", importc.}</code></p><h3 id="peeking-under-the-hood">Peeking Under the Hood</h3><p>What is going on under the hood is quite interesting. If we inspect the executable’s IAT we see
there are no static imports for OpenProcess, VirualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, and CreateRemoteThread.
That is because Nim is dynamically loading the required libraries with LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress.
Furthermore, when compiled Nim will place the source code of the language you are targeting in a folder
called nimcache. You can also specify the nimcache path for generated files with the compiler flag
<code>--nimcache:PATH</code>.</p><p>Below is a snippet of generated code for inject.nim
To make this easier to read I have compiled the program with an additional flag <code>--embedsrc:on</code> this flag tells the Nim compiler
to embed the source code as comments in the generated output. For compilation:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>nim c --run --hints:on --d:release --embedsrc:on inject.nim</span></p></pre></div><p>A snippet of generated C source code that performs injection:</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/f871bb711a469344dbd19d321401823a/9a8de/snippet_inject.png" alt="Inject_Snippet"></p>
      
    <p>Here we can inspect what our function calls are doing under the hood, the
Windows API calls done by winim rely on the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/dynlib.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dynlib module</a> to dynamically
invoke calls. If we inspect that source code we can see
the LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress combination.</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/8c2d1836e5e394c3d66dd878af26a70f/e3d9b/dynlib_code.png" alt="dynlib_code"></p>
      
    <h3 id="nim-and-donut">Nim and Donut</h3><p>Coming from C# one of my favorite tools for crafting payloads is <a href="https://github.com/theWover/Donut" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Donut</a>.
One of the great features with Donut is that it not only works with .NET assemblies but also with native DLLs
and executables. Since Nim can generate both C and C++ source code and link it to a native executable or DLL
Donut is an amazing utility that can transform our output to shellcode.
Since shellcode is language-agnostic we can easily integrate it into other tooling.</p><h3 id="integrating-into-existing-tooling">Integrating into Existing Tooling</h3><p>With shellcode you can easily integrate it into your own custom injectors in the language of your choice.
Of course since these are native executables and DLL’s we can also perform manually mapping and load them into memory.
Coming from C# my goto tools to perform the manual mapping are <a href="https://github.com/Dewera/Lunar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lunar</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/cobbr/SharpSploit/tree/master/SharpSploit/Execution/DynamicInvoke" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">D/Invoke tooling in SharpSploit</a>.</p><p>Let’s compile the injector code as a DLL and export an inject function.
To export the function we need to tell Nim to export it by adding the
following pragmas: <code>exportc, dynlib, and cdecl. or stdcall.</code>
The resulting inject proc is as follows:
<code>proc inject(pid: int): bool {.stdcall, exportc, dynlib.} = </code> <br>
Let’s compile the DLL as follows:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>nim c --d:release --app:lib --opt:size --inject.nim</span></p></pre></div><p>With the DLL let’s manually map it using SharpSploit’s D/Invoke tooling.
If you specifically just want the D/Invoke part you can also use the <a href="https://github.com/TheWover/DInvoke" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">repository</a>
or <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/DInvoke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">nuget package</a> for solely D/Invoke.</p><p>Manual Map Code:</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/f19f9f651aaf612e5aedd6cb03cebbdd/77a0f/dinvoke_nimmanualmapcode.png" alt="dinvokemanmapcode"></p>
      
    <p>Let’s run it and make sure our crt injector proc is executed properly.</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/66af0e3621b0f60c4d539a0403723250/ff8d2/manmapdemo.png" alt="manmepdemo"></p>
      
    <h3 id="embedding-nimscript-with-nimscripter">Embedding NimScript with Nimscripter</h3><p>Within Nim, there is an evolving scripting language known as NimScript.
In the NimScript <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/nims.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">documentation</a> it is defined as,
“the subset of Nim that can be evaluated by Nim’s built-in virtual machine (VM).”
NimScript is typically used as a configuration language in a devops role for example to run tests and build projects.
However, one of the biggest caveats with NimScript as stated within the documentation,
Nim’s <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/backends.html#interfacing-nim-code-calling-the-backend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FFI (foreign function interface)</a> is not available in NimScript.
This means that any stdlib module which relies on importc cannot be used in the VM.”
Nim’s FFI is how Nim can call other functions written in other programming languages, which is basically
Nim’s cross-platform version <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">P/Invoke</a>.
A possible solution is to write the FFI functionality in Nim and expose to NimScript.</p><p>Does that mean NimScript is not viable? Absolutely not,
especially with the slow shift in which especially for implant development
it’s not always ideal to statically embed everything. Instead leaning towards a lightweight
implant that can dynamically resolve commands within memory so even if an analyst
obtains the binary, not everything is revealed.</p><p>There are already a couple open source projects: (<a href="https://github.com/komerdoor/nim-embedded-nimscript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/komerdoor/nim-embedded-nimscript</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/Serenitor/embeddedNimscript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/Serenitor/embeddedNimscript</a>) that show how to use
NimScript as an embedded scripting language.</p><p>However, those repositories while noble do not easily allow the user to expose Nim code to NimScript and
is are simplistic.
Luckily, a new repository known as <a href="https://github.com/beef331/nimscripter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nimscripter</a> allows for easy interoperability between Nim and NimScript.</p><p>Below is an example in which the FFI specific code to call <code>MessageBoxA</code> is exposed to NimScript allowing
us to pass in a string of NimScript to invoke the Nim proc.</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/a0329212717d301eda283a791eda6fc5/fa827/nimscript_embeddedmessage.png" alt="nimscript_embeddedmessage"></p>
      
    <p>In a nutshell, what is happening under the hood is the
<a href="https://github.com/beef331/nimscripter/blob/master/src/nimscripter.nim#L140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">script is loaded</a> and the main body is evaluated which allows us to access symbols it exposes.
A small caveat is that you need to include Nim’s stdlib as an external folder; luckily, depending on what modules
you are you using from stdlib you may be able to remove some if unused.
If you would like to read more about embedding NimScript as well as just learn more about NimScript, I encourage you to check out this wonderful series:
<a href="https://peterme.net/using-nimscript-as-a-configuration-language-embedding-nimscript-pt-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://peterme.net/using-nimscript-as-a-configuration-language-embedding-nimscript-pt-1.html</a>.</p><h3 id="putting-the-pieces-together">Putting the Pieces Together</h3><p>While a simple injector is cool let’s see how hard it is to develop an implant
in Nim. Luckily, just within Nim’s cross-platform <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/lib.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">stdlib</a> is everything needed to create a basic implant
from the FFI for API calls, httpclient for http requests, and stellar json support as a medium for data. The C2 I chose to develop the implant for is <a href="https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mythic</a>, Mythic
is very sophisticated and well structured. Furthermore, implants are essentially plug and play as everything is
dockerized and your agent just needs to communicate back and forth via certain rest api endpoints.</p><p>Sprouting a few weeks later <a href="https://github.com/MythicAgents/Nimplant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nimplant</a> is born.</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/3125a933e063ab22da800b151f09b486/a048d/nimplant_logo.png" alt="nimplant_logo"></p>
      
    <p>Nimplant is a cross-platform Linux and Windows implant for Mythic C2 that is fully asynchronous
with the agent able to generate both C and C++ source code. Currently it just has basic functionality; however, it will be updated
overtime and become much more sophisticated. If you would like to read more about Nimplant
feel free to read the <a href="https://github.com/MythicAgents/Nimplant/tree/master/documentation-payload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">project’s documentation</a>.</p><p>Example Nimplant checkin:</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/5ae0ab5e6ae6720c5cd26a95d1d8122b/a6ea6/nimplant_demo.png" alt="nimplant_demo"></p>
      
    <h3 id="obfuscation">Obfuscation</h3><p>With Nim, there are ample opportunities throughout the development cycle to introduce obfuscation.
Three key areas that I will highlight are:</p><p><strong>Note: Of course these aren’t the only forms of obfuscation you can do just a small subset.</strong></p><p><h4>1. Code Obfuscation</h4></p><p>With Nim opportunities for code obfuscation are ripe, two quick and easy nimble packages
you can utilize are: <a href="https://github.com/Yardanico/nim-strenc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">nim-strenc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Yardanico/nuglifier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">nuglifier</a>.
Let’s just apply nim-strenc to the string literal and view the resulting C file in
our Nimcache.</p><p>Before:</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/6b91405cb049764789b3dcaa914603d8/e4370/hello_world_basic.png" alt="beforenimhello"></p>
      
    <p>After:</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/c282e87fe02cf7ca70c23d2ec7127c68/e4370/strenc_hello_world.png" alt="afternimhellostrenc"></p>
      
    <p>When compiling the creator of strenc recommends turning hints off and stripping the binary so we shall do that.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>nim c --run --hints:off --d:release --passL:-s</span></p></pre></div><p><code>--passL</code> will pass an option to the linker and we are passing <code>-s</code> to the GCC linker to perform stripping.
Within the Nimcache folder, go to hello_r and view the file <code>@mhello.nim.c</code>.
Inside that file we can see both string literals after they have been xor encrypted:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>STRING_LITERAL</span><span>(</span><span>TM__xLHv575t3PG1lB5wK05Xqg_3</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"\207\251\241\236\234\320\246\231\205\230\221\333"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>12</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>STRING_LITERAL</span><span>(</span><span>TM__xLHv575t3PG1lB5wK05Xqg_4</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"\360\275\246"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>With nim-strenc if you look at the codebase it’s less than 30 lines.
It’s applying a …</p></div></article></div>

Doing this is tricky in a React app that uses server side rendering (SSR) because client and server rendering work quite differently: Client render is async so data can be loaded inside components when they render, but server render is completely synchronous - the data must be loaded before render happens.</p><p data-reactid="57">Data loading is, of course, async. The client component-centric data loading pattern is nice, but it's incompatible with synchronous server render. React simply has no mechanism to wait for data to load when components render on SSR. There's a further problem too: React also provides no built-in way to hydrate data loaded during SSR into client state on first render. This is also up to you to implement.</p><p data-reactid="58">So, full stack data loading in React is a tricky problem. A couple of solutions have emerged:</p><ol data-reactid="59"><li data-reactid="60"><p data-reactid="61">Load data at the route level, instead of the component level, then pass data to all components under the route. Works on SSR since the route is known in the request, so data can be loaded before render begins. Can be implemented by piecing together router and state manager libraries.</p></li><li data-reactid="62"><p data-reactid="63">Use a framework that wraps React and abstracts the problem away, perhaps by providing a framework-specific async data loading function for components that works on SSR, and also takes care of hydrating state on the client.</p></li></ol><p data-reactid="64">React Frontload aims to provide a third way - the component-centric data loading pattern available full stack, but without having to buy into a whole framework just to get this feature. It's just a small library that solves this one problem, and can be used in any React stack.</p><p data-reactid="68">Here's an example of loading data into a component with React Frontload</p><p><span>const</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <h2 id="intro">
  Intro
  <a href="#intro">#</a>
</h2>
<p>TorchScript is one of the most important parts of the Pytorch ecosystem, allowing portable, efficient and nearly seamless deployment. With just a few lines of <code>torch.jit</code> code and some simple model changes you can export an asset that runs anywhere <code>libtorch</code> does. It’s an important toolset to master if you want to run your models outside the lab at high efficiency.</p>
<p>Good <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html">introductory material</a> is already available for starting to work with <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html">TorchScript</a> including <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html">execution in the C++ <code>libtorch</code> runtime</a>, and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_language_reference.html">reference material</a> is also provided. This article is a collection of topics going beyond the basics of your first export.</p>
<h2 id="tracing-vs-scripting">
  Tracing vs Scripting
  <a href="#tracing-vs-scripting">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Pytorch provides two methods for generating TorchScript from your model code — tracing and scripting — but which should you use? Let’s recap how they work:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.trace.html"><strong>Tracing.</strong></a> When using <code>torch.jit.trace</code> you’ll provide your model and sample input as arguments. The input will be fed through the model as in regular inference and the executed operations will be traced and recorded into TorchScript. Logical structure will be frozen into the path taken during this sample execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.script.html"><strong>Scripting.</strong></a> When using <code>torch.jit.script</code> you’ll simply provide your model as an argument. TorchScript will be generated from the static inspection of the <code>nn.Module</code> contents (recursively).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not obvious from the tutorial documentation, but choosing which method to use is a fairly simple and fluid choice:</p>
<h3 id="use-scripting-by-default">
  Use Scripting by Default
  <a href="#use-scripting-by-default">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Because <code>torch.jit.script</code> captures both the operations and full conditional logic of your model, it’s a great place to start. If your model doesn’t need any <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_unsupported.html">unsupported Pytorch functionality</a> and has logic restricted to the <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_builtin_functions.html#python-built-in-functions">supported subset of Python functions</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_python_reference.html">syntax</a>, then <code>torch.jit.script</code> should be all you need.</p>
<p>One major advantage of scripting over tracing is that an export is likely to either fail for a well-defined reason — implying a clear code modification — or succeed without warnings.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Unlike Python, TorchScript is Statically Typed</strong></p>
<p>You will need to be consistent about container element datatypes, and be wary of implicit function signatures. A useful practice is to use type hints in method signatures.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Despite TorchScript’s ability to capture conditional logic it does not allow you to run arbitrary Python within <code>libtorch</code> — a popular misconception.</p>
<h3 id="use-tracing-if-you-must">
  Use Tracing if You Must
  <a href="#use-tracing-if-you-must">#</a>
</h3>
<p>There are a few special cases in which <code>torch.jit.trace</code> may be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are unable to modify the model code — because you do not have access or ownership — you may find scripting the model simply will not work because it uses unsupported Pytorch/Python functionality.</li>
<li>In pursuit of performance or to bake in architectural decisions the logic freezing behavior of tracing might be preferable — similar to inlining C/C++ code.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Pay Close Attention to Tracer Warnings</strong></p>
<p>Due to how tracing can simplify model behavior, each warning should be fully understood and only then ignored (or fixed). Also, be sure to trace in eval mode if you are exporting a model for production inference!</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="use-both-together">
  Use Both Together
  <a href="#use-both-together">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Scripted and traced code can be freely mixed, and this is often a great choice. See the existing <a href="https://pytorch.org/">pytorch.org</a> documentation for <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html#mixing-tracing-and-scripting">details</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html#mixing-scripting-and-tracing">examples</a>.</p>
<h2 id="device-pinning">
  Device Pinning
  <a href="#device-pinning">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If you find yourself using <code>torch.jit.trace</code> on some code, you’ll have to actively deal with some of the gotchas or face performance and portability consequences. Besides addressing any warnings Pytorch emits, you’ll also need to keep an eye out for device pinning. Just like <code>torch.jit.trace</code> records and freezes conditional logic, it will also trace and make constant the values resulting from this logic — this can include device constants.</p>
<p>Using this sample code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we trace while executing on CPU or GPU we get this TorchScript (scroll to the right on mobile):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>:</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>:</span>
  <span>_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>ops</span><span>.</span><span>prim</span><span>.</span><span>NumToTensor</span><span>(</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span>
  <span>_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>_0</span><span>),</span> <span>dtype</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>layout</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>device</span><span>=</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>device</span><span>(</span><span>"cpu"</span><span>),</span> <span>pin_memory</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>_1</span></code></pre></div>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can see that <code>torch.device("cpu")</code> has been inserted as a constant into the generated TorchScript. If we try to get clever with this code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>device</span><span>=</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>device</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Tracing will now result in TorchScript that is pinned to the tracing device. When traced on GPU, we see this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span>
    <span>X</span><span>:</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>:</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>_1</span></code></pre></div>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tensors Created During Tracing Will Have Their Device Pinned</strong></p>
<p>This can be a significant performance and portability problem.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="performance-and-portability">
  Performance and Portability
  <a href="#performance-and-portability">#</a>
</h3>
<p>If we later deserialize and run this TorchScript in <code>libtorch</code> the <code>arange</code> tensor will always be created on the device that is pinned — <code>torch.device("cpu")</code> or <code>torch.device("cuda:0")</code> in the examples above. If the rest of the model is running on a different device this can result in costly memory transfers and synchronization.</p>
<p>This device pinning issue extends to multi-GPU scenarios as well. If you have traced and exported a model on <code>cuda:0</code> and then run it on <code>cuda:1</code> you’ll see transfers and synchronization between the devices. Not good. Perhaps even worse, if such a model is run in an environment without any CUDA-capable device it will fail since <code>cuda:0</code> doesn’t exist.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Replace Tensors Created During Execution With Parameters</strong></p>
<p>Tensors created in the execution path while tracing will have their device pinned. Depending on model logic, these can often be turned into Parameters created during construction.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>An example of the problem looks like this in Nsight Systems:</p>

<p>The same pattern holds for <code>tensor[indexes]</code> and <code>tensor.index_select(0, indexes)</code>. This device pinning carries the same performance and portability risks as noted above.</p>

<p>Once we’ve used <code>torch.jit.script</code> or <code>torch.jit.trace</code> to generate a ScriptModule or ScriptFunction we can use <code>.graph</code>, <code>.inlined_graph</code> or <code>.code</code> to understand exactly what TorchScript has been generated. Though it has an entirely undocumented interface it is possible (and fun) to access and modify the generated TorchScript AST directly via the <code>.graph</code> method.</p>
<p>The most useful parts of the API are defined in <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/csrc/jit/python/python_ir.cpp">torch/csrc/jit/python/python_ir.cpp</a>. As you can see, all the basic functionality is present for finding and changing the graph nodes you want. If you change nodes or arguments and then persist the module your subsequent TorchScript load and inference will reflect your changes, though modules cannot be changed recursively in this way (<code>torch.jit.freeze</code> can be useful here).</p>
<p>An example of the kind of graph modification that is possible:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>undevice</span><span>(</span><span>tsc</span><span>):</span>
    <span># use ::to variant which does not hardcode device</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>to_node</span> <span>in</span> <span>tsc</span><span>.</span><span>graph</span><span>.</span><span>findAllNodes</span><span>(</span><span>'aten::to'</span><span>):</span>
        <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>dtype</span><span>,</span> <span>layout</span><span>,</span> <span>device</span><span>,</span> <span>pin_mem</span><span>,</span> <span>non_blocking</span><span>,</span> <span>copy</span><span>,</span> <span>mem_format</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>inputs</span><span>())</span>
        <span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>removeAllInputs</span><span>()</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>a</span> <span>in</span> <span>[</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>dtype</span><span>,</span> <span>non_blocking</span><span>,</span> <span>copy</span><span>,</span> <span>mem_format</span><span>]:</span>
            <span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>addInput</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>

    <span>for</span> <span>constant</span> <span>in</span> <span>tsc</span><span>.</span><span>graph</span><span>.</span><span>findAllNodes</span><span>(</span><span>'prim::Constant'</span><span>):</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>constant</span><span>.</span><span>hasUses</span><span>():</span>
            <span>constant</span><span>.</span><span>destroy</span><span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above code will modify a traced graph, changing <code>aten::to</code> to use an overload which doesn’t change memory location.</p>
<p>But what is this really useful for? As an undocumented API you’d be unwise to use this capability in a production pipeline unless you like maintenance coding. I would only recommend it for research, as in the above example which I used to understand and profile the transfer/synchronization behavior of tensor subscripting.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Don’t Bother With Direct Graph Modification</strong></p>
<p>For legitimate production use-cases you can almost always find a way to modify your model code to generate the TorchScript you want.</p>

</blockquote>

  Rewrite for ONNX/TensorRT Export
  <a href="#rewrite-for-onnxtensorrt-export">#</a>
</h2>
<p>You can get some <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/#stage-3-hacked-deepstream-mdash-80-tensorrt-20-torchscript">awesome results with TensorRT</a> but exporting a model from Pytorch to TensorRT is far from a sure thing. The export path to ONNX and then to TensorRT can fail due to missing or incompatible operations at either step and this can be frustrating.</p>
<p>After the obligatory Google search, I’ve found a reasonable hail-mary approach is to rewrite your tensor processing code to avoid unsupported operators. I can’t give general advice for this but let me show you an example of how this can be possible: <code>repeat_interleave</code>.</p>

<p>The Last Super is<strong> brand new Super Nintendo (SNES) game</strong> created to celebrate the 30th birthday of the console!</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQ1NzUyMDUuZ2lm/original/sd47O2.gif"><br></p>
<p>As the last SNES cartridge on Earth, you'll have to move and jump around in each of the 20 levels of the game so every SNES can play you! But don't let a SNES without cartridge for too long...</p>
<h2>SNES ROM or cartridge?</h2>
<p>The Last Super is an actual game for the Super Nintendo / SNES / Super Famicom console. If you want to play it on a real console, you can <a href="https://catskullelectronics.com/collections/games/products/the-last-super" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">buy a beautiful game cartridge</a> from Catskull Games. As an extra bonus, this cartridge also contains my previous SNES game <a href="https://drludos.itch.io/keeping-snes-alive" target="_blank">Keeping SNES Alive!</a><br></p>

<p>The cartridge is made from newly built elements<em> (PCB, shells, etc)</em> all designed and hand assembled in the US by Catskull himself. The cartridge is region-free. It has been tested and working on NTSC SNES, PAL SNES, JP SFC, and Analogue Super Nt.</p>
<p>If your prefer to play it on emulator, you can <a href="https://drludos.itch.io/the-last-super/purchase" target="_blank">download a ROM version of the game here</a>, and use it with any SNES emulator you like. Here are a few examples: </p>

<h2>Behind the scenes</h2>
<p>The game was <strong>programmed in C</strong> using the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/alekmaul/pvsneslib" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">PVSNESlib</a> by Alekmaul.</p>
<p>The <strong>music was composed by </strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/xracecar" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>XRACECAR</strong></a>. The two tracks are:</p>
<ul><li><em>"ayyy you know the man"</em> (under a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-SA license)<br><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/ayyy+you+know+the+man.xm/23747/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/ayyy+you+know+the+man.xm/23747/</a> <em><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><br></a></em></li><li><em><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"></a>"7049 Bytes of Memories"</em> (under a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-SA license)<br><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/</a></li></ul>
<p><strong>A fun fact about the audio</strong>: the <em>"shlack</em>" sound that you hear when the cartridge enters a console is an<strong> actual recording of the noise made by my SNES power button</strong> <em>(recorded directly from my childhood console, still alive and kicking after 30 years!)</em></p>
<p>Last but not the least, <a href="https://drludos.itch.io/the-last-super/purchase" target="_blank">the full source code is included</a>.<strong> I spent a lot of time cleaning up and commenting the code as thoroughly as I could</strong>, hoping it'll help and motivate you to start making new SNES games too!<br></p></div></div>]]>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Systemd targets are a special kind of unit, this is how I used
them to serialize the boot order of my server and how I am planning
on using them to shape the supervision tree of my system.</p>

<p>As a Linux user I have systemd installed on my devices but I usually tweak
somebody else unit or write a service unit to start a program at boot.</p>

<p>This has changed some time ago when I started looking more into other
unit types that are available for use.</p>

<p>I started with <em>timers</em> to automate recurring tasks such as renewing
certificates using certbot but there is little information about how to
use the rest of the unit types.</p>

<p>For this time we are going to look at a target unit because I see it
as the most useful to get out and I happened to be working on mine recently.</p>

<h3 id="targets">targets</h3>

<p>As I run more and more services on my server I find that there is
more need to divide them into layers looking at their common dependencies and
what they provide; some of them are there to provide an internal service and others
are there for displaying HTML to me.
E.g. most of my web services use the same postgresql cluster and they should all
be started when this becomes available.</p>

<p>Basically for this instance we are going to divide programs I run into two
categories, infrastructure and front-facing. For both groups we will make
a target unit to group them and impose a start order.</p>

<p>For this experiment we will make two targets, <strong>infra.target</strong> and <strong>front.target</strong>,
group the services to be started by their target and add everything to the
supervision tree.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span># infra.target
</span><span>[Unit]</span>
<span>Description</span><span>=</span><span>infrastructure target</span>
<span># a lists of units that will be started along this one
</span><span>Wants</span><span>=</span><span>postgresql.service nginx.service</span>
<span>Wants</span><span>=</span><span>multi-user.target</span>

<span># front.target
</span><span>[Unit]</span>
<span>Description</span><span>=</span><span>front-end target</span>
<span>After</span><span>=</span><span>infra.target</span>
<span>Wants</span><span>=</span><span>infra.target web-app.service</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now for a brief explanation, when starting <strong>infra.target</strong> we are also starting
the units <strong>postgresql.service</strong> and <strong>nginx.service</strong> as they are listed as <em>Wants</em>
and the same is true for starting <strong>front-end.target</strong> starting <strong>infra.target</strong> and
<strong>web-app.service</strong>.</p>

<p>With out dependencies out of the way we also have to ensure order of execution, starting
a web app before the database server is started is not what we want.</p>

<p>What we have to understand here is that we have expressed dependency but not ordering; to
express ordering of units startup we have to use the <em>After</em>, <em>Before</em> directives.</p>

<p>So going back to the previous example we want <strong>front.target</strong> to be started after <strong>infra.target</strong>
and all its dependencies have completed the start up sequence as this means that both
<strong>postgresql.service</strong> and <strong>nginx.service</strong> have been started.</p>

<p>We have taken our initial problem, ensuring some infrastructure will be started, and put a
time constraint on when our front end is started. But we are not done yet!</p>

<p>The startup sequence differs from unit type to unit type; e.g. a service unit has finished the
startup sequence when all <em>ExecStart*</em> directives have been issued, what about a target unit<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>?</p>

<p>This could become an issue with a long startup time, e.g. connection to a another machine to register
you have booted, but for things such as starting nginx or a small postgresql cluster things should be
fast enough.</p>



<p>The last step to take is to notice that we have a chain linking our
targets <strong>front-end.target</strong> -&gt; <strong>infra.target</strong> -&gt; <strong>multi-user.target</strong>
and we can then change the default target from <strong>default.target</strong> to
<strong>front-end.target</strong> and the boot sequence will still go through you previous setup.</p>

<p>So wrapping up we saw how you can use a target unit to wrap together part of your services and wait for
them to start all together, this will enable you to have layers of services and overall
abstract a little more over the server you are booting.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h3 id="openmp-vs-posix-threads">OpenMP vs POSIX threads</h3>
<p>Both are APIs for shared-memory programming. In C, OpenMP is a relatively high-level extension, providing compiler directives for parallelizing many programs with ease while some low-level thread interactions may be difficult to program. Pthreads provide some low-level coordination constructs that are unavailable in OpenMP, making other programs easier to parallelize while requiring explicit specification of the behavior of each thread, which may virtually be any that is conceivable.</p>
<p>Pthreads programs can be used with <em>any</em> C compiler, provided the system has a Pthreads library. OpenMP requires compiler support for some operations, which <em>many</em> compilers provide.</p>
<h3 id="area-under-the-curve">Area Under the Curve</h3>
<p>The program we are about to develop is oftentimes called the 'Hello world!' of parallel programming. We will be using the following formula for <cite>arctan(1)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></cite> in approximating the value for π.</p>
<p><span><span><img src="https://hasithsen.github.io/tech/posts/parallelizing-pi-approx-openmp/Leibniz-formula-for-pi.png" alt="Leibniz-formula-for-pi.png"></span><span><span>Just as we learned a long time ago in Kindergarten, the value of the integral here is the area between the graph and the x-axis while x goes from 0 to 1.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Going through the serial version of the program in C, the value for above is calculated for each integer within range <strong>[1, N)</strong> and summed up within a loop. The resulting <strong>sum</strong> is them divided by <strong>N</strong> for getting an estimate of <strong>π / 4</strong>, before printing out the calculated <em>approximate</em> for π.</p>

<p>To compile above with <code>gcc</code>, use following.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">gcc -o &lt;outputname&gt; &lt;filename&gt;.c -f openmp -lm -Wall -g
</code></pre></div><h3 id="modifying-parallelized-code">Modifying Parallelized Code</h3>
<p>Before changing anything, it pays to understand whatever we want changed in the first-place. So, let us go through the above code. The function <code>omp_get_wtime()</code>, defined in <code>omp.h</code>, returns the amount of seconds since a previous <em>fixed</em> point in time (included for execution timing purposes). Setting the number of threads to spawn when running parallel code (code inside parallel scope, that is) done by <code>omp_set_num_threds</code>. Changing the <code>set</code> to <code>get</code> and calling from <em>within</em> a parallel section returns the number of threads in execution (<code>get</code> counterpart is available for most functions with <code>set</code>). However, due to resource constraints on the system, it is possible we ending up with a lower number of threads.</p>
<p>The directive <code>#pragma omp parallel</code> is for parallelizing the code–it is safe to assume if this is not present somewhere, the program will not be parallelized by OpenMP. The scope of code that needs to be executed in parallel may be defined the same way we do scoping in C, with <code>{}</code>, or without–whereas only immediately following code line will be considered in-scope. This is where new threads will be spawned and start running alongside the master thread, branching the execution.</p>
<p>Any variables created within the parallel scope are private for each thread (i.e. <code>sum_thread</code>), and will not contribute to race conditions. Therefore, the <code>for</code> loop incrementing <code>sum_thread</code> is divided among threads spawned. Please note the way threads divide the iterations among themselves can be handled up to some extent with specific directives, the default behavior is expected here by omitting them.</p>
<p>Critical sections may be scoped within <code>#pragma omp atomic</code> or <code>#pragma omp critical</code>. The former enables low level atomicity of execution (with higher performance) if available, and only accepts a single assignment statement (of an allowed form) within scope, while the latter can handle multiple statements. Both effectively serializes execution. If we end up with most of the code within the scope of either, our code is probably too poor for parallelization with OpenMP.</p>
<p>Outside the <code>#pragma omp parallel</code> scope, previously spawned threads will join the master thread, and it will continue executing similar to a serial program. It is worth mentioning that we may have as many parallel/serial sections as we please.</p>
<p>As should be apparent from above, OpenMP is designed to be easy to learn and can be used for parallelizing existing serial code with minimal modifications. What if we could further simplify the above code?</p>
<h3 id="reducing-the-parallel-code">Reducing the Parallel Code</h3>
<p>Modifying the <code>sum</code> variable at the end of the <code>for</code> loop in above code could be simplified with a reduction operation provided by OpenMP. That is, we can instruct OpenMP to synchronously add the <em>local sum</em> calculated by each thread (within loop) to the shared variable <code>sum</code> as shown in the parallel version below.</p>

<p>Here, we have a single statement <code>#pragma omp parallel for</code> that tells we want the immediately-following <code>for</code> loop parallelized, which is identical to having <code>#pragma omp for</code> immediately before a <code>for</code> loop <em>within</em> the scope of <code>#pragma omp parallel</code>. The <code>reduction(+:sum)</code> tells that we want the <code>sum</code> variable to contain the <em>sum</em> of each local sum calculated in each iteration only available locally to the thread that runs it. OpenMP does this by creating a private <em>sum</em> variable for each thread and initializing it to <strong>unit</strong> according to the operation (ex. <strong>0</strong> for <code>+</code>, <strong>1</strong> for <code>*</code>), this is how we use the <strong>reduction operator</strong> in OpenMP. The <code>shared(N)</code> tells that the <code>N</code> variable should be shared with all threads, this is fine since threads are only reading it–therefore no potential data races. Finally, the approximated values along with the time taken for calculations are printed.</p>
<p>Now that we went through the code, note that the  <code>omp_set_num_threads</code> is not mandatory when using OpenMP, the program defaults to spawning the maximum number of threads possible on the system at execution time.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>The most exciting moment of the web application development is a deployment. Your app is going live! It can also be nerve-wracking moment. Unfortunately. There are many options, many variables and configurations. It is easy to miss something … In this article, I will show you how to pack Django and React application into containers and deploy them with <code>docker-compose</code>. The presented approach can be reused on any Cloud Provider (AWS, DigitalOcean, Linode, GCP, Heroku) - you just need a Virtual Private Server (VPS).</p>

<p>In this article:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We will create two <code>docker-compose</code> configuration files. One for development (easier version) and one for production (with SSL certificate from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>).</li>
  <li>The React static files will be served by <code>nginx</code>.</li>
  <li>The Django static files (from admin and DRF browsable API) will be served by <code>nginx</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>nginx</code> will be reverse-proxy to the Django server (<code>gunicorn</code>).</li>
  <li>In the production, we will add <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/"><code>certbot</code></a> to renew the certificate. To issue a certificate we will use a bash script. You need to have a domain to issue the certificate .</li>
</ul>

<p>We will be using code from the previous article: <a href="https://saasitive.com/tutorial/crud-django-rest-framework-react/">CRUD in Django Rest Framework and React</a> (code with <a href="https://github.com/saasitive/django-react-boilerplate/tree/v6">tag v6</a>).</p>

<h2 id="create-dockerfile-for-django-and-nginx">Create Dockerfile for Django and Nginx</h2>

<p>Let’s start by adding a new directory <code>docker</code> in the main directory of the project. Your project structure should look like below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>.</span>
├── backend
├── docker
├── frontend
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the <code>docker</code> directory please add <code>backend</code> directory with two files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>docker/backend/Dockerfile</code> - it will define how to build Django container,</li>
  <li><code>docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> - it will be entrypoint for Django container. It will apply migrations, collect static files and run WSGI server with <a href="https://gunicorn.org/"><code>gunicorn</code></a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="django-dockerfile">Django Dockerfile</h3>

<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> to build Django container:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># docker/backend/Dockerfile</span>

<span>FROM</span><span> python:3.8.3-alpine</span>

<span>WORKDIR</span><span> /app</span>
<span>ADD</span><span> ./backend/requirements.txt /app/backend/</span>


<span>RUN </span>pip <span>install</span> <span>--upgrade</span> pip
<span>RUN </span>pip <span>install </span>gunicorn
<span>RUN </span>pip <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> backend/requirements.txt

<span>ADD</span><span> ./docker /app/docker</span>
<span>ADD</span><span> ./backend /app/backend</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this <code>Dockerfile</code> the <code>python:3.8.3-alpine</code> is used as base image. Let’s decode this image name and tag. It contains python in version <code>3.8.3</code>, running in the Linux distribution <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/"><code>Alpine</code></a> which is lightweight. The purpose of using lightweight Linux is to have small image which will result in faster builds. You can of course use different base image. For purpose of this tutorial the <code>python:3.8.3-alpine</code> is sufficient.</p>

<p>We create <code>/app</code> directory in the container and copy <code>/backend/requirements.txt</code>. Then, <code>gunicorn</code> and all needed packages are installed. The backend source code is copied at the end of the container build. It is on purpose. It makes building faster. When you change something in the code (without changing the <code>requirements.txt</code> file), only the last line of the <code>Dockerfile</code> will be executed and the rest will be read from cache (of course if available).</p>

<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> is not executing any command, we will use <code>wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> script for this purpose.</p>

<h3 id="docker-entrypoint">Docker entrypoint</h3>

<p>Please add a new file <code>docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> and add execute rights to the file (it is a bash script):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># add execute rights</span>
<span>chmod</span> +x docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

<span>until </span><span>cd</span> /app/backend/server
<span>do
    </span><span>echo</span> <span>"Waiting for server volume..."</span>
<span>done

until</span> ./manage.py migrate
<span>do
    </span><span>echo</span> <span>"Waiting for db to be ready..."</span>
    <span>sleep </span>2
<span>done</span>

./manage.py collectstatic <span>--noinput</span>

<span># Options to DEBUG Django server</span>
<span># Optional commands to replace abouve gunicorn command</span>

<span># Option 1:</span>
<span># run gunicorn with debug log level</span>
<span># gunicorn server.wsgi --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 1 --threads 1 --log-level debug</span>

<span># Option 2:</span>
<span># run development server</span>
<span># DEBUG=True ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above script is waiting till serever volume and database is ready. It runs migration on database and collect static files. It runs <code>gunicorn</code> server with IP address <code>0.0.0.0</code> and (docker default IP) and port <code>8000</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>gunicorn</code> is running <code>4</code> workers with <code>4</code> threads each. You can set different numbers here. It depends on your machine. There are some heuristic rules that set number of workers as <code>4 * CPU cores</code> (see the <a href="https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#workers">gunicorn docs</a>). If you are deploying application to machine with 1 CPU core, then you can use <code>4</code> workers. (Remember, it is just heuristic not an exact rule). Then you can specify how many threads will be running in each worker. In our case, there are <code>4</code> threads (<a href="https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#threads">gunicorn docs</a>). This means that we can process <code>4 * 4 = 16</code> concurrent requests.</p>

<p><strong>1st Note:</strong> We are using <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> for our development - it doesn’t support concurrency. We will need to replace SQLite with advanced database engine like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. I will replace database at the end of this tutorial to make final deployment. I think it is good to deploy application. We will practice deployment and code updates in the production. That’s why we are here.</p>

<p><strong>2nd Note:</strong> One more thing, I added other options to run Django server in <code>wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> which are commmented. Why? You might need them for debugging. The first option add logging to the console with debug level and run <code>gunicorn</code> with one worker and single thread. The second option runs Django development server with <code>DEBUG=True</code>. It needs setting environment variable and load it in <code>settings.py</code> with <a href="https://github.com/henriquebastos/python-decouple"><code>python-decouple</code></a> (for example), I will write about this in the future post.</p>

<h4 id="django-static-files">Django static files</h4>

<p>Before going further, let’s update <code>STATIC_URL</code> variable in the <code>backend/server/server/settings.py</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># backend/server/server/settings.py
</span>
<span>MEDIA_URL</span> <span>=</span> <span>'/media/'</span>
<span>STATIC_URL</span> <span>=</span> <span>'/django_static/'</span> 
<span>STATIC_ROOT</span> <span>=</span> <span>BASE_DIR</span> <span>/</span> <span>'django_static'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We overwrite <code>STATIC_URL</code> with a new value. All static files will be served with <code>/django_static/</code> in the URL. We add two new variables:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>MEDIA_URL</code> - it is URL for serving files uploaded to Django application, we will use it in future posts.</li>
  <li><code>STATIC_ROOT</code> - it is a directory where static files from Django application will be stored after running <code>collectstatic</code> command. The <code>nginx</code> will point to this path.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nginx-dockerfile-and-configuration">Nginx Dockerfile and Configuration</h3>

<p>Please add <code>nginx</code> directory in the <code>docker</code> directory. There will be added three files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>docker/nginx/Dockerfile</code> - the instructions how to build <code>nginx</code> container image,</li>
  <li><code>docker/nginx/development/default.conf</code> - the configuration file for <code>nginx</code> server used in the development,</li>
  <li><code>docker/nginx/production/default.conf</code> - the configuration file for the production.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> for <code>nginx</code> container will use two stage build.</p>

<ul>
  <li>At first stage, we build the React static files.</li>
  <li>At second stage, the static files are copied and <code>nginx</code> server starts. We copy React static files into <code>/usr/share/nginx/html</code> directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>docker/nginx/Dockerfile</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># The first stage</span>
<span># Build React static files</span>
<span>FROM</span><span> node:13.12.0-alpine as build</span>

<span>WORKDIR</span><span> /app/frontend</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> ./frontend/package.json ./</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> ./frontend/package-lock.json ./</span>
<span>RUN </span>npm ci <span>--silent</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> ./frontend/ ./</span>
<span>RUN </span>npm run build

<span># The second stage</span>
<span># Copy React static files and start nginx</span>
<span>FROM</span><span> nginx:stable-alpine</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> --from=build /app/frontend/build /usr/share/nginx/html</span>
<span>CMD</span><span> ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At the second stage, we copy only the final product of the first stage: static files. The <code>node_modules</code> (they can take a lot of space) with dependency files are not in the final image. Such two stage-build makes the size of the final image smaller.</p>

<p>Let’s add <code>nginx</code> configuration for development version of <code>docker-compose</code> (without SSL certificate):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>listen</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>

        <span>proxy_pass</span>   <span>http://backend:8000</span><span>;</span>

    <span>location</span> <span>/django_static/</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>autoindex</span> <span>on</span><span>;</span>
        <span>alias</span> <span>/app/backend/server/django_static/</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do you feel when you see <code>nginx</code> configuration file?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No troubles! The <code>nginx</code> is here to help us. It will do what we will ask in the configuration.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>listen</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server_name</span> <span>_</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server_tokens</span> <span>off</span><span>;</span>
    <span>client_max_body_size</span> <span>20M</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At the begining of the configuration we define a server (<code>server</code> keyword). It will listen on port <code>80</code> (it is a default <code>HTTP</code> port). There is no name assigned to the server (<code>server_name _;</code>). We switch off option to show server version on error pages (<code>server_token off;</code> <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#server_tokens">see docs</a>). The last setting is to set maximum request size (<a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size">see docs</a>) (<code>client_max_body_size 20M</code>). It means that requests larger than 20MB will result in error with HTTP 413 (Request Entity Too Large).</p>

<p>We have five <code>location</code> blocks (<a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location">location docs</a>) in the config which specify configuration for each URL (routing for requests).</p>

<p>The first <code>location /</code> defines what to do if the request comes from <code>/</code> (main domain or IP). The <code>index.html</code> file from <code>/usr/share/nginx/html</code> will be served as a response. It is our React static <code>index.html</code> file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>location</span> <span>/</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>root</span>   <span>/usr/share/nginx/html</span><span>;</span>
        <span>index</span>  <span>index.html</span> <span>index.htm</span><span>;</span>
        <span>try_files</span> <span>$uri</span> <span>$uri</span><span>/</span> <span>/index.html</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The second and third locations <code>location /api</code> and <code>location /admin</code> redirect requests to <code>location @proxy_api</code>. It is a reverse-proxy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>location</span> <span>/api</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>try_files</span> <span>$uri</span> <span>@proxy_api</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>location</span> <span>/admin</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>try_files</span> <span>$uri</span> <span>@proxy_api</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What we have in fourth <code>location @proxy_api</code>? It is our Django application served with <code>gunicorn</code>. The <code>nginx</code> forwards all requests with <code>/api</code> and <code>/a…</code></p></div></div>

November 21, 2020 | https://nohq.co/blog/guide-to-1-on-1-meetings-in-remote-teams/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nohq.co/blog/guide-to-1-on-1-meetings-in-remote-teams/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Regular 1-on-1 (often also written as 1:1) meetings are an important satisfaction factor for remote teams. For managers and companies, it's amazing to stay in the loop and resolve friction quickly. For employees, it's a rare chance to voice opinions and difficulties.</p>
<p>Especially in async environments and other remote teams where face-to-face time is sparse, this regularly scheduled personal time can be a&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's why 1-on-1s are extra important for remote teams, how they work best and why the greatest remote teams are so religious about them.</p>

<h2>What is a 1-on-1 meeting?</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, a 1-on-1 meeting is a discussion between two parties. 1-on-1s are traditionally conducted for things like <strong>performance reviews</strong> or <strong>confidential discussions</strong> between a manager and their direct report.</p>
<p>In remote teams, face-to-face time can be sparse. It's more difficult to catch someone during their coffee break and talk things out. More formally scheduled 1-on-1s can be the solution for that.</p>
<p>Other than what's traditional, it's not uncommon to have 1-on-1s <strong>outside the manager-report relationship</strong>, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>satisfaction survey between employee and HR</li>
<li>knowledge exchange between team leaders</li>
<li>pair review between peers, co-working</li>
</ul>
<p>But even the more traditional manger-report 1-on-1 meetings <strong>holds more weight</strong> in remote work: It's the one place where employees can voice concerns, talk about their growth, their goals or any friction that has come up.</p>

<h2>The benefits of 1-on-1s for remote employees and managers</h2>
<p>When it comes to remote employees, regularly scheduled 1-on-1 meetings are a miracle tool when it comes to retention and employee satisfaction. As mentioned, they are a welcome place to voice concerns early or talk about growth.</p>
<p>For ambitious employees that creates an atmosphere where friction can get moved out of the way quickly, where ears are always open for concerns and growth desires can be made explicit.</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/undraw_Meeting_re_i53h.png" alt="" width="600" height="358"></p>

<p>That sounds like an amazing deal for any employee, but obviously, it also comes at a high cost for managers.</p>
<p>For a team with 8 direct reports, bi-weekly 1-on-1s at a duration of 30 minutes per meeting, that's a full workday of added meeting time every single month! What's in it for the managers?</p>
<p>The benefits for employees can be reversed and are just as important for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>get rid of friction early</li>
<li>know where reports want to be in their careers</li>
<li>stay in the loop about newest developments</li>
<li>better picture of morale and difficulties</li>
</ul>
<p>Given any actionable manager, this is definitely worth its time as actions can be taken that improve satisfaction and retention.</p>
<p>And indeed, <a href="https://www.leapsome.com/blog/meeting-with-purpose-the-unique-benefits-of-1-on-1-meetings">research shows</a> that while group meetings tend to lower employee satisfaction rates, 1-on-1 meetings actively improve that same metric!</p>

<h2>Productive 1-on-1 meetings methods</h2>
<p>1-on-1 meetings aren't hard to do right. As long as they are scheduled consistently and follows a common path – besides having a culture that allows for honest feedback – there's definitely a benefit to doing them.</p>
<p>As with so many things, some people have taken it a step further and created detailed methods and best practises to running 1-on-1 meetings.</p>

<h3>The traffic light check-in</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.connorswenson.com/blog/red-yellow-green-the-traffic-light-that-can-transform-your-meetings">traffic light check-in</a>, also called "Red Yellow Green" check-in is one of the meeting methods that has brought success to companies like Google, Etsy and many startups. So much, in fact, it's being taught by executive and management coaches around the world.</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/eliobed-suarez-PN-YnI5stdQ-unsplash.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p>

<p>The concept is quite simple: If we take a traffic light as a model, your 1-on-1 partner describes their mood as one of the colors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green</strong> means everything is OK, nothing that dampens the mood or blocks you from being near your peak. Let's talk.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow</strong> means so-so. Maybe things are stressful or there's an upcoming blocker. Let's discuss.</li>
<li><strong>Red</strong> is bad! The person is overwhelmed, blocked or is feeling terrible. Let's solve this.</li>
</ul>
<p>An alternative form of this is to collect topics and assign them to each of the colors, for example, <strong>green</strong> describes all the things that were great,&nbsp;<strong>yellow</strong> includes discussion topics that could have gone better and&nbsp;<strong>red</strong> are priority discussion points about things that failed.</p>

<h3>Skip-level meetings</h3>
<p>A skip-level meeting "skips" one layer of responsibility and is usually conducted with the person's manager's manager or even a head of department or CEO.</p>
<p>For remote teams, this can be a great irregular thing to schedule. On one side, employees have the possibility to discuss wider changes and bring up interesting ideas, while managers and executives have a more direct line to the culture and issues of their sub-reports.</p>
<p>Skip-level meetings are usually not done more than once per year per 1-on-1 combination, for leaders, however, it can be a good idea to schedule these monthly or even bi-weekly to have a deeper look into different teams.</p>

<h3>Goal and growth conversations</h3>
<p>A growth (or goal) conversation is different from the regular 1-on-1 check-ins as that it's designed to be a more formal evaluation and discussion. Other than the more traditional performance evaluation, it's a discussion around goals, current progress and growth.</p>
<p>As such, it doesn't have much influence on things like salaries or promotions but instead can help to improve employee satisfaction. In fact, <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/books/career-development-and-job-satisfaction/career-development-an-enabler-for-job-satisfaction">research shows</a> that the major reason for employee satisfaction boils down to career development, so it's something that shouldn't be dismissed.</p>
<p>Growth conversations happen more often than traditional evaluations – usually every quarter up to once per month – and help answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is my short-term goal?</li>
<li>Did I reach my goal last time?</li>
<li>What stopped/enabled me to reach my goal?</li>
<li>What is my big goal for the next year?</li>
<li>What is my progress in reaching that?</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the situation, these conversations can be difficult. For ambitious employees, however, they could be the main driver in motivation, engagement, loyalty and retention.</p>

<h2>7 Tips for better 1-on-1 meetings</h2>
<p>When it comes to 1-on-1 meetings, learning by doing is the keyword. Even if you don't have a plan for them, to start today is to begin the investment in retention and loyalty.</p>
<p>Before you go, though, we hope that these practical tips can help you get started with better 1-on-1 meetings.</p>

<h3>1. Start with an agenda</h3>
<p>It's good practice to set up a way for you and your meeting partner to build an <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/remote-meeting-best-practices/">agenda before the call</a>. Some popular methods to do so are Google Docs and <a href="https://nohq.co/tools/todoist/">Todoist</a>, where projects can be shared between two people.</p>
<p>The great part – simple to solve questions can be solved in writing even before the meeting and when it comes to harder discussions, your meeting partner can prepare for those beforehand. It also helps to keep meetings running smoothly and ending on time.</p>

<h3>2. Stick to a type of meeting</h3>
<p>A little earlier in this post, we described a few popular meeting techniques. While you can tweak meetings and even switch them around, it's usually good to stick to a certain interval and meeting form for a while, to make sure it works out.</p>
<p>Sticking to something for a while helps both of you to settle into a certain flow and helps with evaluating how good something works.</p>

<h3>3. Keep async stuff away</h3>
<p>In the first point, we talked about getting simple questions out of the way early through your agenda. Your agenda items should be evaluated whether they <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/making-asynchronous-communication-work/">should have been an email</a> – or a message – instead.</p>
<p>For example, it feels natural to give a status update during these meetings and checking in whether everything is on track. However, it's a better practice to write this down somewhere and have it recorded – so it can be crossed away from the meeting agenda.</p>
<p>Instead, the meeting should include socialization, talking about emotional topics and hashing out difficult discussions.</p>

<h3>4. Stay consistent</h3>
<p>As with anything, consistency is key! As you go into this new form of collaboration, give yourself the challenge to keep up with it for a few months or even a year.</p>
<p>It's important to keep each other accountable, so pick a specific timeslot, reserve a calendar block and don't make these optional. While some of them can be skipped, it shouldn't become the norm.</p>

<h3>5. Take notes</h3>
<p>Taking notes during the discussion can help you recall information, go back to previous meetings and find patterns and also help you to digest the information on the next day.</p>
<p>Hopefully, good notes can help you read between the lines and see recurring themes that are being discussed again and again.</p>

<h3>6. Build action items</h3>
<p>We all love homework, don't we! For 1-on-1 meetings, however, it could be a good idea to set agenda items and to-dos for the next meeting already, so-called action items.</p>
<p>These action items are usually not about the core work, but instead about the topics that were discussed – specific thoughts about growths or an issue that has been cumbersome for a few weeks.</p>

<h3>7. Run regular retrospectives</h3>
<p>1-on-1s are never set in stone! The great part about running these small meetings is that changes can happen quickly and easily – so, if anything doesn't work for you about these 1-on-1 meetings, change it! Be it timing, frequency, agenda or format, let none of it undiscovered!</p>

November 21, 2020 | https://eugeneyan.com/writing/netlify-back-to-github-pages/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://eugeneyan.com/writing/netlify-back-to-github-pages/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A week ago, I was looking for something to tinker with over the weekend. I ended up switching my site hosting from GitHub Pages to Netlify.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.netlify.com/github-pages-vs-netlify/">comparison was compelling</a>. I was appealed by the 1-click rollbacks, ability to use more Jekyll plug-ins, and A/B testing my site (fun!).</p>
<p>However, I switched back to GitHub Pages today. Why?</p>
<h2 id="my-mx-records-werent-migrated-automatically">My MX records werenâ€™t migrated automatically</h2>
<p>(MX records are DNS records for delivery email to your address.)</p>
<p>When I switched my DNS servers to Netlify, it was pretty painless: Update the DNS name servers, provision the cert, and weâ€™re good to go.</p>
<p>However, I didnâ€™t realize that my MX records werenâ€™t automatically migrated as well. (When I previously moved to Cloudflare, this was taken care of).</p>
<p>As a result, emails to my domain bounced for a few days before I noticed. Thankfully, people reached out via other channels to inform me of it.</p>
<h2 id="adding-mx-records-on-the-dns-provider-was-a-pain">Adding MX records on the DNS provider was a pain</h2>
<p>Trying to add the MX records with the DNS provider, NS1, was a pain.</p>
<p>I had to create an account with NS1 and provide them with credit card details. (Update: Was charged $2 within a day; will enquire why).</p>
<p>Then, I had to set up a â€œZoneâ€� to attach the MX records. However, when I tried setting up the zone for my domain, it was not allowed as the domain already exists. Probably from the Netlify integration.</p>
<p>I spent some time trying to figure this out. I also asked some Netlify folks. Turns out that while they use Netlify to host their site, they use other DNS providers (instead of NS1).</p>
<h2 id="adding-the-custom-certificate-didnt-work">Adding the custom certificate didnâ€™t work</h2>
<p>By now, Iâ€™ve switched my DNS provider back to Cloudflare, and added the Cloudflare Origin cert to my Netlify app. (I really wanted to continue using Netlify.)</p>
<p>However, I soon got complaints that people couldnâ€™t access my site due to the error: â€œPeerâ€™s Certificate issuer is not recognized.â€�. I faced the same issue too. Iâ€™m not sure where the issue lies (cert or host) but I had lost patience by now.</p>
<h2 id="another-gotcha-300-build-minutes-monthly">Another gotcha: 300 build minutes monthly</h2>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.netlify.com/github-pages-vs-netlify/">GitHub Pages vs Netlify comparison</a> indicates that both are free, with Netlify being superior at 3 builds a minute, it leaves out one major gotcha: On the free tier, Netlify only provides 300 minutes of build time monthly. AFAIK, GitHub Pages has no limitations.</p>
<p>For someone who frequently adds and tweaks content, and mucks around with the CSS and whatnot, 300 minutes didnâ€™t last long.</p>
<p>On its own, this limitation would have been bearableâ€”I figured I would try to be more frugal. But the DNS issues broke the camelâ€™s back.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-github-pages">Back to GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>Now, Iâ€™m back to hosting on GitHub Pages and merrily pushing updates as inspiration strikes. Previously, I was checking the build minutes remaining ever so often.</p>
<p>I guess Iâ€™ll have to do without the fancy Jekyll plug-ins, 3 builds/min, and A/B testing for now. In return, I get peace of mind.</p>

<p><em>Edit: Thank you to the 80k people who have read this piece. It looks like many people are struggling with the concept of "greatness". Let's continue to support one another on the journey there. </em></p><p>Over the years, we’ve all encountered our fair share of successes and failures. As I’ve acquired more of both under my name, I’ve started to contemplate which experiences were truly “great” and why.</p><p>Interestingly enough, I realized that it was not the sporadic highs that were exceptional, but instead the long hauls; the sequences of events that seemed minimal at each juncture, but compounded into major gains. This led me to think further about what <em>greatness</em> truly means. I’ve come to learn that it’s not about overnight successes or flashes of excellence, but periods of repeatable habits.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Perhaps “great’, is just “good”, but repeatable. </strong></em></blockquote><h2 id="consider-this">Consider This</h2><p>Before stepping into the bulk of this article, I want to clarify two things:</p><ul><li>Greatness is not instantaneous</li><li>Greatness is earned</li></ul><p>The first step in becoming great is recognizing that you’re likely not already great. In fact, it comes from recognizing that there is no such thing as greatness at a specific instance in time. Greatness is instead a reflection of a period of effort, since greatness in a single instance can be reduced to luck. </p><p>Moreover, being “great” is not about being better than someone else. It is about being dependable and disciplined, and ultimately it is earned. </p><p>Many people, in theory, want to be “great”. In fact, each month 1000 people search “how to be great”, 260 people search “how to become perfect”, and 2400 people search “how to be the best”, looking for discrete answers on how to get from 0 to 1. Yet, many people in life realistically do not want to put in the effort over a sustained period of time to actually get to 1. They are looking for the “secrets to success” that in many ways, do not exist. You know what brings success? Hard work brings success. </p><p>So before proceeding forward in this article, I implore each of you to consider that if greatness truly is a reflection of non-instantaneous, earned effort, ask yourself if that’s the life you’d like to live. Ask yourself whether you’d like to spend your days, weeks, months, and years in a constant uphill battle. </p><p>If you ultimately find that you don’t want to do that, that’s fine! It doesn’t make you less of a person. At least you’ve broken from the holding pattern of thinking you want to do X but not understanding why you haven’t gotten there yet. And if that’s the case, go enjoy your Netflix and chill completely guilt-free.</p><p>With that in mind, let’s dive into what truly makes someone “great’. </p><h2 id="it-s-hard-to-be-consistent">It’s Hard to be Consistent</h2><p>There’s a false impression that success or notoriety comes with being flashy. This notion comes from the media focusing on outliers, whether it be events or personalities which diverge from the norm. Not only can this encourage people to aim for notoriety just for the sake of it (think Elizabeth Holmes), but it makes the rest of us believe that correlation (of those outliers) is causation; in other words, success of those individuals is due to their offbeat ways. But here’s another storyline: the most sure and therefore the <em>best</em> way to “success” is through consistency.</p><blockquote><em>“Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.”</em> - James Clear, <a href="https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ">Atomic Habits</a></blockquote><p>To be clear, consistency isn’t necessarily the easiest way to success, but one that can be achieved with a higher level of certainty, rather than hoping for a lottery win or someone to “discover” you. Continuous effort is a more thoughtful approach that leads to greatness when the following statements are true:</p><ol><li>Inputs are consistent over time</li><li>Intentional inputs lead to expected outputs</li></ol><h3 id="consistency">Consistency<br></h3><blockquote><em>“No one who can rise before dawn three hundred sixty days a year fails to make his family rich”</em> - <a href="https://amzn.to/2Fcnn4K">Outliers</a></blockquote><p>There is a famous saying from Napolean Hill which says, <em>“If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way”</em>. I would actually argue the quote should be, <em>“If you cannot do great things, do small things a great number of times”.</em></p><p>If you don’t have the opportunity to “do great things”, focus on consistently achieving small wins. These small things in fact do not need to be done in a great way, but a good way, repeatably. In fact, I would advise not to focus on perfection, as it is often the enemy of the successful. </p><p>There’s glimmer and hoopla around unpredictability, but in reality, it’s much more difficult and therefore impressive, to be predictably good. For example:</p><ul><li>It’s easy to wake up whenever you “feel like it”. </li><li>It’s hard to stick to a routine of getting up at 6AM.</li><li>It’s easy to pivot from side project to side project, focusing on the new shiny object of the month.</li><li>It’s hard to stick with a side project for years, many of which may not be profitable for a long while. </li><li>It’s easy to give up on someone when you hit a roadblock or the next potential partner becomes available. </li><li>It’s hard to be faithful and invest in a relationship for decades.</li></ul><p>We normally set out in life with good intentions. We <em>intend</em> to set a morning routine or work on a business until it's profitable or to “love someone forever”. We imagine that as we invest in something, we will naturally continue to move in the right direction. If anything, things will get easier, right?</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NQV_7RXfM2ZYDJsT4E4JAaAW2i9KphrB7-fE8XveJlrW-Msf1aIot9ayls-wSCWIroq155Fzdz6vE3d8br71E6Tc5sTQRyhnT0Zb6EJCUoV41B5EoZSczjtWcHo9KV-T9c6s16Cb"></figure><p>The described trajectory is what we perceive on the left. Predictable, linear, and a direct reflection of effort put in. </p><p><strong>Rarely does success in anything look like that.</strong> Life is a series of tiny nodes that tend to look more like the right hand side. There two key elements worth calling out in the more realistic graph on the right:</p><ul><li>Compounding is always present. The earlier steps in any process will be more strenuous, yet it’s difficult to imagine the potential compounding that comes later on. </li><li>With the ups, there are always downs. This seems obvious, but we often forget this when we are in periods of down. We quit at these local minimums (the highlighted sections in red above), because we cannot see the next peak right around the corner. </li></ul><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>a friend just emailed me this note in response to my 'burn out' video. wanted to share;</p><p>'the addiction to having success is what makes you feel unsuccessful at the times when you're not feeling the immediate dopamine hit of your work 'succeeding' at that precise moment.'</p></div>— Casey Neistat (@Casey) <a href="https://twitter.com/Casey/status/1093520669286064133?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have lost our ability to appreciate delayed gratification and, some of us who struggle with perfectionism, can either create repeatedly until we ‘get it right’ never truly feeling fulfilled with our work, or, we avoid creating all together in fear of failing.</p>— Marcio Novelli (@MarcioNovelli) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcioNovelli/status/1093522120536150017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>The local minima are especially psychologically taxing due to something called the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill">Hedonic treadmill</a> or hedonic adaptation. Essentially, as someone achieves new successes in various aspects of their lives, their baseline shifts to reflect that new level and therefore, their expectations and desires are re-established as well. There is no net gain in happiness and thus, it becomes even more difficult to stay “level-headed” during these down moments. </p><p>That is exactly why a specific search for success can be problematic and instead of looking for unsustainable shortcuts in life, it’s much more effective (and healthy) to aim for continuous habits that bring you success as a byproduct, not as the end goal.</p><blockquote><em>“The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.” - <a href="https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ">Atomic Habits</a>, James Clear</em></blockquote><p>On your journey to greatness, you need to fall in love with the process which includes many local minima and maxima. Staying consistent and pushing through both of these continuously is what will truly differentiate you from those that are simply “good” and isolate you as one of the few that are “great’.</p><h3 id="inputs-outputs">Inputs → Outputs</h3><p>The second important aspect of achieving greatness is acting with intention. Your actions and results will not always reflect your intentions, but as you move towards “greatness”, you should have a better idea of what inputs actually deliver output. You’ll still make mistakes﹣as we all do﹣but you’ll have a better grasp on what is more likely to work out. For example, your success rate may be 30%, versus someone flying blind with a 5% success rate. </p><p>Let’s look at a simple example:</p><p>Imagine company X has two sales people. Salesperson A happens to land a $1M deal in his first week. However, he struggles to land anything substantial for the next 6 months. Meanwhile, salesperson B manages to develop a process over the first month, bringing in only $100k which he’s able to scale up and double month over month.</p><p>After six months, this will be the revenue generated by each party.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.stephsmith.io/content/images/2019/05/image-5.png"></figure><p>You’re probably thinking… "So what? That’s just a classic example of compounding." </p><p>Yes! That’s exactly the point. The best things in life often aren’t miracles, but well-thought out approaches that are sustainable. The same thing is true with businesses, marriages, and just about anything with repeatable elements. If you invest time into solving for what leads to success continuously, you will reap those benefits for years to come. <em>So even in the least quantifiable situations, reflect back on what could’ve made a previous loss a future win. </em></p><p>Consider the best companies over time. None of them emerged overnight, nor was there a single inflection point that determined the success or notoriety of these companies. The line of separation between the “great” companies of all time and the “not so great”, is their ability to stand the test of time. </p><p>Would you rather be Juicero that <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/juicero">raised $100M</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/01/rip-juicero-the-400-venture-backed-juice-machine/">went bankrupt</a> within a year of its Series C, or Zoom, which <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zoom-video-communications/funding_rounds/funding_rounds_list#section-funding-rounds">took almost 8 years to take on more funding than $30M</a> and is now one of the most profitable and highly sought after “unicorns” in the valley?</p><p>On top of consistency, greatness comes from asking the right questions and iterating to learn what …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

    <p>To capture your ideas and turn them into tangible products, mind mapping software is a must. During the brainstorming process, ideas happen quickly, and if not appropriately tracked, can become overwhelming.
There are many reasons that mind mapping software is the best solution for this. To fully understand the benefit it can provide to your organization, it’s best to explore the concept of mind mapping and how it helps bring projects to life.</p>

<h2>The concept of mind mapping</h2>
<p>The concept of mind mapping stems from extracting useful ideas and developing links between them. During the brainstorming process ideas flow freely, but sometimes connections are not immediately noticeable. This makes the process of putting these ideas together and creating plan for an entire project extremely difficult. This is where mind mapping plays a critical role.</p>
<p>The best way to describe a mind map is a hierarchical tree is it shows a natural progression between ideas. A mind map separates a project into modular components and then breaks those down into even more specific tasks.</p>
<h2>What is mind mapping software?</h2>
<p>Although mind-mapping is possible by hand, utilizing mind mapping software is a modern and more refined way to get the job done. Utilizing these mind mapping tools enables a project leader to visualize and build out their projects. Generating a mind map by hand can take quite a bit of time, so specialized mind mapping apps condense the process and streamline delivery.</p>
<h2>Best mind mapping software to improve your productivity</h2>
<p>Within the software world, many mind mapping solutions exist. It isn’t difficult to find software for any platform, including the cloud.

<h2>How to pick a mind map tool</h2>
<p>To pick the best mind mapping tool for your unique situation, there are a few factors that should be considered. Depending on your individual needs, you may find that some software lacks a few essential items that are critical for your purposes.
Here are the major factors that should play into your decision.</p>
<div>
    <h3>Team access</h3>
    <p>If you are working on a project that requires multiple team members to access mind maps and edit them simultaneously, you’ll need to consider this. Some mind mapping software does not allow for real-time editing, although it’s supported in most. If you need this feature, then consider Miro or Coggle.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>More than mind maps</h3>
    <p>If you plan on doing more than just mind-mapping for your project, you’ll need to keep this in mind when picking a mind mapping software. While all of the aforementioned software is excellent for mind mapping, some options stand out and are exemplary for other tasks and different diagram types. Mind Meister and Coggle allow for unparalleled customization of charts.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Integrations</h3>
    <p>If you intend to integrate your mind maps into social media or utilize existing technologies—such as Google Drive or Microsoft 365—you’ll need to make sure it’s supported with the mind mapping software you choose. Two excellent options for this are Mindmup and Miro.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Supported platforms</h3>
    <p>You’ll also need to consider which platforms are supported by each type of mind mapping software. If your organization is primarily Apple-based, you’ll need to select mind mapping software compatible with Mac. Your best bet is to choose an option that is cloud-based so it works across all platforms and devices.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Budget</h3>
    <p>Your last consideration will be your budget for mind mapping software. If you have a complex set of projects that need many detailed diagrams, you’ll need to make sure that you select a software option that fits with your budget and allows you the mind maps you need.</p>
</div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, there are many different types of mind mapping software available that fit a variety of needs. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, so it’s best to make a list of your needs, and then start shopping to find the mind mapping software for you.
A great place to start would be to select a few of the options that offer free plans, and start creating a mind map focused on selecting the best mind mapping software. This will give you a real-world view of the features so you can select the software solution that’s right for you.</p>

<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/poi">Poi 0.18</a> is released!</p>

<p>In this blog post I will discuss the new Levenshtein heuristic used in Poi.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/advancedresearch/advancedresearch.github.io/master/images/lev.png" alt="Levenshtein distance"></p>

<p><em>The Levenshtein distance measures minimum single-character changes between two strings.<br>
It is named after Vladimir Levenshtein, which considered this distance in 1965 (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Wikipedia</a>)</em></p>

<h3 id="why-automated-theorem-proving-is-hard">Why automated theorem proving is hard</h3>

<p>Automated theorem proving is hard for the same reason the boardgame chess is hard.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number">The Shannon number</a> is a conservative lower bound
of the game-tree complexity of chess: 10^120.
This is more than the number of atoms in the observable universe.</p>

<p>However, in automated theorem proving, the complexity is sometimes countable infinity.
With other words, if one tries to search the whole space of possible proofs, the program will run forever.</p>

<h3 id="heuristic-measurements">Heuristic measurements</h3>

<p>In order to prioritize search of possible proofs, one needs a heuristic.</p>

<p>Here, the word “heuristic” means the same as e.g. using utility to optimize course of action for AI agents.
In fact, an automated theorem prover is very much alike an AI agent, except there are no interactions with an environment.
The automated theorem prover usually lives in a world with “perfect information”, aka chess.
However, there is no opponent. Instead, the “opponent” is the complexity of math itself.</p>

<p>The following properties was desirable when choosing a heuristic measurement for Poi:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reaches minimum value when reaching goal</li>
  <li>Smooth gradient when getting closer to the goal</li>
  <li>Rule agnostic</li>
  <li>Easy to maintain</li>
</ul>

<p>My first idea of how this heuristic should look like,
was something that used sub-expressions matching with the goal.</p>

<p>I was thinking about how difficult this would be to code.</p>

<p>Then, I realized that I was thinking too complicated: Why not use strings instead of expressions?</p>

<h3 id="levenshtein-distance">Levenshtein distance</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">The Levenshtein distance</a> is the minimum number of
single-character edits required to transform one string into another string.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>lev("a + b", "c + d") = 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is because you only need to replace <code>a</code> with <code>c</code> and <code>b</code> with <code>d</code> in the first string to get the second string.</p>

<p>The Levenshtein distance also allows adding and removing characters, but not swapping them.</p>

<p>At first sight, it might seem a bit hacky to use strings this way,
when we are talking about a theorem prover which uses complex expressions behind the scenes.</p>

<p>However: It satisfies all the properties I mentioned above!</p>

<p>For example, an alternative could be to use machine learning,
which would become gradually better at assisting the theorem prover over time.
In this case, you would probably use strings, bytes or numbers to feed the neural network.
Would you consider this to be a hacky solution too?</p>

<p>I am interested in hearing what people think about what they consider a hacky heuristic versus a more robust heuristic.</p>

<p>So, why not just use a simple string algorithm?
After thinking about this, I decided to go for it, because I could not figure out any rational reason to not do it.</p>

<h3 id="try-first-learn-afterwards">Try first, learn afterwards</h3>

<p>How did I figure out whether Levenshtein distance was the right heuristic to use?</p>

<p>I simply added <a href="https://crates.io/crates/levenshtein">levenshtein</a> to the Cargo.toml
and coded for a few hours: Turned out that it works pretty well.</p>

<p>It took a couple iterations to get it right.
At first, the algorithm just picked the minimum Levenshtein distance from unreduced equivalences.
This worked surprisingly well, but more testing revealed that this algorithm was not sound.</p>

<p>I ended up with using <code>std::collections::{BinaryHeap, HashSet}</code> instead,
picking the minimum Levenshtein distance across all sub-proofs found so far.
This algorithm fixes the soundness problem, but uses a lot of memory.</p>

<p>Only after getting it working, I learned more about the theory behind Levenshtein distance in detail.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts-about-the-design">Thoughts about the design</h3>

<p>Since Levenshtein is not very good at strings where substrings are swapped,
I believe it will perform less well on commutative operators.</p>

<p>However, I believe that using the normal exhaustive search up to some depth,
will resolve some of the issues with commutativity.</p>

<p>The problem is how to deal with large expressions and lots of commutative operators, e.g. addition.
In this case, increasing the depth of exhaustive search will lead to significant slowdown.</p>

<p>One approach to solving this problem, is to assist the automated theorem prover by designing proper utility rules.</p>

<p>This is something I am testing now, by designing worst-case proofs and doing some experiments.</p>

<h3 id="utility-rules">Utility rules</h3>

<p>Utility rules are rules that can be proved from existing rules, e.g.:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x0 + x1 + x2 + x3 &lt;=&gt; x0 + x3 + x2 + x1;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The expression <code>x0 + x1 + x2 + x3</code> is constructed similarly to a linked list (sort of).</p>

<p>The left-most term <code>x0</code> functions as a “tail” that pattern matches anywhere in the expression.
Keeping the left-most term fixed on both sides makes it possible to manipulate the expression at any depth,
instead of manipulating only at the leafs.</p>

<p>This is important when there are long chains of commutative operators,
because it avoids transformations via tree-like structures, which requires many more steps.</p>

<p>Although you can in principle prove the same using <code>a + b &lt;=&gt; b + a</code> only,
the automated theorem prover can not look that many steps ahead to make a realistic estimate using the Levenshtein distance.</p>

<h3 id="future-improvements">Future improvements</h3>

<p>In one test run I am running while writing this blog post, Poi uses 500 MiB of memory.</p>

<p>I might replace <code>HashSet</code> with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo_filter">Cuckoo filter</a> (an improved Bloom filter) in the future,
in order to lower memory usage.</p>

<p>Also, I would like a replacement for <code>BinaryHeap</code> which uses less memory.</p>

<p>Thinking a bit about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">Trie</a> or finite state machines, as in the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/fst">fst</a> crate.</p>

<p>The problem is, I need to pop the minimum sorted by some numeric key.</p>

<p>Basically, I want something behaving like <code>BinaryHeap</code>, but more efficient for strings.</p>

<p>A minor improvement in performance could be to reuse the cache used in the Levenshtein algorithm.</p>

<p>At this stage, I am mostly focusing on testing that things work,
but in the future I might be focusing to how long time it takes to complete the proof search.
I have not decided yet whether the REPL should have built-in benchmarks or whether the REPL code should be refactored for running external benchmarks.</p>

<p>Allegedly “Kernel Text Readonly Region”.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>This post tries to detail the mechanism used in Apple’s A10 chips and later to prevent modification of an iOS kernel at runtime.<br>
Older chips attempt to do this via a monitor program loaded in EL3, which is inherently flawed and bypassable though as detailed in <a href="https://xerub.github.io/ios/kpp/2017/04/13/tick-tock.html">“Tick Tock” by xerub</a>.</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<p>On some sites you’ll see the term “memory-mapped registers” being thrown around. To avoid confusion I will not use that term, but instead:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Register” to mean actual registers such as those accessed by the arm64 <code>msr</code> instruction. Each CPU core has its own copy of such registers, and the values held by them will be lost when the core goes to sleep.</li>
  <li>“MMIO” (memory-mapped I/O) to mean a portion of the physical address that can be used to interact with a device on the SoC. Like regular RAM, this is global to the entire SoC and does not lose its values when any core goes to sleep, as it is a separate device.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also note that code shown here will often have been shortened, expanding or removing macros that are assumed to be defined (<code>KERNEL_INTEGRITY_KTRR</code>, <code>MACH_BSD</code>, <code>__arm64__</code>) or not (<code>DEVELOPMENT</code>, <code>DEBUG</code>).</p>

<h3 id="primitives">Primitives</h3>

<p>Besides abandoning EL3 altogether (leaving only EL1 and EL0), A10 chips introduce two new hardware features that serve as the corner stones for KTRR:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“RoRgn”<br>
A piece of MMIO consisting of a “start”, “end” and “lock” fields. The “lock” field, when   written to, will lock down all three fields, i.e. prevent any modification of them. The start and end fields hold numbers of pages in DRAM, spanning up the RoRgn. Inside this region, the memory controller will reject any and all attempted writes.<br>
XNU has three macros to refer to them:
    <div><div><pre><code><span>#define rRORGNBASEADDR (*(volatile uint32_t *) (amcc_base + 0x7e4))
#define rRORGNENDADDR  (*(volatile uint32_t *) (amcc_base + 0x7e8))
#define rRORGNLOCK     (*(volatile uint32_t *) (amcc_base + 0x7ec))
</span></code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>“KTRR registers”<br>
A set of three registers added to every CPU core, holding “low”, “high” and “lock” values respectively. The lock register, again, locks all three down. The low and high registers hold physical addresses, spanning up the executable range. If the CPU is at EL1 and the MMU is turned on, then any instruction fetch (i.e. trying to execute memory) outside of that range will fail, even if it is marked as executable in the page table. If the CPU is at EL0 or if the MMU is turned off, this range has no effect.<br>
For those too, XNU has macros:
    <div><div><pre><code><span>#define ARM64_REG_KTRR_LOWER_EL1                        S3_4_c15_c2_3
#define ARM64_REG_KTRR_UPPER_EL1                        S3_4_c15_c2_4
#define ARM64_REG_KTRR_LOCK_EL1                         S3_4_c15_c2_2
</span></code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Also it is worth mentioning another feature that was present in past chips already, but is set up differently now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“IORVBAR”<br>
A piece of MMIO holding one field for every CPU, designating the physical address at which it will start executing on “reset” (basically when waking from sleep). This too has a locking mechanism, which is activated by writing to it a value that as its least significant bit set to 1.<br>
On A9 CPUs and earlier this was set to a physical address inside TrustZone, where WatchTower (KPP) resides. Since A10, this is set to <code>LowResetVectorBase</code> as found in XNU, which iBoot calculates from the kernel’s entry point as outlined by this comment:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code><span>/*
 * __start trampoline is located at a position relative to LowResetVectorBase
 * so that iBoot can compute the reset vector position to set IORVBAR using
 * only the kernel entry point.  Reset vector = (__start &amp; ~0xfff)
 */</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="in-theory">In theory</h3>

<p>The above primitives are virtually unbreakable due to their locking mechanism, but do by themselves not protect a running kernel. In order to look at what else is needed, we have to look a potential attacks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>(Asserted:) The primitives need to actually uphold what they promise.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to disable any protections or choose to not enable them, thus they must be set up and locked down before the attacker can gain code execution.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to patch any data you consider critical, so all of it needs to be inside the RoRgn. This sounds obvious in theory, but in practise a bunch of critical things are easily overlooked.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to patch page tables that are used to map memory from the RoRgn, otherwise they can copy said memory to a writeable location and patch page tables to point there instead. Such page tables must thus be inside the RoRgn themselves.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to employ a custom page table hierarchy, so the translation table base register that maps the kernel’s half of the address space (<code>ttbr1_el1</code> in this case) must be unchangeable.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to patch or inject any executable memory, otherwise they could add the instruction <code>msr ttbr1_el1, x0</code> and gain the ability to change <code>ttbr1_el1</code>. Therefore the “executable range” must be a strict subset of the RoRgn.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to turn off the MMU, since when the MMU is off all pages are considered executable and an attacker could again inject <code>msr ttbr1_el1, x0</code>. The MMU status is controlled by the least significant bit of the register <code>sctlr_el1</code>, so said register must to be unchangeable as well during normal operation.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to gain code execution before the MMU is turned on (for afore mentioned reasons). Since a CPU starts out with the MMU turned off when it wakes from sleep, this means IORVBAR must point to memory within the RoRgn, and any code executed before the MMU is turned on must not have its control flow controlled by data outside the RoRgn.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="in-practice">In practice</h3>

<p>So let’s examine how iOS implements all of the above:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>IORVBAR is the first primitive to be fully set up, done so by iBoot before it jumps to the kernel’s entry point. Loaded and locked down all in one go.<br>
RoRgn gets its start and end values set by iBoot as well, but is not locked down yet. This is necessary because a lot of the data that is later readonly actually needs one-time initialisation, which is done by the kernel itself. I’ll skip over most kernel bootstrapping here, but after setting up virtual memory and all const data including kexts, we arrive at <code>kernel_bootstrap_thread</code>, part of which reads:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code><span>machine_lockdown_preflight</span><span>();</span>

    <p>The first thing we’re interested in is <code>machine_lockdown_preflight</code>, which is just a wrapper around <code>rorgn_stash_range</code> that grabs the values computed by iBoot, translates them to physical addresses and stahes them in RoRgn memory for later:</p>
    <div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>rorgn_stash_range</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>

    <p>Next, <code>arm_vm_prot_finalize</code> patches page tables for the main kernel binary one last time before they become readonly, removing the writeable flag from all const and code regions.<br>
And then, right before <code>bsd_init</code> there is a call to <code>machine_lockdown</code>, which is a wrapper around <code>rorgn_lockdown</code>. This call seems to have been <code>#ifdef</code>‘ed out of public sources, but if we compare a few functions to some disassembly, it’s evident a call to <code>machine_lockdown</code> was inlined there:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
                                <p>An overview of the ECS system scheduling problem, the constraints a
prospective solution should consider, and a pair of algorithm examples.</p>
<p><em>This article is written within the context of Rust language ecosystem and
describes concepts mostly relevant to ECS (entity-component-system).
However, no knowledge of the ECS paradigm, Rust's ecosystem, or even Rust
language is necessary for understanding its ideas and conclusions.</em></p>

<p>Behavior of an ECS program is described by one or several "systems" -
the "S" part of ECS - functions that operate on the shared data contained within
the "EC" part.
ECS paradigm is used almost exclusively in the context of game and engine
programming, with some set of systems the program contains normally running
every "frame" - a pre-determined time interval, not necessarily tied to the
video frame rate.
The amount of time required for all systems in a set to finish their work for
the frame can be referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makespan">makespan</a> of the set.</p>
<p>The time a single system needs in order to be done for the frame is usually
not known beforehand, because it usually scales with the data the system
operates on.
Said data can change at runtime, often through user input.</p>
<p>For performance's sake - to minimize the makespan - it's sometimes desirable to
have several of these systems executed at the same time, in parallel.
In practice, however, systems often operate on intersecting sets of data,
which necessitates the use of some kind of synchronization mechanism.</p>
<p>Said mechanism can't be a simple lock over the shared data, since that would
force the execution of systems to be sequential.
It can be several orthogonal locks, but that's not the most performant approach,
and runs the risk of deadlocking in a naive implementation.</p>
<p>A more popular solution is to employ a special algorithm - a "scheduler" -
that queues systems to run in a way that has better utilization of processing
resources (read: threads, since a thread can be running only one system at
a time) than running them sequentially, yet doesn't violate data access rules,
without the need for locks.
(In Rust these rules state that data may be changed from only one place
at a time, and data that may be changed elsewhere cannot be read.)
The problem of finding such an algorithm is closely related to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprocessor_scheduling">multiprocessor scheduling</a> problem; finding the optimal schedule for the
systems, assuming their run times are known, is always NP-hard.</p>
<p>For an ECS program to be schedulable it needs to be executable at least
sequentially, i.e. whatever constraints on system order execution it might have
must not contain cycles of dependencies - the systems must form an acyclic
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_graph">disjunctive graph</a>.
Execution order will be elaborated upon further in the article; for now, the
set  will be said to contain all such programs:</p>

<p>An ECS program  consisting of 
systems is further defined as such:</p>

<p>where  is an individual system, 
is the time it needs to complete its work, and 
is the set of data it operates on. Then, a scheduling
algorithm  is a mapping of  to
some schedule :</p>

<p>The makespan  is the optimal makespan for a
given ,  is the makespan
of , and  is the practical
worst-case makespan of executing all systems of  in
sequence:</p>

<p>The problem then can be stated as finding</p>

<p>and, ideally,</p>

<p>In this article, two systems are described as disjoint if running them in
parallel would not violate access rules,
i.e. .
If the rules would be violated, the systems are intersecting,
i.e. .</p>
<p>Disjointedness is not necessarily transitive. Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>system <code>0</code> with required access to <code>A</code></li>
<li>system <code>1</code> with <code>B</code></li>
<li>system <code>2</code> with <code>A</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Systems <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> are disjoint, systems <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> are disjoint, yet <code>0</code> and
<code>2</code> intersect; or, .</p>
<p>Likewise, intersection is also not necessarily transitive. Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>system <code>0</code> with required access to <code>A</code></li>
<li>system <code>1</code> with <code>A</code> and <code>B</code></li>
<li>system <code>2</code> with <code>B</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Systems <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> intersect, systems <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> intersect, yet <code>0</code> and <code>2</code>
are disjoint; or, .</p>

<p>The first instinct is to generate an execution schedule once, when the scheduler
is first defined and populated.
Even if doing so is NP-hard, it wouldn't be a constant cost, seeing as changes
to  are comparatively rare in practice, if there are any
at all.</p>
<p>One way or another, a sequence of sets of disjoint systems is produced; when
the schedule is executed, sets are iterated sequentially, and systems within
them are ran in parallel.
This can be thought of as a directional acyclic graph where nodes are the
implicit synchronization points between the sets, and edges are the systems and
connect the points in such a way that edges originating in one node all
terminate in the same other node.
Formally:</p>

<p>Since the run time of a system is usually not known at the point of schedule
creation, the schedule has to assume that all systems take equally long.
There is an obvious problem: run times are in no way guaranteed to be equal,
and often independently change during the program's operation.
This almost inevitably produces a situation where some systems in a disjoint
set take longer than the rest, reducing average resource utilization.</p>
<p>Assuming sufficient processing resources (all systems in a
set  can run in parallel at full performance),
the best-case makespan  of 
is the sum of  of the longest-running system in each
disjoint set:</p>

<p>Trivially, if all systems of  are disjoint:</p>

<p>(Naturally, all correct scheduling algorithms should be able to
produce  when applied to such .)</p>
<p>The first idea for alleviating the unknown time problem is to make the
time known.</p>
<p>The scheduler could ask its user to provide hints for the system run time,
be it manually, or via some automated benchmark framework.
However, anticipating all factors that might influence the run time is
impractical for most projects, so this approach would be feasible only for
programs with well-behaved, predictable time coefficients.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the scheduler could collect the run times of systems during
execution, picking up on any changes, and adjusting the schedule to maximize
utilization on the fly (making "static" a misnomer).
Potential volatility of the run time could thwart this approach: if a system
is recorded to take some amount of time to finish during this frame, it's not
guaranteed to not take a vastly different amount next frame, when the
measurement is actually used (in practice, persistently high volatility
between frames is uncommon).</p>
<p>The feasibility of pure  is further undermined by
requirements of certain kinds of ECS, most notably archetypal ECS - a subtype
distinct in the way it organizes data internally.
Without going into specifics: sometimes when the data in such an ECS changes
it also changes which systems are disjoint (this is what the phrase "world's
archetypes have changed" in the examples later in the article refers to).
To address that, the scheduler must partially rebuild its execution graph
whenever such a change occurs.
(Technically, it could also ignore this avenue for parallelization and instead
rely only on statically provable disjointedness; however, that still leaves it
with the unknown time problem.)</p>

<p>The idea of tweaking the schedule on the fly can be taken much further:
a scheduler could retain no static execution graph at all.</p>
<p>Such  would, instead, start
execution of whichever system, then find another one that is disjoint with
the one now running, then another that is disjoint with the two now running...
Once no systems can be started the scheduler simply waits for one of them to
finish; as soon as that happens, it checks again if more systems can now start.</p>
<p>This eliminates the biggest problem stemming from unknown run time of systems:
there are no implicit synchronization points, systems start as soon as
resources are available (access and threads).</p>
<p>However, the order in which systems start matters. Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>systems <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code></li>
<li><code>2</code> intersects <code>0</code> and <code>1</code></li>
<li><code>3</code> intersects <code>1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> are started first, <code>2</code> can start after both of them finish,
and <code>3</code> can start as soon as <code>0</code> finishes; <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> can run in parallel.</p>
<p>If <code>0</code> and <code>3</code> are started first, <code>1</code> can start after <code>3</code> finishes, and <code>2</code>
can start after <code>0</code> finishes, but <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> can't run in parallel.</p>
<p>This implies that a naive  implementation cannot be said
to always produce an optimal schedule.</p>

<p>An important but not yet elaborated upon property of
any  can be gleaned from its definition: it needs to
work for all .
In practice, these programs often impose additional requirements, which may
narrow the search space (the amount of valid schedules) the algorithm has to
contend with by constraining some of their systems to certain positions in the
schedule.</p>
<p>While these constraints may reduce the running time
of  itself, reducing the search space can potentially
exclude the optimal schedule, which, coupled with the fact that no constraint
can ever increase the search space, means that  is
either increased or not affected by any given constraint.</p>
<h2 id="thread-local-systems"><a href="#thread-local-systems" aria-label="Anchor link for: thread-local-systems">
    
    §§
    
</a>Thread-local systems</h2>
<p>Some systems may require being executed on the thread that defined them, due to
some of the system's internal data being thread-local (in Rust terms, <code>!Send</code>
and/or <code>!Sync</code>, depending on mutability of systems in a given implementation).</p>
<p>This requirement does not forbid parallelization: thread-agnostic systems (or
even systems local to different threads) may still run in parallel on other
threads.</p>
<p>While scheduling thread-local systems, it is only necessary to consider them in
the context of their threads - an obvious constraint.
The makespan of a program containing such systems has an additional lower
bound - it cannot be less than the greatest sum of execution time of systems
local to one thread:</p>

<p>where  is a set of all  local to
thread .</p>

    §§
    
</a>Thread-local data</h2>
<p>Some of the data managed by the ECS may only be accessed by its defining thread
(<code>!Sync</code> for strictly immutable data, otherwise  <code>!Send</code>).
This case is similar to thread-local systems, differing in one key way:
the thread-local data can be shared between several systems.</p>
<p>However, it's impossible to run those …</p></div></div>

The previous post received a lot of great feedback and it seems that people are interested in this topic, so I wanted to continue the series and expand upon another hardware debugging mechanism. For those who are unfamiliar, JTAG is a hardware level debugging mechanism that many embedded CPUs utilize, with this post I hope to explain how to approach JTAG from a reverse engineers perspective and provide some practical examples along the way.</p><h2 id="goals">Goals</h2><p>With this post, I hope to do the following:</p><ol><li>Explain how JTAG works</li><li>Demonstrate how to discover and utilize a JTAG port/interface on an unknown target</li><li>Provide an overview of some of the current OSS tools that can be used to interact with a JTAG interface</li><li>Utilize JTAG to extract firmware and debug a target</li></ol><p>Also, before I give an overview, I wanted to point out a few great resources for learning about JTAG</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/cyphunk/JTAGenum/wiki/Embedded-Analysis#jtag">Cyphunk’s Embedded Analysis Page</a></li><li><a href="https://www.fpga4fun.com/JTAG.html">FPGA4Fun JTAG Overview</a></li><li><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/69ac/07f94832ceb4d2344c9c2d2bc8fc04e68124.pdf?_ga=2.81325524.238759085.1584580795-2049975628.1584580795">Blackbox JTAG Reverse Engineering</a></li></ul><h2 id="jtag-overview">JTAG Overview</h2><p>JTAG is a hardware interface that was developed to assist developers and testers with low level debugging. JTAG was originally developed for testing integrated circuits and more specifically, sampling IO pins on a target under test. This type of debugging interface allows engineers to test connections on PCBs without needing the probe the physical pin itself. The JTAG interface is controlled via the state machine outlined below:</p><p><img data-src="http://openocd.org/doc-release/doxygen/jtag-state-machine-large.png" alt="JTAG State Machine" src="http://openocd.org/doc-release/doxygen/jtag-state-machine-large.png"></p><p>One of the important things to remember about JTAG at this level is that it involves two registers, the instruction register, and the data register. To utilize these registers, the proper states in the above state machine must be entered using the following interface signals:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Line</th><th>Usage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>TMS</td><td>This pin is used to navigate and control the JTAG state machine</td></tr><tr><td>TDI</td><td>Input pin, used to write data to the target</td></tr><tr><td>TDO</td><td>Output pin, Used to read data back out from the target</td></tr><tr><td>TCK</td><td>Used to determine when data is sampled for all inputs and outputs</td></tr><tr><td>TRST (Optional)</td><td>This pin can be used to reset the state machine to the starting state</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The state machine is navigated using the TMS and TCK lines, while data is written to or read from via TDI and TDO respectively. TMS is sampled on the rising edge of TCK, meaning that the TMS line must be asserted before TCK is toggled to navigate through the state machine. Data is then shifted into the instruction register (IR) or data register (DR) depending on the state of the JTAG state machine. When an operation is completed (or after the update DR/IR phase) the resulting data can be <em>shifted</em> out of DR by entering the <code>Shift-DR</code> state. With these primitives in place, manufacturers can implement whatever features they wish over JTAG.</p><p>The JTAG standard treats IR and DR as shift registers, and due to this, multiple targets can be daisy-chained together.</p><p><img data-src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Jtag_chain.svg/654px-Jtag_chain.svg.png" alt="JTAG Daisy Chain" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Jtag_chain.svg/654px-Jtag_chain.svg.png"></p><p>In a nutshell, JTAG defines a state machine that is navigated with a minimum of 4 signals. With this state machine in place, end users can write and read from two shift registers, IR and DR.</p><h3 id="jtag-registers">JTAG Registers</h3><p>JTAG utilizes two main registers, the instruction register, and the data register. The instruction register is used to determine what function the JTAG controller is about to carry out such as a memory read, or memory write for example. The data register is then used as an additional input to the instruction register, for the previous example, they may be used to provide an address to read from or write to. These registers can vary in size based on their function.</p><p>To write to a register one would perform the following steps, we’ll use the IR as an example:</p><ol><li>Enter <code>Test Logic Reset</code> state (TLR) (This can be done by asserting the <code>TMS</code> line and cycling <code>CLK</code> 5 times)</li><li>Enter <code>Select IR Scan</code> state</li><li>Enter <code>Capture IR</code> state</li><li>Enter <code>Shift IR</code> – This is where we load the data into IR from TDI</li><li>Enter <code>Exit IR</code> state</li><li>Enter <code>Update IR</code> state – This stage “latches” the value into IR.</li></ol><p>Following this, if there were no data registers required, the operation would be performed, and the result (if any) would be loaded into the data register to be shifted out. However, many instructions require a data register to be filled out as well before operating. In that case, once the data register is written to and updated, the operation will be performed and the result can be shifted out of the data register.</p><p>Some instructions do not require the DR to be loaded, for example, if we had loaded the <code>IDCODE</code> instruction into IR (1110b), this would load the processor’s IDCODE value into the data register for us to then clock out and read it on <code>TDO</code>. To read the result out of <code>TDO</code>, one would navigate to the <code>Shift-DR</code> state, and clock in 32 bits on <code>TDI</code>, this would cause the data in the data register to be shifted out on the <code>TDO</code> line. See the image below for a visual representation of what would happen if one loaded the IR with the <code>IDCODE</code> instruction</p><p><img data-src="https://www.embecosm.com/appnotes/ean5/images/jtag-architecture-2.png" alt="IDCODE Instruction" src="https://www.embecosm.com/appnotes/ean5/images/jtag-architecture-2.png"></p><p>It’s important to remember, that <code>IR</code> and <code>DR</code> can be thought of as shift registers, meaning that when we update them with new values, the old values are then shifted out on <code>TDO</code>.</p><p>The JTAG standard defines the following instruction registers:</p><ul><li><code>BYPASS</code><ul><li>This instruction connects <code>TDI</code> and <code>TDO</code></li><li>In the <code>Shift DR</code> state, data is transferred from <code>TDI</code> to <code>TDO</code> with a delay of one <code>TCK</code> cycle</li><li>0 is loaded into the data register during the <code>Capture DR</code> state</li><li>This can be used to determine how many devices are in a scan chain</li></ul></li><li><code>IDCODE</code><ul><li>When loaded the Device Code Id Register is selected as the serial path between TDI and TDO</li><li>In the Capture-DR state, the 32-bit device ID code is loaded into this shift section</li><li>In the Shift-DR state, this data is shifted out, least significant bit first</li></ul></li><li><strong>Core JTAG Concepts</strong><ul><li>The state machine is navigated with 4 signals: <code>TCK</code>,<code>TMS</code>,<code>TDO</code> and <code>TDI</code></li><li><code>TDI</code> is used to provide input, <code>TDO</code> is used for output</li><li>Using this state machine data can be shifted into the IR (<code>Shift IR</code>) and the DR (<code>Shift DR</code>)</li><li>The instruction register (<code>IR</code>) can be thought of as a function, and the data register (<code>DR</code>) can be considered the argument to that function</li><li>As data is shifted into <code>DR</code> and <code>IR</code>, the previous contents are shifted out on <code>TDO</code></li><li>Once data is shifted into these registers, an operation can be performed (entirely dependent on host implementation aside from a few reserved instructions)</li><li>Data is <em>read</em> out of the target by shifting it onto <code>TDO</code> from the data register in the <code>Shift DR</code> state.</li></ul></li></ul><p>So now that we have gone over how JTAG works at a low level, we should talk about why we might care about it, and how this interface can grant access to useful features for reverse engineers. One of the most commonly used applications of the JTAG interface is hardware-level debugging (hence the title of this post). This is implemented by the chip manufacturer, and can vary from chip to chip, however, one of the most common implementations of hardware-level debugging for ARM targets is <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0314h/DDI0314H_coresight_components_trm.pdf">ARM’s CoreSight Debug Interface</a>. This is the same implementation that we <a href="https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/stm-xbox-jtag/">communicated with over SWD in my last post</a>, only, in this case, the Debug Access Port is communicated with over JTAG. The specifics of the JTAG implementation can be <a href="https://static.docs.arm.com/ihi0031/c/IHI0031C_debug_interface_as.pdf">found here</a>. Luckily for us, some excellent OSS tools can be used to communicate with these ports - this post will focus on using OpenOCD.</p><p>OpenOCD takes care of utilizing the JTAG or SWD interface to grant the end-user various primitives that are provided by the debug interface exposed through the CoreSight DAP. The Coresight / DAP architecture is fairly complicated and too much to cover in this (already long) post, so I will potentially save that for another post</p><h2 id="jtag-for-reverse-engineers">JTAG for Reverse Engineers</h2><p>It’s extremely important to have a solid understanding of the protocol fundamentals when approaching something like this from a reverse engineer’s perspective. When reverse engineering hardware (or software) you want to have your ground truth covered since there are always infinite unknowns. These next few sections will go over how we can take advantage of our low-level knowledge of these protocols to assist us on our path to gaining access to hardware level debugging via JTAG. The first thing that we need to do is determine the pinout, and if the pins exposed allow access to the JTAG interface.</p><h3 id="determining-the-pinout">Determining the pinout</h3><p>JTAG signal lines are often grouped together, sometimes (if you’re extremely lucky!) you will see one of the following headers:</p><p><img data-src="https://elinux.org/images/4/48/Ti_arm_jtag.jpg" alt="JTAG Headers" src="https://elinux.org/images/4/48/Ti_arm_jtag.jpg"></p><p>If you find something like this however, it may not have the exact signal groupings, so we will discuss how to determine a pinout if one assumes it’s used for JTAG.</p><p>When reverse engineering something like this, you want to start with what you know. Since we know that most manufacturers at <em>least</em> implement <code>IDCODE</code> and <code>BYPASS</code> let’s talk about how we can take advantage of those two instructions.</p><p>If you have identified what you believe to be a potential JTAG header or pinout, but do not know the pins, we can use the behavior of these two registers to determine the pinout.</p><p>Since the <code>IDCODE</code> register is typically loaded as the default IR, one can test an assumed pinout by doing the following:</p><ol><li>Assign roles to potential output pins (TMS, TCK, etc)</li><li>Enter the <code>Test Logic Reset</code> state</li><li>Enter the <code>Select DR Scan</code>, <code>Capture DR</code>, <code>Shift DR</code></li><li>Clock 32 values on <code>TDI</code> and monitor <code>TDO</code> for a valid <code>IDCODE</code> value</li><li>Check the <code>IDCODE</code> value that you shifted out if it looks valid congratulations! Otherwise, reassign pins and repeat!</li></ol><p>In addition to taking advantage of the fact that the <code>IDCODE</code> register is often loaded into the IR by default, we can also utilize the fact that both the IR and DR behave as shift registers, so if we assume a common register length (32 bits often works) we can attempt to brute force the pinout by doing the following:</p><ol><li>Assign roles to potential output pins (TMS, TCK,etc)</li><li>Using these assumed values, enter the <code>Test Logic Reset</code> state</li><li>Enter the <code>Shift IR</code> state</li><li>Shift in a unique 32-bit value on <code>TDI</code></li><li>Continue to shift 1’s on <code>TDI</code> while monitoring for your unique pattern on TDO (be sure to do this as lease 32 times!).</li><li>If the pattern is discovered, congratulations! Otherwise, …</li></ol></div></div>

		<div><p>I went into my office yesterday for the first time in a few months to pick some stuff up. We got notified
a couple of days ago to get any personal property out of the office before Thanksgiving or else it'd be
thrown out, so I guess we're moving out of the office<sup id="fnref:moving-out"><a href="#fn:moving-out">1</a></sup>. It was a pretty eerie place to be; even now, 8
months later, most people haven't been back and it kind of looks like the entire office was abducted by aliens in
early March.</p>

<p>Despite how weird it is, I still miss working out of the office.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>I miss having a clean delineation between "work" and "home".</p>
<p>I miss having copious desk space and a big monitor<sup id="fnref:house"><a href="#fn:house">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I miss the 48" TVs on the wall showing Grafana dashboards with key metrics so there was always ambient knowledge of
what was going on with the product.</p>
<p>I miss having meetings in conference rooms where you can see other people and have a giant whiteboard to sketch on.</p>
<p>I miss casual collaboration. Video chat is a poor substitute and Slack is a deeply irritating tool that combines the
worst aspects of synchronous and asynchronous communication.</p>
<p>I miss productivity! Our engineering productivity has fallen through the floor since COVID despite everyone
working longer and harder; I fundamentally do not think remote teams can <em>ever</em> be as productive as in-person teams.</p>
<p>I miss having my employer pay for electricity and heat and fast symmetric multi-gigabit Internet access instead of
shifting those costs to me.</p>
<p>I miss having a plethora of convenient and delicious options for take-out lunch! I miss the gyros and french fries
at <a href="https://www.ayolagreek.com/">Ayola</a>. I miss the chicken pesto sandwich at <a href="https://working-girls-cafe.square.site/">Working Girls'
Cafe</a>. I miss the chow mein and pork buns from <a href="https://yanksing.com/">Yank Sing</a>. I
miss the katsu curry from <a href="http://www.muraccis.com/">Muracci's</a>. I miss the curry burritos from <a href="https://www.curryupnow.com/">Curry Up
Now</a>. I miss the croque monsieur from <a href="https://cafemadeleinesf.com/">Cafe Madeline</a>. I
miss the $5 lunch specials from <a href="http://www.mehfilindian.com/">Mehfil</a>.</p>
<p>I miss the succession of friendly baristas at our <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/hermanos-coffee-juice-san-francisco">favorite coffee shop</a> who always knew our orders and put up with our banter.</p>
<p>I miss occasional after-work drinks at the <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2019/4/25/18516128/skydeck-spirits-in-the-sky-rooftop-bar-san-francisco">sky bar</a> with the $18 well drinks that we always convinced management to pay for.</p>
<p>Hell, I miss <a href="https://www.bart.gov/">BART</a> in all its loud and smelly glory.</p>
<p>Look, I know, it's not all bad. It's a lot easier taking care of a baby while working from home than it would be if
I were commuting 45 minutes each way every day. I'm spending a lot less money on food and coffee and BART. And I'm
not arguing that we should be in the office now; not a single one of those things I listed above is worth the health
risk of jamming 150 people<sup id="fnref:deniers"><a href="#fn:deniers">3</a></sup> into an open-plan office with a quasi-functional ventilation
system<sup id="fnref:ventilation"><a href="#fn:ventilation">4</a></sup>. But I
really hope that office-work isn't a permanent victim of this pandemic, that all the companies pushing for
permanent WFH to save a few bucks on rent reconsider their stances, and that there comes a time when I can go back to
work again.</p>

<p>Anonymous Sum Types are one of those Rust features that doesn't exist yet and you either are very familiar with the idea and can't wait for the day an RFC gets approved or... you've never heard of it and think the name sounds as gibberish. Luckily in my experience the transition from the latter to the former is a smooth one!</p>
<blockquote>

<h2>What's an Anonymous Sum Type?</h2>
<p>Let's break it down word for word. (If you're already familiar, feel free to skip this)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anonymity, the programming term, refers to a variant of a construct which bears no name. For example, in Javascript you have this little guy:</p>

<p>And, for those who are neither familiar with javascript nor anonymous functions as a whole, you might be confused about what the purpose of a function with no name to call it with! However a function in javascript is an object, which means the above is an expression. So any API which takes a function as a parameter can now take an anonymous function. So you can do the following:</p>

<p>And if you're familiar with Rust, you'll realize Rust has a very similar construct, closures!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sum Types</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm sure if you're reading this you're likely familiar with both a sum (as most programmers are familiar with algebra) and a type, but what exactly is a sum type? (also known as a "tagged union" or "discriminated union" or "tagged variant" and probably one or two other things I'm sure)</p>
<p>You might have even used a sum type without being familiar with the overly academic nomenclature of "sum type", let's take at a really common use case in Rust for sum types and, "coincidentally", the topic of this blog post: error handling.</p>
<p>In Rust error handling it has a strong emphasis on returning errors, as opposed to many languages which reach for exceptions. Here is how this difference looks in <em>reality</em>:</p>


<p>In the Java/exceptions version, the addition of error handling does not affect the return type. However, in Rust, you return one of the two types: either <code>CsvFile</code> or <code>io::Error</code>. So, if you think about the actual type you are returning, <code>Result&lt;CsvFile, io::Error&gt;</code> is a type representing the combination of the two types. (Spoiler: this is what a sum type is, more on that in a second)</p>
<p>Let's try doing something similar by hand in Rust:</p>

<p>Now, at risk of over-explaining the concept, let's represent this in a different manner. A type is merely a set of values that allows us to constrain the values we have to work with. Let's try representing <code>bool</code> and <code>u32</code> as sets:</p>
<pre><code>bool = { true, false }
u32 = { 0, 1, 2, 3, ... , (2^32) - 3, (2^32) - 2, (2^32) - 1 }
</code></pre>
<p>that means we can represent our type <code>BoolOrU32</code> as the union of the set <code>bool</code> and the set <code>u32</code>:</p>
<pre><code>BoolOrU32 = bool ∪ u32 = { true, false, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... , (2^32) - 3, (2^32) - 2, (2^32) - 1 }
</code></pre>
<p>Now one thing to consider is that with our <code>BoolOrU32</code> enum, we are still storing the information which tells us if it is a <code>bool</code> or a <code>u32</code>. This is what differentiates a sum type from a C-styled union. This concept of storing which variant the enum is is the "tagged" part of the other name for sum types, "tagged unions".</p>
<p>To put that all together, <strong>an anonymous sum type is an unnamed combination of types</strong>.</p>
<h2>Error Handling Woes</h2>
<p>Taking a look back at our previous example there's a bit of a problem:</p>
<pre><code>warning: this is super limiting
  --&gt; ~/dev/csv-parser/src/lib.rs
   |
33 | fn parse_csv(path: &amp;Path) -&gt; Result&lt;CsvFile, io::Error&gt;;
   |                                              ^^^^^^^^^ this sucks
   |
   = help: consider using one of the following libraries:
           thiserror
           eyre
           snafu
</code></pre>
<p>While some errors from parsing a file might be I/O related (for example if the file doesn't exist), but some are parsing related errors! We could use <code>io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, my_error_here)</code> but that's rather verbose to construct, hacky, and it's even somehow an order worse to extract our error type from the <code>io::Error</code>!</p>
<p>One solution to this problem is to hand roll an <code>enum</code> to make a sum type for your error type. This is a really great way of going about things, and is my goto for error handling! It's a great fit for libraries as it allows library consumers to handle only certain errors, or specify error handling by type. It's not very helpful to handle a missing file and an invalid webpage certificate the same way!</p>
<p>However... this introduces a new problem. Internally, you often want granularity as far as your error types. It allows people new to the codebase to see exactly which 2-3 errors a function could return, it allows you to use exhaustive matching to catch more bugs at compile time, etc. However, it's not very appealing to make a new enum for every new combination of errors a function produces. I mean how do you even get past the gruelling process of naming such a type? <code>IoOrParseError</code> isn't exactly what I call a lovely name...</p>
<h2>A Solution! (Sort of)</h2>
<p>Not wanting to name a sum type? That sounds like a job for... anonymous sum types! This is, admittedly, one of the features I've wanted since I first fell in love with Rust's enums being sum types (in a systems programming language? scandelous!). However, last I checked, bumping every Sum Type RFC with an alt got me nowhere! (Yes, for anyone who is paying attention, I <em>will</em> recycle the exact same joke as from my RustConf talk)</p>
<p>It's time to take matters into my own hands. Introducing <code>some-error</code>!</p>

<p>The idea is simple: use an attribute macro to allow for a very minimal/focused version of anonymous sum types specifically aimed at use in error handling. To use it you just slap <code>#[some_error]</code> on your function, set the return type as <code>Result&lt;T, E1 + E2 + ...&gt;</code> and you're good to go! You can even use <code>?</code> for any of the included error types.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wait, what's the big idea with this hand-wavey black magic nonsense!"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Man Behind The Curtain</h2>
<h3>The Syntax</h3>
<p>In Rust, you can return trait objects, for example:</p>

<p>Where <code>dyn Any + Send + Sync</code> can be any object which can be any type that implements <code>Any</code>, <code>Send</code>, and <code>Sync</code>, the same single function can even return any number of types, so long as all of those types implement <code>Any + Send + Sync</code>. Tiny bit of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/trait-system/dyn-trait-for-trait-objects.html">Rust history</a>, but before Rust 2018, the syntax for this didn't include <code>dyn</code>:</p>

<p>And since this still parses in spite of being deprecated, that means we can use it for our own nefarious macro purposes! (<del>until it is inevitably removed</del>)</p>
<h3>The Pattern Matching</h3>
<p>Unlike the function itself, matching on the anonymous sum type requires no macro. That means this time around we can't cheat! Everything must be above board or <code>rustc</code> will give me a slap on the wrist. Although, I can't quite say I got out of the macro hackery unscathed, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79148"><code>rustc</code> punished me with a bit of ICE for my crimes</a>.</p>
<p>This time, I abuse a lesser-known <a href="https://jam1.re/img/rust-fact.png">Rust fact</a> that Rust functions and modules exist in different scopes, allowing you to make them overlapping:</p>

<p>And, similarly to traits and derive macros, this allows you to import both at once:</p>

<p>which gives the illusion that the function can have associated constants, types, functions, etc.</p>
<h3>Making <code>?</code> "Just Work"</h3>
<p>This part is rather easy! One really wonderful feature of Rust is that the <code>?</code> operator will automatically coerce from <code>Result&lt;T, E1&gt;</code> to <code>Result&lt;T, E2&gt;</code>, given <code>E2: From&lt;E1&gt;</code>. Meaning all we have to do is generate some trivial <code>From</code> implementations and voila! Now any part of the sum type can be returned using <code>?</code>.</p>
<h3>The Variants</h3>
<p>One problem that occurred while making this is that, unlike a normal enum, the variants can't really have identifiers as names. Since it's a common pattern in Rust to refer to errors in the form of <code>module::Error</code> (such as <code>io::Error</code> or <code>fmt::Error</code>), the variants need to be paths (as I don't really consider any form of normalization such as <code>IoError</code> to really be an appealing solution).</p>
<p>So how can we go about this? Since we're already using a macro anyways, we might as well make the most of it! Let's just generate modules to emulate the paths and then re-export the individual variants of our error type!</p>

<h2>Wait What Do You Mean "Sort of" a Solution?</h2>
<p>Welllllllllllllll. While I am rather happy with how far I was capable of pushing what is possible, I can't say whether or not I actually like it. I haven't been able to extensively test it as I started writing the library a day before writing this. Perhaps this results in a lot of problems! Maybe those problems are all solvable by language-level support of anonymous sum types. Maybe someone else needs to "yes and" this idea before it is actually truely useful. I can't say!</p>
<p>My goal here was not to make <strong>The</strong> error handling library, but rather to explore a new design idea. And possibly to give people something to play with to find sharp edges to motivate a language-level implementation.</p>
<p>You're free to use some-error in your projects, and I will certainly maintain it to the best of my ability, but I guess what I'm trying to say is please don't flame me on reddit just because this library isn't going in anyone's million LOC codebase.</p>

November 21, 2020 | https://yakshav.es/the-patron-saint-of-yakshaves/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yakshav.es/the-patron-saint-of-yakshaves/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>In 2015, I gave a talk in which I called <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/skade/tex-the-ultimate-yakshave">Donald Knuth the Patron Saint of Yak Shaves</a>. The reason is that Donald Knuth achieved the most perfect and long-running yak shave: TeX.</p>
<p>I figured this is worth repeating.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-achieve-the-ultimate-yak-shave">How to achieve the ultimate Yak Shave</h2>
<p>The ultimate yak shave is the combination of improbable circumstance, the privilege to be able to shave at your hearts will and the will to follow things through to the end. Here’s the way it was achieved with TeX. The recount is purely mine, inaccurate and obviously there for fun. I’ll avoid the most boring facts that everyone always tells, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check">why Knuth’s checks have their own Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<p>So, let’s get things started.</p>
<h2 id="the-pre-shave">The Pre-Shave</h2>
<p>TeX was invented to typeset a book. No plural. It was invented to typeset the second edition of “The Art of Computer Programming”. The second edition had to be typeset again, as “hot type” typesetting, which was used for the first edition, was not available anymore. Being unimpressed by the available options, Knuth decided to write his own system, which later ended up as TeX.</p>
<p>But “The Art of Computer Programming” is an impressive book in its own right: it is still unfinished, currently spanning 3.5 volumes (yes, the fourth is unfinished, but the first chapters are released). It was called a book of the century by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080820030403/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/100-or-so-books-that-shaped-a-century-of-science">American scientist writers</a>.</p>
<p>Yak shave -2: Write a book of the century</p>
<p>Digging deeper into TAOCP, it already shows the works of a yak shaver destined for greater things. All programs in this book refer to a common assembly language: MIX. Which was invented for the book.</p>
<p>Yak shave -1: Invent your own computer for illustration purposes</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The first version of TeX was implemented using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIL_(programming_language)">SAIL</a> programming language. It was later replaced by WEB. What’s WEB? It’s a programming language, invented by… You’ll have guessed it by now, Donald Knuth. It transpiles to PASCAL. Knuth transpiled the WEB before it was cool.</p>
<p>Yak shave 1: Somewhere along the road, implement your own programming language…</p>
<p>WEB is a special language: in WEB, any bare text is just text. It’s interleaved with marked pieces of code, which are later used for the program code. The documentation can be run through a special program to produce… a TeX file. The concept is called “literate programming” and was introduced by… Donald Knuth.</p>
<p>Yak shave 2: Invent your own programming paradigm for it</p>
<p>But, what does TeX do? Mainly, it does text layout and a couple of other things. Knuth being known for research on algorithms couldn’t do without coming up with his own algorithm, later published together with Michael Plass. What does the algorithm do? It finds a visually pleasing way to lay out a paragraph on a page without making line breaks look jarring (for example by adjusting the “glue”, the whitespace between words). Here’s a <a href="https://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs490/2015W2/lectures/Knuth.pdf">nice explanation</a>.</p>
<p>It’s still considered good and has a huge factor in the recognisable look of TeX documents.</p>
<p>Yak shave 3: Invent your own layout algorithm for it</p>
<p>Which brings us to the next problem: <em>what</em> does this thing lay out? Generically speaking: objects and clusters of objects of varying sizes. Interestingly, that’s what TeX deals with, it has no concept of a character other then dimensions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these are usually characters and characters are provided by fonts. Fonts must usually be licensed at a fee and free fonts weren’t so available in the 70s.</p>
<p>Another very recognisable feature of TeX documents that they are often set in a font called “Computer Modern”.</p>
<p>I’m trying to make this whole thing a bit more thrilling, so I will let you guess who created that one.</p>
<p>Yak shave 4: Design a font</p>
<p>Fonts need to be authored. Usually, they are described in some vector description, often Bézier curves. This is fairly standard and not an innovation of Knuth. <em>But</em>, he wrote a description language for that, along with an interpreter to turn this descriptions into proper font files. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafont">METAFONT</a>. It’s not strictly part of TeX, it’s just that the Yak happened to stand close.</p>
<p>Yak shave 5: Write an authoring tool for fonts</p>
<p>As a side-note, METAFONT was later evolved into METAPOST for generic vector drawings, which has the one feature I still miss from many modern graphics description languages: the ability to describe an (addressable) point as the intersection between two other primitives.</p>
<p>Another side-note: both TeX and METAFONT still see releases, at a slow pace. TeX is currently at version 3.14159265, METAFONT at 2.7182818. Yep, TeX is slowly converging towards pi, while METAFONT towards e. Take that, semantic versioning advocates!</p>
<p>Yak shave 6: Come up with your own versioning scheme<br>
Yak shave 7: Avoid adoption of it for greater good</p>
<p>We’re not done yet. We can layout text (and other things), but where do we convert it to? Now, everyone knows the horror printers invoke, so no one wants to deal with those directly. Classic TeX instead converts things to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_independent_file_format">DVI</a>, the “device independent” format. I don’t know many details about it, except what’s on the wiki page, which feels the need to specifically point out that “DVI is not a document encryption format”. It is again a stack-based language (in contrast to PostScript not turing complete), which can then be interpreted through a driver, which would then send that to whatever target (a printer, PDF or such). It was designed by…</p>
<p>David R. Fuchs, Knuth just wrote the implementation.</p>
<p>Yak shave 8: Implement a custom language for printable documents</p>
<p>Note that I haven’t mentioned that TeX is an… interesting… language by itself, but I don’t consider that a yak shave, this was just the implementation.</p>
<p>That makes most of the initial implementation complete. Which means, in orderly fashion, you should give matters in the hand of the community.</p>

<p>Since the release of TeX, the community has been busy working on using it as a platform. If you ever downloaded the full TeX distribution, please bear in mind that you are downloading the amassed work of over 40 years, to make sure that each and every TeX document ever written builds. We’re talking about documents here.</p>
<p>But mostly, two big projects sprung out of that. The first is LaTeX by Leslie Lamport. Lamport is a very productive researcher, famous for research in formal methods through TLA+ and also known laying groundwork for many distributed algorithms. LaTeX is based on the idea of seperating presentation and content. It is based around the idea of document classes, which then describe the way a certain document is layed out. Think Markdown, just much more complex. The second is ConTeXt, which is far more focused on fine grained layout control.</p>
<p>Both share a common property:</p>
<p>Community yak shave 1: Create not one, but two programs that are very ungoogleable… Before Google is invented.</p>
<p>Being active in a language that has lingo built around “Rust”, “Cargo” and “manifests”, I feel right at home.</p>
<p>Now, the community also wants to evolve TeX: a lot has changed over the years in technology, so, for example, you’d like to use modern font formats, directly write to modern output formats or use this new UTF-8 thingy. For that, there are specialised TeX interpreters, such as <code>pdf(la)tex</code>, <code>lua(la)tex</code> and <code>xe(la)tex</code>. There’s a problem here: you are not allowed to change TeX and distribute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX#License">it under that name</a>. The thinking here is that if you have a <code>tex</code> binary, you can compile any valid TeX from the past and from the future.</p>
<p>The first issue on that road is that WEB isn’t really a popular programming language, neither is PASCAL and running it on modern systems is a bit of a pain. Which means…</p>
<p>Community yak shave 2: Transpile WEB to C and work from there</p>
<p>This is just the start of a great endeavour…</p>
<p>Community yak shave 3: Build a lot of tooling around that</p>
<h2 id="the-moral-of-the-story">The Moral of the Story</h2>
<p>Whenever you feel like “can’t we just replace this whole thing, it can’t be so hard” when handling TeX, don’t forget how many years of work and especially knowledge were poured into that system. Typesetting isn’t the <em>most</em> popular knowledge around programmers. Especially see it in the context of the space it is in: they can’t remove legacy. Ever. That would break documents.</p>
<p>TeX is also not a programming language. It might resemble one, but mostly, it should be approached as a typesetting system first. A lot of its confusing lingo gets much better then. It’s not programming lingo.</p>
<p>By approaching TeX with an understanding for its history, a lot of things can be learned from it. And yes, a replacement would be great, but it would take ages.</p>
<p>In any case, I hope I thoroughly convinced you why Donald Knuth is the Patron Saint of Yak Shaves.</p>

<p>This comes out of a enjoyable discussion with <a href="https://lambdaisland.com/">Arne from Lambda Island</a>, who listened and said “you should totally turn this into a talk”.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a>, a constant-time compare function implementation in <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, is a great case to demonstrate the <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/language-design/#0008401">predictable performance of OCaml’s compiler</a>. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal of a constant-time compare function is to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack">timing attacks</a>, which requires fully deterministic and predictable runtime performance.</li>
<li>Usually, cryptography functions are written in assembly to have total control of resulting binary and avoid unneeded optimization by the compiler.</li>
<li>However, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a> showed us that you can write clean OCaml and get simple and predictable resulting assembly.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the first issue of <a href="https://learnocamlthehardway.substack.com/welcome">Learn OCaml the Hard Way</a>. A publication about learning OCaml from the ground up.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="about-garbage-collection">About Garbage Collection</h2>
<p>It’s hard to have a stable runtime performance for languages that comes with a garbage collector. To have a predictable runtime performance characteristic in these languages, the following rules are usually required to be followed religiously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid garbage collections by avoiding memory allocations.</li>
<li>Avoid boxed values to generate assembly as low-level as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, the resulting code are usually unidiomatic and hard to maintain.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-explorer">Compiler Explorer</h2>
<p><a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a> is a handy tool for exploring compilers and its assembly output. It has built-in OCaml support and removes boilerplate automatically. I recommend you to test the following example with it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Here’s the implementation of <code>eqaf</code>’s <code>equal</code>.</p>

  <span>then</span> false
  <span>else</span> equal <span>~</span>ln<span>:</span>al a b
</code></pre></div><p>Besides basic OCaml syntaxes[1], interesting bits in the example are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can force OCaml to always inline a function via adding an attribute <code>[@inline]</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>String.unsafe_get</code> works like <code>String.get</code> but without bound-checking. It’s unsafe for most use-cases but it’s used here to <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml#L3">avoid jumping to exception</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OCaml provides a FFI <code>external</code> for <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/intfc.html">interfacing with C</a>. Here we use it to call a primitive function provided by OCaml’s runtime <code>%caml_string_get16u</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>external</code> is always unsafe and should be really take care about.</li>
<li>Primitives are not stable. For example: <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36">https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>n asr m</code> shifts <code>n</code> to the right by <code>m</code> bits. This is an arithmetic shift: the sign bit of <code>n</code> is replicated. The result is unspecified if <code>m &lt; 0</code> or <code>m &gt; Sys.int_size</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ref</code> creates a <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/imperative-programming.html">reference cell</a> and allows in-place replacement with <code>:=</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pred x</code> is <code>x - 1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>lor</code>, <code>lxor</code>, and <code>land</code> are logical bit-wise <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>, and <code>and</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the OCaml code is quite low-level (and not very functional). It’s still cleaner than most constant-time compare functions implemented in assembly.</p>

<p>Here’s the resulting assembly of the previous example, copied from the <code>eqaf</code> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml">source</a>. You can get the same output via <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>.</p>

<p><code>eqaf</code> allows us to have a basic understanding about OCaml’s assembly output without inferences of GC, boxed values, and advanced syntaxes such as pattern matching. We will explore more in the future issues.</p>

				<p>This post concludes my introduction to the chrono extension in C++20. Today I present the time-zones functionality.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/TimelineCpp20CoreLanguage.png" alt="TimelineCpp20CoreLanguage" width="650" height="278"></p>
<p>I should have written, today I mainly present the time-zones functionality in C++20. Before I write about the time-zones in C++20, I want to present the online resource <a href="https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/wiki/Examples-and-Recipes">Examples and Recipes </a>from Howard Hinnant, which has about 40 examples of the new chrono functionality. Presumably, the chrono extension in C++20 is not easy to get; therefore it's quite important to have so many examples. You should use these examples as a starting point for further experiments and, therefore, sharpen your understanding. You can also add your recipes.</p>
<p>To get an idea of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/wiki/Examples-and-Recipes">Examples and Recipes</a> I want to present a program for<a href="https://github.com/rbock"> Roland Bock</a> that calculates ordinal dates.</p>
<h2 id="h1-calculating-ordinal-dates">Calculating Ordinal Dates</h2>
<p>"<em>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_date" rel="nofollow">ordinal date</a> consists of a year and a day of year (1st of January being day 1, 31st of December being day 365 or day 366). The year can be obtained directly from year_month_day. And calculating the day is wonderfully easy. In the code below we make us of the fact that year_month_day can deal with invalid dates like the 0th of January</em>:" (Roland Bock)</p>

<p>I want to add a few remarks to the program. Line (1) truncates the current time point. The value is used in the following line to initialize a calendar date. Line (2) calculates the time duration between the two time points. Both time points have the resolution day. Finally, <code>year_day.count()</code> in line (3) returns the time duration in days.<img src="http://www.modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/ordinalDate2.png" alt="ordinalDate2" width="350" height="181"></p>
<p>My following examples to time-zones are also inspired by the already mentioned web resource <a href="https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/wiki/Examples-and-Recipes">Examples and Recipes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h2-times-zones">Times-Zones</h2>
<p>First of all, a time-zone is a region and its full history of the date such as daylight saving time or leap seconds. The time-zone library in C++20 is a complete parser of the<a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones"> IANA timezone database</a>. The following table should give you a first idea of the new functionality.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/timeZone.png" alt="timeZone" width="600" height="277"></p>
<p>I use in my examples the function <code>std::chrono::zones_time</code> which is essentially a time-zone combined with a time point.</p>
<p>Before I show you two examples I want to make a short remark. To compile a program using the time-zone library, you have to compile the<code> tz.cpp</code> file and link against the <code>curl</code> library. The curl library is necessary to get the current <a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones"> IANA timezone database</a>. The following command line for g++ should give you the idea:</p>

<p>My first program is straightforward. It displays the UTC time and the local time.</p>
<h3 id="h2-1-utc-time-and-local-time">UTC Time and Local Time</h3>
<p>The<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time"> UTC time or Coordinated Univeral Time</a> is the primary time standard worldwide. A computer uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a> which is a very close approximation of UTC. The UNIX time is the number of seconds since the Unix epoch. The Unix epoch is 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.</p>
<p><code></code><code>std::chrono::system_clock::now()</code> in line (1) returns in the following program<code> localTime.cpp </code> the Unix time.<code><br></code></p>

<p>I have not to add too much to the program. The code block beginning with line (1) gets the current time point, truncates it to seconds, and displays it. The call<code> date::make_zoned</code> creates a <code>std::chrono::zoned_time localTime. T</code>he following call<code> localTime.get_local_time() </code>returns the stored time point as a local time. This time point is also truncated to seconds. <code>localTime</code> (line 3) can also be used to get information about the time-zone. In this case, I'm interested in the offset to the UTC time.</p>

<p>My last program answers a crucial question when I teach in a different time-zone: When should I start my online class?</p>
<h3 id="h2-2-various-time-zones-for-online-classes">Various Time-Zones for Online Classes</h3>
<p>The program <code>onlineClass.cpp</code> answers the following question: How late is it in given time-zones, when I start an online class at the <code>7h, 13h,</code> or <code>17h</code> local time (Germany)?</p>
<p>The online class should start on the 1st of February 2021 and should take 4 hours. Because of the daylight saving time, the calendar date is essential to get the correct answer.</p>

<p>Before I dive into the functions<code> getMinutes</code> (line 1) and <code>printStartEndTimes</code> (line 2), let me say a view words about the <code>main</code> function. The <code>main</code> function defines the day of the class, the duration of the class, and all time-zones. Finally, the range-based for-loop (line 3) iterates through all potential starting points for an online class. Thanks to the function <code>printStartEndTimes</code> (line 2) all necessary information is displayed.</p>
<p>The few lines beginning with line (4) calculate the<code> startDate</code> and <code>endDate</code> of my training by adding the start time and the duration of the class to the calendar date. Both values are displayed with the help of the function <code>getMinutes</code> (line 1). <code>date<span>::</span>floor<span>&lt;</span>std<span>::</span>chrono<span>::</span>minutes<span>&gt;</span>(zonedTime.get_local_time())</code> gets the stored time point out of the<code> std::chrono::zoned_time</code> and truncates the value to the minute resolution. To properly align the output of the program, line (5) <code> </code><code></code>determines the size of the longest of all time-zone names. Line (6) iterates through all time-zones and displays the name of the time-zone, and the beginning and end of each online-class. A few calendar dates even cross the day boundaries.<img src="http://www.modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/onlineClass.png" alt="onlineClass" width="600" height="760"></p>
<p>There is more to write about the extended chrono library. For example, C++20 offers new clocks such as<code> std::chrono::utc_clock</code> that include leap seconds, or the<code> std::chrono::tai_clock</code> that represents the International Atomic Time (TAI). Additional, thanks to the new formatting library in C++20, time durations can be nicely formatted. This feature is not available so far. If you want to study the formating rules for time durations, here are they: <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/system_clock/formatter#Format_specification">std::formatter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h3-what-s-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>If you want to compare signed and unsigned integrals, you may have a lot of fun. This fun ends with C++20.</p>

                <p>Most styles are editable through <em>CSS variables</em>. You can also add your own styles
                    inline, at the end of MVP.css or in a new stylesheet.</p>
                <p><sup>PRO TIP</sup> If there are two conflicting CSS styles, the last one will take precedence.</p>
                <pre>                    <code>
:root {
    --color: #118bee;
}

/* Lower in the CSS, or in a 2nd stylesheet */

:root {
    --color: green; /* This will take precedence */
}

                <summary>What if I still don't like it?</summary>
                <p>That's OK, you probably shouldn't love your MVP. The goal of MVP.css is to help you
                    feel <i>slightly</i> less embarrased about it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SierpinskiSieve.html">Sierpinski triangle</a> is a famous mathematical figure which presents an interesting computer science problem: how to go about generating it. In this article I'll explain one method of generating the Sierpinski triangle recursively, with an implementation written in Vanilla JavaScript using HTML5 canvas. I'll also explain how to you'd go about downloading the contents of an HTML5 Canvas element as a PNG.</p>
<p>First, here's what the Sierpinski triangle looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/sierpinski-triangle.jpg" alt="The Sierpinski Triangle"></p>
<h2>What is the Sierpinski Triangle?</h2>
<h3>The Sierpinski Triangle is a Fractal, Making it Naturally Recursive</h3>
<p>One initial thing to notice about the Sierpinski triangle is that every triangle is composed of smaller, identical triangles. Those triangles are also made up of even smaller, identical triangles, which are also made up of more triangles, and so on.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/fractal.jpg" alt="Sierpinski Triangle Fractal"></p>
<p>This property in which the Sierpinski triangle is made up of identical, scaled-down copies of itself makes it a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Fractal.html">fractal</a> in mathematics. Fractals are shapes that are made up of scaled down copies of themselves. The Sierpinski triangle is actually arguably one of the most famous fractals that exist, along with <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PythagorasTree.html">Pythagoras Trees</a>, <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MandelbrotSet.html">the Mandelbrot set</a>, and more.</p>
<p>The fact that fractals are made up of copies of themselves makes them naturally recursive, and it tends to be simpler to programmatically generate fractals recursively as supposed to using an iterative approach.</p>
<h3>The Sierpinski Triangle Only Uses Equilateral Triangles</h3>
<p>Next, notice how the Sierpinski triangle is made up of a single shape: the equilateral triangle. This is not a coincidence, and it is in fact one of the reasons the Sierpinski triangle is a notable mathematical figure.</p>
<p>The Sierpinski triangle takes advantage of a property of equilateral triangles: that they are one of the only shapes that can be made up solely by scaled down versions of itself, where a large equilateral triangle can be made by tesselating four equally smaller equilateral triangles. This makes them uniquely positioned to be the centerpiece of simple fractals, since it is intuitive to encompass smaller copies of an equilateral triangle inside a larger one.</p>
<p>This also makes it possible for fractals based on equilateral triangles, like the Sierpinski triangle, to be composed of only one shape. Other polygon-based fractals that don't use equilateral triangles often include several different shapes.</p>
<h2>Generating the Sierpinski Triangle in JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas</h2>
<h3>Setting Up the HTML and Canvas Element</h3>
<p>Let's start by setting up the <code>canvas</code> element and basic HTML markup:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Sierpinski Triangle&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;canvas id="canvas" width="1000" height="1000"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;

    &lt;!-- JavaScript Code Here --&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Note that the width and height variables in the canvas represent the inner dimensions of the canvas, not necessarily its size on the page. This means it can be resized in the future to fit different screen sizes, while maintaining its inner dimensions of 1000px by 1000px.</p>
<h3>Creating Equilateral Triangles on the Canvas in JavaScript</h3>
<p>Since equilateral triangles are the only shape used in the Sierpinski triangle, it makes sense to write a utility function to draw a given equilateral triangle on the canvas at a specified position and of a specified size.</p>
<p>This function will take in two arguments: the position of the bottom left vertex on the triangle (<code>pos</code>), and the length of the sides of the triangle (<code>sidelen</code>).</p>
<p>To create polygons in HTML5 canvas, there are several functions to move to positions on the canvas, draw a path around an area of the canvas, and fill in that area. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>context.beginPath()</code> and <code>context.closePath()</code> — create and close a path; commonly used with <code>context.fill()</code> after closing the path</li>
<li><code>context.moveTo(x, y)</code> — move to a position on the canvas.</li>
<li><code>context.lineTo(x, y)</code> — move to a position on the canvas while drawing a line from the current position.</li>
<li><code>context.fill()</code> — fill the most recent canvas path.</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating a triangle simply means identifying the positions of the three vertices, drawing a path around those vertices, and filling the drawn area with a color. Identifying the positions of the vertices is pretty intuitive. Below is a visual showing the positions of the vertices. Note that the height of an equilateral triangle is mathematically equal to as <code>sin(Pi/3) * sidelen</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/equilateral-triangle.jpg" alt="Equilateral Triangle Vertex Positions"></p>
<p>With the positions of the vertices done, here's what the function to create an equilateral triangle on the canvas would look like:</p>
<pre><code>const c = document.getElementById("canvas");
const ctx = c.getContext("2d"); // context variable is used to draw on a 2D plane

const createTriangle = (pos, sidelen) =&gt; {
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.moveTo(...pos); // go to the left vertex

  // note that (0,0) in canvas is the top left, so 'up' on the vertical component would use substraction.
  ctx.lineTo(pos[0] + sidelen / 2, pos[1] - sidelen * Math.sin(Math.PI/3)); // draw line from left vertex to top vertex
  ctx.lineTo(pos[0] + sidelen, pos[1]); // draw line from top vertex to right vertex
  ctx.lineTo(...pos); // draw line from right vertex back to left vertex
  ctx.closePath();
  ctx.fill(); // fill triangle
};</code></pre>
<h3>Implementing an Algorithm to Generate the Sierpinski Triangle</h3>
<p>Now that the canvas and HTML has been set up and the <code>createTriangle</code> utility function has been written, we can start implementing an algorithm to generate the Sierpinski triangle.</p>
<p>Since fractals are naturally recursive, we'll use a recursive approach to generate the entire triangle.</p>
<p>First, recall that every triangle in the Sierpinski triangle is made up of three smaller triangles, one on the left, another on the right, and a final one on the top. Each smaller triangle is a copy of the outer triangle, the Sierpinski triangle. So, simply create a smaller Sierpinski triangle inside of each of the three triangles, and then more smaller Sierpinski triangles inside of those, and so on. Technically, the Sierpinski triangle repeats forever, but for visualizations like this, a stopping point should be defined when there have been enough repeats that the smallest triangles are hard to make out. At this point, filling in the smallest triangles acts as an effective substitution of repeating further.</p>
<p>To create this stopping condition, a variable called <code>depth</code> can be used. <code>depth</code> would represent the amount of times the program should continue repeating the fractal. <code>depth</code> should start at a certain value and decrease for every repeat, and every smaller Sierpinski triangle created. Once <code>depth</code> reaches zero (the base case), the program would stop and fill in the three triangles instead of continuing to repeat the fractal.</p>
<p>To create this functionality, let's create a function called <code>createSierpinskiTriangle</code> which takes the position of the Sierpinski triangle to generate, its side length, and the depth. The function should identify the positions of the three inner triangles, draw them if depth is equal to zero, or call <code>createSierpinskiTriangle</code> on the three inner triangles if the depth is greater than zero.</p>
<p>Here's what this would look like:</p>
<pre><code>const createSierpinskiTriangle = (pos, sidelen, depth) =&gt; {
  const innerTriangleSidelen = sidelen / 2; // side length of inner triangles is half the side length of the outer triangle
  const innerTrianglesPositions = [
    pos,
    [ pos[0] + innerTriangleSidelen, pos[1] ],
    [ pos[0] + innerTriangleSidelen / 2, pos[1] - Math.sin(Math.PI/3) * innerTriangleSidelen ]
  ]; // these positions are the same as what was used in the createTriangle function
  if(depth == 0) {
    innerTrianglesPositions.forEach((trianglePosition) =&gt; {
      createTriangle(trianglePosition, innerTriangleSidelen);
    });
  } else {
    innerTrianglesPositions.forEach((trianglePosition) =&gt; {
      createSierpinskiTriangle(trianglePosition, innerTriangleSidelen, depth - 1);
    });
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>To call the function, draw the Sierpinski triangle at the bottom left of the canvas (<code>(0, 1000)</code>) with a side length of <code>1000</code>px (the width of the canvas) and a depth of <code>5</code>.</p>
<pre><code>createSierpinskiTriangle([0, 1000], 1000, 5);</code></pre>
<p>Here's the result:</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/sierpinski-triangle.jpg" alt="Recursive Method Result"></p>
<p>Try increasing the depth, and you should see that the triangle gets more and more detailed. Increasing the depth by one will result in three times the amount of total triangles to be drawn, so very high depths like 20 might not be performant since the canvas would have to draw 3^20 (~3.5 billion) triangles.</p>
<h3>Downloading the Generated Triangle From the Canvas as a PNG</h3>
<p>Now that we've generated the triangle recursively, one thing you may want to do is download the generated Sierpinski triangle as an image on your computer. Luckily, this is very simple to do in HTML5 Canvas.</p>
<p>First, the canvas must be converted to a data URL. If you're not familiar with data URLs, here's a simple definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A data URL is a URL scheme that allows data and files (images, audio files, etc.) to be respresented in a single URL containing all of the data. For example, if one wanted to include an image on a website, you would add the image to the web server and link to it in the HTML. With data URLs, the data URL contains the contents of the entire file, so it can simply be put into the HTML directly. This is useful in canvas because we want to export the image without it having a specific public URL, and data URLs allow that to be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The contents of the <code>canvas</code> element can be converted to a data URL with the <code>.toDataURL</code> method.</p>
<p>Next, let's download the data URL into the user's machine. In HTML, downloading a file is done by clicking a link and specifying the <code>download</code> attribute. For example, here's how someone would download an image as <code>myimage.png</code> when the user clicks a link: <code>&lt;a href="image.png" download="myimage.png"&gt;download!&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Downloading a file through JavaScript is as simple as creating a link element with the specified <code>href</code> and <code>download</code> attributes, and artificially clicking on it.</p>
<p>Here's what this would look like:</p>
<pre><code>const downloadCanvasContents = () =&gt; {
  const link = …</code></pre></div></div>

<p>RubyConf 2020</p>
</div>
<p>Due to COVID-19, and a rough year for humanity in general, I was looking forward to hanging out with
fellow Rubyists even if virtual. The team behind managing and hosting the event did an excellent job
in making it a fun and welcoming experience. Kudos!</p>
<p>I’ve been enjoying the virtual format for conferences this year and hoping this becomes more of a
mainstay for future conferences. During Slack conversations, people had mentioned taking a hybrid
approach where people could attend in person but there would also be a way, for people who couldn’t
travel, to also experience the joy of Ruby remotely. I like this idea a lot.</p>
<p>If I had one complaint, I would have wished the service for hosting the event was an all-in-one
platform. Instead, you had to jump between multiple services:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/">Crowdcast</a> - Used for streaming both live and pre-recorded
presentations. I do have to say I enjoyed being able to rewatch parts of a presentation after it
was over since it only took a few minutes to become available. Even better, you could jump over to
a track you didn’t attend and catch up on it at double speed. ⚡️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> - No complaints here. Although, it would have been nice to have the
Slack experience embedded within Crowdcast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.alchemists.io/articles/avoid_zoom">Zoom</a> - Necessary for some of the workshops and sponsored events. This
was unfortunate as I’ve written about my <a href="https://www.alchemists.io/articles/avoid_zoom">dislike for Zoom</a> before and we
should do better as an industry in this regard.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>What I was hoping for was more of an experience like <a href="https://hopin.com/">Hopin</a>. I had
experienced an event on their platform earlier in the year and really loved how you could <em>hop</em>
between reception, the main stage, chats, sessions, expos, and other networking activities.</p>
<p>With all of the above said, the following are notes captured from the conference that caught my
interest. It wasn’t possible to attend all of the talks live but, as mentioned above, being able to
catch up on them after the fact at double speed was a nice bonus. Enjoy and may the following be of
use to you.</p>

<h3 id="_automatic_gc_compaction_in_mri_by_aaron_patterson">Automatic GC Compaction in MRI by Aaron Patterson</h3>
<p>Aaron’s talk dives into a his work around <code>GC.compact</code> which was added in Ruby 2.7.0 to move objects
around and update references in order to keep memory smaller and well organized. The goal is to make
this process more concurrent. I had seen an earlier version of this talk when Aaron spoke at our
local <a href="https://www.meetup.com/boulder_ruby_group">Boulder Ruby Meetup</a> group but was nice to
watch again in a more polished format. While this isn’t recommended for production, at least not
yet, Aaron does recommmend turning this on for your continuous integration builds.</p>
<p>As an aside, Aaron used macOS <a href="https://help.apple.com/instruments">Instruments</a> to benchmark
Ruby. Instruments comes with a GUI tool for digging into the results. Neat.</p>

<h3 id="_the_humble_hash_by_ariel_caplan">The Humble Hash by Ariel Caplan</h3>
<p>I wasn’t able to attend this talk live but caught up on it after the fact and ended up having a few
conversations with Ariel afterwards.</p>
<p>In the talk, he made a good points about using primitives (i.e. <code>String</code>, <code>Symbol</code>, <code>Numeric</code>, etc.)
for hash keys which is a good rule to live by. Even an <code>Array</code> or another <code>Hash</code> can work. The
important aspect of any key is that object equality <em>must be obvious</em>.</p>
<p>He also mentioned using default values and even the lesser used and powerful default proc for Hash
construction:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>Hash</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>"test"</span>
<span>example</span><span>[</span><span>:a</span><span>]</span>  <span># =&gt; "test"</span>

<span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>example</span><span>.</span><span>default</span> <span>=</span> <span>"test"</span>
<span>example</span><span>[</span><span>:a</span><span>]</span>  <span># =&gt; "test"</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>For default proc support, check out <code>Hash.infinite</code> and <code>Hash.with_default</code> support baked into my
<a href="https://www.alchemists.io/projects/refinements/#_hash">Refinements</a> gem or study the
<a href="https://github.com/bkuhlmann/refinements/blob/master/lib/refinements/hashes.rb#L6-L12">source
code</a> directly. Hashes are definitely powerful. 🎉</p>
<p>That said, I hadn’t seen this variant where a hash is used for memoization which is worth
consideration:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>def</span> <span>expensive_cacluation_example</span><span>(</span><span>argument</span><span>)</span>
  <span>@expensive_cacluation_example</span> <span>||=</span> <span>Hash</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>a_hash</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>|</span>
    <span>a_hash</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>do_expensive_calculation</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>@expensive_cacluation_example</span><span>[</span><span>argument</span><span>]</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here’s another variant using instance variables (non-hash):</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>def</span> <span>extract_fees_by_type</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>)</span>
  <span>instance_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'@extract_fees_by_type'</span><span>,</span> <span>type</span><span>.</span><span>to_s</span><span>].</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>'_'</span><span>).</span><span>to_sym</span>

<h3 id="_improve_your_technical_writing_by_noel_rappin">Improve Your Technical Writing by Noel Rappin</h3>
<p>This was a two-hour workshop on technical writing. I’m always eager to get better as a writer and
communicate complex subjects in a manner that is easy to digest so was looking forward to learning
more in this space. The following are notes from attending the workshop:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The reader should always be able to understand something they were unable to do before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing is a great way to solidify and provide concrete evidence of your expertise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When writing, you want to communicate in a way that makes ideas <em>travel</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always best to write just after you have learned something and when you still have that learners
mindset.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Noel had a suggested process for tackling writing endeavors which is a nice starting blueprint but
definitely take the time to explore and deviate as best works for you. Starting with any process
helps you unblock and focus. The following focuses on tackling the problem, your perspective, and
the reader’s perspective:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Problem</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be careful not to focus entirely on the solution. You want to illuminate why this is important to
the reader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does the reader already know? Make a list and think about what you can and can’t assume.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is your goal to get across?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What value do you bring to the piece that is unique to your perspective?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What makes your perspective different?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reader</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are telling a story, like the hero’s journey, where someone doesn’t know how to do something
and now comes back with the skills needed to perform the task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to set up the problem, goal, and get the reader ready to want to learn how to solve the
problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each step should build upon the previous step. The trick is doing this well to where the reader
is also thinking the same thing right about the same time you reveal the solution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoidances</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don’t use metaphors in technical writing due to confusing people from different
languages/cultures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>There are a collection of gems/projects you’ll want to know about to get started adding type
checking to your Ruby code:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ruby/rbs">RBS</a> - Provides a language to help you describe the structure of
your Ruby programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ruby/typeprof">TypeProf</a> - Depends upon RBI and helps infer types from your
Ruby programs. The documentation is sparse but the idea is you could use this gem as a tool for
bootstrapping the addition of types to your Ruby programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/soutaro/steep">Steep</a> - Depends upon RBI and helps enforce adding type

<p><a href="https://sorbet.org/">Sorbet</a> - This is Stripe’s answer to type checking and will, supposedly,
support a subset of RBI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tupl-tufts/rdl">RDL</a> - At first, I had not recognized this gem. Then, after
digging through my notes, I remembered I had come across this gem back in 2016. There is even a
corresponding <a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2017/type-checking-ruby.html">Strange Loop
Presentation</a>. At the time of this writing, there hasn’t been any further activity or development
on this project, though.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<p>Example Implementations</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ruby/gem_rbs">Gem RBS</a> - Uses incompatible semantic versioning to provide
types for existing gems. This also means the versions defined in this project might not match with
the actual gem versions. My initial impression is that this seems a bit kludgey and a potential
source of much confusion.</p>

			<p><span>The Crash of 2008 has infused our societies with enormous scepticism on the role of the authorities, both government and Central Banks. It is quite natural that many dream of a currency that politicians, bankers and central bankers cannot manipulate; a currency of the people by the people for the people. Bitcoin has emerged as the great white hope of something of the sort. Alas, the hope it brings to many people’s hearts and minds is false. And the reason is simple: While it is true that local communities have, in the past, generated successful communitarian currencies (that enabled them to improve welfare in their midst, especially at a time of acute economic crises), <b><i>there can be no de-politicised currency capable of ‘powering’ an advanced, industrial society</i></b>.</span></p>


<p><span><b>1. What are bitcoins and what makes them a very special form of digital currency</b></span></p>
<p><span>Bitcoins are digital units of currency that one can use, on the Internet, to purchase (a limited number of) goods and services. The digital nature of bitcoin is not what makes it novel and unique. There are, indeed, a large array of digital currencies, including dollars, euros, frequent flyer points, Amazon points etc. Starting with standard (fiat) money, more than 90% of dollars, euros, yen etc. are, indeed, digital. When your bank gives you a loan, for instance, it appears as digital money in your bank account. And when you use debit/credit cards or Internet Banking in order to transfer it to someone else’s account, from whom you are buying a good or service, your dollars, euros and yen come and go as mere digital currency units. Only a tiny portion of standard money takes a paper or metallic form.</span></p>
<p><span>Similarly, when an airline grants you frequent flyer points, that you can add to by using a particular credit card or redeem on some flight, upgrade or duty free item, it is creating a digital currency that you are accumulating for the purposes of using it in the future in order to purchase goods or services. Similarly, when the European Union created its carbon trading scheme, to be used by corporations and traders, it concocted a digital stock of carbon dioxide, divided it up in small bundles, distributed them to corporations (attaching to each such bundle or unit a quantity of carbon dioxide that the bundle’s owner could emit) and then set them free to trade these bundles (or pollution rights) amongst themselves in the hope that this digital market would generate a price for carbon dioxide such that corporations would have an incentive to produce less of it and sell (to less efficient firms) the balance of their bundles. Had this scheme worked, these bundles of carbon dioxide would emerge as a digital-only currency.</span></p>
<p><span>So, bitcoin is not novel because it is a digital currency or because it is a ‘made up’ currency. Digital, ‘made up’ currencies are everywhere. What <i>is</i>, however, genuinely novel and unique about bitcoin is that no ‘one’ institution or company is safeguarding the so-called <i>Ledger</i>: the record of transactions that ensures that, when you have spent one unit of currency, there is one less unit of currency in your (digital) wallet.</span></p>
<p><span>Put differently, take gold sovereigns as an example: By their (metallic) nature they constitute private and excludable media of exchange, in the sense that if I use one to pay Mary for a car that she is selling, I shall end up with one less such unit in my wallet. The great challenge of creating a non-physical, wholly digital, currency is the pressing question: <i>If a currency unit is a string of zeros and ones on my hard disk, who can stop me from taking that string, copying and pasting it as often as I want and become infinitely ‘moneyed’?</i> For if I can do that, then it is as if all of us have a printing press in their living room, in which case we would have the makings of instant hyperinflation.</span></p>
<p><span>Until bitcoin’s emergence, the conventional wisdom was that to make a non-hyper-inflationary digital currency possible, a Ledger of Transactions, keeping track of each unit that you and I spent, must be kept by some Central Bank or some corporation. E.g. the Fed or the ECB or indeed Visa keeping track of our digital dollars, or euros. Or British Airways or Lufthansa or Amazon maintaining a Ledger of the ‘frequent flyer’-like points that they administer. Bitcoin, quite audaciously, broke the back of this assumption.</span></p>
<p><span>Bitcoin was born the day in 2008 some anonymous computer geek, using an unlikely Japanese pseudonym (<i>aka</i> Nakamoto), posted an algorithm (on some obscure listserve website) that made something remarkable possible: It could generate a string of zeros and ones that was unique, ensuring that, before it could be transferred from one computer or device to another, a minimum number of other users had to trace its transfer and verify that it left the device of the seller (of some good or service) before moving to the device of the buyer. Moreover, the algorithm was written in such a way as to guarantee a steady ‘production’ of these strings, or bitcoins, over time and in response to the computing power devoted by users in order to help track transfers and, thus, in order collectively to maintain <i>The Ledger</i>. Lastly, to cap the supply of bitcoins, and thus safeguard their value, the algorithm guaranteed that the maximum number of these strings, or bitcoins, could only grow (given the algorithm’s structure) to 21 million units by the year 2040. Once it reached that quantity, its ‘production’ would cease and the users of bitcoins would have to do with these 21 million units. Meanwhile, before that date, and before the maximum bitcoin supply is reached, the ease with which users could ‘mint’ or ‘dig up’ fresh bitcoins (by making computer power available to the bitcoin community) would be inversely related to the total quantity of bitcoins already ‘created’ or ‘extracted’ from the algorithm.</span></p>
<p><span>In a sense, the designer of the bitcoin algorithm (the delectable Mr ‘Nakamoto’, who has, by the way, dropped off the radar some time ago) seems to have designed the new currency on the basis of faith in the crudest version of the ‘monetarist’ <i>Quantity Theory of Money</i> (i.e. the idea that the value of money depended solely on the quantity of money supplied to the public) and, thus, aimed at creating the digital equivalent to… gold. Come to think of it, bitcoin was, indeed, modelled on gold.</span></p>
<p><span><b>2. Bitcoin as a digital simulation of some precious metal (e.g. gold)</b></span></p>
<p><span>What is the great merit of gold? Its scarcity! The fact that, once humans, for some strange reason (most possibly related to gold’s perpetual glitter and scarcity) started using it as (a) a means of exchange and (b) a store of value, gold became a currency and its smallest possible, meaningful, quantity became a currency unit. The designer of bitcoin’s algorithm tried his damnest to emulate gold. Just like gold, which one presumes to be in fixed supply under the Earth’s surface, bitcoin is also limited, artificially (through the design of its algorithm) to a plateau of 21 million units. And just like gold, there are two ways in which bitcoins can be acquired: One is to buy them using dollars, chickens, silk, honey, whatever… The other is to ‘dig’ for them like 19<sup>th</sup> century gold diggers dug for gold. To that intent, Mr ‘Nakamoto’ designed his brilliant algorithm in a manner that allowed for ‘bitcoin digging’. This is how he did it:</span></p>
<p><span>The uniqueness of bitcoin, as alluded to earlier, is that no centralised institution (private or public) is the custodian of the bitcoin transactions’ <i>Ledger.</i> So, who is? The answer is a spectacularly liberal-<i>cum</i>-communitarian: “We all are!” By that, what I mean is that the bitcoin algorithm is written in a manner that makes it possible (indeed demands) that the whole community of bitcoin users has access to, and polices, the Ledger of Transactions (which ensures that I cannot cut and paste my one bitcoin a large, or indeed infinite, number of times).</span></p>
<p><span>In this sense, bitcoin users must make available computing power to the bitcoin users’ community so that everyone can ‘see’ the Ledger, in order to ensure perfect community ownership of the transactions’ record, as opposed to trusting some government agency (e.g. the Fed) or some private corporation that may have its own agenda. Naturally, as the bitcoin economy, and the number of transactions grows exponentially, the amount of computing power that is necessary for one individual to devote to the ‘bitcoin community’ in order to ‘mint’, or ‘unearth’ a new bitcoin rise exponentially with time. This increasing complexity also acts as a legitimiser of the notion that new bitcoins are delivered to the accounts of the users that put increasing computing power at the bitcoin community’s disposal.</span></p>
<p><span><b>3. Bitcoin’s two fundamental flaws</b></span></p>
<p><span>As with all things digital, there are a number of concerns to do with security; with the fear of hackers and e’spivs. Imagine a world that has shifted entirely to bitcoin. Would we not live in fear that some ingenious hacker will get the better of Nakamoto’s algorithm and manipulate it to his benefit? Would it be wise for humanity simply to assume that the bitcoin algorithm is un-hackable (especially so in the absence of some authority that can intervene and save the day if something horrible happens to the algorithm)? Besides, even if the algorithm is safe, there is always the danger of waking up to the realisation that one’s bitcoin stash was e’looted during the night. And if one entrusts one’s stash to some company with better firewalls and computer security, what happens (in the absence of a bitcoin Central Bank) if that company goes broke or simply disappears into the Internet’s darker crevices (with its customers’ bitcoins)?</span></p>
<p><span>These concerns would probably suffice to put a dent in bitcoin’s prospects. But they are not the main drawbacks of the currency. No, there are two insurmountable flaws that make bitcoin a highly problematic currency: First, the bitcoin social economy is bound to be …</span></p></section></article></div></div>

<p>For a long time mediocre artists have used the stories of outliers like Vincent Van Gogh, who only sold two paintings during his lifetime, to romanticize the starving artist lifestyle.</p>



<p>They popularized the notion that is not just ok but also desirable to fail at selling your work. For them, being broke and unable to feed your family signals talent and even unrecognized genius.</p>



<p><strong>But the truth is that starving artists aren’t obscure geniuses — they’re mostly losers who suck at marketing.</strong></p>



<p>Usually, they have two main problems: they don’t understand why people buy things, and they don’t know how to effectively communicate their ideas.</p>



<p>50 years ago, there might have been some valid excuses for not knowing about consumer behavior and storytelling. But in the digital world we live today those excuses are no longer valid. If you don’t use the internet to learn these skills and sell your work is because you don’t want to.</p>



<p>Van Gogh’s case is excusable — he suffered from severe mental illness throughout his life and never even dreamed of having a computer. But you, that are mentally stable and have an internet connection, have no excuse.</p>



<p>If you don’t sell or monetize your creative work on the internet is not because you’re a genius. Quite the opposite.</p>

<p>This fall, as a creative outlet during a challenging teaching term (and as a distraction from the general mess of the world), I began posting weekly looping animations on Twitter, under the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/swirlysquaresunday">#swirlysquaresunday</a>. The idea was to find creative expression under a tight set of aesthetic constraints: a looping animation of a black-and-white checkerboard. Of course, these tight constraints still permit a wide range of <a href="http://isohedral.ca/mathematical-animated-gifs/">fun and captivating visual devices</a>. Here’s one from a few weeks ago as an example.</p>
<p><a href="http://isohedral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/out.gif"><img loading="lazy" src="http://isohedral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/out.gif" alt="" width="512" height="512"></a></p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="http://kangaroo3d.com/">Daniel Piker</a> suggested that it would be fun for a group of people interested in these looping mathematical animations to collaborate. Each would contribute a short sequence that begins and ends with a checkerboard, and we’d glue them together into one longer animation. What a lovely idea! The most famous example of this variety of collaborative artwork is what the Surrealists called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse">Exquisite Corpse</a>. Exquisite Corpse <em>animations</em> are popular too; I’ve long been a fan of <a href="https://zoomquilt.org/">The Zoomquilt</a>, and I’ve seen it done as a group project in animation courses.</p>
<p>So, let’s create a Swirled Series!</p>
<p><a href="http://isohedral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ss_logo.gif"><img loading="lazy" src="http://isohedral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ss_logo.gif" alt="" width="512" height="512"></a></p>
<p>If you’re reading this, you’re invited to submit a short animation loop. I’ll stitch them together into a final sequence. Let me lay down some rules in order to keep the process sane:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a resolution of 512×512.</li>
<li>No colour, but it’s OK to use grey levels beyond pure black and pure white.</li>
<li>Your segment should have at most 180 frames (I’ll aim to play back at 50 frames per second). It’s OK to have fewer frames.</li>
<li>Your segment should begin and end with the same frame: an 8×8 checkerboard (i.e., squares of dimension 64×64), with white in the lower-right corner.</li>
<li>You can do anything you want to get from a checkerboard back to a checkerboard, except sit still.</li>
<li>I strongly recommend that your loop have “zero derivative” at the first and last frames; that is, it should glide to a graceful stop, so that the transition to the next animation in the sequence isn’t jarring.</li>
<li>I would prefer to receive your submission in the form of a zip file containing a directory of PNG images named <code>frame000.png</code>, <code>frame001.png</code>, … <code>frame179.png</code>.</li>
<li>You grant me a non-exclusive, irrevocable license to use your images non-commercially, in animations, for education and research.&nbsp; Conceivably, if the result is entertaining, I might submit it to, say, the Bridges Short Film festival. In all cases, contributors will receive appropriate credit.</li>
<li>The deadline is <strong>Friday, November 27th</strong>. I’ll aim to publish the result the following week.</li>
</ul>
<p>To contribute, send your zipfile to me at <code>swirledseries@gmail.com</code>, or send me a link where I can download it.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that this becomes popular, it’s possible I’ll receive more submissions than I know what to do with. In that case, please accept my apologies in advance as I work out some sort of compromise. I may have to choose who gets in by lottery or submission order, and impose a limit of one submission per person. Most likely, I’d simply keep doing this and roll extra submissions into future animations.</p>
<p>Thanks for playing with us!</p>

<p>Probability is a measure defined on events, which are sets of primitive outcomes. Probability theory mostly comes down to constructing events and measuring them. A measure is a generalization of size which corresponds to length, area, and volume (rather than the bijective mapping definition of cardinality).</p>

<p>The first half of this article is ostensibly devoted to explaining the definition of probability, but that is not my priority. I’m most interested in providing a useful conceptual map, asking and discussing interesting questions, and developing intuition. I provide many links to technical details and further readings. My opening exposition on definitions is brief. If it does not all make sense, please look at other resources. Hopefully this article at least makes those other sources easier to use.</p>

<p>This post is also a pedagogical experiment. I structured this article to be read twice. The first pass is without measure theory, and the second pass is with measure theory. Measure-theory content is hidden by default, e.g. <span><span>like this</span></span>. Simply ignore <span><span>purple text</span></span> the <span><span>first time</span><label for="796b5f2304883e2b8a1737199bea4fcbd95c2af7"> ⊕</label><span><span>Unless you are already acquainted with measure theory, but then you can just look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms#Axioms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia’s definition of probability</a> to understand the gist of probability theory.</span></span></span> you read this post. Then in the <a href="#primer-to-measure-theory">measure theory section</a> at the end of this post you will see a button to show all the hidden text (and you can just click on <span><span>purple text</span></span> anywhere in the post to show it).</p>

<p>Why? Because I see plenty of introductions to probability that leave out measure theory entirely. The problem with them is that a lot of the common probability notation, e.g. random variables, only really makes sense when you understand measures. On the other hand, if you crack open a rigorous text on probability theory (e.g. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/383472.Statistical_Inference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Casella &amp; Berger</a> or <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387953823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shao</a>), it may not be obvious why all this extra complexity with events, sigma-algebras and measure spaces is necessary.</p>

<p>When learning about probability and measure theory myself, I wish I had a resource that both provides precise definitions and intuitions for why these definitions are the way they are, and without wading through a lot of extraneous details. I don’t know if I’ve succeeded in that here, but this is my attempt.</p>



<h2 id="beginner"><a href="#beginner">Beginner</a></h2>

<p>The full definition of probability is below, but to avoid overwhelm, you may first look at this <em>attempt</em> at defining probability. Many people intuitively think of probability this way. Notably, I’ve left out the event space.</p>

<p><strong>Sample set</strong> $\Omega$ is a set of all possible <span><span>samples</span><label for="46f0a5784f51b77c385f44317a48bc352dcfb439"> ⊕</label><span><span>Sample is synonymous with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(probability)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outcome</a>.</span></span></span> $\omega\in\Omega$. A sample is a possible state of the world, e.g. the outcomes for all coins that will be tossed or all dice that will be thrown, or the ordering of cards in a deck.</p>

<p><strong>Probability function</strong> <span><span>$P : 2^\Omega \to [0, 1]$</span><label for="0574240032f5e0595cbf5977a6d3da50278d4847"> ⊕</label><span><span>$2^\Omega$ is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">power set</a> of $\Omega$. The notation $2^{(\cdot)}$ is just a shorthand, though set exponentiation could be <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/901742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defined in general</a>, e.g. $A^B$ is the set of all functions $f : B \to A$, and $n^A$, where $n$ is a natural number, generates the set of all $n$-ary indicator functions . Then $2^A$ gives us all indicator functions  select the elements of every subset of $A$.</span></span></span> gives the probability of a <span><span>set of samples</span><label for="ad8b3af703fafd99caa4527f4b15b75a1975d039"> ⊕</label><span><span>subset of $\Omega$</span></span></span>. A set of samples ${\omega_1, \omega_2, \ldots}$ is called an <strong>event</strong>, which is a set of possible states the world could be in, read as “$\omega_1$ is the case or $\omega_2$ is the case, etc. …”</p>

<p>$P$ satisfies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Non-negativity</strong>: .</li>
  <li>
<strong>Null empty set</strong>: .</li>
  <li>
<strong>Unit sample set</strong>: .</li>

<h2 id="full-definition"><a href="#full-definition">Full Definition</a></h2>

<p>The beginner definition above does not define an event space. This is actually a problem when working with uncountable sample spaces, because not all subsets of an uncountable space can be measured. If that statement confuses you, don’t worry about it and read through this post. Then read my <a href="#primer-to-measure-theory">primer to measure theory</a> at the end which outlines why not every set can be measured. Though this may seem like a minor technicality, specifying what sets can be measured allows probability theory to be <span><span>a lot more general than it otherwise could be,</span><label for="a0359426bd6a552c43a72d1b7b5e568b41b95f0d"> ⊕</label><span><span>This is Kolmogorov’s achievement. Definitions of probability like my beginner definition had been around for hundreds of years prior.</span></span></span> specifically when dealing with real numbers.</p>

<p>Here is a compact but complete definition of probability:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Sample set</strong> $\Omega$ is a set of all possible <span><span>samples</span><label for="46f0a5784f51b77c385f44317a48bc352dcfb439"> ⊕</label><span><span>Sample is synonymous with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(probability)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outcome</a>.</span></span></span>.
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Sample</strong> $\omega \in \Omega$ (i.e. primitive outcome) is a possible state of the world. Samples are disjoint, meaning only one sample can be the case at a time. Samples can be any kind of mathematical object.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Event space</strong> $E \subseteq 2^\Omega$ is the set of subsets of $\Omega$ for which we are <span><span>allowed to assign probability.</span><label for="f8b43cebd8d878851c96f6b83253241ae0914c18"> ⊕</label><span><span>The sets omitted from $E$ are not measurable, but again if you are not familiar with measure theory don’t worry about why some sets cannot be measured until the end of this post.</span></span></span> We require that $\emptyset, \Omega \in E$ <span><span>and $E$ is required to be a <a href="#sigma-algebra">$\sigma$-algebra</a> that contains the measurable subsets of $\Omega$. The tuple $(\Omega, E)$ is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">measurable space</a>.</span></span>
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Event</strong> $e \in E$ is a <span><span>measurable</span></span> set of samples. Samples $\omega \in e$ are <span><span>considered identical</span><label for="b69039dc8767a7b19268d3134cd1eccd7a91f7de"> ⊕</label><span><span>Different samples in $\Omega$ are indeed distinct objects, but their difference does not matter in the context of event $e$.</span></span></span> w.r.t. $e$.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Probability measure</strong> <span><span>$P : E \to [0, 1]$</span><label for="4ad9ab16708369ac059ab042be9927eff00636f9"> ⊕</label><span><span>In general a measure $Q : E \to \real_{\geq 0}$, but I’m including the restriction of the co-domain to the unit interval $[0, 1]$ in the definition of , because we are only talking about probability measures here, and there’s no reason to be more general.</span></span></span> is a function that maps allowed subsets of $\Omega$ to the real unit interval. $P$ is a <strong>measure</strong>, which means it satisfies certain properties that make it behave analogous to length, area, volume, etc. in Euclidean space. Essentially, a measure is a generalization of size that satisfies the following properties:
    <ul>
      <li><span><span><strong>Measurable domain</strong>: $E$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of measurable sets.</span></span></li>
      <li>
<strong>Non-negativity</strong>: .</li>
      <li>
<strong>Null empty set</strong>: .</li>
      <li>
<strong>Unit sample set</strong>: .</li>
      <li>
<strong>Countable additivity</strong>: For any countable set of events <span><span></span><label for="1c4c2f199fe96ef43d1f0b6cc492af4deb8af6af"> ⊕</label><span><span>Remember that $E$ is the event space, and $A$ is a set of events.</span></span></span> where , .</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The triple $(\Omega, E, P)$ defines a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">probability space</a> <span><span>which is also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">measure space</a>.</span></span> These three objects are all we need to do probability calculations.</p>

<h2 id="kolmogorov-axioms-of-probability"><a href="#kolmogorov-axioms-of-probability">Kolmogorov axioms of probability</a></h2>

<p>You may have heard of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms#Axioms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kolmogorov axioms of probability</a>. Kolmogorov formalized probability as a special case of measure theory. Essentially a probability measure is a normalized measure, i.e. assigns 1 to the entire sample space $\Omega$. Above, I’ve merged the axioms of measure theory with Kolmogorov’s axioms. For reference, here are Kolmogorov’s axioms given separately:</p>
<ol>
  <li>$P(e) \in [0, 1], \forall e \in E$, where $[0, 1] \subset \real$.</li>
  <li>$P(\Omega) = 1$, i.e. probability of anything happening is 1.</li>
  <li><span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_additivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$\sigma$-additivity</a> on $E$.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span>Given the axioms of measure theory, we can define probability succinctly by simply stating that $(\Omega, E, P)$ is a measure space where $P(\Omega) = 1$ (see <a href="https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/measure-book1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terence Tao’s Introduction to Measure Theory</a>).</span></span></p>

<p><strong>Finite</strong>: Dice rolls</p>

<p>,<br>
,<br>
.</p>

<p>Note that  is not defined. $P$ measures the “size” of sets.  is the set containing one sample. We can also compute the probability of larger sets, e.g.<br>
,<br>
,<br>
.</p>

<p><strong>Countable</strong> (event set): Variable length binary sequences</p>

<p> is the binary alphabet.<br>
Let $x \in \bin^n$ be a binary sequence of any length $n$, and  returns the length of $x$.</p>

<p>The sample set is all infinite binary sequences, .<br>
This let’s us make an event for each finite length $x$.<br>
Let , where  is the length $\len{x}$ prefix of $\omega$.<br>
The event set is </p>

<p>Then  is the probability of $x$, and  is the probability of the set .<br>
Note that the probability of a finite sequence is always a marginal probability, in the sense that  where  and  are the concatenations of  with 0 or 1.</p>

<p>An example of such a measure is the uniform measure, .</p>

<p><strong>Uncountable</strong>: The reals</p>

<p>,<br>
 contains sets of reals formed by countable union, intersection, and complement of the open intervals. <span><span>This particular choice of $E$ is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Borel algebra</a>, and is a standard $\sigma$-algebra for $\real$. The reason we don’t use $E = 2^\real$ as our event space is that some subsets of $\real$ are not measurable.</span></span></p>

<p>We only need to define $P$ on single intervals, and because of additivity of probability we can derive $P$ on every set in $E$. <span><span>A measure $P$ defined on intervals is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_measure#On_the_real_line" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Borel measure</a>.</span></span> Let</p>



<p>Note that it does not matter if we define $P$ on open intervals, closed intervals, or half-open intervals, because the value of the integral is identical between these cases. <span><span>Specifically, we are performing a Lebesgue integral, which is …</span></span></p></article></div>

		<span>November 20 2020</span>
		
		<p>In the latest chapter of <a href="https://www.thegadhian.com/posts/getting-your-shit-together">getting my shit together</a>, I've moved all my notes from <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> to <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. In this post, I talk a bit about why I think it's cool, and how I use it on my mobile.</p>
<h2>What is Obsidian?</h2>
<p>Obsidian is the latest in the recent vogue of "Second Brain" apps. Essentially it's a place to take notes, and capture ``[[relationships]]` between those notes, resulting in something like your own personal Wikipedia.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.thegadhian.com/posts/using-obsidian-with-termux-and-vim/obsidian.png" alt="My knowledge graph in Obsidian"></p>
<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Daily Notes</strong>: this is where I spend most of my time, capturing anything interesting that happened that day, tasks that come up etc. If something warrants more thought, I'll later turn it into a note of it's own.</li>
<li><strong>Work</strong>: I'll usually keep note files for people (to store notes from 1-1s, anything interesting about them), projects, and occasionally meetings - relating them all together. I'll also create separate notes for any opnions that I'm forming.</li>
<li><strong>Learning</strong>: anything I'm learning about, or reading/watching that I might want to remember later will have a note.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't really know if it's <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#the-introduction-to-the-zettelkasten-method">zettelkasten</a>, <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes">evergreen notes</a>, or <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/">GTD</a>, or <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/">bullet journaling</a>. It doesn't really matter.</p>
<h2>Why switch from Notion?</h2>
<p>Notion is great, and definitely does a lot of things better than Obsidian does (particularly in the project management space). I had an awfully elaborate setup with Notion, with all sorts of relational databases. I found that this added a lot of overhead, both for capturing notes and navigating them.</p>
<p>The selling point of Obsidian for me was that all the notes are (more or less) regular markdown, and stored on <a href="https://plaintextproject.online/index.html">plain text files</a> on your own hard drive. There was something rather romantic about the idea of actually owning your own thoughts. Even if the app disappears one day, my notes will still be there in a usable format.</p>
<p>This emphasis on just writing text, and navigating organically through the graph feels like it's led to me writing more.</p>
<h2>What about mobile?</h2>
<p>The caveat was that Obsidian currently only has a desktop app. It's on their <a href="https://trello.com/b/Psqfqp7I/obsidian-roadmap">roadmap</a>, which the two-person team seem to be blistering through.</p>
<p>However the beauty of having plain text files is that I can do <em>whatever I want</em> with them. This is how I've set up my mobile note-taking.</p>
<h3>Syncthing</h3>
<p>To get the files onto my phone (and between my laptops), I use an open source app called <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a>. This works a bit like <code>rsync</code>, and does it's best to keep the files in sync across any connected devices. As most of my notes are small, self-contained files, conflicts tend to be quite rare.</p>
<h3>Termux</h3>
<p>While there are a handful of markdown editing apps available on Android, I prefer to stick with the soothing familiarity of VIM to do my editing. To achieve this, I use an <em>incredible</em> app called <a href="https://termux.com/">Termux</a>.</p>
<p>Termux is a terminal emulator with a large collection of Linux packages - which allows you to use things like git, node.js, ssh, and VIM all from the comfort of your tiny phone.</p>
<pre><code>termux-setup-storage
pkg update
pkg install vim
</code></pre>
<p>With these three commands, I was able to setup Termux to be able to see my synced vault folder, and edit with VIM.</p>
<p><small>(*<em>Okay I also installed git and cloned my dotfiles and installed all my regular VIM plugins. But you get the gist.</em>)</small></p>
<p>One slight annoyance is the the folder will be in different places on each device. To handle that, I have a <code>.extra</code> file to keep environment-specific config, to which which I've added:</p>
<p><code>export KB_DIRECTORY=/storage/shared/kb</code></p>
<h3>VIM</h3>
<p>While it was great to edit the files in VIM, without the graph view and backlink support it was a lot harder to navigate..</p>
<p>Fortunately, with a few additional lines to <code>.vimrc</code>, we can make this easier!</p>
<pre><code>autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.md setlocal filetype=markdown
autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile $KB_DIRECTORY* setlocal path+=$KB_DIRECTORY/**
set suffixesadd+=.md
</code></pre>
<p>These three lines do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the filetype to markdown for md files, which gives us some syntax highlighting</li>
<li>If I'm in any file in the knoweldge base, set my <code>path</code> to include all subdirectories of that folder. This means that when using <code>gf</code> to "go to file under cursor", or using <code>:find</code> to find a file, we can look at all then notes in any of my subdirectories.</li>
<li>Add <code>.md</code> to the list of "default" suffixes. When using <code>gf</code> to navigate to a file, VIM will try all theses suffixes as it looks for the file in the path.</li>
</ol>
<p>The combination of the above means that if I have a [[Backlink]] that points to <code>/SubFolder/Backlink.md</code>, I can put my cursor over the [[Backlink]], hit <code>gf</code> and VIM will be able to navigate to that file. Success!</p>
<h3>Termux API &amp; Widget</h3>
<p>So I now have the ability to edit my notes on my phone, but it's still a bit of a faff. Ideally on a mobile, I'd want to be able to quickly capture a note, and easily find a particular note to refer to.</p>
<p>The first thing I want is the ability to capture a note quickly. As the notes are plain text files, I can easily manipulate them with bash.</p>
<p>I have a bash function that will find or create the daily note file for today's date, and append whatever I type as a bullet to that file.</p>
<pre><code>today() {
	now=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d");
	if ([[ -z $1 ]]); then
		vim "$KB_DIRECTORY/Daily/$now.md"
	else
		echo $"- $@" &gt;&gt; "$KB_DIRECTORY/Daily/$now.md"

	fi
}
</code></pre>
<p>This allows me, wherever I am in the CLI, to type <code>today I did some stuff</code>, and it will add that to my note!</p>
<p>I have a similar (imperfect) function to be able to fuzzy find any note in my knowledge base:</p>
<pre><code>kb() {
	existing=$(find $KB_DIRECTORY -iname \*"$*"\*.md | head -n 1)
	if ([[ -n "$existing" ]]); then
		vim "$existing"
	else
		vim "$KB_DIRECTORY/$*.md"
	fi
}
</code></pre>
<p>This function allows me to type <code>kb obsidian</code> and it will find the first match it finds with obsidian in the name.</p>
<p>That's all well and good, but still involves opening up Termux and typing a bunch a stuff in. Termux has some additional packages that can be installed, which further integrate it with the Android OS.</p>
<p>In particular, I use Termux API, and Termux Widget.</p>
<p><code>pkg install termux-api</code></p>
<p>Termux allows you to create bash scripts in <code>~/.shortcuts/</code> (or <code>~/.shortcuts/tasks</code> for background tasks), which can then be accessed from a homescreen widget. And with Termux API, we can use some of the OS's input facilities. So, I can have a shortcut like the below:</p>
<pre><code>#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash
source ~/.functions
source ~/.extra

result=$(termux-dialog -t "Note" | jq -r '.text');

today "$result"
</code></pre>
<p>This script opens up a Dialog box which lets me type in a note, uses jq to parse the JSON result of that dialog and extract the text, and uses the <code>today</code> bash function from earlier to capture it in my daily note!</p>
<p>Even better, we can do the same thing with a voice note!</p>
<pre><code>result=$(termux-dialog speech -t "Note" | jq -r '.text');
</code></pre>
<h2>The Result</h2>
<p>Behold, in all it's nerdy goodness:</p>

<p>
A lot of tech discussion these days is focused around scaling web app infrastructures to handle huge traffic.
</p>
<p>
Hacker News abounds with posts about Kubernetes, distributed systems and database replication; the <a href="https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer" target="_blank">Large-Scale System Design Primer</a> on GitHub is extremely well-loved (113k stars) and chock full of advice on memcache clusters and DB sharding.
</p>
<p>
In all the heady excitement of getting your web-based notepad app ready to handle 10 billion daily users, it's important not to forget the power of modern computing hardware and how far simple optimizations can go.
</p>
<p>
You're probably not Facebook. Setting up FAANG-level infrastructure won't make your company into a FAANG, any more than a cargo cult can summon supply-bearing planes by building fake runways and wooden ATC towers. 
</p>
<p>
There's a place for big, scalable cluster infrastructures, but it's a larger scale than many organizations think.
</p>
<h3>The case for optimizing</h3>

<p>
It may sound obvious, but - optimizing your app to fulfill a request in 1/10 the time is like adding 9 servers to a cluster. Optimizing to 1/100 the time (reducing requests from say 1.5 sec to 15ms) is like adding 99 servers. 
</p>
<p>
That's a 1U server doing the work of <em>two 42U server racks</em>, formerly busy turning inefficient code into heat. 
</p>
<p>
That may be an extreme case - but unnecessary bloat is common, and these kinds of gains could be as simple as adding a well-chosen index to speed up a common query by 10x or 100x, or caching some seldom-changing response in memory rather than re-rendering it every time. 
</p>
<p>
Optimizing is good for the world, too:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1/10 or 1/100 the carbon footprint</li>
<li>Cleaner, more maintainable code and systems - optimizing often just means simplifying and removing unnecessary parts</li>
<li>Snappier experience for users (latency is generally lower if you can optimize enough to run on a single server rather than a bunch of networked ones)</li>
<li>Reduced hosting costs</li>
<li>Happier users - developers can focus more on solving users' problems and less on infrastructure</li>

</ul>
<p>
Of course there's a tradeoff between the cost of cloud infrastructure and the cost of paying developers to optimize; but paying developers to set up app clusters and database replication costs money too, and has fewer of the benefits and cost savings.
</p>
<h3>Modern computers are mind-numbingly fast</h3>

<p>
Writing the game engine in C++ for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1090060/Weapon_Hacker/" target="_blank">Weapon Hacker</a>, a side project of mine, taught me a lot about how powerful modern hardware really is. 
</p>
<p>
Coming from a C# / Python / Javascript / JIT-compiled world, my early experiments putting graphics on the screen in native C++ and DirectX were startling; the compiled executable was tiny, started up instantly, and could put hundreds of thousands of objects on the screen at 60 frames per second without breaking a sweat. 
</p>
<p>
A 60 FPS target gives games about 16ms to do all the work they need to in a frame. Weapon Hacker doesn't even compare to what modern AAA engines do, but it generates its random worlds in about 15ms (which last for about an hour-long playthru), and it handles frames with thousands of particles, physics objects, textures, font glyphs and graphical primitives, as well as sound mixing and music streaming, in about 5ms on a 2010-era CPU.
</p>
<p>
Compared to a game engine, the job of most web apps is incredibly mundane: take a request (some HTTP text) and return a response (some HTML or JSON or some such). And yet, 100ms or 500ms request processing times are common. Sometimes the info returned is expensive to generate, but it pays not to forget that in the end it's just inputting some bytes and outputting some bytes. 
</p>
<p>
Given the relative simplicity of the task, 16ms of processing per request (after subtracting network latency) should be achievable in most web applications.
</p>
<p>
On a cheap $5/month dual-core cloud VM, that would allow about 7,500 requests per minute. Or 7,500 pageviews, if you offload static stuff to a CDN. That means 10.8M per day, or 324M pageviews per month. 
</p>
<p>
Of course traffic wouldn't be evenly spread throughout the day, and cloud computing is generally priced for burst loads. But, let's be honest - your traffic isn't anywhere near 324M pageviews, right?
</p>
<p>
If not, condolences that Notepadly.io isn't a market behemoth yet - but congratulations, you can divert some time from multi-master replication and spot instance auto-scaling, and add a cool Clippy virtual assistant instead. Your users will thank you for it.
</p>
<h3>Optimization basics</h3>

<p>
Server-side optimization is a big topic, and there are likely people much better at it (and at explaining it) than I am, so here are just a few general pointers.
</p>
<p>
First - measure.
</p>
<p>
This can be as simple as putting timers around sections of code to see how many milliseconds they take to execute. Or, look at TTFB (time to first byte) in the Network tab of your browser's dev tools. 
</p>
<p>
2ms and 200ms requests seem similar to human perception, despite a massive 100x time difference, so it pays to have hard data.
</p>
<p>
Run simple stress tests to see how much traffic your app can handle. A simple one-page python script on a nearby VM or a dev machine can easily spin up a bunch of threads to make requests as fast as possible. Count the number of completed requests in, say, 30 seconds and watch your server's CPU, memory and IO usage to see where they max out.
</p>
<p>
Compare your stress test results to your day-to-day traffic, and aim for enough headroom that a normal day's traffic peaks at ~1% capacity (or whatever makes sense for your business).
</p>
<p>
Once you have some baseline measurements, here are a few common performance improvements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Cache infrequently-changing responses in server memory</li>
<li>Optimize your database queries - add a well-chosen index, or delete an unneeded one (indices are separate internal tables, so you can sometimes save a lot of storage space and I/O time by removing one); tweak your WHERE conditions to narrow down the rows the DB has to scan through internally</li>
<li>Reduce the number of HTTP requests; don't let REST purists tell you you need a separate URL for each entity - if your app always needs customer &amp; order data at the same time, make it a single API call</li>
<li>Let clients cache static files indefinitely; use cache-breakers on the URLs for content changes</li>
<li>Offload static files to a CDN</li>
<li>Make sure your web server and database are set up and tuned right - that they have enough memory, threads, etc.</li>
<li>Consider a fast single-file database like <a href="https://sqlite.org/whentouse.html" target="_blank">SQLite</a>; it's not for every application, but I've found it handles individual queries about 5x faster than the big client-server DBMS's, with about 1/5 the storage space, and with much less administrative complexity. With its performance numbers it can actually power large sites. It also supports sharding scenarios (e.g. a database file per customer) which can get around the write-concurrency limitations for some applications.</li>
<li>Learn about code performance - in particular the dominance of memory latency as a slowdown factor, and the high price of I/O. Chandler Carruth has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHNmRkzxHWs" target="<em>blank">a great talk</a> on these from a C++ perspective. And Mike Acton's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc" target="</em>blank">talk on data-oriented design</a> is a classic.</li>

</ul>
<h3>You can upgrade your VM in a pinch</h3>

<p>
Cloud hosts usually let you upgrade to a higher-powered VM pretty easily in the event of some viral flood of traffic; in AWS, on my clients' projects, we have been able to launch more powerful EC2 instances (and vise-versa, consolidate to smaller, cheaper instances) by cloning to an AMI image, launching a new instance, and rerouting the same elastic IP, in about 5 minutes. If you freeze data changes, you can even stay online during the transition.
</p>
<p>
That could buy you time to think about clustering if you reach the scale where you need it.
</p>
<h3>In summary</h3>

<p>
There's a time and a scale for big distributed computing setups. But modern CPUs and cloud VMs are insanely fast, and the job of most web apps is incredibly mundane - you can get very far with some basic optimizations, and will likely do the world, your developers and your users some favors in the process.

<p>MySQL and MariaDB optionally log slow queries into the Slow Query Log – or just Slow Log, as friends call it. However, <strong>there are good reasons to log all the queries</strong>, not just some of them. This article shows how to log all available information into the Slow Log.</p>

<h2><span id="Why_cant_I_only_log_the_slowest_queries">Why can’t I only log the slowest queries?</span></h2>
<p>There are several reasons to log all queries. This list is not exhaustive:</p>
<ul><li>If you have a locking query that takes 0.5 seconds and runs 10 times per second, most probably optimising it is much more relevant than a query that takes 1 second and is executed once per second. Logging the slowest queries may result in <strong>bad priorities</strong>.</li><li>Threshold are not smart. Put a 5 seconds threshold, and you will never know that a very frequent query takes 4.9 seconds. Logging the slowest queries <strong>hides important queries</strong>.</li><li>Suppose you only log queries that take 5 or more seconds. If a query takes less than 1 second more of the times and ore than 5 seconds in rare cases (which typically depends on data distribution) you will lose this information. Logging the slowest queries may <strong>hide the real behaviour</strong> of a query.</li><li>If you don’t log relatively fast queries, you cannot analyse your workload and see, for example, that many locking statements insist on the same table.</li><li>You want to see and remove <a href="https://federico-razzoli.com/run-less-queries-in-mysql"><strong>useless queries</strong></a>.</li><li>For some queries it is perfectly ok to take a long time (one-time queries, cached queries, analytics…). This makes any time threshold <strong>not very significant</strong>.</li></ul>
<h2><span id="How_to_apply_the_changes">How to apply the changes</span></h2>
<p>Below you can find the variables to change, as they should be written in the configuration file (most probably <code>/etc/mysql/my.cnf</code> or <code>/etc/my.cnf</code>). Note that <strong>changes in the configuration file will take effect on MySQL restart</strong>.</p>
<p>You avoid restarting MySQL, but I recommend to make the changes to the configuration file anyway, in case it crashes.</p>
<p><strong>To change variables values at runtime:</strong></p>
<pre><code>SET GLOBAL variable_name := 1;
SET GLOBAL variable_name := 'value'; # string values</code></pre>
<p>This only takes effect for <strong>new connections</strong>. You are not logging all queries until all existing connections are closed and new ones are established.</p>
<h2><span id="Setting_the_Slow_Log">Setting the Slow Log</span></h2>
<p>Here you can find the correct setting to use to log all your queries, depending on which MySQL flavour you use.</p>

<p>On MySQL 5.0 didn’t allow to log all the queries. <code>long_query_time</code> was required to be an integer and the minimum value was 1. Therefore all we can to is logging queries that don’t use an index or take at least one second.</p>

<h3><span id="Other_forks">Other forks</span></h3>
<p>WarpSQL 8.0 is based on MySQL 8.0, so you can use the same settings for the slow log.</p>
<h2><span id="Is_the_Slow_Log_slow">Is the Slow Log slow?</span></h2>
<p>In most cases, the slow log performance impact is minimum. It may sound scary to think that MySQL will write something into a file for every single statement; but not if you know the amount of IO that is required for every single statement (undo log, redo log, binlog, doublewrite, potentially reads from tablespaces) and InnoDB background threads. And the slow log is just a sequential write-only file. Slow log access is governed by a lock, but in practice this can only slow down very intensive workloads.</p>
<p>That said, if your IO is nearly saturated, <strong>Percona Server and MariaDB allows to throttle the slow log</strong>. Which means, multiple queries will be written to the file together, to reduce the IO operations. Take a look at <code><a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/server-system-variables/#log_slow_rate_limit">log_slow_rate_limit</a></code>. Note however that, if you do so, some queries will not be logged.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Thanks Peter Zaitsev for reporting to me that <code>log_slow_rate_limit</code> was first implemented and is also supported in Percona Server. This allowed me to fix a wrong sentence in the article. He wasn’t able to write a comment on Federico-Razzoli.com, where this article was originally published, because of a problem in that website (now fixed).</p>

    <p>This article will outline the installation of the open-source Youtube front-end <a href="https://sr.ht/~cadence/tube/">Cloudtube</a> by <a href="https://cadence.moe/">Cadence</a> – who also is the author of the open-source Instagram front-end called <a href="https://bibliogram.art/">Bibliogram</a>.</p>

<p>This allows you to watch Youtube with no ads and quite a bit more privacy.</p>

<p>Cloudtube is an alternative to <a href="https://invidious.site/">Invidious</a>, if you’ve heard of it.</p>

<p>Cloudtube consists of two different pieces of software:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~cadence/Second">Second</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~cadence/cloudtube">Cloudtube</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="second-installation">Second Installation:</h2>

<p>Pull and run the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/heywoodlh/second">Second Docker image</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>docker pull heywoodlh/second:latest
docker run <span>-d</span> <span>--name</span><span>=</span>second <span>\</span>
	<span>--restart</span><span>=</span>unless-stopped <span>--network</span><span>=</span>host <span>\</span>
	<span>-e</span> <span>WEBSITE_ORIGIN</span><span>=</span><span>"http://localhost:3000"</span> <span>\</span>
	heywoodlh/second
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Second should now be running on port 3000 of your host.</p>

<h2 id="cloudtube-installaion">Cloudtube Installaion</h2>

<p>Create the directories where the database and config will live for Cloudtube:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> /opt/cloudtube/db
<span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> /opt/cloudtube/config
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now create a config file in <code>/opt/cloudtube/config/config.js</code> with the following content:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>module.exports = {
        user_settings: {
                instance: {
                        default: "http://localhost:3000"
                }
        }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Make sure the Cloudtube files are owned by the UID/GID of the user in the container image:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>chown -R 1000:1000 /opt/cloudtube/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pull and run the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/heywoodlh/cloudtube">Cloudtube Docker image</a>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>docker pull heywoodlh/cloudtube:latest
docker run -d --name=cloudtube \
	--user=1000 \
	--restart=unless-stopped --network=host \
	-v /opt/cloudtube/db:/opt/cloudtube/db \
	-v /opt/cloudtube/config:/opt/cloudtube/config \
	heywoodlh/cloudtube
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Access the web interface for Cloudtube on port 10412 of your host, I.E. <code>http://server-name:10412</code>.</p>



<p>This installation should be performed as the root user and these commands assume you are on Debian, Ubuntu or one of their derivative distributions.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" width="4000" height="6000" src="https://www.asaremedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/business-acumen.jpg" alt="business acumen"></figure>



<p>Business leaders exist at every level of a company. They are responsible for making decisions to drive the company forward. Sometimes, you will hear these people described as having <a href="https://brunchwork.com/newsletter?ucode=YASARE1983" rel="nofollow">strong business acumen</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before you start scratching your head and wondering what this is precisely, we can break it down for you. Business acumen is easy to understand. More crucially, it is something you can build over time when you know how to recognize it. Let’s dive into understanding this ability, why it matters, and how you can develop it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Defining It</strong></h2>



<p>Business acumen is the “<a href="http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=business-acumen" rel="nofollow">keenness and speed in understanding and deciding on a business situation</a>.” In other words, it is the thought process and intention that goes into deciding on an action and understanding the key factors presented. It also involves the comprehension skills needed to understand all possible routes and outcomes available. With this insight, leaders grasp the potential consequences and necessary trade-offs necessary for optimal results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A leader with strong business acumen can unpack complex situations. They make the right call and understand how the intricate interrelationships of a business work together. Accomplishing this is no easy task, but it will go far in benefiting the company.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Operationally Speaking&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Business acumen can tie directly into daily and long-term operations. This speed and keenness are crucial for breaking down seemingly simple questions that have complicated answers. Some of those questions include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>What are the individual roles and contributions present here?</li><li>How does this company/industry generate revenue?</li><li>What elements will be essential in determining if an action will or will not work?</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Developmentally Speaking&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>If you feel uncertain about your business acumen, don’t worry! The good news is that it not an innate ability. One does not come into the world with strong business acumen and the ability to quickly make complex decisions.</p>



<p>This skill is something people develop over time, often through formal leadership training. It involves enhancing awareness and recognition of critical skills necessary for strong leadership and management.</p>



<h2><strong>Skillfully Speaking&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>So, what are the skills behind a strong business acumen? Well, a person who wishes to develop these comprehension skills fully will:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Focus on key objectives</li><li>Obtain essential information efficiently</li><li>Recognize options and obstacles for potential solutions</li><li>Understand and weight trade-offs through a logical thought process</li><li>Identify routes to overcome obstacles</li><li>Set plans into motion to accomplish objectives</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Do You Have It?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Overall, this ability will enable you to form broader frameworks for the ultimate benefit of the business. You can focus on the big picture without completely overlooking the finer details. This combination will be to your advantage as you tackle big-picture problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can further develop this by focusing on four elements, which include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Understanding your thought process<br>Improving overall business knowledge&nbsp;<br>Recognizing your management style while exploring other styles&nbsp;<br>Enhancing leadership and management skills</li></ul>



<p>If you want to continue developing this ability, focus on strengthening analytical skills, enhancing logical thinking, and remaining disciplined. Fine-tuning these qualities will enable you to face complicated problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You know backups right? Those things you never got around to setting up… well no need to feel guilty any longer, today
I’m excited to share my new backup tool - <a href="https://bupstash.io/">Bupstash</a>!</p>
<p>So why is bupstash cool? Bupstash lets you make encrypted, deduplicated and secure backups.
Bupstash is fast, focused, and places strong emphasis on both security and privacy. Backups can happen to local drives or over ssh. Bupstash can backup files, directories, and even arbitrary command output.</p>
<p>Bupstash was designed to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Efficient deduplication - Bupstash can store hundreds of encrypted directory snapshots using a fraction of the space encrypted tarballs would require.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offline decryption keys - Backups do not require the decryption key be anywhere near an at-risk server or computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key/value tagging with search - all while keeping the tags fully encrypted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great performance on slow networks - Bupstash really strives to work well on high latency networks like cellular and connections to far-off lands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure access controls - Ransomware and disgruntled business partners will be powerless to delete your backups, even after a
full system take over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient incremental backups - Bupstash knows what it backed up last time and skips that work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds great right? How does it work?</p>

<p>Bupstash stores data as a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle tree</a> with encrypted root nodes. Each
time a file is saved, it is split into data chunks, which are
encrypted (using crypto_box_curve25519xchacha20poly1305 from <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium">libsodium</a>) and then sent to or saved in the backup repository if they have never been seen before.</p>
<p>To identify encrypted chunks for deduplication, we use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a> of the decrypted contents. The HMAC
key is a shared secret between the encryption key and the decryption key. This means
someone cannot guess a chunk’s contents based on the deduplication address in the backup
repository.</p>
<p>The end result is that many snapshots which share similar data also share encrypted chunks, resulting in very space-efficient backups. My personal backup repository
contains over 400 snapshots of my 40 GB home directory and weighs in at around 50 GB total.</p>

<p>In bupstash a key is either a ‘main key’ or a ‘put key’. Backups made by put keys can only be decrypted by the original
main key. With this setup, you can send backups to a bupstash repository without ever risking your decryption key.</p>
<p>You can imagine Bupstash’s model like when you send someone a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard">GPG</a>-encrypted email and you do not have access to their decryption key. Instead you use asymmetric cryptography and send data addressed
to their private key. Another benefit of the email-like model is that the email provider does not need access to your
decryption keys to store or forward your emails. Likewise, a remote bupstash repository never needs access
to your backup decryption keys to operate.</p>

<p>Bupstash maintains all backups in a mostly append-only log of encrypted backup metadata.
In order to allow searching that metadata, bupstash syncs the metadata log client-side before
performing decryption and searches client-side. This design sacrifices some performance for search and
listing in favour of fully encrypted metadata. In practice bupstash can easily search hundreds to thousands of snapshots
in seconds.</p>

<p>Bupstash focuses on backup and restore streaming, avoiding network round trips as much as possible.</p>
<p>When a user requests an encrypted snapshot, the
server walks the entire data structure server-side, and pushes
it to the client. The client then is able to verify the structure
and restore your data without any network round trips.</p>
<p>The bupstash <a href="https://bupstash.io/doc/man/bupstash-gc.html">‘garbage collector’</a> works
entirely server-side and without requiring the server to decrypt any data, avoiding
sending data to the client in costly and slow ways.</p>
<p>What does this all mean? In some benchmarks restoring backups from a distant
remote server, I was able to achieve 6x performance improvements over the
previous backup tool I was using (benchmarks coming soon).</p>

<p>Bupstash is designed to allow the use of ssh force commands to control whether
an ssh key has permission to make new backups, list backups or remove backups.</p>
<p>In my personal backup setup, my laptop can only add new backups via a vpn, but never remove
old backups from my backup repository. If my laptop were to be stolen, all backups are
safe from deletion.</p>
<p>When bupstash is configured with append-only access controls, making a backup is analagous to sending someone an email,
the recipient of the message is the one who decides when the message can be deleted.</p>
<p>You can see how to set this up in the <a href="https://bupstash.io/doc/guides/Remote%20Access%20Controls.html">access controls tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Bupstash has the notion of a ‘send log’ for saving bandwidth and accelerating snapshot
speeds. Bupstash remembers which data chunks were
sent in the previous snapshot, allowing the client to avoid resending data pointlessly.</p>

<p>Below is a simple bupstash session:</p>
<pre><code>$ export BUPSTASH_REPOSITORY=ssh://bupstash.io/backups

$ bupstash put host="$(hostname)" name=home-backup.tar /home
ebb66f3baa5d432e9f9a28934888a23d

$ bupstash list host=$(hostname) and 'name=*.tar'
...
id="dbca49b072c0f94b9e72bf81e7716ff9" name="home-backup.tar" hostname="server1" timestamp="2020/08/03 15:47:32"

$ bupstash list-contents id="dbca*"
drwxr-xr-x 0     2020/10/30 13:32:04 .
-rw-r--r-- 1967  2020/10/30 13:32:04 data.txt
...

$ bupstash get id="dbca*" | tar -C ./restore -xvf -
...
$ bupstash get --pick data.txt id="dbca*"
data!

$ bupstash rm name=home-backup.tar and older-than 30d
$ bupstash gc

</code></pre><p>My goal with the bupstash user interface is letting people get on with their day
while having a simple and excellent backup insurance policy.</p>

<p>Bupstash is currently in alpha and ready for people to play with at their own
risk.</p>

				<div>
			<p>The <a href="http://c2.com/">Cunningham &amp; Cunningham Wiki</a> is a wonderful place to get lost in, and it is so (chaotically) packed with useful programming lore that you are bound to come out of a dive a bit more enlightened about what it is programmers actually do.</p>
<p>One of my favorite pages is <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?YouArentGonnaNeedIt">You Aren’t Gonna Need It</a> from which I pull the following quotation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The justification for this is pretty straightforward: adding things you don’t need takes time and energy, plus generates more code, which means more potential bugs and cognitive load for future development. Since your job is to deliver software that actually does something which you presumably have at least a provisional understanding of, speculative development is an obvious waste of time.</p>
<p>To this basic justification I add only the following small elaboration: If you don’t need it now, you probably don’t understand it anyway.  Anything you implement speculatively is very likely to be <em>wrong</em> as well as useless.</p>
<h2>Why Software Is Hard</h2>
<p>There are a lot of reasons software engineering is hard.  Probably the primary reason it is hard is that we do not yet have a complete understanding of why it is so hard in the first place.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_P._Gabriel">Richard P Gabriel</a>, a software philosopher and progenitor of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_Better">Worse is Better</a> meme observes, probably correctly, that one reason for this fundamental ignorance is that software engineering is a comparative tyro among engineering disciplines: it is both extremely young (beginning only in 1945, approximately) and subject to radical change.  A developer in 1945 would find the contemporary development environment utterly alien and vice versa, a state of affairs not afflicting, for instance, stone masons, who have, arguably, thousands of years of more or less dependable tradition to inform their work.</p>
<p>With characteristic insight, Dr Gabriel also observes that software engineering is also difficult because it isn’t <em>physically constrained</em><sup>1</sup>, which means that humans, the product of 3.5 billion years of evolution in a physical environment, but not a computational one, have very little experience upon which to rely as they build objects in the space of computable functions.</p>
<p>Suffer me a brief, digressive analogy: <a href="http://www.roguetemple.com/z/hyper.php">Hyper Rogue III</a> is a game which takes place in a two-dimensional hyperbolic plane.  One implication of such a space is that it is very unlikely that a wanderer will ever return to a particular position unless she almost exactly follows her own trail of bread crumbs.  Exploring the space of computable functions is similarly dangerous to wanderers, except more so: we are not well equipped to even identify the hills, valleys, walls and contours of this space.</p>
<p>Hence my elaboration: the wanderer in the landscape of programming is very likely to lose his way.  He has neither physical constraints nor well developed intuition to guide him.  And despite the existence of tools like git, which promise us the ability to backtrack and refactor with some confidence, software inevitably ossifies as it grows.</p>
<p>Hence my elaboration: you don’t build things you don’t need because, if you don’t need them, you probably don’t really understand what they should be.  If you don’t understand what they should be, you’ll probably wander off base as you build them, and you probably won’t even notice that you have wandered off until something concrete impinges upon that code.  When that happens, you might find that refactoring to solve the problem you have now is prohibitively difficult, because that feature you thought you would need has subtly impinged on other parts of your code.</p>
<p>Explicit, concrete requirements are the closest thing you have to the physical constraints which make stone masonry a more reliable discipline than software engineering, and nothing but rote experience will ever give you the physical intuition that stone masons can rely on.  </p>
<p>So don’t wander off: You Aren’t Gonna Need It anyway.  At least until you do.</p>
<hr>
<p><sup>1</sup>: Well, the relationship between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics">physical constraints on software</a> and the software is, at any rate, not entirely trivial or transparent. </p>

<p>Wearing a plastic face shield and his orange monastic robes, Ashin Wirathu walked into a Yangon police station on November 2 after more than a year on the run. Until he went into hiding in June of last year, Wirathu, a nationalist preacher with links to the Tatmadaw — the Burmese military — was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/may/12/only-takes-one-terrorist-buddhist-monk-reviles-myanmar-muslims-rohingya-refugees-ashin-wirathu">one of Myanmar’s most prominent Islamophobes</a>, spreading bigotry and disinformation online. In May 2019, he was <a href="https://www.mmtimes.com/news/warrant-issued-arrest-ultranationalist-monk.html">charged with sedition</a>, but he <a href="https://myanmar-now.org/en/news/wirathu-declared-a-fugitive-after-failing-to-appear-at-court">never showed up</a> for his court date.</p>



<p>Wirathu’s surrender came in the final stages of an election campaign that once again exposed Myanmar’s racial and religious tensions, three years after a surge in hate speech and nationalist sentiment drove a campaign of ethnic cleansing targeting the country’s Muslim Rohingya minority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The monk’s act was a piece of theater designed to put him and his anti-Muslim ideology back in the public eye and feed into the rumors and misinformation that was circulating online. Activists braced for a surge in hate speech on social media. It never came. The hard news of his arrest was covered by the mainstream press, but online, his supporters were strangely muted. Facebook pages sharing his views were flagged by civil society groups and quickly shut down by the platform.</p>



<p>“He didn’t get anything like the megaphone that he had hoped to get,” says Victoire Rio, a Yangon-based researcher and advisor to the Myanmar Tech Accountability Network, a consortium of nonprofit groups working on disinformation and hate speech. “The whole thing got fairly well contained, and that’s in big part because Facebook was able to take action.”</p>



	




<p>Facebook has faced years of criticism for its failings in Myanmar. In 2018, the <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-facebook/u-n-investigators-cite-facebook-role-in-myanmar-crisis-idUKKCN1GO2PN">United Nations alleged the platform</a>&nbsp;allowed the proliferation of hate speech that incited the genocide. Campaigners in the U.S. and in Myanmar had been pressuring the company to prepare for the 2020 elections to prevent further violence.</p>



<p>In response, Facebook began trialing a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/preparing-for-myanmars-2020-election/">new, more active approach</a> to dealing with hate speech and political disinformation in the run up to the vote on November 8. It involved limiting users’ ability to reshare old pictures without context — a common misinformation tactic — and working with local partners to verify political parties’ pages and fact-check stories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most significantly, the “community standards” Facebook uses to police content on its platforms were expanded. Usually, the company does not remove misinformation unless it creates a threat of imminent harm, but for a few months in Myanmar, that policy was broadened to include anything that could “suppress the vote or damage the integrity of the electoral process” — for example, a baseless rumor that the country’s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, had died from Covid-19, which circulated before the election. Normally, the company’s community standards defines “hate speech” narrowly as attacks on people not concepts — Muslims, but not Islam. That was changed to prevent users from targeting the religion itself or attacking “invaders” or “illegals,” derogatory terms that refer to the Rohingya.</p>



	




<p>It is the first time the company has created country-specific community standards.</p>



<p>“That was a huge deal,” Rio says. “A lot of the problematic content is not framed as hate speech or as a call to violence in the way that Facebook likes it to be, like <em>Cluedo</em> — the weapon, the victim, the location, the whole thing.”</p>



<p>Myanmar has a well-documented problem with online hate speech and malicious falsehoods, which often attack the country’s Muslims. Nationalists and ultra-conservative Buddhists have successfully portrayed Muslims as a threat to the country’s culture and majority religion and as foreign interlopers. This hostility is so widespread that in the 2020 election, mainstream political parties competed to portray their opponents as more sympathetic to Islam.</p>



<p>One widely shared claim, originating from a candidate for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party, was that <a href="https://www.myanmar-now.org/en/news/nld-to-report-usdp-candidate-for-making-false-claims-about-muslims-in-the-ruling-party?page=2">Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) had 42 Muslim candidates</a>. The true number was two. An image circulated on social media showing an NLD meeting in which Buddhist monks appeared to be sitting on the floor while Muslim attendees sat on chairs, which, presented without context, looked like a calculated insult. Normally, such falsehoods would not have breached Facebook’s community standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In October and November, disinformation that tried to exploit religious differences to distort the election result was taken down by Facebook, as were fake “leaked documents” feeding conspiracy theories linking Suu Kyi to the financier and human rights activist George Soros and unfounded claims by the opposition that the vote was rigged.</p>



<p>Several of Facebook’s “trusted partners,” civil society organizations that the company gives a kind of express lane for reporting violations of community standards, told <em>Rest of World</em> that in October and November, when they reported falsehoods and hate speech, their complaints were quickly escalated and the flagged content was removed. Previously, they found that their interventions carried little weight.</p>



<p>“To their credit, [Facebook has] thrown in much more effort, many more resources, for this election than we’ve seen them do … in the last few years,” says Jes Kaliebe Petersen, CEO of Phandeeyar, a social-technology accelerator in Yangon. “That’s been very positive. They’ve had boots on the ground; they’ve had people from their Singapore team dedicated to this. They’ve engaged with civil society.”</p>



<p>In October, Facebook <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-facebook-myanmar/facebook-shuts-dozens-of-myanmar-pages-over-inauthentic-behaviour-idUKKBN27M1BC">removed dozens of accounts</a> for “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” its term for spreading disinformation, and dismantled networks of fake users and clickbait pages that were pushing political misinformation. (Data for Facebook’s takedowns in November is not yet available.) Activists told <em>Rest of World</em> that the approach led to a significant reduction in disinformation and hate speech compared to the previous election five years ago.</p>



<p>“I’m not saying there is no hate speech in 2020, but I think it’s much less than in 2015,” says Harry Myo Lin, an interfaith activist. “They have a more active response to reports and hateful content. It’s not perfect, but I think they did better than before.”</p>



<p>A side effect of Facebook’s crackdowns on hate speech some actors migrated to other platforms, including the Russian social network VK and YouTube — exposing the latter’s own deficiencies in dealing with malicious content. “YouTube, now, is the most problematic one,” says Myat Thu, founder of the Yangon-based fact-checking site Think Before You Trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google-owned YouTube did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>With the vote now over — the incumbent NLD won in a decisive victory — Facebook is set to return to its pre-election policies on December 6, leaving activists concerned that the platform will revert to being a place where hate and disinformation continues to circulate.</p>



<p>“The big question is: What happens next?” Petersen says. “Is this a sign of a new level of consistent support and focus from Facebook, or is it like a SWAT team that they put in, and now … the SWAT team is going to leave again, and we’re back to where we were before.”</p>



<p>In a statement, Facebook said it considers the experiment a success and could adapt it for other countries in the future.</p>



<p>At the Myanmar Tech Accountability Network, Rio said that while Facebook’s experimental approach still had profound flaws, it demonstrated that the company does have the tools to deal with the corrosive misinformation and bigotry that have proliferated on the platform worldwide.</p>



<p>“We need to give them credit where it’s due. They did pretty well,” Rio says. “But if anything, it shows that when they want to, they can.”</p>

<p><em><strong>A course for children in Grades 8-10.</strong></em></p>

<p>The information age is quickly turning into a misinformation age as we are increasingly being manipulated and lied to, by everyone. Our leaders, our media, the companies trying to sell us things, the companies wanting to collect our data, and even the companies claiming to expose the lies of other companies are manipulating us. In fact, even our friends and family inadvertently end up doing the same when they send us 'forwards' without critically analyzing them for accuracy.</p>
<p>One of the most important skills to learn is the ability to spot these lies and protect ourselves from being manipulated. This course will use practical examples and case-studies to analyze how and why the manipulation occurs, how and why most targets fall for these tricks, and how to spot, analyze and disarm them.</p>

<p>We will look at two broad problems: outright lies ("fake news") and technically true statements that are created to mislead. For lies, we will analyze how to spot lies, why even easy-to-disprove lies are widely believed, and how to prevent ourselves from falling for such lies. In case of misleading truths, we will see ways in which numbers and statistics can mislead (for example, use of absolute values instead of percentages or vice versa, or use of mean instead of Median or vice versa), ways in which text/stories/graphics can mislead (for example, in advertisements), and common sense ways in which to estimate the accuracy of the statements (for example, through basic web searches for information, looking for connections and relationships, making approximations and ballpark estimates).</p>

<p>After this course, students would be better equipped to defend themselves against the dark arts of social media manipulation.</p></div><div title="navin kabra photo.png" data-is-responsive="false" data-display-mode="fill" data-content-padding-horizontal="0" data-content-padding-vertical="0" data-exact-height="202" id="comp-kaphhov4"><a href="https://www.genwise.in/our-instructors/Navin-Kabra" target="_self" id="comp-kaphhov4link"><wix-image data-has-bg-scroll-effect="" data-image-info="{&quot;imageData&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;comp-kaphhov4_runtime_dataItem-kaphhp6n&quot;,&quot;metaData&quot;:{&quot;pageId&quot;:&quot;bcpzw&quot;,&quot;isPreset&quot;:false,&quot;schemaVersion&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;isHidden&quot;:false},&quot;title&quot;:&quot;navin kabra photo.png&quot;,&quot;uri&quot;:&quot;98f7cd_c1146be150aa40dc91e5feafc400ffb6~mv2.png&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1123,&quot;height&quot;:1312,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Navin Kabra&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;navin kabra photo.png&quot;,&quot;crop&quot;:null,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;DynamicPageLink&quot;,&quot;innerRoute&quot;:&quot;Navin-Kabra&quot;,&quot;routerId&quot;:&quot;routers-k1j3n23p&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;comp-kaphhov4_runtime_dataItem-kaphhp6nlink&quot;},&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;},&quot;containerId&quot;:&quot;comp-kaphhov4&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;}" data-has-ssr-src="true" data-is-svg="false" data-is-svg-mask="false" id="comp-kaphhov4img"><img id="comp-kaphhov4imgimage" alt="Navin Kabra" data-type="image" itemprop="image" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/98f7cd_c1146be150aa40dc91e5feafc400ffb6~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_168,h_196,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_3/navin%20kabra%20photo.png"></wix-image></a></div><p><span><span><span>Navin Kabra is CTO and Co-Founder at ReliScore, a company that provides skill and capability assessment solutions to the software industry.

<p>By Patrick Colbeck</p>



<p>I’m not sure how you have spent your day today, but I spent mine reviewing contracts and system overview documents related to voting systems.  Why is that?  You may have heard about the <a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/software-glitch-caused-6-000-republican-votes-to-swing-democrat-in-michigan-county">6,000 votes in Antrim County</a>, Michigan that were flipped via software from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. No one denies the veracity of this claim.  The only differences between various parties involved revolve around explanations for exactly how that happened.  </p>



<p>The media has already projected that Michigan’s 16 Electoral College votes will go to Joe Biden.  This projection is based upon an assertion that Joe Biden leads Donald Trump by 146,123 votes.  Any attempt to assert that Michigan is “in play” would have to account for that large of a deficit.  As it turns out, we can.  Against the backdrop of the 6,000 vote “flip” in Antrim County, we have also identified evidence of algorithmic data manipulation in three other counties that could account for as many as 140,000 votes being switched from Donald Trump to Joe Biden in Michigan…and that is through examination of only 3 out of the 83 counties in Michigan.  In the wake of election fraud allegations, <a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2020/11/federal-lawsuit-seeks-to-throw-out-12m-votes-flipping-michigan-for-trump.html?fbclid=IwAR2H1saVwouRyRpAnhkWghxhOPhfODvEjDJA8uz9fLVe4OGl9Sdlt1JsES0">a Federal Lawsuit has been filed that addresses 1.2 Million ballots cast in Michigan</a>.  The bottom line is that the election fraud observed to date can indeed impact the election results in Michigan and potentially the nation as a whole.</p>



<p>Key findings:</p>



<div><div>
<ul><li>Dominion Voting Systems are designed to connect to the internet including wireless internet connections which could be accessed outside of a vote counting facility. Introduces significant chain of custody concerns regarding vote tallies.</li><li>My personal attempts to discern the chain of custody regarding how vote tallies were to be transferred from the counting board tabulation machines to the county were met with deflection and avoidance by one of the Senior election officials, Chris Thomas.</li><li>According to Dominion, there are two methods available to users of the Dominion Voting system to transfer vote tally data to election officials: 1) physical transfer via flash drive or 2) over a network connection.  </li><li>The inability to verify which method is used obstructs the statutory duties of a poll challenger and puts election integrity at risk.</li><li>According to the Detroit Elections Manual, flash drives were to be used to transfer the data, but it was obvious from review of the network configuration that network connections were in use including Wi-Fi connections.  </li><li>If memory cards were indeed intended to be used, it would have raised additional chain of custody concerns regarding these cards.  In Philadelphia, <a href="https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/09/30/laptop-encrypted-usb-drives-stolen-from-philadelphia-election-machine-warehouse-officials/">an election laptop and encrypted flash drives were stolen from an election machine warehouse in September</a>.</li><li>A forensic audit of the voting system configuration in Antrim County revealed that an open port had been accessed in the Dominion voting machines putting chain of custody at risk.</li><li>If a computer is connected to the internet, all resources on that computer, including voting data, is vulnerable to remote manipulation.  See my <a href="https://letsfixstuff.org/2020/08/lets-fix-election-integrity-ev/">Election Integrity Solution Podcast</a> for more information on this risk.</li></ul>

<p>Why is internet connectivity a big deal?  It enables top-down manipulation of vote tallies.  </p>



<p>Some of you may have seen examples of “vote flipping” on live news network feeds in which thousands of votes were added to Joe Biden while the exact number of votes were subtracted from Donald Trump.  </p>



<p><a href="https://rumble.com/vb236n-proof-why-trump-will-win-part-2.html">SEE VIDEO PROOF OF VOTE FLIPPING</a></p>



<p>Remember, these “flips” have already been confirmed to have happened in Antrim County.  </p>



<p>At the end of the night, though, any electronic vote switching must be reconciled with other ballot records such as the poll books and physical ballot counts.  All precincts must be balanced to ensure the integrity of that precincts vote tally.</p>



<p>Many of you may recall news stories of a cessation of voting activities across many of the major cities in battleground states between Midnight and 4:00am on November 4.  <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/04/facebook-posts/battleground-states-did-not-stop-counting-votes-el/">According to Politifacts this assertion is FALSE</a>.  </p>



<blockquote><p>“At no point has the counting process stopped since it began at 7 a.m. yesterday morning, which was when, per Michigan election law, it could begin,” said Tracy Wimmer, director of media relations for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, referring to the morning of Nov. 3.</p><cite>SOURCE:  <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/04/facebook-posts/battleground-states-did-not-stop-counting-votes-el/">Politifact</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>I was on the floor of the AV Counting Board in Detroit between midnight and 4:00am.  Counting activity had indeed stopped during that time period.  In fact, the only apparent ballots available to count at that time were around 12 boxes of military ballots.  Rather than count these ballots during overnight quiet period, Detroit Election Officials chose to wait until they had prohibited access to the AV Counting Board by Poll Challengers such as myself.  I had left to train our next wave of poll challengers in a break room upstairs only to find that my re-entry to the counting board was prohibited. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-300x169.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-768x432.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.150/bkq.639.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/More-Cardboard-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>SOURCE:  Cardboard on Windows at Detroit AV Counting Board by Patrick Colbeck</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>So, why would the ballot count be stopped if there were ballots remaining to be counted?  The end of shift for the poll workers on duty was 5:00am.  Well, one could make the claim that they were waiting for word on the number of votes they needed to win the state.  Perhaps coincidentally, a Detroit Elections Bureau vehicle arrived at the back entrance of the AV Counting Board with 61 mail bins full of ballots at 3:45 am.  I witnessed ballot after ballot being placed upon staging tables after a very quiet night.  Could it be that this was an attempt to ensure that the paper trail matched with the electronic vote tally?</p>



<p>Is it even possible to modify the electronic vote tally?  According to <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/11/dominion-voting-systems-officer-strategy-security-eric-coomer-admitted-2016-vendors-election-officials-access-manipulate-vote/">Dominion Voting Systems Officer of Strategy and Security, the answer is yes.</a></p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Dr. Coomer’s statement brings to light a very serious issue all voters should understand.</strong>&nbsp;Voting systems must be re-certified each time they make changes to the hardware or software. Recertification is an expensive and time consuming process.&nbsp;<strong>What Dr. Coomer told the Board is that Dominion Voting does not go back for recertification of software when threats to their code are discovered.&nbsp;</strong>Rather, they rely on post-election audits and providing advice to election jurisdictions about security. I have reviewed all of the recertification documents produced by Dominion, and I do not recall any software adjustments for security purposes.</p><p><strong>This is the reality of the security of your vote.</strong>&nbsp;Software systems that count and record the vote across Illinois and throughout the USA are not updated to address security problems, and even if they were, the software can be completely bypassed by going to the data tables that drive the systems.</p><cite>SOURCE:  <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/11/dominion-voting-systems-officer-strategy-security-eric-coomer-admitted-2016-vendors-election-officials-access-manipulate-vote/">The Gateway Pundit</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>So, if vote tallies were electronically manipulated, what records need to be preserved to verify that it happened?  In order to answer that question, let’s take a closer look at the design of the Dominion Voting System.</p>

<p>Upon review of the design of the Dominion Voting System, what components merit further examination?</p>



<p>While ALL equipment and records need to be secured as soon as possible, I believe the security of our election boils down to the secure retention and examination of the following key artifacts:</p>



<ul><li>ImageCast Listener Module: “The ImageCast Listener module is responsible for receiving and tracking encrypted results file transmissions from any ImageCast Election Day tabulator.”</li><li>Image Cast Evolution Memory Card: “The ICE memory card has only one partition that holds the ballot images, election database, audio files, etc” (<em>Very curious as to what “etc” might entail</em>)</li><li>EMS Audit Log:  “From the initial state of the election project, until the deactivation state, the EMS system maintains an activity log within the EMS Database. This activity log contains every action that any of the users have performed within the system and represents a detailed audit log that can be analyzed and printed in the form of an audit report. The audit record information cannot be modified or permanently deleted using the EMS client applications. It can, however, be exported for archiving purposes as part of the record retention policy. Keeping in mind that audit log information can contain a significant amount of information, it is the responsibility of the administrative user to perform regular archiving of the log.  During the voting phase of the election event, ImageCast devices also keep an activity audit log which tracks events happening on the device itself.”</li><li>Event logs from the Election Official, Electronic Poll Book, Tabulator and Adjudicator computers</li></ul>



<p>There are <a href="https://letsfixstuff.org/2020/11/michigan-election-fraud-is-real-and-significant/">numerous lawsuits</a> in progress through the state and federal court systems which allege election fraud.  It will take time to gather and evaluate all of the artifacts cited above.  The Dominion Voting System is complex.  This complexity is compounded by vote tally chain of custody concerns enabled by the connection of this system to the internet.  It will take weeks, even months potentially, to reveal the truth of what caused software “glitches” such as the Antrim County vote flip and other “flips” observed throughout the early morning hours of November 4th.</p>



<p><em>NOTE:  <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title52-section20701&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim">52 USC Section 20701</a> requires that election records are retained for 22 months from the date of the election.  Furthermore, willful destruction of these records would likely be seen by courts as justification for issuing orders to redo the election.</em></p>

<!-- What is the value for the user/reader?  -->

<p>Use this 8-step machine learning checklist to guide you through your machine learning projects.</p>

<p>I found this checklist the appendix of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow</a>.
Every machine learning project should use this checklist, or at least part of
it.</p>

<p>The checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Frame the problem and look at the big picture.</li>
  <li>Get the data.</li>
  <li>Explore the data to gain insights.</li>
  <li>Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to machine learning algorithms.</li>
  <li>Explore many different models and shortlist the best ones.</li>
  <li>Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution.</li>
  <li>Present your solution.</li>
  <li>Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.</li>
</ol>



<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-11-20-machine-learning-checklist/2020-11-20-13-58-51.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In this step you frame the problem and try to look at the big picture. This
step answers questions such as: What problem are we solving? What business
objective does it solve? Who is going to consume my solution? What is the
current solution? At the end of this step you’ll have a solid grasp of the
big picture of what you’re solving.</p>

<p>Checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Define the objective in business terms.</li>
  <li>How will your solution be used?</li>
  <li>What are the current solutions/workarounds (if any)?</li>
  <li>How should you frame this problem (supervised/unsupervised, online/offline, etc.)?</li>
  <li>How should performance be measured?</li>
  <li>Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?</li>
  <li>What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objective?</li>
  <li>What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experience or tools?</li>
  <li>Is human expertise available?</li>
  <li>How would you solve the problem manually?</li>
  <li>List the assumptions you (or others) have made so far.</li>
  <li>Verify assumptions if possible.</li>
</ol>



<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-11-20-machine-learning-checklist/2020-11-20-13-59-17.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In the second step we fetch the data. Try to automate as much as possible so
you always have the freshest data. At the end of this step you will have a
raw dataset.</p>

<p>Checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>List the data you need and how much you need.</li>
  <li>Find and document where you can get that data.</li>
  <li>Create a workspace (with enough storage space).</li>
  <li>Get the data.</li>
  <li>Convert the data to a format you can easily manipulate (without changing the data itself).</li>
  <li>Ensure sensitive information is deleted or protected.</li>
  <li>Check the size and type of data (time series, sample, geographical, etc.).</li>
  <li>Sample a test set, put it aside, and never look at it.</li>
</ol>



<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-11-20-machine-learning-checklist/2020-11-20-13-59-30.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In the third step do exploratory data analysis (EDA). We explore the data and
try to figure out the “health” and “shape” of the data (missing values,
distributions, etc.) At the end of this step you’ll have a solid
understanding and feel of the dataset.</p>

<p>Checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a copy of the data for exploration (sampling it down to a manageable size if necessary).</li>
  <li>Create a Jupyter notebook to keep a record of your data exploration.</li>
  <li>Study each attribute and its characteristics:
    <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Type (categorical, int/float, bounded/unbounded, text, structured, etc.)</li>
      <li>% of missing values</li>
      <li>Noisiness and type of noise (stochastic, outliers, rounding errors, etc.)</li>
      <li>Usefulness for the task</li>
      <li>Type of distribution (Gaussian, uniform, logarithmic, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For supervised learning tasks, identify the target attribute(s).</li>
  <li>Visualize the data.</li>
  <li>Study the correlations between attributes.</li>
  <li>Study how you would solve the problem manually.</li>
  <li>Identify the promising transformations you may want to apply.</li>
  <li>Identify extra data that would be useful.</li>
  <li>Document what you have learned.</li>
</ol>



<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-11-20-machine-learning-checklist/2020-11-20-13-59-50.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In this step you’re going to prepare the data. At the end of this step you’ll
have a set of functions/transformers that perform data transformations. These
transformers turn your raw data into preprocessed cleaned data, ready to be
used by machine learning algorithms.</p>

<p><strong>Set yourself up for success by writing functions for your data
transformations!</strong></p>

<p>Write functions for all data transformations you apply, for five reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>So you can easily prepare the data the next time you get a fresh dataset</li>
  <li>So you can apply these transformations in future projects</li>
  <li>To clean and prepare the test set</li>
  <li>To clean and prepare new data instances once your solution is live</li>
  <li>To make it easy to treat your preparation choices as hyperparameters</li>
</ul>

<p>Checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Data cleaning:
    <ul>
      <li>Fix or remove outliers (optional).</li>
      <li>Fill in missing values (e.g., with zero, mean, median…) or drop their rows (or columns).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Feature selection (optional):
    <ul>
      <li>Drop the attributes that provide no useful information for the task.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Feature engineering, where appropriate:
    <ul>
      <li>Discretize continuous features.</li>
      <li>Decompose features (e.g., categorical, date/time, etc.).</li>
      <li>Add promising transformations of features (e.g., log(x), sqrt(x), x2, etc.).</li>
      <li>Aggregate features into promising new features.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Feature scaling:
    <ul>
      <li>Standardize or normalize features.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>



<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-11-20-machine-learning-checklist/2020-11-20-14-00-02.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Train many quick-and-dirty models from different categories (e.g., linear,
naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, neural net, etc.) using standard
parameters.</li>
  <li>Measure and compare their performance.
    <ul>
      <li>For each model, use N-fold cross-validation and compute the mean and standard deviation of the performance measure on the N folds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Analyze the most significant variables for each algorithm.</li>
  <li>Analyze the types of errors the models make.
    <ul>
      <li>What data would a human have used to avoid these errors?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Perform a quick round of feature selection and engineering.</li>
  <li>Perform one or two more quick iterations of the five previous steps.</li>
  <li>Shortlist the top three to five most promising models, preferring models
that make different types of errors.</li>
</ol>



<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-11-20-machine-learning-checklist/2020-11-20-14-00-12.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Don’t tweak your model after measuring the generalization error: you would just
start overfitting the test set.</p>

<p>Checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fine-tune the hyperparameters using cross-validation:
    <ul>
      <li>Treat your data transformation choices as hyperparameters, especially when
 you are not sure about them (e.g., if you’re not sure whether to replace
 missing values with zeros or with the median value, or to just drop the
 rows).</li>
      <li>Unless there are very few hyperparameter values to explore, prefer random
 search over grid search. If training is very long, you may prefer a
 Bayesian optimization approach (e.g., using Gaussian process priors, as
 described by Jasper Snoek et al.).1</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Try Ensemble methods. Combining your best models will often produce better
performance than running them individually.</li>
  <li>Once you are confident about your final model, measure its performance on
the test set to estimate the generalization error.</li>
</ol>



<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-11-20-machine-learning-checklist/2020-11-20-14-00-22.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Document what you have done.</li>
  <li>Create a nice presentation.
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure you highlight the big picture first.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Explain why your solution achieves the business objective.</li>
  <li>Don’t forget to present interesting points you noticed along the way.
    <ul>
      <li>Describe what worked and what did not.</li>
      <li>List your assumptions and your system’s limitations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ensure your key findings are communicated through beautiful visualizations
or easy-to-remember statements (e.g., “the median income is the number-one
predictor of housing prices”).</li>
</ol>



<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-11-20-machine-learning-checklist/2020-11-20-14-02-21.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Get your solution ready for production (plug into production data inputs,
write unit tests, etc.).</li>
  <li>Write monitoring code to check your system’s live performance at regular
intervals and trigger alerts when it drops.
    <ul>
      <li>Beware of slow degradation: models tend to “rot” as data evolves.</li>
      <li>Measuring performance may require a human pipeline.</li>
      <li>Also monitor your input’s quality.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Retrain your models on a regular basis on fresh data (automate as much as possible).</li>
</ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I consider PR reviews as one of the fundamental and most important
tools developers have to collaborate. We use it daily to submit changes and
to get important feedback from peers and more experienced developers.</p>
<p>And so, <strong>it should be targeted to software developers and not to managers</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s cover some of the daily tortures of dealing with <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>, which
I unfortunately need to deal with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey friend, how about you implement this piece of functionality in this other way?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This common and healthy workflow is <strong>fundamentally broken</strong> in BB because
you cannot copy code from the body of the PR into a comment without getting
a lot more than what you clearly selected.</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/460408cff29803e91776376bae5605ad/copypastev3.gif" alt="Copying and pasting code from PR changes is broken"></p>

<p>Trying to click anywhere else when writing a comment like for example
expanding to see more code will result in an alert that states
that your comment changes will be removed which is already super annoying.
But if you even do not care about discarding your comment and you go ahead
and click on discard the comment isn’t really discarded! So it is completely misleading.</p>
<p>This is BB not caring about the amount of time developers throw into detailed
code reviews.</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/7a16dbe4130224ea56472f85903a24f7/commentclick.gif" alt="Are you sure you want to discard (actually not) your comments?"></p>
<h2 id="what-you-see-may-be-what-you-get-horrible-markdown-support"><a href="#what-you-see-may-be-what-you-get-horrible-markdown-support" aria-label="what you see may be what you get horrible markdown support permalink"></a>What You See May Be What You Get: horrible markdown support</h2>
<p>Markdown is a tool aimed for technical folks, it is minimal but gets
the job done without any distractions, it is <em>not</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> (what you see is what you get)
by design and partially for simplicity.</p>
<p>BB takes the worse of all worlds: horrible “standard” markdown support
that varies across places and combine it with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editor.
This creates really weird
use cases we will cover below.</p>
<p>Other technical tools, such as <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, understand how important decent markdown
support is and they use it to empower developers.
They do build visual tools on top of markdown but without combining them
into a monster broken implementation.</p>
<p>Let’s see some specially frustrating cases</p>
<h3 id="selecting-a-code-block-language"><a href="#selecting-a-code-block-language" aria-label="selecting a code block language permalink"></a>Selecting a code block language</h3>
<p>Instead of using the standard <strong>”```typescript”</strong> they include a visual
Select. Guess what, professional developers don’t need this help at all, and
newbies can search the web once and forget about this.</p>
<p>Think about ergonomics, with regular markdown you do everything with the keyboard,
with the BB inferno you first need to type the three backward ticks and then grab the
mouse and select your language and then click back on the code block.</p>
<p>This is a really poor understanding of your user’s UX!</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/e7b45f374d83485074abc0f93fc73afb/mdlang.gif" alt="selecting code block language"></p>
<h3 id="smart-dumb-markdown-hybrid-support"><a href="#smart-dumb-markdown-hybrid-support" aria-label="smart dumb markdown hybrid support permalink"></a>Smart (dumb) markdown hybrid support</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">markdown</a> hybrid implementation produces stuff like this</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/e0371b316a1ee15020dc166396db9c4c/format.gif" alt="format"></p>
<h3 id="list-items-without-an-empty-line"><a href="#list-items-without-an-empty-line" aria-label="list items without an empty line permalink"></a>List items without an empty line</h3>
<p>This cannot happen in the comment textbox unless you force it to, but
it can happen in the PR description textbox and it can also happen when you
write the markdown in a <em>regular</em> text editor / IDE i.e. when committing code
via git, when writing the README, etc.</p>
<p>If you don’t leave an empty line before a list then it won’t get transformed correctly:</p>
<p><img src="https://nosleepjavascript.com/c8e58d30c452b643bf40ea77f00b21d0/lists.gif" alt="markdown lists"></p>
<h2 id="performance-of-the-text-box"><a href="#performance-of-the-text-box" aria-label="performance of the text box permalink"></a>Performance of the text box</h2>
<p>I have a pretty good and modern computer but most of the time
I experience heavy lags when writing a simple text only comment in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BB</a>.</p>
<p>I suspect this is related to the horrible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> implementation,
which we have just heavily broken down above.</p>
<h2 id="doesnt-work-on-large-prs"><a href="#doesnt-work-on-large-prs" aria-label="doesnt work on large prs permalink"></a>Doesn’t work on large PRs</h2>
<p>When a PR is a large (I know, I know, large PRs should not happen, but unfortunately sometimes they do)
BB will choose either</p>
<ol>
<li>consuming a lot of resources</li>
<li>not displaying the entire PR</li>
</ol>
<p>In either case the UX ends up being bad.</p>
<p>In case <strong>1.</strong> you will get a lot of RAM being consumed and
most likely the scrolling and the interaction with the page
will be even more slow and awkward.</p>
<p>In case <strong>2.</strong> you need to click file by file to inspect a PR, which isn’t better IMO.</p>

<p>I’ve seen that the described behaviors tend to be cross
cutting problems across the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> suite, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a> has similar
problems and <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/alldoc/atlassian-documentation-32243719.html">Confluence</a> is horrible, they are generally
really slow and clunky and unresponsive and text editing tends to be a pain.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-your-product"><a href="#understanding-your-product" aria-label="understanding your product permalink"></a>Understanding your product</h2>
<p>PRs are one of the core use cases of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BB</a> as a product,
they are what have arguably made <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> the beacon that it is now.</p>
<p>There are a few things your PR experience needs to provide at the base level</p>
<ul>
<li>PR title, description and inline comments.</li>
<li>Every text box needs to support plain markdown and maybe mentioning other people (tagging).</li>
<li>If you want to add markdown shortcuts make them <em>insert markdown</em> and <strong>not</strong> actually applying style.</li>
<li>Good diffing visualization (which BB does well IMO).</li>
<li>It is all about the code!</li>
<li>Copying code from the diff needs to work as expected.</li>
<li>Markdown code blocks (code snippets) are a fundamental feature of all your text boxes.</li>
<li>Either provide a really good experience inside your code blocks or do nothing.</li>
<li>Your app needs to be simple, small, fast and stable in time.</li>
<li>Some PRs are open for long periods of time, make sure your app is stable!.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are one the core features a good PR UI needs to provide, if anything,
these need to be the best of the best.</p>
<p>BB seems to have prioritized being “cute” or “pretty” (is it?) instead of being functional.</p>
<h2 id="solutions"><a href="#solutions" aria-label="solutions permalink"></a>Solutions</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> is a developer centric platform, use developer centric tools,
use plain old text inputs with good markdown support, add as little as possible
on top of that, make the experience of writing comments, PR descriptions,
code snippets as easy, simple and fast as possible.</p>
<p>Don’t leak stuff from <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a> and <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/alldoc/atlassian-documentation-32243719.html">Confluence</a> to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>, they have different
audience.</p>
<p>And if you have time… make sure <em>every</em> text input in your system has a plain text
mode, where either you interpret it as good old markdown or as unformatted text, either
is much better than what you have now.</p>

<p><span>How do they get all their data into one place in order to merge it all together?</span></p>
<p><span>Traditionally you would need to have a large team of data engineers to connect to all these various data sources, set up complex ETL jobs using either custom scripts or python libraries like Airflow and Luigi and then they would have to ensure that those pipelines were constantly running.</span></p>
<p><span>This method is both time consuming and expensive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thankfully, there are modern tools that can help your team simplify your data workflow and instead of 4, 5 maybe 10 data engineers. You can go down to just one.</span></p>
<p><span>One of those tools is Fivetran.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://fivetran.com/"><span>Fivetran</span></a><span> is a highly comprehensive ELT tool that is becoming more popular every day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You’re probably wondering, what is an ELT?</span></p>
<p><span>ELT stands for extract, load, transform.</span></p>
<p><span>These are the steps required to take your data from a system like Saleforce or Quickbooks and insert it into your centralized data storage system (often referred to as a data warehouse).</span></p>
<p><span>Basically, Fivetran allows for efficient collection of business processes and customer data from related applications, websites, and servers. The data collected is then transferred to other tools for analytics, marketing, and data warehousing purposes.</span></p>
<h2><span>Fivetran Data Connectors&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Fivetran does all this by offering a myriad of connectors to both source and destination connectors that allows for both pushing and pulling of data. The pull connectors will pull from data sources in a variety of methods including ODBC, JDBC, and multiple API methods. That’s a lot of technical abbreviations that translate to Fivetran being able to connect to nearly a hundred different data sources.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>What Are Pushing And Pulling Data Connectors</span></h3>
<p><span>Fivetran’s push connectors receive data that a source sends, or pushes, to them. In push connectors, such as </span><a href="https://fivetran.com/docs/events/webhooks#webhooks"><span>Webhooks</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://fivetran.com/docs/events/snowplow#snowplow"><span>Snowplow</span></a><span>, source systems send data to Fivetran as events. This is very useful to make sure your data is as real-time as possible. From there, you can start implementing logic, and dashboards. This is where</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://fivetran.com/docs/transformations/basic-sql"><span>Fivetran data transformations come into play</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>How Does Fivetran Transformations Work</span></h3>
<p><span>This tool isn’t limited to only extracting and loading data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After loading the data, Fivetran offers data teams the ability to easily set up custom data transformations.&nbsp; These</span> <span>transformations can run in your destination after you load your data in, so your raw data is always available alongside your transformed data. If a transformation fails, you can look into the logs to try to figure out the issue. If your analytical needs change, you can edit your transformations and run them again on your raw data.</span></p>
<p><span>There are two types of transformations you can use. Custom SQL and dbt transformations. Both can be set to run when you need and can help shape your data as need be.</span></p>
<p><span>What’s also great is if your team uses dbt transformations they can be version controlled to ensure your team can roll back to a previous data transformation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For those unfamilar with dbt.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>dbt is an open-source software that enables you to perform sophisticated data transformations in your destination using simple SQL statements. With dbt, you can, write and test SQL transformations, create and share documentation about your dbt transformations and view data lineage graphs.</span></p>
<p><span>Some other high level differences are listed below.</span></p>

<p><span>Once you have created your transformations. You will need to schedule them to run.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>How Does Fivetran Manage Data Scheduling&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>One of the hacky things data engineers do to manage scheduling is put everything into cron or Windows Task Scheduler. Both of these tools allow you to schedule jobs at specific times and intervals.</span></p>
<p><span><br>
</span><span>The problem is, this can quickly become very messy.</span></p>
<p><span>Fivetran makes it easy. You can set your transformations to run either at specific intervals through the user interface or set it to run when new data is added to your source.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s also important to note that depending on how you set up your sources as well as which sources you are using can change how your data is updated.</span></p>
<p><span>Fivetran refers to the initial data load essentially as a sync. After the initial sync of your historical data, Fivetran moves to performing incremental updates of any new or modified data from your source database. During incremental syncs, Fivetran uses your database’s native change capture mechanism to request only the data that has changed since our last sync, including deletes. Each database uses a different change capture mechanism.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also set up re-syncs that will essentially wipe out all the previous data in the past.</span></p>
<p><span>The point here is that most of this data loading, is done without setting up complex API connections.</span></p>
<h3><span>Should I hire a BI Developer/Data Engineer For Fivetran</span></h3>
<p><span>Tools like Fivetran make developing ELTs very easy. The scheduling, connectors and transformations remove a lot of the heavy infrastructure lift that requires data and software engineers.</span></p>
<p><span>However, this doesn’t mean you don’t need a data expert.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Between needing to build dashboards off the data as well as creating SQL queries that are reliable and robust, having a strong data expert is important.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our team can help you implement your Fivetran transformations as well as develop dashboards and metrics. <a href="https://www.theseattledataguy.com/contact-data/">Reach out to us today for a free consultation.</a></span></p>

  <p><span>29 Oct 2020</span></p><p>AWS recently announced that their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/09/amazon-timestream-now-generally-available/">Timestream database is now generally available</a>. I tried it out with an existing application that uses timeseries data. Based on my experimentation this article compares Amazon Timestream with DynamoDB and shows what I learned.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.timescale.com/blog/what-the-heck-is-time-series-data-and-why-do-i-need-a-time-series-database-dcf3b1b18563/">Timeseries data is a sequence of data points stored in time order</a>. Each timestream record can be extended with dimensions that give more context on the measurement. One example are fuel measurements of trucks, with truck types and number plates as dimensions.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>As this article compares Timestream with DynamoDB, it’s good for you to have some experience with the latter. But even if you don’t, you can learn about both databases here.</p>

<p>I will also mention Lambda and API Gateway. If you’re not familiar with those two, just read them as “compute” and “api”.</p>

<h2 id="use-case">Use Case</h2>

<p>My application monitors markets to notify customers of trading opportunities and registers about 500,000 market changes each day. DynamoDB requires ~20 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadWriteCapacityMode.html">RCU/WCU</a>s for this. While most of the system is event-driven and can complete eventually, there are also userfacing dashboards that need fast responses.</p>

<p>Below you can see a picture of the current architecture, where a Lambda function pulls data into DynamoDB, another one creates notifications when a trading opportunity appears and an API Gateway that serves data for the user dashboards.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/2020/timestream/timestream-use-case.png" alt="Architecture for Use Case"></p>

<p>Each record in the database consists of two measurements (price and volume), has two dimensions (article number and location) and has a timestamp.</p>

<p>Testing out Timestream required two changes: An additional Lambda function to replicate from DynamoDB to Timestream, and a new API that reads from Timestream.</p>

<h2 id="data-format">Data Format</h2>

<p>Let’s start by comparing the data format of DynamoDB and Timestream.</p>

<p><strong>DynamoDB</strong> holds a flexible amount of attributes, which are identified by a unique key. This means that you need to query for a key, and will get the according record with multiple attributes. That’s for example useful when you store meta information for movies or songs.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/2020/timestream/data-format-dynamo.png" alt="Data Format DynamoDB"></p>

<p><strong>Timestream</strong> instead is designed to store continuous measurements, for example from a temperature sensor. There are only inserts, no updates. Each measurement has a name, value, timestamp and dimensions. A dimension can be for example the city where the temperature sensor is, so that we can group results by city.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/2020/timestream/data-format-timestream.png" alt="Data Format Timestream"></p>

<h2 id="write-to-timestream">Write to Timestream</h2>

<p>Timestream shines when it comes to ingestion. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/API_WriteRecords.html"><code>WriteRecords</code> API</a> is designed with a focus on batch inserts, which allows you to insert up to 100 records per request. With DynamoDB my batch inserts were sometimes throttled both with provisioned and ondemand capacity, while I saw no throttling with Timestream.</p>

<p>Below you can see a snapshot from AWS Cost Explorer when I started ingesting data with a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/timestream/pricing">memory store</a> retention of 7 days. Memory store is Timestream’s fastest, but most expensive storage. It is required for ingestion but its retention can be reduced to one hour.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/2020/timestream/timestream-write-storage-cost.png" alt="Timestream Write and Storage Cost"></p>

<p>The <strong>write operations are cheap</strong> and can be neglected in comparison to cost for storage and reading. Inserting 515,000 records has cost me $0.20, while the in-memory storage cost for all of those records totalled $0.37 after 7 days. My spending matches <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/timestream/pricing/">Timestream’s official pricing</a> of $0.50 per 1 million writes of 1KB size.</p>

<p>As <strong>each Timestream record can only contain one measurement</strong>, we need to split up the DynamoDB records which hold multiple measurements. Instead of writing one record with multiple attributes, we need to write one record per measure value.</p>

<p><strong>Backfilling old data</strong> might not be possible if its age exceeds the maximum retention time of the memory store which is 12 months. In October 2020 it was only possible to write to memory store and if you tried to insert older records you would get an error. To backfill and optimize cost you can start with 12 months retention and then lower it once your backfilling is complete.</p>

<h2 id="read-from-timestream">Read from Timestream</h2>

<p>You can read data from Timestream with SQL queries and get charged per GB of scanned data. <code>WHERE</code> clauses are key to limiting the amount of data that you scan because “data is pruned by Amazon Timestream’s query engine when evaluating query predicates” (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/timestream/pricing/">Timestream Pricing</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The less data makes it through your <code>WHERE</code> clauses, the cheaper and faster your query.</strong></p>

<p>I tested the read speed by running the same queries against two APIs that were backed by DynamoDB (blue) and Timestream (orange) respectively. Below you can see a chart where I mimicked user behavior over the span of an hour. The spikes where DynamoDB got slower than Timestream were requests where computing the result required more than 500 queries to DynamoDB.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/2020/timestream/access-speed-comparison.png" alt="Access Speed Comparison"></p>

<p>DynamoDB is designed for blazing fast queries, but <a href="https://bahr.dev/2020/02/02/aggregate-ddb/">doesn’t support adhoc analytics</a>. SQL queries won’t compete at getting individual records, but can get interesting once you have to access many different records and can’t precompute data. My queries to Timestream usually took more than a second, and I decided to <strong>precompute user facing data into DynamoDB</strong>.</p>

<p>Dashboards that update every minute or so and can wait 10s for a query to complete are fine with reading from Timestream. Use the right tool for the right job.</p>

<p>Timestream seems to have <strong>no limit on query length</strong>. An SQL query with 1,000 items in an SQL IN clause works fine, while <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html">DynamoDB limits queries to 100 operands</a>.</p>

<h2 id="timestream-pricing">Timestream Pricing</h2>

<p>Timestream pricing mostly comes down to two questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do you need <strong>memory store with long retention</strong>?</li>
  <li>Do you <strong>read frequently</strong>?</li>
</ul>

<p>Below you can see the cost per storage type calculated into hourly, daily and monthly cost. On the right hand side you can see the relative cost compared to memory store.</p>



<p>My ingestion experiments with Timestream were quite cheap with 514,000 records inserted daily for a whole month and the cost ending up below $10. This is a low barrier to entry for you to make some experiments. I <strong>dropped the memory storage down to two hours</strong>, because I only needed it <strong>for ingestion</strong>. Magnetic store seemed fast enough for my queries.</p>

<p>When I tried to read and precompute data into DynamoDB every few seconds, I noticed that <strong>frequent reads can become expensive</strong>. Timestream requires you to pick an encryption key from the Key Management Service (KMS), which is then used to decrypt data when reading from Timestream. In my experiment decrypting with KMS accounted for about 30% of the actual cost.</p>

<p>Below you can see a chart of my spending on Timestream and KMS with frequent reads on October 14th and 15th.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/bahrmichael/bahrmichael.github.io/raw/master/pictures/2020/timestream/timestream-cost.png" alt="Timestream in Cost Explorer"></p>

<h2 id="problems-and-limitations">Problems and Limitations</h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/API_RejectedRecord.html">Records can get rejected for three reasons</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Duplicate values for the same dimensions, timestamps, and measure names</li>
  <li>Timestamps outside the memory’s retention store</li>
  <li>Dimensions or measures that exceed the Timestream limits (e.g. numbers that are bigger than a BigInt)</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=960046&amp;#960046">my experience with these errors</a> I suggest that you <strong>log the errors but don’t let the exception bubble up</strong>. If you’re building historical charts, one or two missing values shouldn’t be a problem.</p>

<p>Below you can see an example of how I <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/timestream-write.html">write records to Timestream with the boto3 library for Python</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>boto3</span>

        <span>})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Another perceived limitation is that each record can only hold one measurement (name and value). Assuming you have a vehicle with 200 sensors, you could write that into DynamoDB with one request, while Timestream already needs two. However this is pretty easy to compensate and I couldn’t come up with a good acceess pattern where you must combine different measurement types (e.g. temperature and voltage) in a single query.</p>

<p>Last but not least, Timestream does not have provisioned throughput yet. Especially when collecting data from a fleet of IoT sensors it would be nice to limit the ingestion to not cause cost spikes that may be caused by a bug in the sensors. In my tests the cost for writing records has been negligible though.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I moved my timeseries data to Timestream, but added another DynamoDB table for precomputing user facing data. While my cost stayed roughly the same, I now have <strong>cheap long term storage at 12% of the previous price</strong>.</p>

<p>DynamoDB is faster for targeted queries, whereas <strong>Timestream is better for analytics</strong> that include large amounts of data. You can <strong>combine both and precompute</strong> data that needs fast access.</p>

<p>Trying out queries is key to understanding if it fits your use case and its requirements. You can do that in the timestream console with the AWS examples. Beware of frequent reads and monitor your spending.</p>

<h2 id="try-it-out">Try it out</h2>

<p>Try out one of the sample databases through the Timestream console or replicate some of the data you write to DynamoDB into Timestream. You can achieve the latter for example with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html">DynamoDB streams</a>.</p>

		<p>Would you believe that chasing the high score was not always a part of arcade games? Indeed, until well after Pong it was not even a desired feature until 1978’s <em>Star Fire</em> took it to a whole new level. The tale of that game and its many innovations are what we will bring you today, as well as the source code which reveals even more secrets within the legendary game <em>Star Fire</em>.</p>
<p><em>(This article serves as a promotion for the author’s book Candid Conversations in Code: Interviews with the First Generation of Video Game Programmers now available through the website <a href="https://storybundle.com/games">Storybundle</a>. Gaming Alexandria receives no proceeds from the sale of this book.

<p><iframe title="Arcade Longplay - Star Fire (1979) by Exidy" width="747" height="420" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N5r_SM-ugOU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>Star Fire</em>, as with all good ideas, came from a place of ambition. The man with the plan was a fellow named Ted Michon. Michon had worked as a technician at arcade company Digital Games/Micronetics, which set him up to become a game creator for them when he created an early microprocessor game for them called <em>Night Racer</em>. With a new direction for games taking shape and the company he worked for falling apart, Michon decided to form his own independent arcade development company called Techni-Cal in 1976.</p>
<p>Ted was an alumnus of California Technical Institute (CalTech) and knew some of the computer-saavy students behind him in seniority. From this pool he settled on the inventive David Rolfe, who was a hotshot assembly programmer at the school. Rolfe readily admits that he has no interest in games as a matter of enjoyment, but leaps at the chance to solve hard problems. The task Michon had ready for his new employee would scratch that itch.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10608" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10608"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01-Michon.png" alt="" width="305" height="345" srcset="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01-Michon.png 1208w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01-Michon-265x300.png 265w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01-Michon-904x1024.png 904w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01-Michon-768x870.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10608">Michon on left, helping build the world’s tallest card tower in 1975.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ted had become enamored with an obscure film called <em>Star Wars</em>, particularly the iconic spaceship battles. He wanted to create a game which had that same sense of high-flying freedom, as well as incorporating a color monitor (for which had had found a cheap supplier). These sorts of tasks in the late 1970s, preceding even Space Invaders, were tall orders. Michon had created a hardware to facilitate this feat though, so it was up to Rolfe to make it sing.</p>
<p>Coupled with Ted’s then girlfriend (later wife) Susan Owen helping with art, the three person team would work out of Michon’s apartment via a terminal connected to the mainframe at CalTech to embark on their <em>Star Wars</em>-inspired project. At one point they even had hope they could secure the <em>Star Wars</em> license, though no official Star Wars game would emerge until 1982. They would retain major inspirations from that initial concept though, like the title screen at the enemy spacecraft. Michon secured a tentative deal with arcade manufacturer Midway Manufacturing, subsidiary of Bally, and the team would begin to show them work in progress.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10609" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10609"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Rolfe.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="285" srcset="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Rolfe.jpg 571w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Rolfe-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10609">David Rolfe</figcaption></figure>
<p>Rolfe’s first problem to solve was creating an efficient color system which would not consume all the expensive RAM at their disposal. A standard, modern color system would assign a bit for every two colors on the screen, but even a four color system at even standard resolution would be over 32K of RAM. Rolfe’s solution would allow for up to eight total colors which only used 1.8 bits per pixel, with some compromises. For instance the stars in the background could change color from white to blue if one of the Tie Fighter-based enemy ships passed in front of it. Likely this was a form of color-cels as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfh0ytz8S0k">used on the Commodore 64</a>, spread across much larger objects.</p>
<p>Then to make the ships appear as if they existed in a 3D space, Rolfe would have to implement a new technique called spite-scaling. <a href="https://youtu.be/k0uFSSzYaJ8?t=174">Taito’s <em>Interceptor</em></a> had deployed this technique, but that game was only available in Japan. By having Susan create several different images of the enemy spacecraft, Rolfe could switch between the different sizes on the fly to have the fighters swoop in. All of this required a lot of storage, so much so that <em>Star Fire</em> wound up using 21 separate ROM chips to store all the game graphics and code.</p>
<p>Even with the unprecedented excitement and novelty the game could show, Midway was not impressed by the gameplay of <em>Star Fire</em>. It was suggested that they add in an extra element for the player to shoot, and perplexingly Midway President Hank Ross said that this should be a witch on a bicycle, not a spaceship. Even with this additional, the game still wasn’t deemed up to their standards, so Ted and David were both released from their deal.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mattel Electronics Intellivision programmer interviews" width="747" height="560" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UDZq4OLg7wQ?start=37&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With no money coming in, Rolfe had to find some extra work in the meantime. He joined up with APh Technology Consulting, who was at the time working on the programming backbone for what would become the Mattel Intellivision. Rolfe was directly responsible for providing a working prototype for the 1978 Winter CES, after which time Michon had managed to find a new buyer for their space flight game.</p>
<p>Exidy, a smaller arcade company out of Sunnyvale, California, was responsible for minor hits like <em>Death Race</em> and <em>Circus</em>. They were always seeking to push technological boundaries and thought <em>Star Fire</em> could be the sort of stand-out they needed. Rolfe returned to the project to make some minor changes – such as adding Exidy branding, including to an Enterprise-esque spaceship which replaced the witch – and the game was placed into a sit-down cabinet for increased immersion. It felt as close as they could get to the Star Wars game without a license.</p>

<p>After release in November of 1978, Exidy did not find the mega-hit that they were looking for, but they did bring one significant innovation: The high score table. Rolfe had wanted to have players make a mark on the game as a signature of their accomplishments, and he felt that saving scores would be the best way to do that. Such a trick had never been done before. Some arcade owners might take down high scores by hand as part of a formal competition, but <em>Star Fire</em> put these competitive instincts into rigid code. Players would have a reason to return to a machine beyond the novelty, and that goalpost could change constantly, along with the ability to input their initials.</p>
<p>Following this, Rolfe would again work with Michon on the games Fire One and Kreepy Krawlers (unreleased) for Exidy before moving over to full-time on Intellivision work. Before that though, he had prepared a second version of Star Fire for export called ‘Star Fire II’ with fixes from its predecessor. Through the last 40 years, Rolfe has managed to maintain this source code for this game and has provided the opportunity for Gaming Alexandria to share its secrets!</p>
<p>The following observations were made by Ryou of <a href="http://sudden-desu.net/">Sudden Desu</a>, who delved into the Star Fire II code and extracted some interesting findings which support Rolfe’s tale.</p>
<hr>
<h2>STAR WARS</h2>
<p>The visual references are numerous and hard to ignore, from the STAR FIRE logo to the TIE fighter enemies, and even the Exidy ship which has the iconic X Wing laser guns. The David Rolfe interview elaborates on the reasoning behind this. The code is even more explicit in its references. SWARX.ASM is the code to draw the STAR FIRE logo on the title screen, and its TITLE directive is telling:</p>
<pre>TITLE "DO STAR WARS TITLE"</pre>
<p>When this code is called from ATRACT.ASM, it’s referred to as “SPACE WARS”</p>
<pre>CALL DOSWAR ;WRITE SPACE WARS SIGN</pre>
<p>The TIE fighter enemies are referred to by that name as well. TIE.ASM is their primary code.</p>
<pre>SEXTERN PS.TFIR,PS.PULS ;TIE FIGHTER FIRE IN INIT


;MUST BE CALLED BEFORE THE TIE FIGHTERS CYCLE THROUGH THE PSEUDO COLOR RAM
;THIS ROUTINE IS OPTIMIZED FOR SPEED BASE ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT
; MOST OF THE SCREEN IF FILLED WITH ZERO

</pre>
<h2>EASTER EGG</h2>
<p>Star Fire is known as being the first game which allowed for player initials to be saved alongside their score in the High Score list. This also means that Star Fire is the first game that has Easter Eggs based on player initials. The high score list code is located in ATRACT.ASM, and right at the top of the file we have this assembler expression:</p>
<pre>FT.GOD = -1 ;SET IF MACHINE KNOWS US</pre>
<p>And further down, among the code for the player initials input:</p>
<pre>IFE FT.GOD

<p>Indeed, if you enter DBR, TZM or SKM as your initials, you will then see a full screen message reading HI DAVE, HI TED or HI SUSAN, respectively.</p>
<p>You may notice that the labels for Susan’s block of code are TRYSKO and GOTSKO, which implies the initials for the easter egg changed from SKO to SKM. (Did Susan get married along the way…?) Indeed, SKM only works for Star Fire II. In the original Star Fire sets, the initials for Susan’s easter …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img alt="Title image" src="https://www.jaredwolff.com/cbor-for-embedded-c-and-rust/images/CBOR_for_embedded_C__Rust.png" data-src="images/CBOR_for_embedded_C__Rust.png"></p><p>When sending data theres a few ways you can go about it. In the embedded world, it’s not uncommon to serialize data so it can be efficently sent through the ether. On the other end it’s reassembled and used however necessary. In today’s post we’ll chat about serializing with <a href="https://cbor.io/" target="_blank">CBOR</a> (CBOR stands for Concise Binary Object Reprentation). It’s open, widely adopted and available in most popular programming languages.</p><p>The idea of CBOR is to take a structure or object, pack it up efficently for network usage. That way we transmit the least amount of data necessary. This will save you bandwidth but also cost especially for LTE deployments.</p><p>For the purpose of this post we’ll be creating a simple codec for use in embedded. On the “cloud” side we’ll use Rust’s <code>serde_cbor</code> to do the heavy lifting for us. We’ll start with the embedded side.</p><h2 id="your-embedded-options">Your embedded options</h2><p>For the purposes of this post, we’ll work on creating an example you can run on the machine you’re using. The only extra thing you’ll need for the process is to download and include a CBOR library in your project. I’m using <a href="https://github.com/laurencelundblade/QCBOR" target="_blank">QCBOR</a> for this example but other libraries are available like <a href="https://github.com/intel/tinycbor" target="_blank">TinyCBOR</a>. I’ve chosen QCBOR over the later because of its ease of use.</p><h2 id="creating-the-c-codec">Creating the C Codec</h2><p>First, lets create a codec that will encode and decode messages into CBOR format.</p><ol><li><p>First, let’s create the header file: <code>telemetry_codec.h</code></p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;qcbor/qcbor.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>/* Position enum */</span>
<span>enum</span>
{
    telemetry_version_pos,
    telemetry_rssi_pos,
} telemetry_data_positions;

<span>/* Used to store strings */</span>
<span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span>
{
    <span>char</span> bytes[<span>64</span>];
    size_t size;
} telemetry_data_string_t;

<span>/* Struct for telemetry data */</span>
<span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span>
{
    telemetry_data_string_t version;
    int32_t rssi;

} telemetry_data_t;

<span>/* Encode function */</span>
QCBORError <span>telemetry_codec_encode</span>(<span>const</span> telemetry_data_t <span>*</span>p_data, uint8_t <span>*</span>p_buf, size_t len, size_t <span>*</span>p_size);
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see above, <code>telemetry_data_t</code> is the data that we’re trying to encode/decode. Within <code>telemetry_data_t</code> is a <code>telemetry_data_string_t</code> which you can use to store variable length buffer for strings.</p><p>You’ll also notice that i’m defining an enum called <code>telemetry_data_positions</code>. This definies the position in the CBOR that each piece of data will live. This is in substitution of string key/value setup like you’d often see in JSON. See below:</p><p>Instead of:</p><p>You get something like this:</p><p>As you can imagine, you’re saving some bytes here. Even more when you encode using CBOR rather than JSON!</p></li><li><p>Next we’ll want to define the encode function in <code>telemetry_codec.c</code>. First using the defintion provided in the <code>.h</code> file:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">QCBORError telemetry_codec_encode(<span>const</span> telemetry_data_t <span>*</span>p_data, uint8_t <span>*</span>p_buf, size_t len, size_t <span>*</span>p_size)
</code></pre></div><p>Within the function we want to set up a <code>UsefulBuf</code> which we’ll be encoding the data into. There’s also a <code>QCBOREncodeContext</code> that will contain the state of the encoder as it’s used:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">    <span>// Setup of the goods
</span><span></span>    UsefulBuf buf <span>=</span> {
        .ptr <span>=</span> p_buf,
        .len <span>=</span> len};
    QCBOREncodeContext ec;
    QCBOREncode_Init(<span>&amp;</span>ec, buf);
</code></pre></div><p>There are a handful ways to encode data. To emulate a JSON key/value store we’ll be putting our values into a map:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">    <span>/* Create over-arching map */</span>
    QCBOREncode_OpenMap(<span>&amp;</span>ec);
</code></pre></div><p>This allows us to use functions like <code>QCBOREncode_AddBytesToMapN</code> and <code>QCBOREncode_AddInt64ToMapN</code> to add data along with a position key:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">    <span>/* Add the version string */</span>
    UsefulBufC data <span>=</span> {
        .ptr <span>=</span> p_data<span>-&gt;</span>version.bytes,
        .len <span>=</span> p_data<span>-&gt;</span>version.size};
    QCBOREncode_AddBytesToMapN(<span>&amp;</span>ec, telemetry_version_pos, data);

    <span>/* Add the rssi */</span>
    QCBOREncode_AddInt64ToMapN(<span>&amp;</span>ec, telemetry_rssi_pos, p_data<span>-&gt;</span>rssi);
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see above, you can use another <code>UsefulBufC</code> for encoding the bytes from the <code>version</code>. You can encode values into a singluar entry by using <code>QCBOREncode_AddInt64ToMapN</code> or similar. This function will size the CBOR output appropirately an send the least amount of bytes necessary. Thus, in reality it will almost never send a fully 64 bit number.</p><p>Finally, make sure you close out the map and finish encoding!</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">    <span>/* Close the map*/</span>
    QCBOREncode_CloseMap(<span>&amp;</span>ec);

    <span>/* Finish !*/</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>QCBOREncode_FinishGetSize</span>(<span>&amp;</span>ec, p_size);
</code></pre></div><p>In the end your <code>telemetry_codec.c</code> should look something like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;telemetry_codec.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>/* Encode function */</span>
QCBORError <span>telemetry_codec_encode</span>(<span>const</span> telemetry_data_t <span>*</span>p_data, uint8_t <span>*</span>p_buf, size_t len, size_t <span>*</span>p_size)
{

    <span>// Setup of the goods
</span><span></span>    UsefulBuf buf <span>=</span> {
        .ptr <span>=</span> p_buf,
        .len <span>=</span> len};
    QCBOREncodeContext ec;
    QCBOREncode_Init(<span>&amp;</span>ec, buf);

    <span>/* Create over-arching map */</span>
    QCBOREncode_OpenMap(<span>&amp;</span>ec);

    <span>/* Add the version string */</span>
    UsefulBufC data <span>=</span> {
        .ptr <span>=</span> p_data<span>-&gt;</span>version.bytes,
        .len <span>=</span> p_data<span>-&gt;</span>version.size};
    QCBOREncode_AddBytesToMapN(<span>&amp;</span>ec, telemetry_version_pos, data);

    <span>/* Add the rssi */</span>
    QCBOREncode_AddInt64ToMapN(<span>&amp;</span>ec, telemetry_rssi_pos, p_data<span>-&gt;</span>rssi);

    <span>/* Close the map*/</span>
    QCBOREncode_CloseMap(<span>&amp;</span>ec);

    <span>/* Finish !*/</span>
    <span>return</span> QCBOREncode_FinishGetSize(<span>&amp;</span>ec, p_size);
}
</code></pre></div><p>That’s all what’s needed to encode a <code>telemetry_data_t</code> strucure! I’ve also created a decode function in the example code. You can get that at the bottom of this post.</p></li></ol><h2 id="creating-the-http-client">Creating the HTTP Client</h2><ol><li><p>Before getting started you’ll need some dependencies. On Mac you can install <code>cmake</code> and <code>curl</code> using <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">&gt; brew install cmake curl
</code></pre></div></li><li><p>You should also create a <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> with the following contents:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8.2)

# Project
project(CBORClientExample)

# Include directory
include_directories(include)
include_directories(lib/QCBOR/inc/)

# Include sources 
file(GLOB QCBOR_FILES lib/QCBOR/src/*.c)

# Libcurl
link_libraries(curl)

# Executable
add_executable(client main.c src/telemetry_codec.c ${QCBOR_FILES})
</code></pre></div><p>This allows us to import dependencies and compile everything that’s needed. You’ll also notice that theres a <code>lib/QCBOR</code> reference. We’ll need to clone the QCBOR repo for that:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">&gt; mkdir -p lib/
&gt; cd lib
&gt; git clone https://github.com/laurencelundblade/QCBOR.git
</code></pre></div><p>In the example code I added it as a submodule. No cloning necessary. (Initialize with <code>git submodule update --init</code>)</p></li><li><p>Finally in <code>main.c</code> you we can get to work encoding some data and then sending it via HTTP. First let’s create the data:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* Create the object */</span>
telemetry_data_t data <span>=</span> {
    .rssi <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>49</span>,
    .version <span>=</span> {
        .bytes <span>=</span> <span>"0.1.0"</span>,
        .size <span>=</span> strlen(<span>"0.1.0"</span>),
    }};
</code></pre></div><p>Then ecode using the <code>telemetry_codec_encode</code> function we just created:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* Encode the data */</span>
uint8_t buf[<span>256</span>];
size_t size <span>=</span> <span>0</span>;
QCBORError err <span>=</span> telemetry_codec_encode(<span>&amp;</span>data, buf, <span>sizeof</span>(buf), <span>&amp;</span>size);
<span>if</span> (err)
    printf(<span>"QCBOR Error: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, err);
</code></pre></div><p>Then using some modified example code from <a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/c/http-post.html" target="_blank">here</a>, we’ll POST the data to the Rust server we’ll develop in the next section:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">    <span>/* Send data using Libcurl */</span>
    <span>/* Adopted from here: https://curl.se/libcurl/c/http-post.html */</span>
    CURL <span>*</span>curl;
    CURLcode res;

    curl_global_init(CURL_GLOBAL_ALL);

    <span>/* get a curl handle */</span>
    curl <span>=</span> curl_easy_init();
    <span>if</span> (curl)
    {
        <span>/* First set the URL that is about to receive our POST. This URL can

        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, <span>"http://localhost:3030/telemetry/1234"</span>);

        <span>/* Now specify the POST data */</span>
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE, size);
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, buf);

        <span>/* always cleanup */</span>
        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
    }
    curl_global_cleanup();
</code></pre></div><p>The biggest difference fromt he example is the usage of <code>CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE</code> and <code>CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* Now specify the POST data */</span>
curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE, size);
curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, buf);
</code></pre></div><p>This will define the variable sized data we have to send over after encoding. In this case the size will be <code>size</code> and the buffer involved is <code>buf</code> (defined earlier)</p><p>Here’s a full look at the code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;telemetry_codec.h&gt;</span><span>

They allow us to build some features really fast. Showing your stakeholders that youâ€™ve built real-time, collaborative features in almost no-time gets you the â€œwow effectâ€�, so needed in some fields. However, Firestore has also many pain points that, in my opinion, outweigh the pros in most of the more advanced cases.</p><p>This is a series of articles where we are comprehensively describing <strong>pros and cons of using Firestore as the backend for your next mobile application</strong>. In this series, we will try to show you that making this decision is not a simple process and you need to analyze your app from multiple perspectives.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><h2>Author</h2><div><p><img alt="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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"></p></div></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><h4><strong>Posts in the series:</strong></h4><p><strong>1.

For free you get services that complement each other with ergonomic and easy to bootstrap libraries. With Firestore libs you get all the goodies of Firebase suite - auth, serverless, storage, ML and others perfectly blended with the language specifics.<br></p><p><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/leancodelanding2/dc9745e6-6cc3-45d1-bbb9-c661003ebaf7_Group+1529.png"></p><p>The only bad thing about it is that they are pervasive - once you get them, you start using them everywhere. In all layers. Generally, that is a bad thing, but letâ€™s be honest here, most small apps donâ€™t need any additional abstractions and using the libraries directly is a good thing.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMjY4IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjM4IiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjY4IDM4IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjxwYXRoIGQ9Ik0yNDguOTY5IDM4VjBNMjY4IDE4Ljk4NWgtMzguMDMyTTEzMy45ODUgMzhWMG0xOS4wMzEgMTguOTg1aC0zOC4wMzJNMTkuMDMxIDM4VjBtMTkuMDAxIDE4Ljk4NUgwIiBzdHJva2U9IiMwMDAiIHN0cm9rZS1taXRlcmxpbWl0PSIxMCIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="></p></div></div><div><h2><strong>Offline capabilities</strong></h2><p><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/leancodelanding2/62110205-82f5-4a52-bef3-2a190f906b77_Mask+Group+%285%29.png"></p><p>This is a major trait of Firestore. The truly killer feature - <strong>it can work </strong>(to some extent) <strong>offline.</strong> <em>Seamlessly</em>. If you have accessed the data previously, you can do so again without the Internet connection. You can even save the data there without active connection. Firestore libraries handle all the syncing, data merging, notifications and other problems.<br></p><h2><strong>You donâ€™t need backendâ€¦ sometimes<br></strong></h2><p><strong>Firebase platform (that Firestore is part of) might be a viable â€œbackendâ€� option for small, user-focused apps.</strong> If you use it alongside other SaaS solutions (e-mails, voice calls, etc.), you might be even able to build a not-so-small app without creating any traditional backend system.<br></p><p><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/leancodelanding2/0b913bc2-d221-491b-9f35-c4503a14c2bc_qwerty.png"></p><h4><strong><br>Firebase suite provides you with:</strong></h4><ol><li>Auth - Firebase Auth.</li><li>Storage - Firebase Cloud Storage.</li><li>Serverless - Firebase Cloud Functions.</li><li>Basic machine learning - Firebase ML.</li><li>A/B tests &amp; user-scoped configuration - Firebase Remote Configuration.</li><li>App distribution &amp; monitoring - Firebase App Distribution &amp; Crashlytics.</li><li>Many, many more.</li></ol><p><strong>Being Googleâ€™s product, it also integrates well with GCP.</strong> It blends with it more and more with every release and I suppose that soon, these two will be fully merged.</p><p>Having all these solutions in a single place, governed by the same IAM services and configured the same gives you a great advantage right at the beginning. It allows you to focus on what matters, leaving all the gritty details to Firebase. Even if you end up needing some more advanced backend features, you can always use <strong>Cloud Functions</strong> and do it the <em>normal way</em>.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iNzUiIGhlaWdodD0iMzgiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA3NSAzOCIgZmlsbD0ibm9uZSIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj48cGF0aCBkPSJNNC4wODcgMzhMMCAzMy45NTEgMTQuODUgMTkuMDMgMCA0LjEwNyA0LjA4NyAwbDE4Ljg4IDE5LjAyOUw0LjA4NiAzOHptMjUuOTU5IDBsLTQuMDMtNC4wNDlMNDAuODY4IDE5LjAzIDI2LjAxNyA0LjEwNyAzMC4wNDcgMGwxOC45MzYgMTkuMDI5TDMwLjA0NiAzOHptMjYuMDE3IDBsLTQuMDg3LTQuMDQ5IDE0Ljg1LTE0LjkyMi0xNC44NS0xNC45MjJMNTYuMDYzIDAgNzUgMTkuMDI5IDU2LjA2MyAzOHoiIGZpbGw9IiMwMDAiLz48L3N2Zz4="></p></div></div><div><h2><strong>Examples</strong></h2><p><br>Firestore is great for many things.

Jagged GPS signal, no Internet, very slow connection, intermittent Internet connection, apparent connection - all need to be taken care of. With Firestore, we were able to handle all of the cases and give our users a solution that works everywhere, even in very remote areas, without that much of a development.Â&nbsp;</p><p>There are tons of other places where Firestore is a great solution, but Firestore simplicity can take its toll. Where Firestore shines and simplifies things at the beginning, it can make your hair gray after the application gets complicated enough. As everything in programming - you need to wage pros and cons, consider the future and select what is best for your app. </p></div></div></div></section><section><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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"></p></div></div><div><p>Do you want to find out how the Firestore pricing works or what traps wait for you if you want to properly secure it?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In this article, I will be describing my experience preparing for and taking the CKAD exam. A little bit about my background to relate with if you’re also on the same boat as I was: I am primarily a Software Developer; I’ve used mostly Python and Go. I have some experience in shell scripting and nearly negligible experience in DevOps.</p>
<p>First, we’ll spell out what the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam is. According to <a href="https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the CNCF website</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam certifies that users can design, build, configure, and expose cloud-native applications for Kubernetes.” </p><cite><a href="https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNCF</a></cite></blockquote>
<p>I recommend going through the CNCF website to understand the curriculum, exam tips, and other FAQs.</p>
<p>We’ll now dig into what it took me, an absolute beginner to DevOps, to prepare for the CKAD exam.</p>
<p>There are a few fundamental prerequisites such as Linux know-how, YAML configuration, Docker, etc., that one must know before proceeding to the Kubernetes world. I find the <a href="https://kodekloud.com/p/learning-path" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learning path</a> recommended on the <a href="https://kodekloud.com/courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KodeKloud</a> website to be especially helpful to plan the order of learning the prerequisites.</p>
<h2>Certified Kubernetes Application Developer materials and courses</h2>

<p>I did the following courses offered by KodeKloud (this is most definitely not a plug for KodeKloud, you may learn all of these from other sources if you wish) in the order listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Linux </strong>– <strong>The Linux Basics Course</strong>. This course might not be necessary for everyone. If you’re familiar with the Linux terminal, basic commands, and comfortable using the Linux terminal, then you’re good to go.</p>
<p><strong>Automation</strong> – <strong>Ansible for Beginners.</strong> It is essential to understand how the YAML configuration works and know the data structures used in a YAML file. This course explains all of this and provides exercises for hands-on practising, among other topics.</p>
<p><strong>Docker – Docker for Absolute Beginners, Docker – SWARM | SERVICES | STACKS</strong>. Before jumping directly to Kubernetes, I think it is essential to understand the fundamentals of containers and container-based systems. Learning about the Docker platform is a great way to start with it. Once you are familiar with the basics of Docker, proceed further to learn advanced topics such as Docker Swarm, Services, etc., These courses should provide you with a pretty strong foundation to being learning Kubernetes.</p>
<p><strong>Kubernetes – Kubernetes for the Absolute Beginners, Certified Kubernetes Application Developer</strong>. These courses explain the core concepts in Kubernetes very well. The content of the CKAD course is tailor-made to fit the CKAD exam curriculum. Working through these courses, their practice materials, and mock exam should give one enough idea about the actual exam. I would also like to add that only these courses might not be sufficient to excel in the exam. Find more resources to help you practice.</p>
<p>What I find noteworthy about these courses is that KodeKloud provides a virtual lab to practice what you have learnt right away. Personally, for me, this is a huge plus. If you have only been watching a bunch of videos without getting your hands dirty, then it is not going to be of much use.</p>
<p>Other helpful resources to prepare for the exam:</p>
<ol type="1"><li><a href="https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises</a> – This is extremely helpful for more practice questions.</li><li>Even more practice – <a href="https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/practice-enough-with-these-questions-for-the-ckad-exam-2f42d1228552" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/practice-enough-with-these-questions-for-the-ckad-exam-2f42d1228552</a></li></ol>
<h2>Tips for pulling off the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam</h2>
<p>There are a few key aspects that will help you with the exam.</p>
<ol type="1"><li><strong>Familiarity</strong> – Familiarize yourself with the exam curriculum, the kubectl command, exporting to a yaml definition file (instead of writing one from scratch), and editing it as needed.</li><li><strong>Practice</strong> – The more you practice, the more familiar you are with the commands and shortcuts you learn along the way. Practising will also help you respond faster.</li><li><strong>Speed</strong> – Speed is particularly crucial to ace the exam. You have about 2 hours to answer 19 questions. And each of these questions may have sub-tasks. Again, at the cost of repeating myself, practice, practice, keep practising!</li><li><strong>Helpful resources during the exam</strong> – You do not have to remember definitions of all the Kubernetes resources. You have access to Kubernetes documentation during the exam to look up any information you want. Besides documentation, you can also use the <strong>‘kubectl explain’</strong> command to look up any resource. Learn how to use the <strong>‘kubectl explain’ </strong>command to your advantage, as this will save you a lot of time.</li><li><strong>Time awareness </strong>– Be aware of the amount of time you spend on each question. Some might require only a couple of minutes, while others require more. Skim through all the questions quickly, make a mental estimate of the time you will have to spend on each of them.</li><li><strong>WiFi – </strong>Ensure that you have seamless internet connectivity to avoid disruptions during your exam.</li><li>Be physically and mentally prepared to sit through the exam for about 2 hours with no break. I know you could take breaks in between, but that will cost you time. So, be prepared.</li></ol>
<p>Ensure that you’re well-rested. Do not stress yourself about the exam as it will only hinder your performance. Even if you do not pass the exam on your first try, you can retake the exam once more. You will have gained insight into the exam expectations, which will surely help you prepare well for your next try. Keep calm and give your best 😊</p>

<p>Earlier today, I was briefly entertaining the idea of writing a library to wrap and enhance querySelectorAll in certain ways. I thought I’d rather not introduce a <a href="http://projects.verou.me/parsel/">Parsel</a> dependency out of the box, but only use it to parse selectors properly when it’s available, and use more crude regex when it’s not (which would cover most use cases for what I wanted to do).</p>



<p>In the olden days, where every library introduced a global, I could just do:</p>



<pre><code>if (window.Parsel) {
	let ast = Parsel.parse();
	// rewrite selector properly, with AST
}
else {
	// crude regex replace
}</code></pre>



<p>However, with ESM, there doesn’t seem to be a way to detect whether a module is imported, without actually importing it yourself.</p>



<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/1329389035249422336">tweeted</a> about this…</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>One issue with ESM (and other module systems) is that you can't have optional dependencies. </p><p>With globals, you could check if a global existed and branch accordingly. With modules, you can't check if a module is available/loaded without importing it from somewhere.</p></div>— Lea Verou (@LeaVerou) <a href="https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/1329389035249422336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>I thought this was a common paradigm, and everyone would understand why this was useful. However, I was surprised to find that most people were baffled about my use case. Most of them thought I was either talking about conditional imports, or error recovery after failed imports.</p>



<p>I suspect it might be because my primary perspective for writing JS is that of a library author, where I do not control the host environment, whereas for most developers, their primary perspective is that of writing JS for a specific app or website.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/1329389035249422336">Kyle Simpson asked me to elaborate</a> about the use case, I figured a blog post was in order.</p>



<p>The use case is essentially <strong>progressive enhancement</strong> (in fact, I toyed with the idea of titling this blog post <em><strong>“Progressively Enhanced JS”</strong></em>). If library X is loaded already by other code, do a more elaborate thing and cover all the edge cases, otherwise do a more basic thing. It’s for dependencies that are not really <strong>depend</strong>encies, but more like <strong>nice-to-haves</strong>.</p>



<p>We often see modules that do things really well, but use a ton of dependencies and add a lot of weight, even to the simplest of projects, because they need to cater to all the edge cases that we may not care about. We also see modules that are dependency free, but that’s because lots of things are implemented more crudely, or certain features are not there.</p>



<p>This paradigm gives you the best of both worlds: <strong>Dependency free</strong> (or low dependency) modules, that can use what’s available to improve how they do things with <strong>zero additional impact</strong>. </p>



<p>Using this paradigm, the <strong>size of these dependencies is not a concern</strong>, because they are <strong>optional peer dependencies</strong>, so one can pick the best library for the job without being affected by bundle size. Or even use multiple! One does not even need to pick one dependency for each thing, they can support bigger, more complete libraries when they’re available and fall back to micro-libraries when they are not.</p>



<p>Some examples besides the one in the first paragraph:</p>



<ul><li>A Markdown to HTML converter that also syntax highlights blocks of code if <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> is present. Or it could even support multiple different highlighters!</li><li>A code editor that uses <a href="https://projects.verou.me/incrementable">Incrementable</a> to make numbers incrementable via arrow keys, if it’s present</li><li>A templating library that also uses <a href="https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/">Dragula</a> to make items rearrangable via drag &amp; drop, if present</li><li>A testing framework that uses <a href="https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/">Tippy</a> for nice informational popups, when it’s available</li><li>A code editor that shows code size (in KB) if a library to measure that is included. Same editor can also show gzipped code size if a gzip library is included.</li><li>A UI library that uses a custom element if it’s available or the closest native one when it’s not (e.g. a fancy date picker vs <code>&lt;input type="date"&gt;</code> ) when it isn’t. Or <a href="https://projects.verou.me/awesomplete/">Awesomplete</a> for autocomplete when it’s available, and fall back to a simple <code>&lt;datalist&gt;</code> when it isn’t.</li><li>Code that uses a date formatting library when one is already loaded, and falls back to <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat">Intl.DateTimeFormat</a></code> when it’s not.</li></ul>



<p>This pattern can even be <strong>combined with conditional loading</strong>: e.g. we check for all known syntax highlighters and load Prism if none are present.</p>



<p>To recap, some of the <strong>main benefits</strong> are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Performance:</strong> If you’re loading modules over the network HTTP requests are expensive. If you’re pre-bundling it increases bundle size. Even if code size is not a concern, runtime performance is affected if you take the slow but always correct path when you don’t need it and a more crude approach would satisfice.</li><li><strong>Choice:</strong> Instead of picking one library for the thing you need, you can support multiple. E.g. multiple syntax highlighters, multiple Markdown parsers etc. If a library is always needed to do the thing you want, you can load it conditionally, if none of the ones you support are loaded already.</li></ul>



<h2>Are weak dependencies an antipattern?</h2>



<p>Since this article was posted, some of the feedback I got was along the lines of <em>“Weak dependencies are an antipattern because they are unpredictable. What if you have included a library but don’t want another library to use it? You should instead use parameters to explicitly provide references to these libraries.”</em></p>



<p>There are several counterpoints to make here.</p>



<p>First, if weak dependencies are used well, they are only used to <em>enhance</em> the default/basic behavior, so it’s highly unlikely that you’d want to turn that off and fall back to the default behavior.</p>



<p>Second, weak dependencies and parameter injection are not mutually exclusive. They can work together and complement each other, so that the weak dependencies provide sensible defaults that the parameters can then tweak further (or disable altogether). <em>Only</em> having parameter injection imposes a high upfront cognitive cost for using the library (see <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration">Convention over Configuration</a></em>). <strong>Good APIs make simple things easy and complex things possible.</strong> The common case is that if you’ve loaded e.g. a syntax highlighter, you’d want to use it to syntax highlight, and if you’ve loaded a parser, you’d prefer it over parsing with regexes. The obscure edge cases where you wouldn’t want to highlight or you want to provide a different parser can still be possible via parameters, but should not be the only way.</p>



<p>Third, the end user-developer may not even be aware of all the libraries that are being loaded, so they may already have a library loaded for a certain task but not know about it. The weak dependencies pattern operates directly on which modules are loaded so it doesn’t suffer from this problem.</p>



<h2>How could this work with ESM?</h2>



<p>Some people (mostly fellow library authors) *did* understand what I was talking about, and expressed some ideas about how this would work.</p>



<p><strong>Idea 1:</strong> A global module loaded cache could be a low-level way to implement this, and something CJS supports out of the box apparently.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">CommonJS exposes the cache … maybe ESM could follow, handy also for cache invalidation and code coverage with tests … indeed my tests are all CommonJS and I *can’t* change that 😔</p>— Andrea Giammarchi 🍥 (@WebReflection) <a href="https://twitter.com/WebReflection/status/1329396560694796290?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p><strong>Idea 2:</strong> A global registry where modules can register themselves on, either with an identifier, or a SHA hash<br><strong>Idea 3:</strong> An <code>import.whenDefined(moduleURL)</code> promise, though that makes it difficult to deal with the module not being present at all, which is the whole point.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>an ugly way could be to:<br>globalThis[Symbol.for(moduleName)] = true;<br>in the main module export/file</p><p>another way I use with uce is to pass through customElements.whenDefined('uce-lib').then(…) so that if nobody imports 'uce' nothing happens</p><p>import.whenDefined(module).then(…)?</p></div>— Andrea Giammarchi 🍥 (@WebReflection) <a href="https://twitter.com/WebReflection/status/1329420308491677696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If it exported a known SHA. a could be solved</p>— James Campbell (@jcampbell_05) <a href="https://twitter.com/jcampbell_05/status/1329413956474187777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p><strong>Idea 4:</strong> Monitoring <code>&lt;link rel="modulepreload"&gt;</code>. The problem is that not all modules are loaded this way.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I had a few things in mind:</p><p>– if the tag is present in the page, you could assume it's either present or will be very soon (already loading), so that might/should be a safe enough signal for your use-case</p><p>– you could also attach a load event handler to the tag to observe it</p></div>— getify (@getify) <a href="https://twitter.com/getify/status/1329407281797222401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p><strong>Idea 5:</strong> I was thinking of a function like <code>import()</code> that resolves with the module (same as a regular dynamic import) only when the module is already loaded, or rejects when it’s not (which can be caught). In fact, it could even use the same functional notation, with a second argument, like so:</p>



<pre><code>import("https://cool-library", {weak: true});</code></pre>



<p>Nearly all of these proposals suffer from one of the following problems.</p>



<p>Those that are <strong>URL based</strong> mean that only modules loaded from the same URL would be recognized. The same library loaded over a CDN vs locally would not be recognized as the same library. </p>



<p>One way around this is to expose a list of URLs, like the first idea, and allow to listen for changes to it. Then these URLs can be inspected and those which <em><strong>might</strong></em> belong to the module we are looking for can be further inspected by dynamically importing and inspecting their exports (importing already imported modules is a pretty cheap operation, the browser does de-duplicate the request).</p>



<p>Those that are <strong>identifier based</strong>, depend on the module to register itself with an identifier, so only modules that want to be exposed, will be. This is the closest to the old global situation, but would suffer in the transitional period until most modules use it. And of course, there is the potential for clashes. Though the API could take care of that, by essentially using a hashtable and adding all modules that register themselves with the same identifier under the same “bucket”. Code reading the registry would then be responsible for filtering.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Media manipulation through images and videos has been around for decades. For example, during <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4984364/How-Hitler-Mussolini-Lenin-used-photo-editing.html">WWII, Mousollini released a propaganda image</a> of himself on a horse with his horse handler edited out. The goal was to make himself seem more impressive and powerful <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. These types of tricks can have significant impacts given the scale of the audience, especially in the internet era. <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/media-forensics">DARPA has constructed an entire program</a> to develop media forensics methods for detecting manipulated media <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/12/deep-fakes-fake-news-truth">Fake news may one day pale in comparison to the impact of deepfake news</a> <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. Deepfakes are a set of Computer Vision methods that can create doctored images or videos with uncanny realism. In recent years, they have been blowing up in both quality and popularity. The term deepfake comes from a “fake” image or video generated by a “deep” learning algorithm. You’ve likely seen a video of a movie scene with actors face-swapped with a scary degree of accuracy.</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>Deepfake of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Silvester Stallone in the movie Step Brothers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXwmSFjlVc0">(source)</a></figcaption>    
</figure>

<p>This technology has the potential to provide malicious actors with the means to sow unprecedented amounts of disinformation because it is far cheaper and more accessible than traditional special effects techniques used in Hollywood when it comes to creating videos with realistic face-swaps. This is concerning, since fake news is already prevalent and people are all too often believing news with little to no evidence <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. Just recently, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/01/tech/false-biden-video-twitter/index.html">a deceptively-edited video making it look like Joe Biden didn’t know what state he is in got 1 million views on Twitter</a> <sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. Deepfakes could provide “evidence” to people who are looking to further their cognitive dissonance around disinformation. This is a real threat, with two bills <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3230/text">H. R. 3230</a>,<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/3805/text">S. 3805</a> having already been proposed in Congress to counter the spread of deepfakes for illegal purposes.</p>

</figure>

<p>Since the term was coined in 2017, the amount of detected deepfakes on the internet has been increasing exponentially. At the same time, the underlying AI methods to generate deepfakes have improved, as have user-friendly tools that allow one to easily create deepfakes without in-depth technical knowhow. In this blog post, I’m going to go over some background behind deepfakes, what they have been used for, and how to counter them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A deepfake refers to a specific kind of synthetic media where a person in an image or video is swapped with another person’s likeness. -<a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/deepfakes-explained">Meredith Somers</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Synthetic image and video generation have been a growing computer vision subfields, and they got a lot of momentum with the introduction of generative adversarial networks (GAN) in 2014 <sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">6</a></sup>. The term “deepfake” was first coined by a Reddit user in 2017 who was using the technology to create fake pornography of celebrities using face swaps <sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10">7</a></sup>. Since then, the term has evolved to cover a wider range of image and video augmentations and generation as well as some audio applications.</p>

<p>Deepfakes come in a variety of forms according to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11138.pdf#page=34&amp;zoom=100,65,305">Mirsky and Lee</a> <sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">8</a></sup>. Here are examples of different types of deep fakes on a woman’s face:</p>

<h3 id="reenactment">Reenactment</h3>
<p>aka Using your facial or body movements to dictate the movements of another person</p>

<p>Current works in reenactment are looking to minimize the amount of training data that is needed to be able to generate a modified face. One-shot and few-shot learning have become popular approaches to utilize data from many different faces but only need to fine tune on a select few samples of their target face. Some of the leading methods here are <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08139.pdf">MarioNETte</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09224.pdf">FLNet</a>.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="replacement">Replacement</h3>
<p>aka Your identity is mapped to another person (for example the face swap filter on Snapchat)</p>

<p>Many replacement works apply either encoder-decoder networks or variational autoencoders to learn to map the source face to the target while retaining the same expressions. Common challenges that come up with replacement is the need to deal with occlusions, when an object passes in front of the target’s face. Recent replacement models include <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13457">FaceShifter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/shaoanlu/faceswap-GAN">FaceSwap-GAN</a>.</p>

<p>Reenactment and replacement are the two most prominent types of deepfakes, since they have the highest potential for destructive applications. For example, the face of a politician could be reenacted to say something they never actually said, or a person’s face could be replaced into an incriminating video for blackmail purposes. These types of manipulated media (deepfake or not) can be incriminating and/or harmful to the target’s reputation, like the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/01/tech/false-biden-video-twitter/index.html">post of Biden mentioned earlier</a> in which signs that said the name of the state were edited to make it look like he didn’t know where he was.</p>

<p>At the core of the concern about deepfakes is the fact that they make reenactment and replacement accessible and cheap; you don’t have to understand the details of the techniques involved to be able to create deepfakes. Tools like <a href="https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab">DeepFaceLab</a> allow anyone to take an image or video and replace a face, de-age a face, or manipulate a speech. For really seamless deepfakes, tools like this will provide a high quality generation of a face, but you still need some experience in video editing software like Adobe After Effects to add them to a video. If you don’t have the desire or ability to make them yourself, you can even find services and marketplaces willing to create deepfakes for you. One example is <a href="https://deepfakesweb.com/">https://deepfakesweb.com/</a> where you just have to upload videos and images you want, and they will create a deepfake for you in the cloud.</p>

<p>When deepfakes first gained popularity in 2017, they were overwhelmingly used in internet forums to generate fake pornography of celebrities. Even in 2019, 96% of all publicly posted deepfakes were pornographic, according to a <a href="https://sensity.ai/mapping-the-deepfake-landscape/">survey</a> done by the company <a href="https://sensity.ai/about/">sensity</a>. The targets of deepfakes (the people who have their faces swapped into deepfakes) are generally people who work in the entertainment industry.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="deepfakes-in-media">Deepfakes in Media</h3>

<p>Aside from pornography, various online creators have been applying deepfakes to other forms of media, namely movie clips; individuals are constantly producing viral videos face swapping actors of movies with other actors. For example, in a recent YouTube video the faces of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Silvester Stalone were added to the movie Step Brothers <sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11">9</a></sup>.</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>Deepfake of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Silvester Stallone in the movie Step Brothers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXwmSFjlVc0">(source)</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While such videos suggest deepfakes could prove to be useful for the entertainment industry, most of these viral videos have just been short demonstrations, and there has yet to be a major Hollywood production to utilize deepfakes. Though, some might say that Hollywood should already be using deepfakes. Netflix received a lot of criticism for the quality of the de-aging effect that was used in the movie “The Irishman”. In response, someone <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/the-irishman-deepfake">applied a de-aging deepfake to the movie and got impressive results</a>; perhaps it’s only a matter of time until Hollywood productions use these tools directly.</p>

<p>While no large blockbusters have used deepfakes, there are some accounts of smaller productions experimenting with deepfakes. Most notably, a producer has used deepfakes in his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/movies/deepfakes-documentary-welcome-to-chechnya.html">documentary about gay and lesbian persecution in Chechnya, to disguse the identities of the people being interviewed</a>.</p>

<p>As the examples above demonstrate, besides the possible negative uses of deepfakes, they can also lead to new possibilities when it comes to the entertainment industry. For instance, it could be really cool to be able to select which actor you want to watch in a movie. And, comedy impersonations like on Saturday Night Live will no doubt also reach a whole new level with deepfakes. In fact, just the other week, the creators of South park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, started a new comedy series on YouTube called “Sassy Justice” centered around using deepfakes for celebrity impersonations. If you’re a fan of South Park you should definitely check it out:</p>

<h3 id="deepfakes-in-politics">Deepfakes in Politics</h3>

<p>Whenever a deepfake video gains attention online, there are always numerous comments from people expressing their concerns about using deepfakes to influence politics for nefarious purposes. These concerns are definitely valid, since in the information age being able to flood the internet with fake media about your political opponents that can fool viewers eyes and ears could be disastrous. To date, there have been quite a few deepfakes made addressing politics, many of which are satirical. One of the most popular was made by Jordan Peele where he reenacted Obama’s face <sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12">10</a></sup>. This was not done maliciously, but rather to raise awareness of the potential that deepfakes have to shape the political landscape.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legal Technology, or LegalTech, is the employment of technology and software to assist the legal&nbsp; profession with day-to-day operations, primarily to increase efficiency and save time. Most of the work of legal professionals, even when it comes to litigation, is clerical and repetitive.</p><p>To give legal professionals more time and space to put their minds to pressing matters which require human instinct and discernment, automated systems are being increasingly implemented. In recent years, the LegalTech industry has boomed with growing interest in the use of technology in all things legal.</p><p>The following major advancements have contributed to the further digitalization of the legal profession:<br></p><p><strong>Artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> is the ability of a computer or a robot controlled by a computer to do tasks that are usually done by humans that require human intelligence and judgment. In the legal industry, the use of AI has become quite significant over the years in Legal Research, Due Diligence, Contract Review, Risk Analysis and Legal Outcome Prediction.<br></p><p><strong>AI applications: </strong>AI has been simplifying research for legal professionals for years now with the help of research databases such as WestLaw and LexisNexis. AI-powered tools¹ can review documents and flag them as pertinent to a case, and once a certain type of document is identified as relevant, machine learning algorithms find other documents that are similarly relevant. Moreover, AI makes contract review more efficient by highlighting the most significant clauses of a contract, thus saving time that would otherwise be spent reading lengthy and arduous contracts. AI also helps identify contractual risks that could have negative repercussions for clients. AI can redline items, revise contracts, counsel clients on whether they should sign a contract or not, and can even help clients negotiate better terms.&nbsp;<br></p><p>AI also significantly contributes to the procurement of client background information for the purpose of due diligence. Additionally, it also helps in predicting the outcomes of legal proceedings, for which it applies² natural-language processing to a multitude of court decisions to locate trends that can be used to a client’s advantage. Thus, the use of AI in the legal sector is increasing manifold and can soon replace human involvement, thereby enabling more human attention to critical legal tasks.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f2c641d738317342c81b2b8/5fb6d86d41842fad0c48b3af_pexels-julia-m-cameron-4145190.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>E-billing:</strong> With law firms serving hundreds of clients, invoicing becomes a very strenuous task. E-billing³ is the automation of the review and approval of invoices received by the legal department of a firm. Legal e-billing systems enable legal teams to make rules on the basis of which incoming invoices are automatically reviewed, approved and rejected, thereby saving human effort and time while also removing the possibility of human error. Thus, not only is it a simpler record keeping software, in addition to simplifying record keeping, e-billing can also be used to identify cost-cutting measures and data-driven financial strategies. It is the ultimate win-win scenario; who doesn’t like to do less work and still earn profit?<br></p><p><strong>Blockchain and Smart Contracts:</strong> Arising as one of the finest developments in the world of algorithms in the later half of this past decade, blockchain is a transparent system whereby information is recorded, duplicated and distributed across an entire distributed network of computer systems. One application of blockchain that excites the legal profession is smart contracts. Smart contracts are basically terms of an agreement written into computational code in such a way that it is devoid of ambiguity and has no need for interpretation. Smart contract code is automatically executed and validated using cutting-edge cryptographic technology, and truly decentralized blockchains also provide protected systems⁴ immune to hacking, forgery, or post-deployment editing. Blockchains enable legal professionals to write and deploy smart contracts that can not be edited after publication by malicious actors and that will function as intended without administration by a third-party authority. All legal professionals should consider investing in this level of security and trustless reliability.<br></p><p><strong>E-courts</strong> are systems whereby court documents, right from filing complaints and evidence to the delivery of justice, are administered online. Even though <strong>E-filing</strong> is not a recent development, the COVID-19 pandemic has definitely increased its importance in the functioning of courts and the entire legal system.&nbsp;</p><p>Many courts that have switched to electronic filing also have an electronic docket system. This system allows users to browse through all filed documents quickly and efficiently. File collections that used to take up entire rooms can now be managed entirely electronically. Thus, it is a cost-cutting and time-saving mechanism for both parties and the courts, and further ensures speedy delivery of justice.<br></p><p><strong>Cloud computing:</strong> is another jewel in the LegalTech crown.&nbsp; Cloud computing technologies⁵ have been in use since the 1950s, but lately they have been adopted and assimilated into the operations of law firms. Cloud computing provides mobility and work space independence to professionals and can also be cost-friendly; however, it provides a lot of ethical dilemmas and issues regarding data breaches and security, due to potential lack of control of what personnel can access sensitive data. Hence, data protection, access control, and security comprise yet another domain that law firms have begun investing into heavily. Information being the new currency of the 21st century, cloud computing and data protection form the backbone of modern legal services.<br></p><p><strong>LegalTech startups:</strong> In recent years, LegalTech startups have been capitalizing on the demand for development of technology compatible with the legal sector. Some legal startups develop AI based software that contribute to cost-efficient and time-saving legal processes, thereby reducing the burden on managers, lawyers and litigants. LegalTech is a very promising and ever-evolving field, with lots of avenues yet unexplored and endless possibilities as technology is only bound to get better.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>COVID and its effect on the LegalTech sector:</strong> Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence and application of LegalTech has become all the more important in modern times, and it&nbsp; will completely revolutionize the traditional operations of the legal industry.</p><p>Although LegalTech appears to be quite an attractive and exciting field, one must not forget that technology is but a means to an end, the end here being justice and societal betterment, something which cannot be completely devoid of human touch.</p><h4>‍</h4><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h4><em>References</em></h4><p>¹ Bernard Marr, How AI And Machine Learning Are Transforming Law Firms And The Legal Sector, May 23, 2018,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/23/how-ai-and-machine-learning-are-transforming-law-firms-and-the-legal-sector/#67d853ac32c3"> https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/23/how-ai-and-machine-learning-are-transforming-law-firms-and-the-legal-sector/#67d853ac32c3</a><br></p><p>² Jason Koebler, Rise of the Robolawyers, April 2017, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/rise-of-the-robolawyers/517794/">https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/rise-of-the-robolawyers/517794/</a><br></p><p>³ What is Legal E-Billing?, <a href="https://www.busylamp.com/what-is-legal-e-billing/">https://www.busylamp.com/what-is-legal-e-billing/</a><br></p><p>⁴ Cameron Haden, How Blockchain Could Affect Your Legal Career, <a href="https://www.thelawyerportal.com/blog/how-blockchain-affects-your-legal-career/">https://www.thelawyerportal.com/blog/how-blockchain-affects-your-legal-career/</a></p><p>⁵ Cloud Computing for the Legal Profession: Challenges and Opportunities, <a href="https://theknowledgereview.com/cloud-computing-legal-profession-challenges-opportunities/">https://theknowledgereview.com/cloud-computing-legal-profession-challenges-opportunities/</a><br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p><em><strong>Join us November 25, 2020 at 1 pm EST for ShipIt! Presents: The State of Ruby Static Typing at Shopify as we talk about static typing at Shopify. We’ll share why we chose Sorbet for the monolith and the lessons we learned along the way the&nbsp;way. <a href="#ShipIt">Please Register</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p>Shopify changes a lot. We merge around 400 commits to the main branch daily and deploy a new version of our core monolith 40 times a day. The Monolith is also big: 37,000 Ruby files, 622,000 methods, more than 2,000,000 calls. At this scale with a dynamic language, even with the most rigorous review process and over 150,000 automated tests, it’s a challenge to ensure everything&nbsp;runs smoothly. Developers benefit from a short feedback loop to ensure the stability of our monolith for our merchants.</p>
<p>Since 2018, our Ruby Infrastructure team has looked at ways to make the development process safer, faster, and more enjoyable for Ruby developers. While Ruby is different from other languages and brings amazing features allowing Shopify to be what it is today, we felt there was a feature from other languages missing: <strong>static typing</strong>.</p>

<p>Even in 2018, typing for Ruby wasn't a novelty. A few attempts were made to integrate type annotations directly into the language or through external tools (RDL, Steep), or as libraries (dry-types).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which solution would best fit Shopify considering its codebase and culture? For the Ruby Infrastructure team, the best match for a typing solution needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Gradual typing: </strong>Typing a monolith isn't a simple task and can’t be done in a day. Our code evolves fast, and we can’t ask developers to stop coding while we add types to the existing codebase. We need flexibility to add types without blocking the development process or limiting our ability to satisfy merchants needs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Speed</strong>: Considering the size of Shopify’s codebase, speed is a concern. If our goal is to provide quick feedback on errors and remove pressure from continuous integration (CI), we need a solution that’s fast.</li>
<li>
<strong>Full Ruby support</strong>: We use all of Ruby at Shopify. Our culture embraces the language and benefits from all features, even hard to type ones like metaprogramming, overloading, and class reopening. Support for Rails is also a must. From code elegance to developer happiness, the chosen solution needs to be compatible as much as possible with all Ruby features.</li>
</ul>
<p>With such a list of requirements, none of the contenders at the time could satisfy our needs, especially the speed requirement. We started thinking about developing our own solution, but a perfectly timed meeting with Stripe, who were working on a solution to the problem, introduced us to <a href="https://sorbet.org/" target="_blank" title="Sorbet is a fast, powerful type checker designed for Ruby" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sorbet</a>.</p>
<p>Sorbet was closed-source at the time and under heavy development but was already promising. It’s built for gradual typing with phenomenal performance (able to analyze 100,000 lines per second per core) making it significantly faster than running automated tests. It can handle hard to type things like metaprogramming, thanks to Ruby Interface files (RBI). This is how, at the start of 2019, Shopify began its journey toward static type checking for Ruby.</p>

<p>With only a three-person team and a lot on our plate, fully typing our monolith with Sorbet was going to be an approach based on Shopify’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/456735890" target="_blank" title="Shopify - How we Get Shit Done" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Get Shit Done (GSD) framework</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>We tested the viability of Sorbet on our core monolith by only typing a few files, to check if we could observe benefits from it while not impairing other developers’ work. Sorbets’ gradual approach proved to be working.</li>
<li>We manually created RBI files to represent what Sorbet could not understand yet. We checked we supported Ruby’s most advanced features as well as Rails constructs.</li>
<li>We added more and more files while keeping an eye on performance ensuring Sorbet would scale with our monolith.</li>
</ol>
<p>This gave us confidence Sorbet was the right choice to solve our problem. Once we officially decided to go with Sorbet we reflected on how we can reach 100% adoption in the monolith. To determine our roadmap we looked at:</p>
<ul>
<li>how many files needed to be typed</li>
<li>the content of the files</li>
<li>the Ruby features they used.</li>
</ul>

<p>Type checking in Sorbet comes in different levels of strictness. The strictness is defined on a per file basis by adding a magic comment in the file, called a <em>sigil</em>, written <code># typed: LEVEL</code>, where <code>LEVEL</code> can be one of the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>ignore</strong>: At this level, the file is not even read by Sorbet, and no errors are reported for this file at all.</li>
<li>
<strong>false</strong>: Only errors related to syntax, constant resolution and correctness of sigs are reported. At this level sorbet doesn’t check the calls in the files even if the methods called don't exist anywhere in the codebase.</li>
<li>
<strong>true</strong>: This is the level where Sorbet actually starts to type check your code. All methods called need to exist in the code base. For each call, Sorbet will check that the arguments count matches the method definition. If the method has a signature, Sorbet will also check their types.</li>
<li>
<strong>strict</strong>: At this level all methods must have a signature, and all constants and instance variables must have explicitly annotated types.</li>
<li>
<strong>strong</strong>: Sorbet no longer allows untyped variables. In practice, this level is actually unusable for most files because Sorbet can’t type everything yet and even Stripe advises against using it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we were able to run Sorbet on our codebase, we needed a way to track our progress and identify which parts of our monolith were typed with which strictness or which parts needed more work. To do so we created SorbetMetrics, a tool able to collect and display metrics about typing coverage for all our internal projects. We started tracking three key metrics to measure Sorbet adoption :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sigils</strong>: how many files are typed <code>ignore</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>true</code>, <code>strict</code> or <code>strong</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Calls</strong>: how many calls are sent to a method with a signature</li>
<li>
<strong>Signatures</strong>: how many methods have a signature</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Bar graph showing increased Sorbet usage in projects over time. Below the bar graph is a table showing the percentage of sigils, calls, signatures in each project." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/sorbet-dashboard_ef9747c0-3326-4b45-bbe9-59a1680718f2.jpg?v=1605798789" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/sorbet-dashboard_ef9747c0-3326-4b45-bbe9-59a1680718f2.jpg?v=1605798789"><br><em>SorbetMetrics dashboard homepage</em></p>
<p>Each day SorbetMetrics pulls the latest version of our monolith and other Shopify projects using Sorbet, computes those metrics and displays them in a dashboard internally available to all our developers.</p>

<p>If we treat typing as a product, we also need to focus on supporting and enabling our “customers” who are developers at Shopify. One of our goals was to have a strong support system in place to help with any problems that arise and slow developers down.</p>
<p>Initially, we supported developers with a dedicated Slack channel where Shopifolk could ask questions to the team. We’d answer these questions real-time and help Shopifolk with typing efforts where our input was important.</p>
<p>This white glove support model obviously didn't scale, but it was an excellent learning opportunity for our team—we now understood the biggest challenges and recurring problems. We ended up solving some problems over and over again, but it solidified the effort to understand the patterns and decide which features to work on next.</p>
<p>Using Slack meant our answers weren't discoverable forever. We moved most of the support and conversation to our internal Discourse platform, increasing discoverability and broader sharing of knowledge. This also allows us to record solutions in a single place and let developers self-serve as much as possible. As we onboard more and more projects with Sorbet, this solution scales better.</p>

<p>Going further from unblocking our users, we also need to ensure their happiness. Sorbet and more generally static typing in Ruby wouldn’t be a good fit for us if it made our developers miserable. We’re aware that it introduces a bit more work, so the benefits need to balance with the inconvenience.</p>
<p>Our first tool to measure developers’ opinions of Sorbet is surveys. Twice a year, we send a “Typing @ Shopify” survey to all developers and collect their sentiments regarding Sorbet’s benefits and limitations, as well as what we should focus on in the future.</p>
<p><img alt="A bar graph showing the increasing strongly agree answer over time to the question I want Sorbet to be applied to other Shopify projects. Below that graph is a bar graph showing the increasing strongly agree answer over time to the question I want more code to be typed." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Sobert-at-Shopify-Survey-Results-1.jpg?v=1605764198" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Sobert-at-Shopify-Survey-Results-1.jpg?v=1605764198"><br><em>Some responses&nbsp;from our “Sorbet @ Shopify” surveys</em></p>
<p>We use simple questions (“yes” or “no”, or a “Strongly Disagree” (1) to “Strongly Agree” (5) scale) and then look at how the answers evolve over time. The&nbsp;survey results gave us&nbsp;interesting insights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorbet catches more errors on developer’s pull requests (PR) as adoption increased</li>
<li>Signatures help with code understanding and give developers confidence to ship</li>
<li>Added&nbsp;confidence&nbsp;directly impacted&nbsp;the increasing positive opinion about static typing in Ruby</li>
<li>Over time developers&nbsp;wanted more code and more projects to be typed</li>
<li>Developers get used to Sorbet syntax over time</li>
<li>IDE integration with Sorbet is a feature developers are rooting for</li>
</ul>
<p>Our main observation is that developers enjoy Sorbet more as the typing coverage increases. This is one reason that's increasing our motivation to reach 100% of files at <code>typed: true</code> and maximize the amount of methods with a signature.</p>
<p>The second tool is interviews with individual developers. We select a team working with Sorbet and meet each member to talk about their experience using Sorbet either in the monolith or on another project. We get a better understanding of what their likes and dislikes are, what we should be improving, but also how we can better support them when introducing Sorbet, so the team keeps Sorbet in their project.</p>

<p>Currently, Sorbet is only enforced on our main monolith and we have about 60 other internal projects that opted to use Sorbet as well. On our main monolith, we require all files to be at least <code>typed: false</code> and Sorbet is run on our continuous integration platform (CI) for every PR and fails builds if type checking errors are found. We’re currently evaluating the idea of enforcing valid type checking on CI even before running the automated tests.</p>
<p><img alt="Three pie charts showing percentage of sigils, calls, and signatures in the monolith used to measure Sorbet adoption" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Typing-Coverage-Shopify-Monolith.jpg?v=1605764949" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Typing-Coverage-Shopify-Monolith.jpg?v=1605764949"><br><em>Typing coverage metrics for Shopify’s monolith</em></p>
<p>As of today, 80% of our files (including tests) are <code>typed: true</code> or higher. Almost half of our calls are typed and half of our methods have signatures. All of this can be type checked under 15 seconds on our developers machines.</p>

November 20, 2020 | https://codecs.multimedia.cx/2020/11/an-upcoming-image-format-war/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://codecs.multimedia.cx/2020/11/an-upcoming-image-format-war/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>So this week <code>libwebp2</code> appeared in a public repository. From a quick glance it looks like lossy format is based on AV1 coding blocks and lossless format is largely the same as the original WebP lossless but both now use ANS coding. And (of course) there’s a hint on experimental lossy encoding using neural networks.</p>
<p>Let’s pretend that JPEG has finally died (again) and GIF and PNG are both gone. So what modern image formats intended for general audience are out there?</p>
<p>Of course there’s Nokia HEIF which is picture(s) split into tiles, coded with H.EVC and stored in MP4. Because of the wonderful patent situation around it probably it won’t be used outside iEcosystem.</p>
<p>AVIF—same container, different codec (AV1 in this case).</p>
<p>WebP/WebP2—Baidu image format with lossy compression based on Baidu VPx codec (VP8 or VP10) and lossless compression from the French division of Baidu.</p>
<p>JPEG XL—a joint project between Cloudinary and Swiss division of Baidu responsible for Baidu Chrömli (in case you did not know that’s a Swiss word for various small sweets bits like Guetsli, Brunsli and such; Brötli/Gipfeli/Zöpfli/Grittibänzli are related to bread though, especially Brötli). Anyway, that’s a different format with different set of features that include lossless JPEG recompression (and hopefully the best practical lossless image compression as one would expect from creators of FLIF).</p>
<p>So my point is if you’d have to choose between all those formats essentially you have to pick some format from Baidu (either directly from it or using its codec). Somehow this future does not excite me much so I’d rather stick to old formats for which a single programmer can write a standalone decoder in reasonable time.</p>
<p>Also for some reason this reminds me of Soviet space program where there were three main construction centres (led by Korolyov, Chelomey and Yangel) producing different missiles and spaceships many of those are still in use. But the competition was also hurtful for the general progress. As you remember there were three heavy spaceships proposed by neither of them was really successful: Korolyov’s N1 had failures because of the engines, Yangel’s R-56 was cancelled early in favour of N1, Chelomey’s UR-700 has never been realized either, Glushko’s Energia had two launches (both successful) but it was too late and there was no payload for it beside equally successful Buran program. So on one hand you have variety and on the other hand you have a lot of wasted resources and efforts.</p>
<p>I see parallels here and with AV1 as well. Why the company controlling <code>libaom</code> would develop <code>libgav1</code> too?</p>
<p>And while speaking about AV1 I should mention that it reminds me of another kind of project, namely Olympic games.</p>
<p>Originally the Olympics were competition between various people from various city-states for both religious and entertainment reasons. Later they were resurrected as a mean to promote sports and unity, but just a couple decades later the games became more of a political instrument promoting national teams instead of being just a competition of individuals from various places (partly because all the training becomes too costly for a non-professional sportsman, partly because countries want the prestige). And a bit later it became a business project that 2004 Summer games in Athens demonstrated the best.</p>
<p>So you have a committee that holds the rights to the symbols, logos, mascots and everything else. The receiving party has to build large infrastructure to host various competitions and hope that the guests will bring enough money to compensate at least some of those costs (and maybe those buildings would be useful later but quite often they are not). Various companies pay a lot of money to become sponsors in hope that such status will work as effective advertisement, broadcasting companies pay a lot of money for broadcasting rights in hope of getting more viewers (and money from ads). So before the games a lot of parties pay a lot of money and afterwards they might make profit or not. And the host country is left with huge expenses for constructing stadiums and such—and those rather useless constructions that are too big for regular events or training. And of course the prestige. Where money go to and which Olympics were profitable to the host country is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>
<p>In a similar way AV1 feels like such project: it drew resources from different companies and people from different opensource multimedia projects to build something huge that is not really useful (I know that in theory it should trade bandwidth for CPU heat but how many customers will be AV1 ready before AV2 is released and the cycle repeats?) and people involved in <code>libaom</code>, <code>svt-av1</code>, <code>dav1d</code> and <code>rav1e</code> would better be doing something else including better multimedia frameworks (I work on <code>NihAV</code> mostly because the alternatives are even worse) or new codecs or even on a decent video editor so people making videos for BaidUTube won’t have to rely on expensive proprietary solutions that tend to crash anyway or suspicious Chinese or Russian programs that rip off opensource libraries (I’ve seen one using <code>mencoder</code> compiled as a <code>.dll</code>).</p>
<p>Anyway, like the Olympics were intended to promote sport and healthy living but became business projects that are financial loss to the most parties, AV1 looks like a project that also while being positioned as the saviour of opensource multimedia essentially benefits just a small group of organisations. And as with many other things I say I’d be happy to be proven wrong.</p>
<p>P.S. In case you say that I’m inconsistent and dislike both competing groups inside one company and uniting efforts (for the sake of the same company). Well, I’d prefer different entities (companies or opensource projects or whatever) to produce single solution each while there’s more than just one entity doing it. To return to space analogies, I’d rather see many private companies developing an own line of spaceships each (for various purposes too) instead of ULA producing several kinds of radically different spaceships without any outside competition.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><img src="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/robot-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150">There is a popular image out there, among the general public, that small startups — particularly small software startups — are a hotbed of technical innovation, constantly creating new technology. But is it true?</p>

<p>Of course, to a certain extent it is true. But in my experience <em>startups are disproportionately innovating when it comes to business models</em>, and <em>creating new ways to hold onto their customers</em>. High-level technical innovation is mostly happening at large companies.</p>
<p>Looking back at the last 10 years, it’s surprising how much of <a href="https://www.philipotoole.com/resume/">my career</a> has been based on technologies that were actually developed at very large firms.</p>
<h2>The reality</h2>
<p>My first example is <a href="https://www.loggly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loggly</a>. At Loggly we were one of the first (if not the first) teams to put <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Kafka</a> in front of <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elasticsearch</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpNbjXFPyZ0&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build a product out of it</a>. But Apache Kafka was developed at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>, after it had become a large firm.</p>
<p>Next is <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InfluxDB</a>. <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/blog/influxdb-1-0-ga-released-a-retrospective-and-whats-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">During my time there</a> we created the TSM storage engine, but <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/concepts/storage_engine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">key parts of that engine were based on the Gorilla storage engine</a>, which came out of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch is interesting example. It was a small company, and it created a Search product of global importance. But it, in turn was built on <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Lucene</a>, which was developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Cutting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doug Cutting</a> after his experience at <a href="https://www.parc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xerox PARC</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple</a>.</p>
<p>So the image of small software startups making groundbreaking technical advancements is not quite as common as we think.</p>
<p>At Loggly we had the <em>freemium</em> model — the idea that you give part of your software away for free, and hope people will upgrade to the premium versions. We were constantly tweaking that business model — <em>that was innovation right there</em>, but we never thought of it as such.</p>
<h2>The lesson?</h2>
<p>When it comes to evaluating an company, and its potential success, there may be a lesson here. Perhaps the company that has built brand new software from end-to-end is not going to be as successful as that company that has taken existing software, <em>and combined it with innovative business models</em>.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about corporate knowledge management systems recently.</p>



<p>If we think about a company as an organism, then a knowledge management system is essentially the (collective) brain that keeps that organism alive and running. A corporate knowledge management system should contain every single bit of codifiable information within the company resulting in a library of all projects, processes and procedures.</p>



<p>In an ideal state, it is the single source of truth that helps to inform every individual in the firm about what everyone else is up to. Information should be easy to add (input) as well as easy to search and find (output) resulting in quick knowledge transfer between different employees.</p>



<p>In reality, however, this hardly ever is the case. As anyone who has ever worked at a larger company can attest to, company knowledge bases always end up being a huge mess. </p>



<p>What starts with a neatly organized Confluence wiki, over time morphs into a multi-headed monster consisting of millions of notes and documents that live across Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, Asana and half a dozen different wiki tools. Most docs will be outdated, some will contradict others and the one you are really looking for only shows up on page 14 of your search results.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/monster-4.png"></p><p>It seems like things usually start to fall apart once a company surpasses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar number</a> of 150 employees. This is probably when people start to realize that all the different documents of <em>explicit knowledge</em> they were amassing over the years have been held together with <em>implicit knowledge</em>. </p>



<p>It’s easy to find – and understand – the right documents when you know every other person in the company, but once you’re past that point, you need a system to organize all the data so that people can make sense of it.</p>



<p>The idea behind tools like Notion is to solve this problem by using just one tool for all your different knowledge documents. Instead of Google Docs AND Asana AND Trello AND Airtable, you just do everything in Notion. This reduces complexity because you don’t have to switch and search across different apps. At the same time, Notion forces you to think about a system that makes information easy to find with its folder-like structure and links between different databases.</p>



<p>I’ve never used Notion with more than half a dozen people myself, but from what I’ve heard from people at larger companies, Notion knowledge bases also don’t scale very well beyond a certain number of users. Once too many people start contributing to it, things become bloated and unnavigable.</p>



<p>A friend at Stripe recently suggested – half-jokingly – that we should hire a librarian to organize all our internal data and documentation. The more I think about it, the more I like the idea. Perhaps every company should hire a Chief Notion Officer once it hits 100 employees?!</p>



<p>An alternative approach to Notion is a knowledge management system that can live across different tools and without active manual curation because it’s based on really powerful search. The folder structure of your Google Drive, for example, doesn’t <em>really</em> matter because looking up documents via search is faster and more convenient. Meta search tools like <a href="https://usefyi.com/">FYI</a> are supposed to offer the same but across different productivity tools.</p>



<p>But again I’m skeptical that this really works beyond a certain amount of users (and thus documents). I remember even Google’s internal search engine doing only a mediocre job of surfacing the most relevant documents (and even if it did you weren’t sure if there wasn’t a better or more up-to-date version of it).</p>



<p>I’m sure we’ll get there eventually, but until then we probably need a mix of automated search and manual human help – which is where Slack comes in. I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1097940802737704960">always thought</a> Slack plus Notion plus <a href="https://www.atspoke.com/">Spoke</a> would make a really powerful product (and I’m surprised Slack hasn’t made any major acquisitions in this space).</p>



<p>If you think about it, Slack is basically a search engine powered by humans: Most Slack messages are just questions. <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">It’s 911 for when everything else fails</a>. So if Slack had access to your entire knowledge base, it could answer at least the most commonly asked questions automatically. The rest would still get answered manually by the channel participants. Or your Chief Notion Officer.</p>

<p>This is probably the most vicious attack on a Tesla we have ever witnessed. A man from London, Ontario, Canada saw a lonely <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Tesla Model 3</a> in a parking lot at night and no one is sure what motivated him to hit the car with a concrete brick. </p>



<p>Unaware of the technology in Teslas, this goon never knew the car’s <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/sentry-mode/">Sentry Mode</a> cameras were recording him during the entire course of his vandalism.</p>



<p>This incident took place on the 29th of October, 2020 at 5:57 AM according to the car’s owner. The damages have been estimated at $10,000 till now.</p>



<p>Here’s the short video clip from the right repeater camera which captured the actual action taking place.</p>

<p>Grabbing frames from the above footage, the Tesla owner posted the following two photos that show the stills of the vandal’s face from two different angles.</p>

<p>Tesla community members have come to help in identifying the person in the video by using AI face extrapolation and photo editing skills to get a clearer idea of the face of the vandal in this case.</p>

<p>Apparently, the cinder block was thrown at the car’s side window and doesn’t look like significant damage to the vehicle but the owner said that the block had also hit the B-pillar and above that damaged the body of the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Tesla Model 3</a>.</p>



<p>According to the owner of the damaged car, the side window glass is only $200 CAD but the real damage was done to the body of the car. The culprit also ferociously searched inside the car as well and damaged different parts in the process, making the total damage close to $10,000 CAD.</p>



<p>However, with this much visual proof, the insurance company should not have any problem knowing that the owner was not at fault.</p>

<p>In a Tesla vandalism <a href="https://www.xautoworld.com/news/police-after-tesla-vandals/">case from Sacramento, California last year</a>, two Tesla vandals turned themselves to the police after the Sentry Mode video went viral and it even aired on national television. Similarly, this guy from London, ON will not be able to hide for long, help spread the word, and videos.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for further updates on this case, we will post part 2 of this when the culprit gets caught. </p>

    <p>Some decisions we make lie in a spectrum, whether it’s how dirty a joke should be or how much can we mix the batter before we ruin the cake. In many of those decisions, the options have order to them. A joke can be more or less dirty. We can over or under mix batter.</p>
<p>A professional at the subject matter could pick the perfect spot in that spectrum. They know the cause-effect relation very well and have the high analytical know-how to determine what is approrpriate and when. However, there is a method for non-professionals to arrive at very good results with very little practice.</p>
<p>“Go to the extreme, then half way”.</p>
<p>If you want to know how tolerant your in-laws are of dirty jokes, just tell the dirtiest one you have. If they are grossed out, the next one you should tell is the middle between it and the mildest one you know. You continue “splitting the difference” until you find what they’re comfortable with. You’ll be astonished how quickly you’ll arrive at an answer.</p>
<p>The dirty joke example is simplistic, but most often than not you would find yourself pondering questions you either can’t ask or no one has the answer to.</p>
<p>Expect awkward moments and thrown cakes. The payment for quick, correct, decisions with practically zero professional training is the unpleasentness of the search. Nonetheless, Instinctive Binary Search is very useful for subject matters you are not very good at. Not only will you answer the question you have, but you will improve your familiarity with the subject at large. At some point, you will see commonalities in all the good decisions you make.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, just make sure you are the principal bearer of the pain of the search. It’s no problem to tell a slightly inappropriate joke to old people, but if, knowing them (or the joke), there’s a high risk of them being deeply disturbed, tell the joke to someone else.</p>
<p>Some people may hate you because of a slip up, or going too far. Mistakes happen, but make sure you are aligned with other people. The purpose of IBS isn’t for the world to be your test dummy, but to get the details the world wants you to know but sometimes forgets to tell you.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    

<p>I was trying to find a good use case for my <a href="https://www.banggood.com/LILYGO-TTGO-T-Watch-2020-ESP32-Main-Chip-1_54-Inch-Touch-Display-Programmable-Wearable-Environmental-Interaction-Watch-p-1671427.html">LILIGO TTGO T-Watch</a>. It’s a programmable smart watch featuring the amazing ESP32 chip and a 240x240 color LCD screen.</p>

<p>I keep hearing about Doom running on this and that, sometimes directly and sometimes using the device as an exotic external screen. My project falls into the latter category, but it was a lot of fun to implement!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As this was mostly a learning experience, I took several wrong turns and mention them in this writeup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As with most of tiny projects, I got the basics version up and running on a two afternoons and then fiddled with the code for a few more days to get a more presentable result.</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-watch-500.jpg" alt="alt"></p>

<p><em>It works!</em></p>

<h2 id="building-steps">Building steps</h2>

<h3 id="getting-the-video-signal-across">Getting the video signal across</h3>

<p>There are a couple of ways to transmit data from a computer to the ESP32-based watch. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and a serial port.</p>

<p>Serial port seemed promising - I initially targeted 120x120 picture, which can be represented by 14400 bits or 1800 bytes. Targeting 115200 bauds I could achieve around 7 fps (115200 / 16200 bauds per frame).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The default serial configuration is 8 data bits, no parity and one stop bit, hence 9 bauds per byte.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the goal was of displaying DOOM on the smart watch in mind, I thought. I decided to divide this into three phases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scale the image down to the resolution of the watch</li>
  <li>Implement a proof of concept serial display on the T-Watch</li>
  <li>Optimize until it works better</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="scaling-doom">Scaling Doom</h2>

<p>I started with finding a suitable Doom source port. I discovered  <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/">Chocolate Doom</a>, which accurately reproduces the game as it was played in the 1990s.</p>

<p>Building it on Ubuntu is straightforward, so I dived straight into the code and started poking around.</p>

<h3 id="wrong-turn-1---modifying-doom-internal-resolution">Wrong turn #1 - modifying Doom internal resolution</h3>

<p>The first thing I did was try to find how a resolution gets set.</p>

<p>At first I tried to change the internal resolution of the renderer - there was a <code>#define</code>
for <code>SCREEN_WIDTH 320</code> and <code>SCREEN_HEIGHT 200</code> in <code>i_video.h</code>.</p>

<p>Changing this to 120x75 made the game crash. I attached a debugger to see where exactly and the game was attempting to render some things at locations beyond 120x75. Scaling all coordinates by 0.5x helped get the menu to display, but it crashed again as soon as I started the game.</p>

<h3 id="scaling-and-dithering">Scaling and dithering</h3>

<p>After studying the Chocolate Doom source port some more I realized it has a series of buffers and textures that represent stages of the <a href="https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom/blob/master/src/i_video.c#L780">rendering pipeline</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The engine itself draws assets with a <a href="https://zdoom.org/wiki/Palette">palette</a> to make a better use of 255 colors.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>the game is drawn into an 8-bit paletted 320x200 paletted screen buffer.</li>
  <li>blit into a 32-bit ARGB 320x200 buffer</li>
  <li>rendered into an upscaled texture using a nearest linear scaling (e.g. 640x400)</li>
  <li>rendered to the screen (e.g. 800x600) using linear scaling</li>
</ul>

<p>It was clear the dithering and output to the serial port should happen somewhere within this pipeline.</p>

<h3 id="wrong-turn-2">Wrong turn #2</h3>

<p>I realized looking at the screenshots from various buffers that I’ve been dithering the wrong display buffer (the 320x200 display buffer), then downscaled in SDL to 240x150, which caused artifacts and didn’t look as good.</p>

<p>The correct way was to scale the display buffer to 240x150, then dither, then send this over the wire.</p>

<h2 id="dithering">Dithering</h2>

<p>After a little research on 1-bit graphics I realized there are two commonly used dithering algorithms - I implemented both:</p>

<h3 id="ordered-dithering">Ordered dithering</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering">Ordered dithering</a> is a simple algorithm that produces a characteristic crosshatch pattern.</p>

<p>It works by applying a threshold map to the pixels displayed, causing pixels from the map to change color based on the distance from the original color to black and white.</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-ordered-4x4-matrix.png" alt="ordered dithering"></p>

<p><em>Ordered dithering patterns</em></p>

<h3 id="floyd-steinberg-dithering">Floyd-Steinberg dithering</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering">Floyd-Steinberg dithering</a> operates using error diffusion and is characterized by its grainy or speckled appearance.</p>

<p>Because Floyd-Steinberg works by pushing the quantization error from a pixel to its neighboring pixels, a slight change in the scene can propagate over the entire screen. I found that aesthetically less pleasing than the more predictable ordered dithering, as it was simply less jumpy.</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-dither-240x150.png" alt="doom dithered"></p>

<p><em>Floyd-Steinberg dithering above, ordered dithering below</em></p>

<h3 id="grayscale-and-gamma">Grayscale and gamma</h3>

<p>In both dithering algorithms we convert the color to grayscale with the following algorithm:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//get r,g,b color values</span>
<span>uint8_t</span> <span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>g</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint32_t</span> <span>pix</span> <span>=</span> <span>getpixel</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>);</span>
<span>SDL_GetRGB</span><span>(</span><span>pix</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>format</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>g</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>b</span><span>);</span>
      
<span>// Convert the pixel value to grayscale / intensity</span>
<span>grayscale</span> <span>=</span> <span>.</span><span>299</span><span>f</span> <span>*</span> <span>r</span> <span>+</span> <span>.</span><span>587</span><span>f</span> <span>*</span> <span>g</span> <span>+</span> <span>.</span><span>114</span><span>f</span> <span>*</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Doom is quite dark, so it’s hard to see anything in the default <em>gamma</em> setting. Fortunately the engine also features gamma correction, that can be toggled with the <code>F11</code> key in game.</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-gamma.png" alt="gamma"></p>

<p><em>Gamma settings 1, 3, 5 going from unusable in monochrome to pretty bright</em></p>

<h2 id="watch-as-an-external-display">Watch as an external display</h2>

<p>To make data transfer a bit less intensive I decided to transmit in 120x120 resolution and then double the pixels to 240x240 on the device.</p>

<p>Initially I programmed my watch to be a simple single-core serial display.
It reads one row of pixels from the serial port as 120 bits that represent black or white pixels, then expands each bit onto a 16-bit array value.</p>

<h4 id="transfer-rate">Transfer rate</h4>
<p>When transmitting 120x120 pixels at around 16 FPS we produce around 15 * 9 (data + stop bit) * 120 (rows) * 16 (fps) = 259 kbits of data per second.</p>

<p>The algorihm for</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>char</span> <span>rxBuffer</span><span>[</span><span>RECEIVE_LINE_BYTES</span><span>];</span>
<span>uint32_t</span> <span>lineBuffer</span><span>[</span><span>DISPLAY_LINE_LENGTH</span><span>];</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>Serial</span><span>.</span><span>readBytes</span><span>(</span><span>rxBuffer</span><span>,</span> <span>RECEIVE_LINE_BYTES</span><span>);</span>
<span>tft</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>setAddrWindow</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>DISPLAY_LINE_LENGTH</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>);</span>
<span>convertPixelsBetweenBuffers</span><span>();</span>
<span>tft</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>startWrite</span><span>();</span>
<span>tft</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>pushPixels</span><span>(</span><span>lineBuffer</span><span>,</span> <span>DISPLAY_LINE_LENGTH</span><span>);</span>
<span>tft</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>pushPixels</span><span>(</span><span>lineBuffer</span><span>,</span> <span>DISPLAY_LINE_LENGTH</span><span>);</span>
<span>tft</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>endWrite</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The pixel conversion does the horizontal pixel doubling and prepares it to the  converts input (a 120 bits field) to the display line (240 16-bit pixels, stored in a 120 32-bit array). It iterates bit by bit .
We can display data on the TTGO T-Watch using the <a href="https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI">TFT_eSPI library</a>. It includes a <code>pushPixels</code> function that expects a buffer of 16-bit pixel colors.</p>

<p>I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/jborza/watch-doom-receiver/blob/master/util/sender.py">supporting tool</a> to feed the watch some pixels in Python. The bits are sent using the <code>pyserial</code> library in a loop.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-the-watch-and-doom">Connecting the Watch and Doom</h2>

<p>Python is not very helpful in the Chocolate Doom port, so I had to write the serial frame transmitter in C. 
I’ve adapted the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/38318768/72746">first code snippet I found</a> I found on Stack Overflow, credit goes to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1599004/sawdust">sawdust</a>.</p>

<p>Still working in the 120x120 pixel resolution, this is how the intermediate result looked:</p>

<p><img src="http://jborza.com/assets/doom-120x120-watch.jpg" alt="first attempt"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s incredibly low-res. Also, because I was lazy, the last row of pixels of the status bar is leaking all the way down the screen as I just repeated rows 75 up to 120 in the output stream :-)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I eventually bumped the resolution to 240x150.</p>

<p>There’s nothing special about the serial output module, there’s a function that takes an <code>SDL_Surface</code> assuming its dimensions being 240x150, loops over the RGB values and for every row of 240 pixels (bits) spits out 30 bytes.</p>

<h2 id="getting-it-faster">Getting it faster</h2>

<p>Straightforward increase of the baudrate to 500,000 caused some screen tearing, it seemed that the <em>serial receiver</em> code on the watch was having hard time keeping up. After optimizing the bit conversion loop it could handle stable 500,000 bauds, leading to high enough framerate to consider increasing the resolution to 240x240.</p>

<h3 id="wrong-turn-3---going-multi-core-on-the-esp32">Wrong turn #3 - going multi-core on the ESP32</h3>

<p>I thought I could leverage the second core on the ESP32 and have the watch run two tasks - one that processes the serial data and another that decodes it and sends to the display.</p>

<p>I implemented a proof of concept serial display that uses the <a href="https://www.freertos.org/RTOS-task-notifications.html">FreeRTOS Task notification API</a> to communicate between the task using notifications.</p>

<p>It used two buffers - one to receive the serial data which got copied to the display task and the notifications were supposed to let the tasks know that they can touch the shared buffer.</p>

<p>The source lives in the <a href="https://github.com/jborza/watch-doom-receiver/blob/multithreaded/watch-doom-receiver.ino"><code>multithreaded</code> branch</a> - but it didn’t really work faster, which lead me to the next attempt:</p>

<h3 id="using-dma-for-the-speed">Using DMA for the speed</h3>

<p>What helped in the end was using Direct Memory Access (DMA) transfer using `  tft-&gt;pushPixelsDMA(lineBuffer, DISPLAY_LINE_LENGTH);`. It’s basically “fire and forget” data transfer - the controller will move the data from the RAM to the display and practically allow the microcontroller to execute other code as opposed to operating the SPI bus.</p>

<p>Now I could increase the baudrate to 921600 and practically double the framerate.</p>

<h4 id="vertical-synchronization">Vertical Synchronization?</h4>

<p>If we just dump the data to the screen without some kind of synchronization or alignment, the device wouldn’t know where the boundary between the frame data lies.</p>

<p>It also means we would need to be lucky to start the transmission in sync with the watch displaying the first row of the frame data.</p>

<p>To fix this, I added a simple VSYNC message that the watch sends to the PC over the serial port when it starts drawing the first row. Upon receiving VSYNC, the PC should start abandon the current frame and start sending another frame from the beginning. I’ve added a handler for this to the python support tools, but decided not to for Doom as it was easier to just reset the line currently being drawn if no data has come for a while across the serial port.</p>

<p>Content marketing can be overwhelming for a business until the budget is there for bigger longterm communications programs. If you’re a startup owner or solo marketing manager, you’re already doing a lot with a little. But if you’re building a company, the time is already here to get started on content marketing, because content marketing is a long game that takes time and is an integral part of brand building. Many startups give up too soon, but you can handle content marketing, whether you do it yourself or hire it out. It doesn’t have to be fancy, but it does have to be focused in a few particular ways to succeed over time. You can start your own content marketing if you stay focused and don’t let initial slow traction get you down.</p>



<p>Cronicle Consulting presents a short Content Series: 5 Ways To Start Content Marketing For Your Tech Startup. This series will be split into 5 sections so stay tuned for the next articles. First up, starting a company blog. It’s the simplest way to start content marketing from day 1, and it will bring in results if you do it right. But most people don’t know how to focus their blog for optimum results, so it feels like a waste of time. That’s why we’re here to help you avoid common content marketing errors before you begin. Note: SEO is its own important topic and won’t be covered in the scope of this article.</p>



<h2>Content Marketing Plan #1: Company Blog</h2>



<p>Content marketing in a company blog not just about the content showing professional expertise or announcing company news. People want to know:</p>



<ol><li>what you’re like to work with.</li><li>how you view the world within your professional sphere.</li><li>how you communicate.</li></ol>



<p>Your blog is where prospective clients go to see how you interact with the world. When you start your company blog, begin by announcing the launch of the company. Then, tell your team story. Here are a few ideas to get started.</p>



<h3>Content Marketing Ideas For A Blog</h3>



<ol><li>tell your team story.</li><li>talk about the problem your product or service is solving in the world or what cause you are supporting.</li><li>announce new hires.</li><li>post job listings.</li><li>tell the story of company volunteering.</li><li>publish white papers and awards.</li><li>announce events and promotions.</li><li>publish your own industry research reports or host your own awards.</li><li>turn engineering expertise into mini e-books or published papers.</li><li>host round tables interviewing industry experts.</li><li>cover industry news.</li></ol>



<p>If you need to hire your company blog out to a communications firm, check out their other client blogs and see if they are matching the tone and content to the industry and if they know their technical stuff in depth. If all the blogs for various clients in different industries sound the same or too high level, move on to a different firm. Tech startups in particular have this problem. Addressing it early can help you avoid wasting your efforts. </p>

These days they are competitions, media exposure, and an opportunity to create print content and a community that grows over time. </figcaption></figure>



<h2>Tone, Focus &amp; Style in a Company Blog</h2>



<p>The tone of your company blog is critical: the vocabulary has to be right for the professional space being addressed, the focus of the content interesting to people in your field or your client space, and the communication style appropriate to your industry. Is the communication style in your space more formal or jocular? Is it interested in the broader social good, or does your circle tend to focus on technical details of research and problem solving industry issues? Once you get the hang of focus through trial and error and having someone with industry-specific content expertise create your blog, a company blog is one of the best ways to keep your website popping up in organic search results on topics potential clients are searching for, and you’ve pre-sold a lot of people on working with your team. </p>



<h3>Appropriate Blog Tone Varies By Industry</h3>



<p>We cannot emphasize enough getting the tone right. The problem with content marketing is that it falls to the marketing folks most of the time instead of an in-house journalist, which only larger companies have budget for. If you are a marketing manager versed in content that’s great. If you’re not sure if you’re doing this correctly, one way to check is to make sure you don’t use quite the same tone for sales copy as you do for the company blog. Think about the tone of how people within the organization communicate with each other and with clients, and use that as a guide instead. Why? Because it all begins to sound like a sales pitch otherwise, and that is not at all what content is for. Client storytelling works best when it’s done in the tone that makes people sound the most professional, or the friendliest, or the best suited to solve a client’s problems. Sales copy often accomplishes this only in direct pitches. </p>



<h3>You Are Not The Hero Of The Story, You Are The Bard</h3>



<p>Content is your chance to provide good will to the world, information for free that benefits them. The best way to do this is to talk about causes your company believes in, promote the good work of colleagues, and position yourself as the cheerleader to someone else as the hero of the story. If it starts to sound like “we have the best culture, look how amazing our culture is at this workplace here, check us out, guys” it’s going to turn a lot of people off subconsciously to listening to what you actually have to offer. What you actually have to offer is a whole lot of wisdom and thought leadership that the world probably needs. The aim here is to tell the story you want to tell, but think of yourself as the support role or the cheerleader, not the hero. Just that simple shift will make your story sound so much more beneficial to the reader, and will cut out the feeling of awkwardness that can come from self-promotion.</p>



<figure><img src="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ep11585detroitreport2019-tw1024.jpg" alt="EntryPoint Detroit Research Report 2019" srcset="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ep11585detroitreport2019-tw1024.jpg 760w, https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ep11585detroitreport2019-tw1024-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px"><figcaption>Research reports also require funding, like this one from EntryPoint’s Detroit Entrepreneurial Ecosystem report. Creating, publishing, or sponsoring a report like this can be very useful content. </figcaption></figure>



<h3>Company Blog Style Is Tailored To The Blog’s Purpose</h3>



<p>Keep company blog content styled in a way that fits your brand and how you want to present your organization to the world. This often swings several directions off track.</p>



<h4>Common Company Blog Errors:</h4>



<ol><li>Your company blog sounds too much like a sales pitch for culture.</li><li>Your company blog is all jargon and no specifics on your offerings.</li><li>Your company blog is all about your company.</li></ol>



<p>Number 1 depends on if you work in an industry that relies heavily on people’s buy-in to a particular culture. Some company blogs do get away with a particular tone that sounds almost cultish, but often this is a turnoff for prospective hires and clients. To avoid this common mistake in a world of business websites that are nothing but culture pitch, focus on the benefit to the client. What do they want to know about? What are they searching for? What helps them? It’s a great approach for creating content that people are more likely to be searching for anyway. </p>



<p>Number 2 is actually debatable. There are industries in which a jargon-heavy website is appropriate. “We deliver on deadline on spec with the most disruptive innovation imaginable.” Except what do you deliver? Well, sometimes industries communicate exclusively in industry jargon, and that’s properly communicating professional expertise and the right pitch. But it does wear thin on long-form content. If you work in an industry that’s super jargon heavy, try to keep the jargon to the static pages, and the blog should go more in depth into what you’re working on, as much as you can afford to share. Many industries such as automotive, advanced manufacturing, defense contracting, and the like are not able to publish the same kind of company blog because of NDAs and heavy restrictions on proprietary information. Biotech would be another good example. You want clients to know what you could offer them, but all details are often available in house after demos and personal contact with a client and most sales handled directly. In this case, if you still want to publish a company blog, keep it to the new hires, press releases, new services offered, and details of presentations from trade shows, which can be fun to read about. </p>



<p>Number 3 is tricky. Many company blogs don’t have time to move past basic company press releases, but if you can make the time, reporting on industry news can be one of the most powerful ways to establish your company as an industry leader in the space. The style of your blog needs to be determined by whom you are serving. Biotech companies often focus very much on direct sales to clients, but a security startup needs to establish themselves as a leader in the industry thought leadership space. Their blog should be focused on industry standards, industry problem solving, and innovative solutions and conversations that serve the broader space. </p>



<p>But everyone’s already doing this these days, right? Not quite. It takes a good marketing manager or journalist to spot the common flaw. Most company blogs talk about the company or their ability or authority to report on industry news far more than they produce actual content that is valuable to the reader. Journalism requires funding, and it doesn’t come for free even if the cost is giving your marketing team space to produce quality content in house. This is where companies think content marketing doesn’t work and tend to fall off over time to focus on other marketing. If your company promotes themselves as an industry thought leader but only talks about how central they are to the ecosystem and how many events they’re hosting or attending to prove their relevance, they can come across as insecure or bragging or …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-606e3fb9ac8364badb5c"><div><p>When we are kids, we have many aspirational dreams and ambitious goals. <strong>You want to eat the world. </strong>Then, when you’re an adult, <strong>the world eats you.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We grow up, and the same dreams become impossible or we stop pursuing them. But why? Was it because our dreams were straight-up stupid? Or because we settled and decided they were impossible?&nbsp;</p><p>I want to explore this question as a kid who <strong>still</strong> has lots of ambitious dreams and <strong>wants</strong> <strong>to eat the world.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Lately, I’ve experienced that my goals and dreams might be stupid or impossible. But why? If I think they are. They will be impossible because I won’t even try. I have to keep reminding myself that they are not and keep believing they are and can be possible.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ambition starts fragile</strong>, we need to feed it to keep going[1]. Steven Spielberg said, “Dreams always come from behind you, not right between your eyes. But when you have a dream, it doesn’t often come at you screaming in your face...Sometimes the dream almost whispers.” And you have to <strong>listen</strong> very <strong>carefully</strong>...</p><p>Ambition has more to do with <em>listening carefully </em>than it is with anything else. You need to be sensitive to <strong>what you want </strong>and <strong>why you want it.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Ambition can be grown and cared for like a garden. You start small and you constantly prune and iterate it.&nbsp;</p><p>Ask yourself what you love and what sacrifices you’re willing to make to pursue your goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people don’t just lose their ambition (some get even more ambitious as they get older) but most people don’t ask themselves these questions and life happens to them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I’ve realized that being ambitious isn’t about trying to become rich or famous, but more about knowing what you want and why you want it. Once you know that, you’ll be more likely to sacrifice and push through all the obligations and randomness of life, and finally accomplish your dreams.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>So, <strong>Why the fuck do we lose our ambition when we grow up?</strong></p><p>Losing our ambition is like losing our soul and excitement to be alive. We’re saying, “Nope, I refuse to fully live.” Being ambitious isn’t about becoming famous or billionaire. It’s about fully living.</p><p>Socrates said once, “The unexamined life is not worth living,” meaning living a life under the rule of others, never questioning what you want out of it is not <strong>worth</strong> <strong>living. </strong>&nbsp;And let me make sure you know this too, a life with no aim and with no purpose isn’t an alternative either.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re young or whatever age you are, and want to be ambitious. Be aware of the reasons people lose their ambition.&nbsp; What are those reasons? There are many reasons, but there’s one that expresses the essential reasons: <strong>Change of priorities.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>People get comfortable, which makes them lose sight of the big picture, and you add responsibilities and obligations. You get the average adult. This is often true, but not always. Sometimes, people change what they’re ambitious for. Kids want to be astronauts, teens want to change the world, and adults want to spend time with their families.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is one right? Neither. You choose. The issue occurs when your priorities change without you realizing it. You may WANT to change your priorities, just be aware of the WHY.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if you don’t change your priorities, there’s another reason that is probably the biggest contributor.</p><p>“Everyone wants to be a published author, nobody wants to write a book.” This isn’t about becoming a published author, but an example of a high-status goal that many people grow up aspiring to, that turns out to require you to work hard over a long time.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/" target="_blank">Patrick McKenzie </a>elaborates more on this idea and says, “One of my most disconcerting observations about the world is that the number of people who will, in their life, pursue a concrete goal with focus and determination for several months is *much much lower* than what I would have assumed it would be.”&nbsp;</p><p>Why are some people more determined than others? Or why do others never give despite failing repeatedly? A harsh truth many people refuse to accept.&nbsp;</p><h2>Destined to Fail, Arriving Successfully</h2><p>Look, youngsters my age (17) or older haven’t experienced true failure in their life. Why? Most of them because they haven’t really tried anything. To fail, you have to try. If you never try, you never fail.&nbsp;</p><p>Since early on, we take pre-planned paths such as standardized testing and getting A’s. As long as you do nothing dumb and do what teachers tell you, you will be fairly successful. Just be complacent and follow others. Simple, right?<br></p><p>Real-life is not like that.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you graduate college and you are finally dropped off at the so-called “real world” with no instructions. Most people struggle with how to be <strong>successful. </strong>You try things and you fail.&nbsp;</p><p>The first failures are rough because you aren’t used to them, so they are cruelly painful. Like when you told that one girl in fourth grade you liked her, but she rejected you. Well, maybe it’s not that painful.&nbsp;</p><p>You try things and you fail. Then one of two things takes place. You either try again and learn and improve or you avoid pain altogether.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, neither is right nor wrong. Each one comes with pros and cons.&nbsp;</p><p>The first option of trying things and failing is a lot tougher short-term but benefits people long term. Few people take this road because humans love <strong>comfort </strong>and avoid <strong>pain.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The second option of avoiding pain is far more common and causes people to stick with jobs and careers they don’t like because it’s “too hard” to change. This road is easier in the short-term but leads many people to become depressed and “giving up,” which is what I’m talking about when people grow up and “lose ambition.”</p><p>Enough of my ranting. How do you know what road to take?&nbsp;</p><h2>Choose a life that makes sense to YOU!</h2><p>Every young person wants to be unique. We want to dream and we want to inspire others. But that doesn’t always happen because lots of times it’s easier to follow what <strong>others say </strong>and do what<strong> others do.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Many people reason by analogy (because someone did it), and few reason by truths or <a href="https://www.techtello.com/first-principles-thinking/" target="_blank">first principles</a> (what do I think is true for sure?).&nbsp;</p><p>To think for yourself independently of others takes more mental output and yes it’s freaking hard, but only if you do, you can start <strong>fully living.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Being ambitious isn’t for everyone, but most people should dare to try it. Yes, it’s harder, tiring, and perhaps even meaningless. But I’m still ambitious.</p><p>Nothing that we’ll ever do will matter. Nothing. If you look at the world not in years or centuries, but in billions of years. Few things will matter. So why even bother?</p><p>At first, you may become nihilistic but if you look at it more carefully, you’ll realize that because nothing will matter, you might as well try to optimize every minute you live by helping others, being happier, loving more, and being more ambitious.&nbsp;</p><h2>I Refuse to Wait</h2><p><strong>Young Human:</strong> I want to eat the world.</p><p><strong>Old Human:</strong> Try to not get eaten first, kid.</p><p><strong>Young Human:</strong> (says nothing and thinks to himself, “Who was the weirdo who looks like he was eaten?”</p><p><strong>Old Human: </strong>You’ll understand…</p><p>___________</p><p>Perhaps I’m dumb for trying to be ambitious and even dumber for trying to help others to see if being ambitious makes sense for them. Like <a href="https://twitter.com/Lexstok/status/1309371088498053120?s=20" target="_blank">someone told me on Twitter</a>, “Bookmark this tweet, set a timer for 20 years, and you’ll be able to answer this yourself by then.”</p><p>But I refuse to wait twenty years. I would rather try to learn from the mistakes of other people and have an answer that makes sense for me. An answer that aligns with what I think, what I say, and what I do.&nbsp;</p><p>That answer is that being ambitious is worth it. It’s not about being rich or famous but understanding what you want and why you want it while treating ambition like a garden that can be grown and cared for.&nbsp;</p><p>If you can listen carefully and <em>garden </em>your ambition, you can start <strong>fully living</strong> the life you want and choose for yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, remember priorities might change. You thought you wanted to be an astronaut, but now all you want to do is play with your toddler and help him/her accomplish their dreams. Life is always beautiful, just make sure you’re the one planting the flowers in the <em>garden</em>.</p><p>If you decide you want to be ambitious, understand you may fail, and once you fail. That failure will take you back to the fourth grade but keep going, you may want to find friends who are ambitious, optimistic, and driven because they will be the one who will hold you accountable and help you when you fail.&nbsp;</p><p>And if you remember anything from this essay, remember that everything and anything you do won’t matter and will be meaningless. All the hard work, all the stress, and all the worries will be meaningless. But if that is true, you optimize for doing what makes you happy, for trying to help others, and perhaps being more <strong>ambitious</strong>.</p><p>Now, I’m starving. Let’s eat the world!</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Think of ambition as 'feeding' as a small but consistent habit. Every action is a vote for who you will become and what you will achieve. This is how you build ambition.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Thanks</strong> to my friends in my dorm who inspired me to write this essay after hours of deep conversations and discussions! Thanks guys!</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601195872853_6856"><p>If you’re into interesting ideas (like the one you just read), sign up for my<a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/newsletter"> </a><a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank">Weekly Memos</a>, and I’ll send you new essays right when they come out.

The common team structure I saw was senior engineers leading features, while trying to improve and grow the non senior members during the process.</p></span></p><h2 id="how-does-this-work"><span>link</span><span>How Does This Work</span></h2><p><span>The senior engineers are the ones responsible to make the feature delivered, they are the ones with all the context and they are the active leaders of those feature squads - communication with stakeholders, design etc.<br>
The team lead's job is to make sure the senior engineers are on track and help them if needed.<br>
The advantages are obvious: this way there is maximal certainty that the features will be delivered on time, the non senior members learn by watching the senior in action and by (hopefully) active mentoring.<br></span></p><h2 id="disadvantages-of-senior-first-delivery"><span>link</span><span>Disadvantages Of Senior First Delivery</span></h2><h3 id="team-stagnation"><span>link</span><span>Team Stagnation</span></h3><p><span>Working in this structure preserves the current hierarchy of the team. The seniors are the leaders, the non seniors are there to be led. <br>
This by definition means that the squad members will always be as good as their senior squad leads: all they see is what the senior engineer shows them - in the happy flow by active mentoring, in the worst case just by watching them.</span></p><h3 id="limited-growth-rate"><span>link</span><span>Limited Growth Rate</span></h3><p><span>This is the key part in my opinion, both the seniors and the non seniors have limited amount of potential growth in this scenario, actually the growth is relatively really slow. <br></span></p><ul><li><span>From the senior engineer's perspective: they do more of the same - they became seniors because they know how to design, do decompositions, update stakeholders, code well.<br>
But that not they're main purpose right? This structure misses the point where senior engineers are measured by their impact on the group and making others better. Instead, senior engineers are measured here by their ability to deliver the feature on time.<br>
So the senior engineers improve certain skills which they are already good at, but do not maximize their most important muscle - to make others better.</span></li><li><span>From the non senior engineer's perspective: they are expected to grow by watching and not to grow by doing. So yes - they will grow by watching the senior engineer leading the feature and by active mentoring by them, but they will improve less than doing that themselves and being exposed to all of the different aspects of leading a feature: having all the context, communication with stakeholders etc.</span></li></ul><p><span><img src="https://shaimendel.dev/docs/assets/turn-the-senior-around/new_way.png" alt="Turn The Senior Around"><p>
The non senior engineers are the ones responsible to make the feature delivered, they are the ones with all the context of the feature and they are the active leaders of those feature squads.<br>
The senior engineer's role is first and foremost to constantly give feedback to the non senior engineer who leads the feature - help them learn by providing them a great ground for them to grow.<br>
The team lead's job is double:</p></span></p><ul><li><span>Communicate with the non seniors as feature leads, help if needed and make sure everything is on track</span></li><li><span>Communicate with the senior engineers and give them all the help needed to <strong><em>make sure they have all they need to grow the non senior members</em></strong>. The team lead constantly gives feedback to the senior engineers on how they improve others.</span></li></ul><h2 id="advantages-of-turning-the-senior-around"><span>link</span><span>Advantages Of Turning The Senior Around</span></h2><h3 id="dynamic-team-hierarchy"><span>link</span><span>Dynamic Team Hierarchy</span></h3><p><span>The non seniors feel that the limit to their performance is only themselves and not the senior who leads them (in the scenario before). The fact that the non seniors lead the feature provides them the needed experience and confidence to later become seniors themselves.</span></p><h3 id="maximal-growth-rate"><span>link</span><span>Maximal Growth Rate</span></h3><ul><li><span>From the senior engineer's perspective: they are focused on making others better. They constantly get feedback from the team lead on their ability to do so while of course being active part of the feature implementation.<br>
The senior engineers still use and maintain their strong muscles (design, coding etc) by mentoring the non seniors - pairing, feedback etc.</span></li><li><span>From the non senior engineer's perspective: they grow by trying their best to lead a feature while getting constant feedback from the senior team members. They are exposed to all of the "senior qualities" in first hand and improve on a daily basis.</span></li></ul><h3 id="long-term-team-building"><span>link</span><span>Long Term Team Building</span></h3><p><span>When you zoom out and see what happens to a team that uses this method for a long time you see strong teams where all the team members maximize their growth in their respective areas of learning.<br>
You see a stronger team where seniors constantly grow the non seniors, leading to a robust team.<br>
You see a team that promotes more people to seniors.<br>
You see a team where senior engineers can break through the senior limits and get promoted themselves.<br>
You see a team with satisfied team members :)<br></span></p><h2 id="the-risk"><span>link</span><span>The Risk</span></h2><p><span>Having said all of that there is a short term risk here - you put all your faith and trust on the non senior members to lead critical features and rely mostly on the seniors to help them.<br>
This requires a huge trust in the team and an ability of the team lead to maximize the empowerment of the team members.<br>
I personally really enjoy this step, when you trust your team this way the team feels it. This ability to rely on the team while having long term team building vision is exactly where we grow as engineering managers, but this might be a topic to another blog post :) <br></span></p><p><span>Turning the senior around means to flip the team structure - let the non seniors lead features and make sure the senior members grow them by constant feedback.<br>
This allows strong team building, maximizes everyone's growth and eventually fulfills the two objectives stated at the beginning: delivering on time and supporting our team's professional growth.</span></p></div></div>]]>

                <p>Should our favorite “-ilities” and miscellaneous design/decision drivers be filed under “Non-Functional Requirements” or “Extra-Functional Requirements”? The two editors of IEEE Software Insights do not agree. Read their arguments and decide yourself.</p>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>This post has its roots in a somewhat heated, half-serious terminology debate between us<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> when we reviewed a submission to <a href="https://ozimmer.ch/authoring/2020/06/18/IEEESoftwareInsights.html">Insights</a> recently, our practitioner and experience report column in <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so">IEEE Software</a>.</p>

<p>In requirements land, features aka functional requirements specify “what” a system is supposed to do (on various levels of refinement and elaboration, for instance identified with user stories and/or elaborated with use cases). And then there is all the rest: <!-- TP quote --></p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>The payment requests made during checkout in the (fictitious!) online shop “StayHomeStaySafe.com” should complete in less than three seconds in 80% of the cases.</li>
    <li>Our software should be highly maintainable and evolvable. <!-- not SMART by sample design --></li>
    <li>Due to an Enterprise License Agreement, the relational database management system shall be “TRM Server Version 42.1” from “Delphi Systems”. <!-- this plays with IBM -> HAL --></li>
    <li>Apache 2 and Eclipse are our white-listed open source licenses; the usage of software licensed differently required explicit written approvals by project-external parties including the company-wide architecture board and the legal department.</li>
    <li>The application has to run on existing hardware natively; the operating system must be Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS. Level 1 and 2 support and systems management will be provided by an already existing (fictitious!) service center “CantReproduceNeedMoreInfo Ltd.”.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>What is the most adequate generic term for such “how” requirements and decision drivers?</p>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> The term <em>Non-Functional Requirement (NFR)</em> has been used for a long time.</p>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> <em>Extra-Functional Requirements (EFR)</em> is the better term.</p>

<p>Let’s see whether one of us can convince the other to swap one character in his <a href="https://ozimmer.ch/index/2020/10/30/DrivenByTLAs.html">TLA portfolio</a>, or whether there is a place for both terms. We will exchange arguments in a point-counterpoint style.</p>

<h3 id="qualities-and-constraints-not-much-in-common">Qualities and Constraints: Not Much in Common</h3>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> Many existing methods and speakers use the term NFR, including <a href="https://www.architecting.co.uk/presentations/NFRs.pdf">Peter Eeles from IBM</a>, <a href="http://www.bredemeyer.com/pdf_files/NonFunctReq.PDF">Ruth Malan and Dana Bredemeyer</a> and <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/nonfunctional-requirements/">SAFe</a>. In my blog post introducing the  <a href="https://ozimmer.ch/practices/2020/10/14/DesignPracticeRepository.html">Design Practice Repository (DPR)</a>, I introduce NFRs as this: “quality attributes certainly are included, but NFRs can also be constraints not related to quality at all”.</p>

<p>The five examples above show how diverse the NFR space is; in <a href="https://ozimmer.ch/practices/2020/09/24/ASRTestECSADecisions.html">another post</a> on this blog, I define 5+2 criteria for the architectural significance of such requirements. In the absence of any strong defining semantics, I do not have a problem with defining by exclusion and using the prefix “non” (which I usually avoid, due to its lack of precision).</p>

<h3 id="qualities-and-constraints-beyond-but-not-functional">Qualities and Constraints: Beyond but Not Functional</h3>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> Wait! A requirement for something to be non-functional is a requirement for it not to work, which may be exactly what should happen under some circumstances. So the extra-functional formulation is the more appropriate one.</p>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> Extra-functional sounds like an amplification to me, like “super-functional” or “über-functional”, which clearly is counter-intuitive (where are the qualities?). “This is an extra-hard problem” does not come across as “easy to solve” to me. Even worse, “extra” leaves me with a “free skating” impression, but meeting software quality requirements certainly is a duty/liability, not an option.</p>

<p>And I’d use “dys-functional” if I ever had to refer to a requirement for something not to work.</p>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> Dys-functional implies that it doesn’t work properly, while if something is non-functional it simply doesn’t work at all.</p>

<p>Let me give an example. During the ongoing pandemic, online supermarkets are usually overloaded due to their limited capacity. To deal with this, they open up delivery slots gradually and do not accept orders unless customers can reserve slots in advance. Once it happened to my surprise: I found lots of available slots and I could get my order submitted, only to discover a few days later that the order had been cancelled and refunded. I received an apology letter stating: “due to the peak in demand, our order submission system should have been non-functional”.</p>

<p>So here we can see that the online supermarket only scales up to its capacity (two extra-functional requirements) and that when full, it should stop accepting orders (a non-functional requirement).</p>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> Now I am confused, are you saying that both EFRs and NFRs should be specified? I’d say that “stop accepting orders when condition … holds” is just yet another functional requirement (one about a “rainy day” scenario). When working with <a href="https://www.cs.unb.ca/~wdu/cs6075w10/sa2.htm">Quality Attribute Scenarios</a> to elicit NFRs, for instance, you can specify operating conditions under “environment” and the behavior under “response”. No need for an extra term!</p>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> I never said that you should not use the term NFR. The example is meant to illustrate that requirements can exist for a system to be non-functional – like you say, under certain conditions. Would you rather classify the scenario “when it rains, stop working” as a functional requirement or as a requirement for the system to be non functional under a certain condition?</p>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> It depends what you mean by “working” here; rejecting requests during a certain period is a behavior of the system that can be observed at its boundary and answers a “what” question rather than “how” questions; a contract for this behavior can be specified and tested against. So it is a functional requirement. We might need another post to clarify what we mean by “functional” before we can discuss “extra” vs. “non” 😉.</p>

<h3 id="quality-attribute-and-requirement-taxonomies">Quality Attribute and Requirement Taxonomies</h3>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> I like the <a href="https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/7375/">taxonomy by Martin Glinz</a> who specialized on requirements engineering:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A non-functional requirement is an attribute of or a constraint on a system. An attribute is a performance requirement or a specific quality requirement” (categories: reliability, usability, security, availability, portability, maintainability).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> Indeed, the software requirements literature is full of examples of Non-Functional Requirements, but I am not arguing against the past. Those taxonomies of quality attributes are good; I also dedicate one lecture to them in my Software Architecture class, whose <a href="https://leanpub.com/software-architecture/">script is available on LeanPub</a>. They have just been filed under an inappropriate label.</p>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> The article specifically distinguishes constraints from qualities, which goes beyond labelling! See the examples above, requirements 3 to 5 in particular.</p>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> Would you agree that such platform constraints can be also seen as “Compatibility” or “Portability” requirements (see the “-ilities” figure at the top of this post)?</p>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> Some of them can, but not all. Constraints reduce the options in design. Many of them are caused by <a href="https://ozimmer.ch/practices/2020/04/27/ArchitectureDecisionMaking.html">architectural decisions</a> made previously (that I sometimes refer to as “legacy decisions”); they do cover (rather hard) technology choices such as platform selections — but (often softer) organizational aspects as well. So I have a hard time putting all of them in a single quality category. Anyway, which reference supports your position?</p>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> I let George Fairbanks speak, p. 246-247 in <a href="https://www.georgefairbanks.com/book/">“Just Enough Software Architecture”</a>:<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A quality attribute is a kind of extra-functional requirement, which are also called non-functional requirements and non-functional properties. The term extra-functional is preferred over non-functional because “extra” is more etymologically accurate than “non” in this context — these requirements go beyond functional requirements, not negate them. Most people would interpret a sign saying “non-functional” hanging on a water fountain to mean that it is broken, not that it is high throughput.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> It is worth noting that George writes “accurate” and not “correct”. But this is just a single author voice, really. One that has weight, I admit that <!-- even George can't get everything right --> 😉.
Martin’s paper, on the other hand, is published in academic conference proceedings.<sup id="fnref:2:1"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> Ok, here’s a peer-reviewed quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The term nonfunctional requirement has been used broadly in academic literature and some parts of industry, but it suffers from an unfortunate ambiguity: “nonfunctional” is an actual word that, according to Merriam- Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (11th edition), means something doesn’t work.”<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> That’s a good point.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> Authors do not agree… here are two more examples: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228883029_The_Process_of_Software_Architecting">“The Process of Architecting”</a> (Peter Eeles/Peter Cripps), for instance, uses NFR: “requirements that include constraints and qualities”; this book generalizes from several industrial methods. We find the term in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FURPS">Functionality, Usability, Reliability, Performance, Supportability (FURPS)</a> taxonomy, but not in the <a href="https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010">ISO/IEC 25010 quality model</a>. <a href="https://www.viewpoints-and-perspectives.info/home/book/">“Software Systems Architecture”</a> (Nick Rozanski/Eoin Woods) also does not recommend the term NFR but uses “perspectives” instead.</p>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> There is also the <a href="http://www.mrtc.mdh.se/ITEQS/2021/">International Workshop on Testing Extra-Functional Properties and Quality Characteristics of Software Systems (ITEQS)</a>, now in its 5th edition.</p>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> Yes, but in 2018 they gave the best paper award to a paper titled: “A Testability Analysis Framework for Non-Functional Properties”!</p>

<p>Looks like some more etymology work is in order now.</p>

<h3 id="the-terminology-battle-continues">The Terminology Battle Continues…</h3>

<p><strong>Cesare:</strong> About extra, in addition to amplification (extra-hard but also extra-easy) there are many meanings. See for instance here: <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/extra">https://www.dictionary.com/browse/extra</a>.</p>

<p>So extra in this case would mean “beyond”, “additional”. Performance is an additional requirement going beyond functional correctness. Your software should compute the correct result but also deliver it on time.</p>

<p><strong>Olaf:</strong> Correctness (or accuracy?) actually is a quality. <!-- Martin G also points out that all functional requirements can be seen as qualities, F in FUPRS --> When I talk about functional requirements, I have user stories or use cases in mind that the system under construction supports its end users with. …</p></div></div>

This defines how to map data from the source (in this case Kafka) to the target (S3).&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, it also includes how data should be partitioned into S3, the bucket names and the serialization format (support includes JSON, Avro, Parquet, Text, CSV and binary).&nbsp;</p><p>The syntax looks like this:</p><pre>INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;bucketAddress:pathPrefix&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>SELECT&nbsp;*&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM&nbsp;kafka-topic</pre><pre></pre><pre>[PARTITIONBY&nbsp;(partition[,&nbsp;partition]&nbsp;...)]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[STOREAS&nbsp;storage_format]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[WITHPARTITIONER&nbsp;partitioner]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[WITH_FLUSH_SIZE&nbsp;flush_size]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[WITH_FLUSH_INTERVAL&nbsp;flush_interval]</pre><pre></pre><pre>[WITH_FLUSH_COUNT&nbsp;flush_count]</pre><p>Full docs for the syntax can be found <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.0/integrations/connectors/stream-reactor/sinks/s3sinkconnector/">here</a>. </p><p>The connector supports a number of different authentication mechanisms to the S3 bucket including standard AWS Credentials (using an access and secret key) and via an <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html">IAM role for EC2</a>. </p><p>Where credentials are needed, the Lenses <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.0/integrations/connectors/secret-providers/">secret manager plugins</a> allow you to integrate with common key management solutions such as Hashicorp Vault and AWS Secret Manager.&nbsp;</p><h2>Increased control &amp; pipeline as code</h2><p>Having control over how the data is structured whilst being sinked allows you to optimize for specific use cases, workloads and read patterns by downstream applications (such as Snowflake or AWS Athena, Glue etc.) and cost.

In <b>Bucket name, </b>enter a name for your bucket &lt;BUCKETNAME&gt;. Do not use hyphens or other special characters. This is a requirement of the connector later.</p><p>4. 	Leave checked <b>Block All Public Access</b> and other settings as default.</p><p>5. 	Choose <b>Create bucket</b></p><p>Take note of your AWS region of your bucket as you’ll need this later.&nbsp;</p><h2>Step 2: Create an IAM role</h2><p>For the EC2 authentication to work, you must create an IAM role before you can launch the instance that will run Kafka Connect (the Lenses Box docker is packaged with Kafka Connect). </p><p>With the IAM role created,&nbsp; it will be attached to an instance running Kafka Connect/Box.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, if you will authenticate to the S3 bucket with AWS Secret and Access keys instead, follow the processes described <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key/">here</a>.</p><p><b>To create an IAM role using the IAM console</b></p><p>1.

Depending on which other services you want to access, you may want to open up certain ports (but not essential for this walkthrough).&nbsp;</p><p>1.        Request a Box license key for free from: <a href="https://lenses.io/box/">https://lenses.io/box/</a>. You’ll receive an email with a docker run command</p><p>2.       Run the command on your EC2 instance. It should look like this: </p><p><code>docker&nbsp;run&nbsp;-e&nbsp;ADV_HOST=127.0.0.1&nbsp;\</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-e&nbsp;EULA="https://dl.lenses.io/d/?id=REGISTER_FOR_KEY"&nbsp;\</code></p><p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--rm&nbsp;-p&nbsp;3030:3030&nbsp;-p&nbsp;9092:9092&nbsp;lensesio/box:latest</code></p><p>Note: if you want to configure your own external producers/consumers to this instance, set the <code>ADV_HOST</code> address accordingly.&nbsp; But you’ll need to ensure you open up port 9092 in the security group too.&nbsp;</p><h2>Step 4: Access Lenses and verify data</h2><p>1.	Access Lenses through your browser on port 3030.</p><p>2.	The “Explore” page acts as a real-time data catalog. Search for the <code>backblaze_smart</code> topic. This topic includes real-time flow from a sample producer within the Box environment.&nbsp;</p><p>This will be the data we sink to S3.&nbsp;</p><p>3.

<p>I spent over 25 hours building a cut-down version of Sapiens. The goal? Future-me should be happy to read this once future-me forgets how we evolved. It’s massive for a blog post, just under 30 minutes, but that’s the best I could do, condensing 9 hours worth of material.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to keep editing to a minimum: It’s the original text, edited to ensure it still flows like the book.</p>

<p>You can get the book <a href="https://amzn.to/2WWNsjq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="development-of-brains">Development of brains</h2>

<p>What caused our brains to develop? We’re not sure.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem likely. A larger brain needs more energy and thus reduces the chance you’ll survive. Getting more energy meant hunting more.</p>

<p>One contributing factor was the domestication of fire. Fire paved the way for cooking.</p>

<p>Whereas chimpanzees spend 5 hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food. The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines. Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human brain. Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers, it’s hard to have both. By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains.</p>

<p>And, we weren’t alone. Competing with us were the Neanderthals, among other species. They were stronger, they had bigger brains, and they could survive the cold. How come, then, did we “win”?</p>

<p>We aren’t sure. The most likely answer is the very thing that makes the debate possible: Homo sapiens conquered the world thanks above all to its unique language.</p>

<h2 id="cognitive-revolution">Cognitive Revolution</h2>

<p>The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. What caused it? We’re not sure. The most commonly believed theory argues that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using a new type of language. We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation.</p>

<!-- 
> All new humans are improvements over the past?
> As in, the de facto keeps rising.

>These mutated humans were praised for their initiative and were more successful
>Till everyone became like this and then even more better humans were praised and the previous became the normal -->

<p>What’s special about our language?</p>

<p>Our language is amazingly supple. We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning. We can thereby ingest, store and communicate a prodigious amount of information about the surrounding world. A monkey can yell to its comrades, ‘Careful! A lion!’ But a modern human can tell her friends that this morning, near the bend in the river, she saw a lion tracking a herd of bison. She can then describe the exact location, including the different paths leading to the area. With this information, the members of her band can put their heads together and discuss whether they ought to approach the river in order to chase away the lion and hunt the bison.</p>

<!-- Most likely, both the gossip theory (who can be trusted and who can't) and the there-is-a-lion-near-the-river theory are valid.  -->

<p>Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled.</p>

<!-- The alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable coalition -->

<p>Using language, lots of humans could work together, form a tribe, help each other, and hunt together.</p>

<p>However, communicating with lots of people brings with it new co-ordination problems. The critical threshold for a group interacting together is 150 people.</p>

<!-- But once the threshold of 150 individuals is crossed, things can no longer work that way. You cannot run a division with thousands of soldiers the same way you run a platoon. Successful family businesses usually face a crisis when they grow larger and hire more personnel. If they cannot reinvent themselves, they go bust.  -->

<p>How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. This is an imagined reality.</p>

<!-- Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens has thus been living in a dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations.  -->

<!-- As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as gods, nations and corporations. -->

<p>Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, and as long as this communal belief persists, the imagined reality exerts force in the world.</p>

<p>In other words, while the behaviour patterns of archaic humans remained fixed for tens of thousands of years, Sapiens could transform their social structures, the nature of their interpersonal relations, their economic activities and a host of other behaviours within a decade or two.</p>

<!-- > Because of the cognitive Revolution and the introduction of imagined reality -->

<p>For example, consider trade. Trade cannot exist without trust, and it is very difficult to trust strangers. The global trade network of today is based on our trust in such fictional entities as the dollar, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the totemic trademarks of corporations. When two strangers in a tribal society want to trade, they will often establish trust by appealing to a common god, mythical ancestor or totem animal.</p>

<!-- One on one, even ten on ten, we are embarrassingly similar to chimpanzees. Significant differences begin to appear only when we cross the threshold of 150 individuals, and when we reach 1,000–2,000 individuals, the differences are astounding -->

<!-- The real difference between us and chimpanzees is the mythical glue that binds together large numbers of individuals, families and groups. This glue has made us the masters of creation. -->

<p>Our Tree of Knowledge mutation was significant. However, it’s not just our biology that brought us where we are today.</p>

    <p>Biology sets the basic parameters for the behaviour and capacities of Homo sapiens. The whole of history takes place within the bounds of this biological arena.</p>

<!-- Referring only to our biological constraints would be like a radio sports-caster who, attending the World Cup football championships, offers his listeners a detailed description of the playing field rather than an account of what the players are doing. -->

<!-- There is some evidence that the size of the average Sapiens brain has actually decreased since the age of foraging. Survival in that era required superb mental abilities from everyone. When agriculture and industry came along people could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival, and new ‘niches for imbeciles’ were opened up. You could survive and pass your unremarkable genes to the next generation by working as a water carrier or an assembly-line worker. -->

<p>The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes. Just as the economic success of a company is measured only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees, so the evolutionary success of a species is measured by the number of copies of its DNA. If no more DNA copies remain, the species is extinct, just as a company without money is bankrupt. If a species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species flourishes. From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than a hundred copies. This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions.</p>

<p>Rather than heralding a new era of easy living, the Agricultural Revolution left farmers with lives generally more difficult and less satisfying than those of foragers. Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.</p>

<!-- > The average person in Jericho of 8500 BC lived a harder life than the average person in Jericho of 9500 BC or 13,000 BC. But nobody realised what was happening. Every generation continued to live like the previous generation, making only small improvements here and there in the way things were done. Paradoxically, a series of ‘improvements’, each of which was meant to make life easier, added up to a millstone around the necks of these farmers -->
<!-- 
--- Way of life being lost over generations
    Like with the foundation.
    Also short sightedness.
    As, working harder here meant more food => can better feed children => even more people exist => You're back where you started, except you're working harder.
 -->

<p>Compared to foraging, working a bit harder on the farm meant more food. Settling down on the farm also meant greater freedom to reproduce - you’re not travelling all the time, so you can afford to have more children. This in turn, meant a higher population. And a higher population meant higher food requirements. Thus, the farmers were forced to work even harder.</p>

<p>Why didn’t humans abandon farming when the plan backfired? Partly because it took generations for the small changes to accumulate and transform society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently. And partly because population growth burned humanity’s boats. If the adoption of ploughing increased a village’s population from a hundred to 110, which ten people would have volunteered to starve so that the others could go back to the good old times? There was no going back. The trap snapped shut.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and spawn new obligations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This discrepancy between evolutionary success and individual suffering is perhaps the most important lesson we can draw from the Agricultural Revolution. When we study the narrative of plants such as wheat and maize, maybe the purely evolutionary perspective makes sense. Yet in the case of animals such as cattle, sheep and Sapiens, each with a complex world of sensations and emotions, we have to consider how evolutionary success translates into individual experience.</p>

<!-- In the following chapters we will see time and again how a dramatic increase in the collective power and ostensible success of our species went hand in hand with much individual suffering. -->

These are allowing enterprises to boost their time-to-value and enable agility like never before. When we look at Kubernetes projects put in production, the goal of most companies is largely focused on three domains.</p><ul><li>Operations</li><li>Customer service</li><li>Future of the business</li></ul><p>However, the successful adoption and implementation of Kubernetes isnâ€™t straightforward and poses several challenges - from the perspective of developers as well as IT management.</p><p><b>Key obstacles to Kubernetes adoption</b></p><p>The IT department in any enterprise is almost always the most taxed and burnt out. Kubernetes has been found to be adding to this taxation. For most IT developers, the security concerns posed by Kubernetes is the biggest challenge so far. It has also been found that in the event of limited knowledge about the architecture, it also makes it difficult for developers to effectively scale up the applications. The organizations are thus strapped for talent and must provide their employees with training to bridge the gap.</p><p>Another key obstacle to Kubernetesâ€™ adoption is a lack of resources. This lack of resources doesnâ€™t just make the implementation complex but also causes additional stress to the developers. Building cloud-native applications become a stressful job and result in immense project delays. The burnout associated with Kubernetes adoption is so high that it drives developers to look for a new job.</p><p><b>Disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic</b></p><p>In the face of a global pandemic as dangerous as COVID-19, the disruptions have also been felt by developers and IT managers working with Kubernetes. In the last five to six months since the pandemic has wreaked havoc across the world, enterprises have felt a disruptive effect on their operations. The most critical disruptions, in this case, have been project delays, frozen or slowed down hiring, development budgetary cuts, and technology acquisition budgetary cuts.</p></div></section></div>]]>

          <a name="topofpage"></a>
          <p>Throughout my career, I’ve developed some <em>opinions</em>. Some have worn particularly deep ruts,
reinforced by years of experience. I tried to figure out what these
had in common, and it’s
the idea that <strong>code in production is the only code that matters</strong>. Staging doesn’t
matter, code on your laptop doesn’t matter, QA doesn’t matter,
only production matters. Everything else is debt.</p>

<p>This perspective probably comes from years sitting in between
operations and product development. I strongly
believe that teams should optimize for getting code to production as quickly as
possible as well as responding to incidents in production.</p>

<p>This idea, and a lot of the practices it implies, can be
counter-intuitive or controversial, so I want to dive into them a little
further. What follows is a set of practices and principles I believe are true,
considering my underlying belief that code working in production is the only
code that matters.</p>

<h2 id="engineers-should-operate-their-code">1. Engineers should operate their code.</h2>

<p><strong>Engineers are the subject matter experts for the code they write and should be
responsible for operating it in production</strong>. In this context, “operating” means
deploying, instrumenting, and monitoring code as well as helping to resolve
incidents related to or impacting that code. The responsibility of operating
code aligns incentives - it encourages engineers to write code that is
observable and easy to debug, and connects them to what customers really care
about. It encourages them to be curious about how their code is performing in
production. Importantly, engineers should be on-call for their code - being
on-call creates a positive feedback loop and makes it easier to know if their
efforts in writing production-ready code are paying off. I’ve heard people
complain about the prospect of being on-call, so I’ll just ask this: if you’re
not on-call for your code, who is?</p>

<p>If you’re not currently on-call for your code but want to be, and can help
influence this decision, there are some things you can do. Set up PagerDuty (or
similar) schedules for each group of engineers responsible for specific
services or parts of your code. A good schedule has 6–8 engineers. There are
plenty of variations, but a typical template is to have one-week rotations,
where you’ll be on-call for secondary for a week and then primary for a week.
Configuring alerts is a separate topic, which probably deserves it’s own blog
post entirely, but focus on things that impact your customers (see:
Symptom-based alerting) and remember that you’re ultimately responsible for how
you respond to alerts, which means you can change them.</p>

<p>There are two talks I’d recommend watching that touch on the topic of
configuring alerts: Liz Fong-Jones talks about SLOs in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4jbUzEVL0">Cultivating Production Excellence</a> and Aditya Mukerjee does a great job talking about techniques for
managing alerts in <a href="https://vimeo.com/274820572">Warning: This Talk Contains Content Known to the State of California to Reduce Alert Fatigue</a>.</p>

<h2 id="buy-almost-always-beatsbuild">2. Buy Almost Always Beats&nbsp;Build</h2>

<p><strong>If you can avoid building something, you should.</strong> Code is the most expensive
way to solve a problem that isn’t addressing a core area of your business. For
most small to mid-sized companies, there are open source or better yet, hosted
solutions that solve a wide range of common problems. I mean things like git
repository hosting (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc), observability tooling
(Honeycomb, Lightstep, etc), managed databases (Amazon RDS, Confluent Kafka,
etc), alerting (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc) and a whole host of other commodity
technologies. This even applies to your infrastructure - if you can help
it, don’t roll your own Kubernetes clusters (side note: do you even need to use
Kubernetes?), don’t roll your own load balancers if you can use Amazon ELB or
ALBs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH</a> syndrome is very real and some companies get burned badly by
this. I’ve seen teams light time and money on fire reinventing components when
better, more battle-tested alternatives exist in the market. Those same teams
almost always end up spending years contending with the resulting technical
debt. If you’re on such a team and have the will and ability to impact change,
start rolling back these decisions one by one. Migrate your databases to a
managed provider, migrate your feature flagging system to a SaaS tool (i.e.
LaunchDarkly). Keep going until the only software you maintain yourselves is
the software that delivers value to your customers. You’ll be much, much better
off for it.</p>

<h2 id="make-deployseasy">3. Make Deploys&nbsp;Easy</h2>

<p>Deploying should be a frequent and unexciting activity. <strong>Engineers should be
able to deploy with minimal manual steps and it should be easy to see if the
deploy is successful</strong> (this requires instrumenting your code for observability,
which - tada - is covered above), and it should be easy to roll back a deploy
if something doesn’t go well. Deploying frequently implies that
deploys are smaller, and smaller deploys are generally easier, faster and
safer.</p>

<p>Many teams implement periods where deploys are forbidden - these can be
referred to as code freezes, or deploy policies like “Don’t deploy on Fridays”.
Having such blackout periods can lead to a pile-up of changes, which increases
the overall risk of something going very wrong.</p>

<p>If you’re on a team that fears deploys, dedicate a percentage of your
engineering time to improvements in your deployment pipeline until the fear is
gone. On a recent team I worked with, we were able to improve deploy times from
3 hours to 30 minutes, which drastically improved the teams’ confidence in the
deploy process. A natural side effect of this was that engineers started
deploying much more frequently instead of waiting for changes to pile up enough
to warrant a “release” (which was synonymous with a deploy).</p>

<p>The book
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339">Accelerate</a>
has been getting a lot of attention. If you haven’t read it, I’d recommend it.
The team behind it also publishes the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/devops/">State of DevOps</a>
reports, which are full of well-researched information about what various
companies in the industry are doing. It’s not a coincidence that two of the
four key metrics that the book focuses on are directly related to this (Deploy
Frequency, Change Lead Time). Shipping is <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/o11ycast/ep-12-speed-of-deployment-with-rich-archbold-of-intercom/">your company’s heartbeat</a>.</p>

<h2 id="trust-the-people-closest-to-theknives">4. Trust the People Closest to the&nbsp;Knives</h2>

<p><strong>The people who work with a system are the ones who understand it best.</strong> This
applies to any part of the socio-technical systems within which we all work. In
the case of software systems, the engineers who deploy every day and are
on-call for critical services understand the level of risk they operate in. A
sad trend is that managers tend to overestimate their teams’ progress on
certain transitions - i.e. cloud-native, DevOps, etc. The higher up the
management chain, the larger this overestimation tends to be. Engineers who
deploy and get paged when things break know where the bodies are buried and
they know what needs the most work. They should, therefore, be the primary
stakeholders responsible for prioritizing technical work.</p>

<p>Another manifestation of this principle applies to platform or services teams.
If you’re responsible for building some shared component that’s used within
your organization (i.e. a messaging system, ci/cd infrastructure, shared
libraries or services) there’s an uncomfortable truth lurking for you: the
people who use your work know more about it than you do in many cases. They
understand implicitly how it serves customers and they know what contortions or
hoops they have to jump through to get it to work. Listen to them for
clues on how to improve the UX of your services and tools.</p>

<h2 id="qa-gates-make-qualityworse">5. QA Gates Make Quality&nbsp;Worse</h2>

<p>Many teams have a manual QA step that gets performed before deploys. The idea,
I guess, is to have someone run automated or manual tests to verify that a set
of changes are ready to be released. This sounds like a comforting
idea - having a human being (or team of human beings) “verify” a release before
it goes out - <strong>but it falls victim to several false assumptions and creates
some misalignments that do more harm than good.</strong></p>

<p>First of all, if there’s manual work that needs to be done before a deploy can
go out, that creates a bottleneck - if you’re making deploys easy, and
deploying small changes frequently, no QA team is going to be able to keep up
testing every deploy, and will inevitably block teams from deploying. That’s no
good. If you have manual tests, automate them and build them into your CI
pipeline (if they do deliver value).</p>

<p>Secondly, the teams doing QA often lack context and are under time pressure.
They may end up testing “effects” instead of “intents”. For example, I’ve seen
QA teams burn time testing that when something happens in a UI, something
related happens in a database. What happens when an engineer refactors that UI
component and changes the underlying data model? The functionality works, but
the test breaks. Because two teams are involved, this takes coordination and
time to fix. Similarly, I’ve seen QA teams block deploys because of failing
tests when caching was introduced at the CDN layer - a TTL of 5 seconds on an
activity feed may not ever be noticed by a user but it might break QA tests
causing unnecessary conflicts between product and QA engineers.</p>

<p>Luckily, solving this one is easy. Instead of having a dedicated QA team work
on creating manual and automated test cases that run in a fictitious QA
environment, reassign that team to work on continuous testing in production.
Instead of being a gate for deploys, a QA team could continuously verify that
production is working as expected. QA teams are also well situated to lead
Chaos Engineering initiatives, where faults are intentionally injected in
production. QA engineers could also work on making the CI/CD pipeline more
reliable, so that deploys are no longer a nightmare.</p>

<p>When training a USB3 link, one of the data sequences exchanged looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">BC BC BC BC <span>00</span> <span>00</span> 4A 4A 
4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 
</code></pre></div><p>When using the AB07-USBFMC, trying to send this pattern resulted in the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">BC BC BC BC <span>00</span> <span>00</span> 0A 4A
0A 4A 0A 4A 0A 4A 0A 4A
</code></pre></div><p>This is interesting for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This PHY has geared inputs, and accepts two bytes of data at a time.</li>
<li>The incorrect values (<code>0A</code>) are off from the correct value (<code>4A</code>) by a single bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure enough, modifying the data packet to send <code>FF</code> instead of <code>4A</code> pretty clearly shows off that missing bit:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">BC BC BC BC <span>00</span> <span>00</span> BF FF
BF FF BF FF BF FF BF FF
</code></pre></div><p>At this point, I assumed that I'd gotten the pinout incorrect; and that I'd been writing to the wrong pin –
but careful examination of the documentation and my FPGA I/O definitions suggested that I had things right.
This suggested it was time to check things on the physical layer.</p>
<p>The board in question looks like this:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/board.jpg" alt="The PHY board, which features a notable long span of resistors, neatly tucked in parallel."> <figcaption>
            <h4>The AB07-USBFMC (slightly modified as detailed later).</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Notably, there's a long series of what look like termination / signal conditioning resistors present at
the PHY boundary – and it looks like there's about 32 in total; which would make sense: 16 for transmit,
and 16 for receive.</p>
<p>A quick probe verifies that these are ~50R resistors, which would make a lot of sense for series termination:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/50r.jpg" alt="Multimeter showing a measurement of 47.5 ohms."> <figcaption>
            <h4>Sure looks like a series termination resistor.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is excellent news, as it means that the signals are easily accessible without “voiding our warranty”,
which is a bit of a comfort when dealing with a rather expensive evaluation board.</p>
<p>So, as a next-step test, I had my FPGA squirt a 100MHz clock signal into every line on the transmit bus,
and probed the PHY side of one of those termination resistors:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/phy_tx_healthy.png" alt="A somewhat-rounded square wave, consistent with probing a 100MHz clock."> <figcaption>
            <h4>A nice, healthy wobble. AC coupled.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The frequency and amplitude of this signal are pretty in-line with what you'd expect: the amplitude corresponds
nicely to a decently healthy logic <code>1</code>. But how does the signal look on the problematic bit?</p>
<p>I adjusted the FPGA design so it only squirted a wave into the problematic bit; and probed in line until I found it:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/phy_tx_unhealthy.png" alt="A somewhat-rounded square wave, consistent with probing a 100MHz clock."> <figcaption>
            <h4>A *lot* less happy. Still AC couled for display.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Ut-oh. This signal's looking a lot less happy – and a lot more attenuated. At approximately 500mV peak,
you'd be hard pressed to consider this a logic <code>1</code>, even if you gave it your very best squint. There's no way
this thing would have worked in a test environment – which makes it seem very unlikely that this board was, y'know,
tested.</p>
<p>This immediately made me suspicious of the termination resistor sitting next to it; and apparently for good reason:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/larger_50r.jpg" alt="Multimeter showing a measurement of 396.0 ohms."> <figcaption>
            <h4>Quite possibly the largest 50 Ω I've ever seen.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This resistor is quite clearly supposed to be 50 Ω. It's also quite clearly <em>not</em> 50 Ω, despite sitting cleanly
in the middle of a row of 50 Ω resistors, and pretty much definitely the source of my problems.</p>
<p>So, naturally it's time to perform what I assume must be several hundred dollars worth of rework on this $1.65k board.
Luckily, I stock E24 0402s, so I had the resistor replaced with an appropriate value in no time.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/happier.png" alt="Oscilloscope display of a corrected waveform."> <figcaption>
            <h4>Much happier. Note the amplitude.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With an appropriate value replaced, everything looks much happier – and everything works much more nicely.
Finally, our USB training sets look just the way they should:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/yay.png" alt="Analyzer display showing the correct value of our training set."> <figcaption>
            <h4>A correct Training Set, at last.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I'm planning on reaching out to Design Gateway – to at least let them know that this is an issue on some boards.
I'll update this post if/when I get a reply.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lately, there has been a lot of discussion about SLAs, SLOs and SLIs. As <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/defining-SLOs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this article</a> states, it is hard to define the correct SLOs and SLIs. This discussion is about what part of your services you want to monitor. But it is also difficult to measure these correctly. In this blog post I take a look at two examples of what can (and for us, did) go wrong in monitoring. This is about how you monitor your services.</p><h2>Example: TCP connections for monitored services</h2><p>The first example will be about TCP connections, a proxy, and handshakes.</p><h3>Expectation vs. reality</h3><p>For one of our projects we use an authentication proxy which is talking to an LDAP server as backend. We came across connections piling up on the server hosting this proxy. At first, it was not clear what was causing these connections.</p><p>After the proxy was installed, I integrated it into our Zabbix monitoring. To verify the proxy is answering requests, I used Zabbix’ built-in check <code>net.tcp.connect</code>. At first all seemed fine. The check was doing exactly what I expected.</p><p>But after a while we saw connections to the backend piling up on the server running the proxy. As no one was using the proxy for authentication at that point, I suspected Zabbix causing the vast number of connections. The monitoring of the service wasn’t working as expected. But what exactly was happening?</p><p>Each time Zabbix initiated the check, it was doing a three-way TCP handshake …</p><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/Selection_001.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/Selection_001-283x300.png" alt="TCP three-way-handshake" width="283" height="300" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/Selection_001-283x300.png 283w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/Selection_001.png 462w" sizes="(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px"></a><br> Source: <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/park/cs536-e2e-3.pdf">https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/park/cs536-e2e-3.pdf</a></p><p>… and after that tore down the connection:<br> <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/Selection_002.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/Selection_002-281x300.png" alt="TCP connection tear down" width="281" height="300" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/Selection_002-281x300.png 281w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/Selection_002.png 466w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px"></a><br> Source: <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/park/cs536-e2e-3.pdf">https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/park/cs536-e2e-3.pdf</a></p><p>In tcpdump, it looks like this:<br> <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image04.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image04-300x37.png" alt="TCP 3-way-handshake and tear down" width="300" height="37" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image04-300x37.png 300w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image04-1024x127.png 1024w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image04.png 1558w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p><p>That was expected, so why were there so many connections still left on the system?</p><p>The proxy responded correctly, so the Zabbix check said everything is fine. But what happened on the connection from the proxy to the backend system?</p><p>It turned out, the proxy was starting a TLS connection to the backend for every incoming TCP connection. It did not matter to the proxy, there was no data sent. But the TLS connection to the backend should not be a problem either. It should have been torn down when the TCP connection from Zabbix to the Proxy ended. But that is theory. In reality the TLS connection even persisted after the correct TCP teardown:</p><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image01.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image01-300x71.png" alt="TLS handshake - 1" width="300" height="71" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image01-300x71.png 300w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image01-1024x245.png 1024w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image01.png 1567w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p><h3>The Swiss army knife of networking</h3><p>So, I found the connections piling up on the proxy. But I still did not know what was the real problem. I tried to get a more precise view by connecting to the proxy manually with netcat: <code>nc -v backend.example.com 8636</code></p><p>But nothing happened. Each time I opened a connection with netcat to the proxy, it started a TLS connection to the backend. I closed netcat and after that, the proxy tore down the TLS connection to the backend. No connections piled up on the Proxy. What was different? After some more testing and man page reading I managed to reproduce the Zabbix behaviour with netcat: <code>nc -z -v backend.example.com 8636</code></p><p>The parameter that did the trick was <code>-z</code>. It instructs netcat to close the connection after a successful connect:</p><pre lang="”txt”">-z      Specifies that nc should just scan for listening daemons, 
        without sending any data to them. It is an error to use 
        this option in conjunction with the -l option.
</pre><p>So, it is not a problem specific to Zabbix, but it seems to be the Proxy. During the tests with netcat I observed, the problem didn’t appear when I used netcat in interactive mode.</p><p>Perhaps everything is a timing problem?</p><p>Netcat offers another handy parameter for these tests:</p><pre lang="”txt”">-w timeout
             Connections which cannot be established or are idle 
             timeout after timeout seconds. The -w flag has no 
             effect on the -l option, i.e. nc will listen forever
             for a connection, with or without the -w flag. 
             The default is no timeout.
</pre><p>So, I tried it again with <code>nc -w 1 -v control01.baremetal 8636</code> and it turned out, it works.</p><p>I did some more tests with this parameter and it worked without leftovers. Taking a closer look at the tcpdump traces, the TLS connection is not torn down when the initiating TCP connection to the Proxy ends before the TLS handshake finished. As soon as the TCP teardown sequence starts after the TLS handshake is done, the TLS connection also ended as expected(tcpdump view):</p><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image00.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image00-300x94.png" alt="TLS handshake - 2" width="300" height="94" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image00-300x94.png 300w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image00-1024x321.png 1024w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2014/12/image00.png 1566w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p><h3>Monitoring the service</h3><p>So, I used the netcat command to create a new Zabbix check with the slowed down TCP disconnect. It is not the perfect solution, but works fine for my situation.</p><p>To be complete, implementing the check for Zabbix did not work without problems. In short, it showed Zabbix also needs the parameter <code>-d</code>. Otherwise, it does something weird with stdin and the parameter <code>-w 1</code> has no effect.</p><h2>Example: State of a monitored service</h2><p>This is another example of an application we monitor. There we monitored the availability and response time of an HTTP endpoint. The first approach was a simple HTTP GET showing these response times:</p><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-10-08_10_07.png"><img loading="lazy" width="250" height="40" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-10-08_10_07-250x40.png" alt="Pile Up of monitored response times" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-10-08_10_07-250x40.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-10-08_10_07-700x112.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-10-08_10_07-768x123.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-10-08_10_07-1536x246.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-10-08_10_07-120x19.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-10-08_10_07.png 1670w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p>As you can see in the graph above, the response time piled up the more we queried the endpoint.</p><p>As it turned out, the application held a state associated with the endpoint. Be surprised, but not everything is stateless. This state grew bigger and bigger each time we queried the endpoint. Therefore, it took the application longer and longer to process our requests. The session timeout was too long, to discard the session between the monitoring queries.</p><p>The application had to be modified, so that it does not create a session for the endpoints used for monitoring. This is just an example and might also happen with disk space, memory, or CPU consumption.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Not only is it hard to define SLOs/SLIs and define the correct measures for a user perspective. As shown with these examples, it is also hard to monitor the services correctly without impacting the selected SLOs with your measurement. It’s crucial not to only know what service to monitor, but also how to monitor this service. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Observer effect</a> is not only applicable to quantum physics.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Did you ever need to redirect the default URL of firebase hosting to a custom URL? You may ask me why do you need to do so. There are a couple of cases that we need to do so. I’m going to explain a scenario that I’ve needed to redirect the default URL to a custom URL in Firebase Hosting.</p>
<p>My client asked me to host his web site on Firebase Hosting and at that time he was not configured with the proper domain name. So I deployed his website and I gave him the deployed URL something like https://myapp.firebaseapp.com. So he was happy and shared that with few people that need that to test. A few days later he configured his proper domain name in firebase hosting and it is working perfectly. But the problem is the default URL that I have shared with him previously also working. He wanted to redirect that URL to the custom domain that he configured. </p>

<p>The problem here is firebase does not allow to cancel or redirect the default URL. So adding redirects in firebase.json won’t work. So we have to do it on our own. The simplest way that I realize is to do the redirection with JavaScript. So what you have to do is adding the below script to the bottom of your index.html page.</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
        if (location.hostname.indexOf('custom.domain') === -1) {
            location.replace("https://custom.domain");
        }
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>What this script does is if the URL hostname is not equal to our custom domain the rewrite the URL to the custom domain. This method works for all the browsers that enabled the JavaScript.</p>
<p>Hope this will help you if you had to face the same situation as me. You can see more details <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34212039/redirect-to-firebase-hosting-custom-domain">here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>No matter what architecture you’re planning to build: an API Gateway is mostly part of a modern setup. So why not connect your Spring Boot apps with Kong API Gateway using a standard like OpenAPI and configuration-as-code?!</p><h2>Finding a good way to integrate</h2><p>I have to admit that I’am a little late to the party. Many of my colleagues have already written <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/en/?s=kong">posts on Kong API Gateway on our codecentric blog</a>. If you want to read more about <a href="https://github.com/Kong/kong">Kong as an API Gateway</a>, I can recommend having a look. Getting involved has been on my list for a long time. So here we go. 🙂</p><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/spring-boot-kong-logos.png"><img loading="lazy" width="250" height="67" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/spring-boot-kong-logos-250x67.png" alt="Spring Boot connected with Kong" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/spring-boot-kong-logos-250x67.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/spring-boot-kong-logos-700x187.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/spring-boot-kong-logos-768x205.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/spring-boot-kong-logos-120x32.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/spring-boot-kong-logos.png 1534w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p>Logo sources: <a href="https://github.com/Kong/kong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kong logo</a>, <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spring Boot logo</a></p><p>I always want to know how I can integrate new technologies into my tool belt. So why not try to integrate Kong as an API Gateway for Spring Boot Apps? Maybe that’s also a problem you have, since you landed here on this article. And it shouldn’t be a big problem, right? Hmm, googling around, I wasn’t convinced about the solutions I found.</p><p>Many of the implementations <strong>needed code changes</strong> or the usage of custom annotations on the Spring side in order to do the integration. A lot of them relying on libraries with a suspiciously small user base. Or I found many articles describing <strong>manual steps</strong>, where I would need to click on this and that in order to connect my app with Kong. None of these approaches really seem to work out in the long run. So I began to dive a bit deeper into the topic. And I developed some <strong>requirements for the solution I was trying to find</strong>:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> There <strong>shouldn’t be any need to change the code</strong> of my Spring app! Since there’s no silver bullet, I always want to be able to use other tools with minimal effort if my requirements change. And I also want to integrate my existing Spring Boot apps into the API Gateway seamlessly.<br> <strong>2.</strong> I had no clue about Kong, but I wanted to use it really as any other tool that is able to remain in my toolbelt: <strong>It should be configurable 100% by code</strong> – so that no clicks will be needed at all.<br> <strong>3.</strong> Many posts about Kong involve a huge Docker Compose file with 3 to 4 services solely needed to fire up a API Gateway instance. I like full-blown setups for production use, but I wanted to have <strong>a setup where Kong only needs one service</strong> – like other solutions I saw with for example <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spring Cloud Gateway</a> or <a href="https://traefik.io/traefik/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Traefik</a>.<br> <strong>4.</strong> The <strong>integration of Spring Boot and Kong should be fully automated</strong>. Since code is here to change, every change affecting my app’s REST interface should be reflected automatically in the API Gateway. And I want to be able to automatically verify that in my CI/CD pipeline.</p><h2>The setup</h2><h2><p>Finally I found a setup that should work for many use cases and would also meet my requirements. Let’s take a look onto the following diagram:</p><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/blog-post-setup.png"><img loading="lazy" width="250" height="39" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/blog-post-setup-250x39.png" alt="the setup of the blog post using OpenAPI &amp; Insomnia Inso" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/blog-post-setup-250x39.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/blog-post-setup-700x109.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/blog-post-setup-768x119.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/blog-post-setup-1536x238.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/blog-post-setup-2048x318.png 2048w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/11/blog-post-setup-120x19.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p>Logo sources: <a href="https://www.openapis.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OpenAPI logo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Kong/kong" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kong logo</a>, <a href="https://insomnia.rest/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Insomnia logo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/tree/develop/packages/insomnia-inso" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Inso logo</a></p><p>So the idea is to <strong>use <a href="https://www.openapis.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OpenAPI</a> as the integration glue</strong> here. I think that’s a great specification – even without using an API Gateway. Maybe it’s even already there in your project?! In order to simplify the usage of OpenAPI with Spring, there’s the great <a href="https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">springdoc-openapi</a> project which we’ll use in our setup.</p><p>In addition, we’ll also focus on <strong><a href="https://docs.konghq.com/latest/db-less-and-declarative-config" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kong’s Declarative Configuration option</a></strong>. This will have a bunch of benefits. First, this approach enables us to use Kong as fully configurable by code. It also enables a really elegant setup, where we only need one single Kong service – since there’s also a DB-less mode, where Kong doesn’t need any database. And finally using the <a href="https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/tree/develop/packages/insomnia-inso#-inso-generate-config-identifier" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">openapi-2-kong functionality of the Insomnia CLI (“Inso”)</a> we can directly <strong>generate the Kong Declarative Configuration file from our OpenAPI specification</strong> that is derived from our Spring Boot REST API. As we don’t want to get a headache by using too many buzzwords, we should get our hands dirty and simply build this setup from the ground up! To really be able to comprehend every single step, you may also want to look into <a href="https://github.com/jonashackt/spring-boot-openapi-kong" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the example project on GitHub</a>.</p></h2><h2>Creating a Spring Boot app or choose an existing one</h2><p>This is the easy part. We all know where to start if we want to kick off a new Spring Boot project. <strong>Go to <a href="https://start.spring.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">start.spring.io</a></strong> and generate a Spring REST app skeleton matching your needs. You may also choose one of your existing apps to start with. I simply took the <code>weatherbackend</code> app from this <a href="https://github.com/jonashackt/cxf-spring-cloud-netflix-docker" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spring Cloud-based project</a>, which was part of <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2017/05/ansible-docker-windows-containers-scaling-spring-cloud-netflix-docker-compose/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a blog post I wrote in 2017 about a Spring Cloud Netflix-stack-based setup</a>. Additionally I also wanted to get a feeling for the differences between the setup back then compared to the usage of Kong API Gateway today.</p><p>The <code>weatherbackend</code> Spring Boot app is using standard dependencies like <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-web" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spring-boot-starter-web</a> to implement some Spring MVC based REST endpoints. The class <a href="https://github.com/jonashackt/spring-boot-openapi-kong/blob/main/weatherbackend/src/main/java/io/jonashackt/weatherbackend/api/WeatherBackendAPI.java" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WeatherBackendAPI.java</a> looks like something you would expect:</p><div><div><pre><span>package</span> <span>io.jonashackt.weatherbackend.api</span><span>;</span>

<span><span>&lt;/plugin<span>&gt;</span></span></span></pre></div></div><p>As you see, we also need to tell the <code>spring-boot-maven-plugin</code> to start and stop the integration test phases, since the <code>springdoc-openapi-maven-plugin</code> will use the live documentation of a running Spring Boot app to generate the OpenAPI spec file. In order to finally generate the file, simply execute Maven with: <code>mvn verify</code>. The output should look like this:</p><div><div><pre>...
<span>[</span>INFO<span>]</span> <span>---</span> springdoc-openapi-maven-plugin:<span>1.1</span>:generate <span>(</span>default<span>)</span> <span>@</span> hellobackend <span>---</span>

...</pre></div></div><p>This indicates that the OpenAPI spec generation was successful. Therefore, we need to take a look into the <code>weatherbackend/target</code> directory, where a file called <code>openapi.json</code> should be present now. <strong>And this is great news!</strong> Without changing any code, we generated our OpenAPI spec file. 🙂</p><h2>Tweak the API information in the generated OpenAPI spec</h2><p>We could just go on with that <code>openapi.json</code> file, but we may want to tweak it slightly. Since if we move forward, we will notice that some information should be changed <strong>to achieve a better integration into Kong</strong>. Especially the element <code>"title": "OpenAPI definition"</code> is later used as the Kong service name. Also the element <code>"url": "http://localhost:8080"</code> is used to configure the upstream service endpoint <code>protocol</code>, <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> inside the Kong service definition.</p><p>I know that “this is code”. But again <strong>we don’t need to change any existing code</strong> and we don’t need to introduce new classes/annotations into our normal Spring code. We simply create a new separate class that uses <a href="https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi#adding-api-information-and-security-documentation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the @OpenAPIDefinition annotation</a> to configure the needed service info. So let’s create a class like <a href="https://github.com/jonashackt/spring-boot-openapi-kong/blob/main/weatherbackend/src/main/java/io/jonashackt/weatherbackend/api/OpenAPIConfig.java" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OpenAPIConfig.java</a> that looks as follows:</p><div><div><pre><span>package</span> <span>io.jonashackt.weatherbackend.api</span><span>;</span>
&nbsp;
<span>import</span> <span>io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations.OpenAPIDefinition</span><span>;</span>

                <div><p>During the summer of 2019, I received a Facebook message from Roboflow co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/braddwyer">Brad Dwyer</a> asking me if I wanted to design a new mobile app he was working on. His previous app, <a href="https://magicsudoku.com/">Magic Sudoku</a>, had recently generated some buzz online and even won a <a href="https://blog.producthunt.com/golden-kitty-awards-winners-7c2628e5f429">Golden Kitty award from Product Hunt</a>, so he was excited to build another app using Apple's ARKit.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FH30v5kCWAw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>Video version of this post: don't forget to <a href="https://bit.ly/rf-yt-sub">subscribe</a>!</figcaption></figure><p>At the beginning of our meeting, Brad placed a Boggle box in front of me and said he wanted to experiment with augmented reality in the board game space. His vision was to blend the the experience of playing board games on your phone with the experience of playing a physical board game with friends. </p><h3 id="research">Research</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/discovery01.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/discovery01.jpg 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/discovery01.jpg 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/discovery01.jpg 1600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/discovery01.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>There are so many ways to play Boggle.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/discovery02.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/discovery02.jpg 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/discovery02.jpg 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/discovery02.jpg 1329w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>My first step was to buy Boggle and start playing it regularly. I also began researching different ways you can play Boggle, including all the variations sold by Hasbro, both physical and digital. I even watched old clips of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbxlB67nnmM">short-lived Boggle game show</a> from the '90s on Youtube.</p><h3 id="first-design-iteration-where-s-the-augmented-reality">First Design Iteration - Where's the Augmented Reality?</h3><p>I have designed many mobile apps over the years, but this was my first foray into augmented reality. From our initial research and our time spent playing the game, Brad and I identified some pretty obvious pain points.</p><ol><li>There’s no way quick way to identify words you’ve missed unless you type all the letters into an <a href="http://fuzzylogicinc.net/boggle/">online Boggle solver</a>.</li><li>It takes a significant amount of time to read your words out loud and score them.</li><li>It can be a pain to challenge words from other players if you aren’t familiar with the Boggle dictionary.</li></ol><p>The main requirement was to use <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/creating-boardboss-a-mobile-application-that-improves-boggle/">computer vision to scan the letters</a> in the grid and provide a list of all possible words. I was still learning the capabilities of ARKit so, initially, I didn’t spend a lot of time designing the AR experience. I played it safe and designed a simple Boggle app that listed all the possible words, provided a 3-minute timer, and gave users the ability to enter their scores after each round. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/i1-screens.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/i1-screens.jpg 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/i1-screens.jpg 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/i1-screens.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>My first iteration was too light on augmented reality.</figcaption></figure><p>At this point, my designs were fulfilling Brad’s main requirement of including a computer vision component, but the app wasn’t really differentiating itself from other scorekeeping apps. Brad’s feedback was to go all in on the AR experience and come up with something he wasn’t even sure he could build.</p><h3 id="second-design-iteration-let-s-visualize-some-data">Second Design Iteration - Let's Visualize Some Data</h3><p>During my initial research, I found a great article <a href="http://thebogglers.blogspot.com/2008/06/my-boggle-strategy-fwiw.html">full of tips for improving your Boggle score</a>. It instructed players to look for common groups of letters and memorize all the various words that stem from those groups.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/i2---inspiration.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/i2---inspiration.jpg 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/i2---inspiration.jpg 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/10/i2---inspiration.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>My AR concepts were inspired by data visualization imagery I found online.</figcaption></figure><p>With AR, I realized we could use the letters on the grid to do more than just list out all the possible words.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>Security is an illusion, especially with computers. The systems are so complex, handled by so many different people that nobody really has a good idea of how everything works. Even the best specialists have knowledge gaps: software, hardware, etc… This creates a security nightmare: breaking stuff is trivial, fixing the systems is nearly impossible.</p>
<h2 id="high-security-systems-still-exist">High Security Systems Still Exist</h2>
<p>There are systems that are protected against nearly all attacks. <strong>Their main philosophy is not to fix the security issues but to prevent an attacker from accessing the system in the first place.</strong> You can’t hack something that’s not there. However these systems are painful to use, especially for their lack of internet connection. Here are the main techniques used in a high security system:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Air Gapping</strong>: The device can’t connect to anything that is not physically plugged into it. No internet, wifi, bluetooth, speaker, microphone, webcam. Anything that can communicate with the outside world is physically removed from the electronic device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non Contamination Protocol</strong>: Air Gapping is not sufficient (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">stuxnet</a> is a good example of why it isn’t). Everything plugged into the air gapped device (like usb keys) can’t be plugged anywhere else. No exceptions. This prevents any information from getting out. I would even recommend not to plug anything that comes from another device (stuff like stuxnet or ransomware can still make some damage).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical Protection</strong>: Non-contaminated air gapped devices are impossible to attack remotely. The only way is to access them physically. Having the electronic device hidden in a place that is difficult to access (e.g. in a safe) will protect it better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Full Disk Encryption</strong>: Physical Protection is not foolproof. An attacker can still get access to it with enough resources. To protect the information inside your device, encrypt its entire content. Not all types of encryption are made equal, we will talk about it later in this article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tamper Evident System</strong>: The last remaining attack on an electronic device, after you’ve already used all of the above techniques, is to tamper it. The main goal is to access the encryption key when it is entered. Using tamper evident techniques (hardware and software) will alert you that somebody has modified your device to access your password (more about it in Two Layers of Encryption below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backup</strong>: The last remaining problem is system failure. As long as your backups follow all of the above techniques, you can have as many as you want. Store them in a different location for increased safety.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security is more about how you use the hardware/software rather than having a secure device in itself. It’s more about protocol than technology.</strong></p>
<p>I have seen classified environment with less security than the one just presented. Using a device with all of the above techniques will guarantee an electronic fortress. However this creates a big problem: <strong>you become the information’s weak link</strong>. It means that an attacker will no longer try to hack or decrypt your device, but instead will threaten you in order to access the information inside it.</p>
<h2 id="plausible-deniability">Plausible Deniability</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.alvarez.io/img/color/2FE.png" alt="Rubber-hose cryptanalysis">
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis">Rubber-hose cryptanalysis</a> from <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">xkcd</a></em></p>
<p>To prevent being compelled to reveal your passwords, somebody invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption">Deniable Encryption</a>. Basically you have two passwords: when you enter the first one the information decrypted is different than when you enter the second one. You use your device with the second password to work on the sensitive information (which can’t be accessed using the first password). In case somebody threatens you, you give them the first password. They will decrypt your device and see that there is no information (or if there is, info that is not sensitive).</p>
<p>In practice Plausible Deniability is problematic:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tools and techniques exist to detect the presence of a secondary password (Deniable Encryption).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your attacker sees that the system can use plausible deniability, they may not believe that there is only one password and therefore may continue to threaten you until you reveal the second one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will be harder for you to pass lie detection tests since you are still able to access the sensitive information using a secondary password.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What you really want, if threatened, is not to be physically able to unlock your device. If you can’t decrypt the information, nobody has a reason to threaten you.</p>
<h2 id="two-factor-encryption">Two Factor Encryption</h2>
<p>Two Factor Encryption uses your password in addition to something you possess to generate the encryption key of your device. In general these secondary factors look like USB keys. To decrypt the information, you need your password (50% of the key) and some information you don’t know, stored/calculated by your secondary factor (the other 50% of the key).</p>
<p>You can’t open your device without these two elements: your password and the secondary factor.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing is that if you break the secondary factor, you won’t be able to access your device and its backups. You can’t be compelled to decrypt the information, because you simply can’t: your password, which you can now freely communicate to your attacker, will not be enough.</p>
<p><strong>Using Two Factor Encryption creates a physical “red button” which, if pressed, will destroy all access to the information in your devices (even offline backups stored in different locations).</strong></p>
<p>This also has the side effect of preventing you from accessing your device’s information ever again. This is one disadvantage of Two Factor Encryption over Plausible Deniability, which is that you can’t access your data after the attacker is done with you. However if you’re handling sensitive information, it is very likely that you’d rather have it destroyed than letting it fall into the wrong hands.</p>
<h2 id="yubikey">YubiKey</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.alvarez.io/img/color/2FE-2.png" alt="YubiKey"></p>
<p>A nice, affordable second factor for your encryption is a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">YubiKey</a>. However there is no straightforward manual on how to use it, and the key has quite complex modes and functionalities.</p>
<p>If you are not a technical person, I will recommend using the <a href="https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016614980-Understanding-Core-Static-Password-Features">password mode</a>. It is not as safe as the challenge mode, but it will be simpler to use and to configure.</p>
<p><strong>Password Mode</strong></p>
<p>The YubiKey can act as a usb keyboard. When the button is pressed, it will send a combination of keys (a kind of password) as if someone was typing. This makes it compatible with everything that requires a typed password. However using this mode implies that the 50% of the key coming from your 2FE will be the same across all devices. If it is intercepted it will drastically reduce the security.</p>
<p>To use the password mode, when prompted to your login information, enter your password (the thing you know), then plug your YubiKey and press the button. It will “type” the rest of the “password” (the thing you possess but don’t know). You can then access your device.</p>
<p>In this scenario the thing you know is 50% of the password, the other 50% of it (which you don’t know) is stored on your YubiKey and typed for you when you press the button.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge Mode</strong></p>
<p>The challenge mode is safer than the password mode, however it is more complex to configure and use. The information received from the YubiKey (the 50% of the key that comes from the 2FE) is different for each device. If it is intercepted, it will not compromise the security of other devices.</p>
<p>To use the challenge mode, your encryption software has to be compatible with it (contrary to the password mode which works with everything). When prompted to your login information, enter your password, and then the software will send a challenge (a phrase or an id you pre-configured) to the YubiKey which will respond with the missing 50% of the encryption key. The combination of the two elements (your password and the 2FE response), creating the encryption key, will unlock your device.</p>
<p>The advantage of the challenge mode is that if you configure a different challenge (phrase or id) for each device you will have a different response each time, making your encryption key unique on all your devices and backups. This increases the security a lot in case one of them is compromised.</p>
<h2 id="not-all-encryptions-are-made-equal">Not All Encryptions Are Made Equal</h2>
<p>Cryptography may be the hardest thing in security. If you screw it up, nobody will come and tell you about it, and  you will pay the consequences later on.</p>
<p><strong>Serpent Encryption Algorithm</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_(cipher)">Serpent</a> was part of the finalists of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard_process">AES competition</a>. It was judged to be the most secure algorithm of them all, but <a href="https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paper-twofish-final.pdf">was discarded due to its speed</a>. However 20 years later, the computational power of everything exploded. Today the difference in speed between AES and Serpent doesn’t matter anymore, however the  difference in security still does. This is part of the reason why you should use Serpent everywhere ;)</p>
<p><strong>Truecrypt</strong></p>
<p>Truecrypt is an awesome tool that has been proved to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt#Legal_cases">complicated to break</a>. The tool was suddenly discontinued in 2014 in what seemed to be due to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/26pxol/truecrypt_is_dead/">third party pressure</a>. An independent audit was financed by the <a href="https://www.opencryptoaudit.org/">community</a> in 2013. The <a href="https://opencryptoaudit.org/reports/TrueCrypt_Phase_II_NCC_OCAP_final.pdf">summary</a> was released in 2015, showing “no evidence of deliberate backdoors, or any severe design flaws that will make the software insecure in most instances”.</p>
<p>Given that it’s complicated/impossible to break, that it’s been audited without any security flaw found, and the pressure put on the developers to stop the project: <strong>it’s safe to say that you should use it everywhere</strong>.</p>
<p>You can find Truecrypt <a href="https://github.com/DrWhax/truecrypt-archive">here</a>, the last version is 7.1a. Use the 3 ciphers cascade encryption mode.</p>
<p>If you use the hidden volume feature, be careful with older backup versions of your file container. The difference between the older version of the container and the newer version will reveal the use of an hidden volume (bytes will change where there is supposedly no data). Try to backup the content of your container inside a new one, so  that there is no match at all between the backups and the original container.</p>
<p><strong>Password</strong></p>
<p>The last line of defense for your data is your password. Depending on the system you are using, the encryption key will be encrypted using your password, or …</p></div></div>

That's because the cameras in smartphones are&nbsp;unable to replicate the physical movement of an adjustable lens as seen with digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras.&nbsp;</p>  <p>This physical manipulation lens still relies on 16th century Galilean optics, an archaic system that has not been reimagined — until now. Scope CEO Holden Beggs says the new technology the team has come up with has modernized the current lens system. It&nbsp;applies electrical fields to liquid crystals enabling a high quality zoomed image without any physical movement.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"If you think about whenever you try to take a photo, especially when you want to zoom in and take a photo, when you pinch the zoom, that photo gets blurry, it gets pixilated; and it's because all your phone is essentially doing is using software that just crops the photo, it's not actually keeping that high quality," Beggs told CBC News.</p>  <p>"What our technology means is you'll be able to zoom to take consistently sharp photos, it means you'll be able to take different kinds of photos … and you can do it without having a bunch of cameras on the back of your phone, just one that can do everything."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/scope.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/scope.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/scope.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/scope.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/scope.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808073.1605800706!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/scope.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Scope CEO Holden Beggs says the new technology has modernized the current lens system and applies electrical fields to liquid crystals enabling a high quality zoomed image without any physical movement. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Dyson Canada Ltd.)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <h2>'Impressive invention'</h2>  <p>Explaining how the Scope lens works, Beggs said when different fields are applied, the crystals reorient and change shape, mimicking a physical zoom system — a perfect integration and replacement of current smartphone lenses.</p>  <p>"It's a great invention because it solves a problem that has really been plaguing optics and cameras," he said.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/scope.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/scope.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/scope.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/scope.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/scope.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5808070.1605800590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/scope.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>UW’s engineering team surpassed more than 1,800 international applicants in 27 countries with their invention.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Dyson Canada Ltd.)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The students recently won the international runner up prize and $8,500 for the James Dyson Award (JDA), a global annual design competition to encourage students to engineer inventions to some of the world's largest problems.&nbsp;</p>  <p>UW's engineering team beat out more than 1,800 international applicants in 27 countries with their invention.</p>  <p>Peter Gammack, Dyson's vice president of new product innovation, called Scope "an impressive invention" in a release.</p>  <p>"Not only is it a low compact and cost-effective solution, it also has the potential to be used in a variety&nbsp;of product applications. I was also impressed that the team used simulation techniques in&nbsp;conjunction with practical experiments to develop the concept," Gammack said.</p>  <p>Beggs said it will be a few years before the Scope lens is rolled out on smartphones.</p>  <p>"The smartphone cycle is quite long. A company like Apple for instance is working on a smartphone that is coming after the smartphone that is coming after the one coming out next," he said.</p>  <p>"It's a very long process to get technology to a smartphone."</p>  <p><span><span><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gEe3zxJ4_Lc" frameborder="no" title="YouTube content" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span></span></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>This is the default <a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/blob/master/rich/logging.py#L15">RichHandler</a> class in <a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich">Rich</a>. It would be possible to do a little more customization for Django logs. Maybe highlight 5xx in red, for example.</p>
<p>To add this to your Django project, <code>pip install rich</code> then configure the console to use <code>"rich.logging.RichHandler"</code> rather than StreamHandler.</p>
<pre><code>LOGGING = {
    "version": 1,
    "disable_existing_loggers": False,
    "formatters": {"rich": {"datefmt": "[%X]"}},
    "handlers": {
        "console": {
            "class": "rich.logging.RichHandler",
            "formatter": "rich",
            "level": "DEBUG",
        }
    },
    "loggers": {"django": {"handlers": ["console"]}},
}
</code></pre>
<p>The process is much the same for any project. See the documentation for the Rich <a href="https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logging.html">logging handler</a> for details.</p>

November 20, 2020 | https://jslvtr.com/posts/better-python-console-apps-with-rich | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jslvtr.com/posts/better-python-console-apps-with-rich">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently I've been working on a few internal tools for my company, Teclado. Things like web scrapers to collect data and store it in a database, or simple tools to make people's jobs easier.</p>
<p>Because these are intended for a very small audience who are doing very specific tasks, I normally make console applications. And console applications can be tricky to use (and look hideous) most of the time.</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong> is a Python library that changes that completely. My new console apps are a joy to use, look great, and it's super easy to create them.</p>
<p>In this post, let me tell you about Rich and how I've been using it. I'm not a Rich expert by any means, but I hope it helps!</p>
<h2>A Rich Example</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html">Rich documentation</a> is excellent, so I'll just give you a quick example of the sorts of things you can do with it.</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> rich <span>import</span> <span>print</span>
<span>from</span> rich.prompt <span>import</span> Prompt

name = Prompt.ask(
    <span>"What is your name?"</span>,
    choices=[<span>"Jose"</span>, <span>"Adam"</span>, <span>"Jen"</span>]
)

helped = <span>50</span>  
print(<span>f"You have helped [bold green]<span>{helped}</span>[/] students this week! :muscle:"</span>)</code></pre>
<p>The output of this code is this:</p>
<p><img src="https://jslvtr.com/images/better-python-console-apps-with-rich/prompting.gif" alt="Terminal demo of the Prompt code"></p>
<p>Sadly, Windows support for emojis in the terminal is extremely subpar. It works well on Mac, though!</p>
<p>You can see that Rich does a lot for you already, such as limiting choices in prompts, or support for colours and styles in text using a BBCode-like syntax.</p>
<p>There's more though!</p>
<h2>Tables with Rich</h2>
<p>By far one of my favourite features of Rich is <em>Tables</em>. I'm using tables for all sorts of stuff in my console apps, and I find myself doing the same pattern over and over:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear the console</li>
<li>Add a table row</li>
<li>Draw the table</li>
</ul>
<p>With this pattern, tables can look like they're growing over time, effectively making your console window into a standalone app.</p>
<p><img src="https://jslvtr.com/images/better-python-console-apps-with-rich/tables-demo.gif" alt="Terminal demo of growing tables"></p>
<p>For example, recently I was writing a scraper for house prices nearby (I'm thinking of moving), and I naturally wanted to display the house information, price, and so forth. Nothing better than a table for this, so I got to writing:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> requests
<span>from</span> bs4 <span>import</span> BeautifulSoup
<span>from</span> rich.console <span>import</span> Console
<span>from</span> rich.table <span>import</span> Table

console = Console()
page = requests.get(RIGHTMOVE_URL).content
soup = BeautifulSoup(page)


property_table = Table()
property_table.add_column(<span>"Address"</span>, style=<span>"bold"</span>)
property_table.add_column(<span>"Rooms"</span>)
property_table.add_column(<span>"Price"</span>)

<span>for</span> property <span>in</span> properties:
    property_table.add_row(property[<span>0</span>], str(property[<span>1</span>]), str(property[<span>2</span>]))

console.print(property_table)</code></pre>
<p>That's how easy it is to draw a table using Rich! It doesn't have dynamic growing, but all you have to do to make a table grow dynamically is clear the console and re-create the table each time, with increasing numbers of rows.</p>
<p>That could be particularly useful if we had to scrape each property's page to get more information. If we did that, the table could grow as we scrape, which would be awesome!</p>
<h2>Adapting Classes to Rich</h2>
<p>Another great thing about Rich (especially if you're making applications that specifically output to a Rich <code>Console</code>), is that your classes can become <code>Renderable</code>. Then you can just print them, and Rich will display them in the format you choose.</p>
<p>For example, you could make a class like this one:</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> rich.console <span>import</span> Console, ConsoleOptions, RenderResult
<span>from</span> rich.table <span>import</span> Table


<span><span>class</span> <span>PropertyTable</span>:</span>
    <span><span>def</span> <span>__init__</span>(<span>self</span>):</span>
        self._properties = []

    <span><span>def</span> <span>__len__</span>(<span>self</span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> len(self._properties)

    <span><span>def</span> <span>append</span>(<span>self, prop</span>):</span>
        self._properties.append(prop)

    <span><span>def</span> <span>pop</span>(<span>self</span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> self._properties.pop()

    <span><span>def</span> <span>clear</span>(<span>self</span>):</span>
        self._properties.clear()

    <span><span>def</span> <span>__rich_console__</span>(<span>self, console: Console, options: ConsoleOptions</span>) -&gt; RenderResult:</span>
        properties = Table(expand=<span>True</span>)
        properties.add_column(<span>"Address"</span>)
        properties.add_column(<span>"Rooms"</span>, style=<span>"bold"</span>)
        properties.add_column(<span>"Price"</span>, style=<span>"bold green"</span>)

        <span>for</span> prop <span>in</span> self._properties:
            prop.add_row(prop[<span>0</span>], str(prop[<span>1</span>]), str(prop[<span>2</span>]))

        <span>yield</span> properties</code></pre>
<p>And when printed using a Rich <code>Console</code>, that shows a table with a row per item in the <code>_properties</code> list.</p>
<h2>Better Logging and Tracebacks with Rich</h2>
<p>Rich can do many other things for you, but another good one is that it can make it easier to read tracebacks and errors. Just do this:</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> rich.traceback <span>import</span> install

<h4>About Nir Eyal</h4>



<p>Nir Eyal is an Israeli-born American author, lecturer, and investor.  Previously, he taught as a Lecturer in Marketing at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School and I’ve sold two technology companies since 2003. </p>



<p>Nir Eyal is the bestselling author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591847788/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=motiveex-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1591847788&amp;linkId=efb3c5480d3cd5d001553869edce302c"><em>Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/194883653X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=motiveex-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=194883653X&amp;linkId=4e87049bcf3c51d2ef9828baac46fd9b"><em>Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life</em></a>. </p>



<p>Years of studying successful startups led to insights about influencing consumer behavior. And then, these insights were codified in the Hook model: a cycle of events, engineered to keep users coming back. </p>



<p> Hooked is ideal for businesses that build products that require ongoing, unprompted user engagement, and therefore need to build user habits within the product to thrive. It is a perfect read for startup founders, visionaries, innovators, but also established corporations who aim to understand how products influence our behavior and use habits for good.

<h4>Nir Eyal Quotes</h4>



<p>Here are the most powerful success lessons from the Nir Eyal quotes:</p>



<blockquote><p>Users who continually find value in a product are more likely to tell their friends about it.</p><cite><strong> Nir Eyal </strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Many innovations fail because consumers irrationally overvalue the old while companies irrationally overvalue the new.</p><cite><strong> Nir Eyal </strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Products that require a high degree of behavior change are doomed to fail.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>To change behavior, products must ensure the user feels in control. People must want to use the service, not feel they have to.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The Hook Model is designed to connect the user’s problem with the designer’s solution frequently enough to form a habit. It is a framework for building products that solve user needs through long-term engagement.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Make your product so simple that users already know how to use it, and you’ve got a winner.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Companies who form strong user habits enjoy several benefits to their bottom line.</p><cite> <strong> Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>the first place for the entrepreneur or designer to look for new opportunities is in the mirror.</p><cite><strong>Nir Eyal </strong> </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Fun is looking for the variability in something other people don’t notice. It’s breaking through the boredom and monotony to discover its hidden beauty.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>For some businesses, forming habits is a critical component to success, but not every business requires habitual user engagement.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Instead of relying on expensive marketing, habit-forming companies link their services to the users’ daily routines and emotions.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>When users start to automatically cue their next behavior, the new habit becomes part of their everyday routine.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The ultimate goal of a habit-forming product is to solve the user’s pain by creating an association so that the user identifies the company’s product or service as the source of relief.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to complete the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the behavior.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“Habit Testing.” It is a process inspired by the build-measure-learn methodology championed by the lean startup movement. Habit Testing offers insights and actionable data to inform the design of habit-forming products. It helps clarify who your devotees are, what parts of your product are habit-forming (if any), and why those aspects of your product are changing user behavior.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Internet is, “a giant machine designed to give people what they want.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Habit-forming products often start as nice-to-haves (vitamins) but once the habit is formed, they become must-haves (painkillers).</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>For an infrequent action to become a habit, the user must perceive a high degree of utility, either from gaining pleasure or avoiding pain. </p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>So why haven’t more Google users switched to Bing? Habits keep users loyal. If a user is familiar with the Google interface, switching to Bing requires cognitive effort. Although many aspects of Bing are similar to Google, even a slight change in pixel placement forces the would-be user to learn a new way of interacting with the site. Adapting to the differences in the Bing interface is what actually slows down regular Google users and makes Bing feel inferior, not the technology itself.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>We often think the Internet enables you to do new things … But people just want to do the same things they’ve always done.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Users take their technologies with them to bed.[cxiv] When they wake up, they check for notifications, tweets, and updates, sometimes even before saying “Good morning” to their loved ones.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Once a technology has created an association in users’ minds that the product is the solution of choice, they return on their own, no longer needing prompts from external triggers.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Variable rewards are one of the most powerful tools companies implement to hook users</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<pre></pre>



<blockquote><p>You are now equipped to use the Hook Model to ask yourself these five fundamental questions for building effective hooks:   1.   What do users really want? What pain is your product relieving? (Internal Trigger) 2.   What brings users to your service? (External Trigger) 3.   What is the simplest action users take in anticipation of reward, and how can you simplify your product to make this action easier? (Action) 4.   Are users fulfilled by the reward, yet left wanting more? (Variable Reward) 5.   What “bit of work” do users invest in your product? Does it load the next trigger and store value to improve the product with use? (Investment)</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Who is on a team matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work, and view their contributions.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>To receive fewer emails, we must send fewer emails.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>There are many counterintuitive and surprising ways companies can boost users’ motivation or increase their ability by understanding heuristics—the mental shortcuts we take to make decisions and form opinions.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>If you were to walk around Slack’s company headquarters in San Francisco, you’d notice a peculiar slogan on the hallway walls. White letters on a bright pink background blare, “Work hard and go home.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The goal is to eliminate all white space on your calendar so you’re left with a template for how you intend to spend your time each day.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Motivation or Ability — Which Should You Increase First? After uncovering the triggers that prompt user actions and deciding which actions you want to turn into habits, you can increase motivation and ability to spark the likelihood of your users taking a desired behavior. But which should you invest in first, motivation or ability? Where is your time and <a href="https://motiveex.com/tag/wealth/">money</a> better spent? The answer is always to start with ability.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Building habit-forming products is an iterative process and requires user behavior analysis and continuous experimentation.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>However, products utilizing infinite variability stand a better chance of holding on to users’ attention, while those with finite variability must constantly reinvent themselves just to keep pace.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Many entrepreneurs fall into the trap of building products that are only marginally better than existing solutions, hoping their innovation will be good enough to woo customers away from existing products. But when it comes to shaking consumers’ old habits, these naive entrepreneurs often find that better products don’t always win—especially if a large number of users have already adopted a competing product.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Companies fail to change user behaviors because they do not make their services enjoyable for its own sake, often asking users to learn new, unfamiliar actions instead of making old routines easier.</p><cite> <strong>Nir Eyal </strong>  </cite></blockquote>

One thing that I know confused me as a first time founder trying to raise capital from investors for the first time was when someone mentioned to me that they would want a warrant in the deal. Warrants can sound intimidating but as you know here at Talkin' SaaSy we like to try and break things down so they are more digestible so let's get into warrants, long story short, an IOU for investors.</p><p>Early-stage investing is speculative and risky business. More often than not angels or early-stage funds are taking bet on founder they believe in that are working on a product or solution to a problem that they believe will have broad market application. Now early-stage investors protect themselves from this risky business, first is diversification of their portfolio, more promising startups means you are more likely to have a few winners in your portfolio (in theory). Second is warrant coverage, how exactly does this help?</p><p>Warrants are essentially an IOU from a company to an investor as part of a funding round. Say I put $250,000 into a seed round of your budding SaaS startup at $1.00 a share. For early-stage investing like this, a fund or angel is counting on that price per share multiplying many times, if it goes to $40.00 per share, my $250,000 is now $40M, sounds like a nice return, right?. Well my seed fund is a $50M fund which means even if i hit one company that goes from 1 to 40 dollar per share, I'm still $10M short on breaking even with my fund, yikes. This is where warrants come in, for those early-stage investors, maximizing the number of shares you can get in your winners is a key for driving fund performance.</p><p>So now, in that same seed round, I included a warrant for 20% of the round meaning the company, if I exercise the warrant. Must sell me and additional $50,000 shares at a strike price (a strike price is just a set price that is agreed upon in the warrant, it means the investors get to buy shares of the stock at the set strike price, no matter what the actual price is in the most recent funding round). So, with my 20% warrant, I am entitled to purchase an additional $50,000 worth of shares at a $2.00 strike price. So if that same company goes to $40.00 a share and I exercise my warrant I turn my $50,000 into an extra $1,000,000, as an investor I just got much closer to returning my fund and I haven't even take into account pro-rata right (we will get into that another time).</p><p>Warrants on their surface are meant to help companies looking to raise capital. In theory, the investor is incentivized to help the business do better and thus the warrant becomes more valuable. The issue is, most early-stage funds typically have warrants in all of their deals, so no matter which deal wins, they get to leverage that warrant into great ROI for the fund. How could we rethink warrants to better align outcomes and incentivize investors to help startup succeed?&nbsp;Is it a sliding performance scale?&nbsp;The better the startup grows and performs the better the terms of the warrant are for investors? It will be interesting to see if we can rethink how we use warrants to help align the outcome for founders and investors. Disclosure, warrants are used in multiple types of investing and this article is only meant to summarize their use in private venture investing. This is also a very simplified summary of warrants, if you are using a warrant in a funding round always comply with securities law and consulte a legal professional.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/xd">xd(1)</a> is a tool that dumps binary input in a more human-readable format.
There are countless tools that fit this description, including od(1), hexdump(1), xxd(1), and a bunch of Rust crates in the same vein, but this one has a new trick up its sleeve.</p>



<p>A column with printable ASCII bytes shown as exactly that, and everything else as a dot, is such a strong convention that it basically defines the visual identity of hex-dumping tools.
It’s not a bad convention too — the unobtrusive dots for C0 controls and high bytes make ASCII text stand out, as if you had installed strings(1) on your pattern-matching neurons.
But imagine what kinds of patterns you could spot in binary data, if only there was a unique glyph for each of the other 161 possible bytes?</p>

<p>The features released so far are pretty minimal beyond this very idea, but my hope is for xd(1) to eventually join the likes of rg(1) and fd(1) as another product of Rust’s renaissance of best-in-class solutions to CLI problems.</p>

<p>Modern character encodings like UTF-8 won’t work for a bunch of reasons, including the fact that they’re variable-length, which would break the one-to-one relationship between bytes and glyphs that we’re going for.
Many common single-byte character sets like ISO-8859-1 or Windows-1252 won’t either, because they tend to leave 00h–1Fh and 80h–9Fh undefined to accommodate the C0 and C1 controls, which aren’t the simple printable characters we’re after.</p>

<p>I’ll let Raymond take it from here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a code page that matches ASCII for the first 128 values and can round trip arbitrary bytes through Unicode?</p>

  <p>You may find yourself looking for such a code page when you have a chunk of binary data with embedded ASCII text. You want to be able to dig out and even manipulate the ASCII text, and treat the non-ASCII parts as mysterious characters that have no meaning, but you need to be able to convert them back into the original bytes.</p>

  <p>[…]</p>

  <p>Okay, I’ll cut to the chase. The code page I use for this sort of thing is code page 437. Every bytes is defined and maps to a unique Unicode code point, and it agrees with ASCII for the first 128 values.</p>

  
</blockquote>

    <a href="https://www.azabani.com/images/xd-dots.png"><img src="https://www.azabani.com/images/xd-dots.png" width="100%"></a>
</figure>

<p>In particular, we use a mapping of code page 437 to Unicode that <em>includes</em> the dingbats and other symbols that lived in the ROM at 01h–1Fh, plus a tweak that replaces U+0000 NULL with U+2400 SYMBOL FOR NULL at 00h.
The end result is a reversible text representation that’s fairly visually distinct<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

delan you still got that hexview program?

[2016-06-19 18:33:35] &lt;delan&gt;
yeah Jaci, I’m still working on it</pre>

<p>This is actually my third attempt at executing this idea in this form<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I first wrote <a href="https://bitbucket.org/delan/xd/commits/branch/prototype.c">a version of this tool</a> in C, before I even got into Rust, and it was pretty elaborate.
There were <a href="https://bitbucket.org/delan/xd/commits/b01eb4396a235fe6c85d30fc24ca497b60f3018c#Largv.cT10">custom format strings</a> powered by <a href="https://bitbucket.org/delan/xd/commits/b01eb4396a235fe6c85d30fc24ca497b60f3018c#Lcontext.cT72">a nearly-incomprehensible hand-rolled parser</a>, a cute little <code>--help</code> system that would essentially popen(3) a pager like less(1) and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/delan/xd/commits/b01eb4396a235fe6c85d30fc24ca497b60f3018c#Lmain.cT73">pipe documentation text from inside the program</a>, and the project even taught me how to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/delan/xd/commits/41d60216d694de579844b8ba9259834e753693ec">use fuzzing to fix bugs</a>!</p>

<p>A couple of years later, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/delan/xd/commits/branch/prototype.rs">I ported it to Rust</a> as my first foray into the language.
I kept many of the more… useful features (the popen(3)-to-pager trick was more <em>cute</em> than <em>useful</em>), learned to <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nom">use parser combinators</a> with the new <a href="https://bitbucket.org/delan/xd/commits/d804e1cdd0dd5a4a7c5279624c592e3b8d44b4a5#Lsrc/format.rsT138">custom format parser</a>, and wrote enough functionality that I could start <a href="https://bitbucket.org/delan/xd/commits/e387383e193e2afd1a54e8a437cadc57595f0594?at=prototype.rs#Lsrc/options.rsT85">emulating the competition</a>.</p>

<p>The problem was that I hadn’t really <em>released</em> many of my projects before, and I was more than happy to perpetually avoid dealing with <em>that</em> can of worms in favour of using the project as a training ground for learning how to build new things.
Rust certainly helped — unlike C, it has a fantastic <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/">package manager</a> and a <a href="https://crates.io/">place to put your packages</a> — and that’s where <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ing2ynab">almost</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nonymous">everything</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pledge">else</a> I’ve managed to release (or help release) has gone.</p>

<p>But the lesson that really made this project see the light of day?
To build something that has any broader impact, you can’t just experiment forever, rewriting your project over and over (but better this time) and trying to perfect a feature set that will blow everyone out of the water on version zero.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, you’ve got to actually turn it into a thing that’s useful to someone (even just you or your friends), be it a package they can install, <a href="https://charming.daz.cat/">a service</a> they can use, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMGM6s1Qw_Q">video</a> and <a href="https://www.azabani.com/2020/06/29/bad-apple-for-taskmgr.html">writeup</a> they can enjoy, or <em>something</em>.
And from there, you can iterate.</p>

                    <h2 id="a-week-in-summary-hype-value-hyper-hype-vs-hyper-growth">A week in summary: Hype = Value? Hyper hype VS Hyper growth</h2><p><br>A bit of market frenzy this week and US election conspiracy with the timing of Pfizer and BioNTech announcement of a COVID-19 vaccine. A vaccine that could bank them <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/10/pfizer-and-biontech-could-make-13bn-from-coronavirus-vaccine">$13 billion next year</a> and speed of development. The FTSE 100 jumped by 5% whilst Zoom (-15%), Peloton (-7%) and Netflix (-5%) fell. Perhaps more people would still prefer to go back to their Friday night drinks and in-person gym experiences over online <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21559541/beyonce-peloton-themed-class-music-bike-treadmill-lawsuit-settled">Beyonce X Peloton classes</a>.<br></p><div><p><strong>Hyper hype hype</strong></p><p>On the other side of the market, Supreme was acquired this week for $2.1 billion by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/09/vans-owner-vf-corp-to-buy-streetwear-brand-supreme-for-2point1-billion.html">VF Corp</a>. This brings them into the fold of a company who owns Timberland, The North Face and Vans. They are <a href="https://trapital.co/2020/11/10/memo-014-hip-hops-next-era">a firm with experience</a> in extending the shelf of mass market brands but it is to be seen whether Supreme’s brand will extend well into the mass market. Whilst resale prices may be high for Supreme products on the secondary market, going to the masses can be profitable. Last year when Yeezy began to go to the mass market they saw a <a href="https://footwearnews.com/2019/business/athletic-outdoor/yeezy-mass-release-sales-2019-1202736706/">500% increase in sales</a> and also a $1.3 billion deal with GAP this year. </p></div><div><p>The market continued as a hypebeast continued this week with viral digital products studio MSCHF claiming to raise a seed round of $200 million for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/mschfs-push-party-raises-an-unconventional-round-at-a-200-million-valuation">PushParty</a>, an app with a FOCUS on doing one thing only. If you press the big red button on the app, you send a notification to everyone with the app installed. Perhaps being a hypebeast can be quite a lucrative career option. MSCHF previously raised $11.5 million and who can forget, Push Pizza, the equally minimalist startup that lets you do only one thing - <a href="https://insights.dice.com/2014/08/08/push-for-pizza-app/">push a button for pizza</a>.</p></div><figure><img src="https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/XQpNChZzd_phLLy_NgqZNTeyAt7_6ZsK76jKtw5-C4qAcFz2BEMKI2E0zSZVAYoltjqrikDrFui0Ov2Q1OV1HpKeyVYSC_DXfO7oCrHrmIpfUghel-kHqpd3MnMGVOIqxOBWRZ7s2jUB8fpcwKU7_SSgP7mREA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://mcusercontent.com/9c9bf2101972b0a405bd2f81d/images/b40917ab-e8ff-4e6e-8699-aeaf753e0f0d.png" alt=""></figure><div><p><strong>Hyper growth</strong></p><p>Whilst Supreme and MSCHF command the attention of Gen-Z, UK startup Hopin has been facing super <em>hypergrowth</em>. The startup has raised $125 million in a Series B since raising $40 million in a Series A only a few months ago in the summer. Hopin is now at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/hopin-raises-125m-for-its-online-events-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/">$2.25 billion valuation</a> whilst having $20million Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). The startup is only 2 years old. Solo founder Johnny Boufarhat created the startup from a desire to improve the events networking business after falling seriously ill after a food poisoning experience. Johnny shares <a href="https://viralwegrow.com/blog/hopin-johnny-boufarhat/">some of his insights</a> on how he has managed to raise capital as a solo founder and how to manage viral growth.</p></div><p>Hopin’s valuation at 100x its current ARR display some of the investor optimism in having a ‘really good’ <em>product market fit </em>for Software as a Service (SaaS) businesses and an extreme outlier. As a benchmark, slower growing SaaS companies trade at 3-5x next year’s revenue (e.g. Zuora and Dropbox) whilst fast growing ones (and outliers) like Zoom and Datago trade at a valuation that is 40x the ARR.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/uI1EZt26p1urFsssrQWvx2UUvFfxgnuQVL9Lae5dJqTsfUuVoY00a0GbXvLNW_QBJS57zoc6mtft0-ZzqEeBwdhJ0lv-fLq8GCW5isAW_ObudP5LeVxik8g-godRRmgUWOGMO9Gh" alt=""><figcaption>Growth premium in SaaS. <em>Source: SeriouslySaaS</em></figcaption></figure><div><p><strong>Product to Market Hype - Veblen Goods</strong></p><p>What we are seeing in the market with hype products is a phenomenon called a Veblen good. What this means is that unlike consumer interest for traditional goods which falls as price increases, increasing the price for a Veblen product creates an exclusive ‘luxury’ effect that increases demand. In the case of Supreme, there’s a perceived value in the hype for a good whether it be resale values or to own something exclusive. How this works for content or digital media which is less scarce and more infinitely scalable is less certain (although <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tokenized-art-nfts-paint-bright-future-for-artists-blockchain-tech">blockchain firms are trying for digital art</a>). MSCHF is a media based company and it is working for them. </p></div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/HFJUMKT8iR-7zDYzXYa0GeAJmTQNwmiPqIYWeNyFXyLcq6LxariReqhP6uynZNKo3dWthnaaDgqwouQu6wjfbEMYkcg7sxHUl9t8wr1V6O_IFg2sbyn6kulBmfErKZJEmhSRvhDv" alt=""><figcaption>Normal Good vs Veblen Good</figcaption></figure><div><p>Perhaps this hype is part of a wider cultural shift of spending patterns. According to Future Cast, Gen Z’s have an <a href="https://www.millennialmarketing.com/research-paper/the-power-of-gen-z-influence/">enormous influence on spend</a>. They spend $44 billion for themselves and influence $600 billion in spending by others. It is well documented that both Gen Z’s and Millenials have a greater weighting on value in paying for <em>experiences</em>. Perhaps being a part of a meme or consuming <em>content as an experience </em>is worth hyping and paying for. </p></div><h2 id="brain-gems">Brain Gems<br></h2><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/08/business/digital-nomads-regret.html"><strong>The Digital Nomads Did Not Prepare for This</strong></a> (by Erin Griffith)</p><p>Paradise lost.

<p>Drupal, a popular CMS and blogging platform has patched a remote code execution vulnerability, <strong>CVE-2020-13671</strong>.</p>



<p>Today, over half a million sites use Drupal, as such applying updates for critical vulnerabilities like these immediately is vital.</p>



<p>The vulnerability also tracked as <a href="https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2020-012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SA-CORE-2020-012</a>, exists due to improper validation of filenames of files uploaded to Drupal websites.</p>



<p>A remote attacker can upload files with crafted filenames. Since the vulnerable versions do not properly sanitize these filenames, it is possible to trick the uploader into treating a file as, say, PHP, and have it execute arbitrary code on the server. </p>



<p>“Drupal core does not properly sanitize certain filenames on uploaded files, which can lead to files being interpreted as the incorrect extension and served as the wrong MIME type or executed as PHP for certain hosting configurations,” states Drupal’s security advisory.</p>



<h2>Multiple patched versions released</h2>



<p>Drupal has released patches for multiple versions, depending on what branch you are using:</p>



<ul><li>If you are using Drupal 9.0, update to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.0.8">Drupal 9.0.8</a></li><li>If you are using Drupal 8.9, update to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.9.9">Drupal 8.9.9</a></li><li>If you are using Drupal 8.8 or earlier, update to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.8.11">Drupal 8.8.11</a></li><li>If you are using Drupal 7, update to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.74">Drupal 7.74</a></li></ul>



<p>“Versions of Drupal 8 prior to 8.8.x are end-of-life and do not receive security coverage,” states the advisory.</p>



<p>In addition, for due diligence, website admins should check <em>all previously uploaded files</em> for malicious extensions. </p>



<p>The security advisory suggests looking for files with more than one extension, such as <code>filename.php.txt</code> or <code>filename.html.gif</code>.</p>



<p>These files are really PHP or HTML files containing code but have been disguised as text/image files via a misleading file extension.</p>



<p>“Look specifically for files that include more than one extension, like&nbsp;<code>filename.php.txt</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>filename.html.gif</code>, without an underscore (<code>_</code>) in the extension. Pay specific attention to the following file extensions, which should be considered dangerous even when followed by one or more additional extensions:”</p>



<ul><li>phar</li><li>php</li><li>pl</li><li>py</li><li>cgi</li><li>asp</li><li>js</li><li>html</li><li>htm</li><li>phtml</li></ul>



<p>“This list is not exhaustive, so evaluate security concerns for other unmunged extensions on a case-by-case basis.”</p>



<p>Multiple researchers have been credited for reporting this vulnerability: ufku, Mark Ferree, Frédéric G. Marand, Samuel Mortenson of the Drupal Security Team, and Derek Wright.</p>



<p>Users are advised to upgrade their Drupal instances to the fixed versions as soon as possible. Also, remember to perform additional auditing steps mentioned above to minimize the possibility of a potential security compromise.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><h2>Why did this data breach occur?</h2><p>Based on the scale of personal identification information data exposed, experts believe that the breach occurred due to a misconfigured AWS S3 bucket with respect to poorly maintained <a href="https://thechief.io/c/debricked/pci-dss-requirements-managing-security-vulnerabilities-when-handling-payment-cards/">PCI DSS</a>, or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. PCI DSS is a crucial information security standard that protects the data of branded credit card holders and allows them to make safe and secure transactions on online portals. </p><p>According to <a href="https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/prestige-soft-breach-report/">websiteplanet.com</a>, Prestige Software was not following this standard, which resulted in the ability to accept and process credit card statements to become subdued. The resulting data breach effortlessly sourced all sensitive information leading to millions of customers exposed on the Internet. The effects of this data breach will be felt by the company directly in terms of negative press coverage, loss of business, and legal action. They will also have to face heavy fines due to GDPR and Data Privacy Violations.</p><p>This data breach doesnâ€™t just affect customers and the company itself but also exposes its clients, including big names such as Expedia, Booking.com, Agoda, Sabre, Omnibees, and more. Whatâ€™s more concerning is that while investigations were ongoing regarding the data breach, new customer records were still being accepted, recorded, and uploaded on the platform.</p></div></section></div>]]>

<p>I think DevOps, as we understand it today, is coming to an end. At least the Ops part of it. As cloud infrastructure becomes a key application concern, more and more ops tasks are done by the cloud itself or built into the application. What’s left is the provisioning and management of the infrastructure needed by the application. This comes with all the baggage associated, like security and networking, for example.</p>
<p>All of these patterns that are now being forged will make the infrastructure provisioning indistinguishable from the application itself for the general use case. Right now, in most companies, traditional IT Groups have rebranded themselves as DevOps and are now the gatekeepers of AWS, instead of the on-premise VMWare clusters. They use Terraform instead of bash scripts and are generally more agile, having adopted many of the development practices. These are specialized people that are familiar with networking, with how IAM works in AWS. They are responsible for building the networking part, the infrastructure, securing it, and handing it over to the application that uses them.</p>
<p>The developers are mostly fine with it, as they don’t want to learn the intricacies of AWS IAM or VPC’s. I’m reminded in many ways of how the database was treated when I joined the industry in the 2000s. Back then, the application would not touch the structure of the database. You would have scripts that would be run by DBAs on production systems. Those would create the database structure, the tables, indexes, and basically the entire database structure. Developers would then map these to their code and just perform DML once the application was running on a fixed schema that is managed by someone else. I see infrastructure the same way today.</p>
<p>Once ORM and various other frameworks started to manage this domain, these concerns got bundled in the application. There is no reason why the same thing won’t happen to infrastructure. The only problem is we didn’t have the right frameworks to do it, but now we’re starting to get them.</p>
<p>The need to handle application infrastructure (I see this different than managing core business services infrastructure like AD, email, finance systems, etc.) at scale happened in the age of virtualization and started with CFEngine. For those that don’t know, CFEngine was one of the first configuration management systems as we understand it today, followed by Puppet, Chef, and others. CFEngine happened in the age where most provisioned happened either by hand or by following documented step by step instructions. At the core of the proposition was a whitepaper written by Mark Burgess <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. The mainline of reasoning was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Present day computer systems are fragile and unreliable. Human beings are involved in the care and repair of computer systems at every stage in their operation. This level of human involvement will be impossible to maintain in the future. Biological and social systems of comparable and greater complexity have self-healing processes that are crucial to their survival. It will be necessary to mimic such systems if our future computer systems are to prosper in a complex and hostile environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CFEngine was one of the first cracks of the problem of building a self-healing system that works at scale and shares some of the ideas from the immune system. To achieve this, it leveraged four important properties:
1) It used a DSL to describe the desired state instead of using procedural languages. This would try to abstract components to allow administrators to parameterize and reuse.
2) It has converging semantics, i.e., one describes what a system should look like, and when the system has been brought to that state, CFEngine becomes inert.
4) It offers protection against an unfortunate repetition of tasks and hanging processes in situations where several administrators are working independently with little opportunity to communicate.</p>
<p>Using these features, one could achieve a self-correcting and self-healing system, which would result in a system that maintains fault tolerance. Today with AWS, we can design a system that displays the same properties by leveraging multi-regional services. By their nature, these services can transfer these properties to the application if employed with careful design.</p>
<p>Lots of other tools appeared around the same time or soon after, each focusing on different aspects of the initial value proposition. Probably the most popular are Puppet and Chef. Each has its strong points. At the company I work, we went with Puppet to handle our infrastructure configuration mostly because it was easier to read for non-programers. From a sysadmin perspective, it was appealing to get something done without diving too much into coding. In time, it would prove to be a false choice that would hurt us more than it helped.</p>
<p>Puppet has its own DSL, its own terminology, and idiosyncrasies. It has its own ecosystem of tools, dashboards, and extensions that help you get pretty far in managing your infrastructure. Its strong point is dealing with single server systems that didn’t need distributed coordination between them. There is a way of coordination across several servers with exported resources and PuppetDB, but it always felt hacky to me((it may be a different story today, but I haven’t followed the space for a couple of years now).</p>
<pre><code>
#https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-minecraft/blob/master/manifests/user.pp

class minecraft::user {
  group { $minecraft::group:
    ensure =&gt; present,
    system =&gt; true,
  }

  user { $minecraft::user:
    ensure     =&gt; present,
    gid        =&gt; $minecraft::group,
    home       =&gt; $minecraft::install_dir,
    managehome =&gt; true,
    system     =&gt; true,
    require    =&gt; Group[$minecraft::group],
  }

  # Ensures deletion of install_dir does not break module, setup for plugins
  $dirs = [$minecraft::install_dir, "${minecraft::install_dir}/plugins"]

  file { $dirs:
    ensure  =&gt; directory,
    owner   =&gt; $minecraft::user,
    group   =&gt; $minecraft::group,
    require =&gt; User[$minecraft::user],
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This worked well and allowed us to build a lot of automation to manage hundreds of servers when dealing with simple infrastructure components. But like most things, it’s the edge cases that make you feel the pain. Since the Puppet language is a DSL, simple problems started to become big problems. Like, not being able to do a proper for-loop. Or doing string manipulation.</p>
<p>Most configuration languages suffer from these problems. In the end, you will also probably get in a situation where you need to extend them to cover a specific use case, and usually, it’s at this point that you will need to write real code. There is only so much you can do without writing in “real” languages, so we should have probably done it from the start. Looking back, probably Chef would have been a much better choice. At least with it, a lot of the things learned there could have been applied to other aspects of my career (Chef uses ruby instead of their own DSL). I don’t have a lot of experience with Ansible or with Salt, but I feel they suffer from the same shortcomings and have similar strong points.</p>
<p>A somewhat distinct category in the configuration language space is Terraform and AWS Cloud Formation. They both borrow from the legacy of configuration management systems and try to sync their internal view of how things should look with reality. The main difference, outside of the way you express intent (which is still using DSL and not full fledge languages), is that they’re designed to work at the cloud provider level.</p>
<p>Just as Puppet and Chef are very good at managing typical resources on a machine (service, package, config file), Terraform and AWS Cloud Formation are very good at managing cloud services. They were built with the notion of cloud infrastructure. This doesn’t mean that you can’t do the same thing with Puppet, Chef, and the rest of the gen2 configuration languages. You can, but due to how fast they adapted to the cloud reality, how they tried to monetize the cloud, and so on, Terraform became the uncontested king of DSL based cloud infrastructure management, while Cloud Formation reigned in AWS land.</p>
<p>All these tools adopted the best parts from CFEngine, the most important being the notion of convergent state. They would take your expressed intent, compare it to the machine, figure out any dependencies and order of steps that will bring the resources to its desired state. They usually also involve a compilation stage where they map the DSL to inner logic and create an execution plan. This would also catch basic mistakes. These are good ideas that have battle-proven and are now the default way of dealing with infrastructure.</p>
<p>As we move forward, however, fundamental shifts are happening in the way we consume and deal with infrastructure components. Now you can leverage AWS services. You can build a very complex application that uses CloudFront for static content distribution, API gateway with Lambda to build API routes and add business functionality to them. Identity management can be handled by Cognito. On the backend, these Lambda functions can interact with an entire ecosystem of infrastructure directly, like RDS or DynamoDB. You can interact with analytics systems via Redshift or display visualized data via QuickSight. Background tasks can be handled by Lambda as well, workflows driven with step functions, async batch, and ETL tasks using AWS EMR or Glue. Composing these to achieve significant business value can be done with relatively little glue code as AWS services are very well integrated together.</p>
<p>New classes of applications are emerging that try to better adapt to this landscape. One example is what AWS labeled as serverless. Provisioning these types of apps using Terraform or Cloud Formation can lead to a lot of friction. In such a tightly integrated model, your infrastructure will evolve with your application, so this probably needs to be one of the most …</p></div></div>

<p>I had a fun little experience over the past few days. Someone had ordered Domino’s in the UK and seemingly typed in my email address by accident. This gave me the privilege of receiving daily emails from Domino’s promoting their latest deal. The first few days it was novel and interesting seeing what was popular across the pond but this morning I decided I might as well unsubscribe.</p>

<amp-img src="/assets/static/images/dominos-pre-vpn.png" alt="Domino's marketing page without VPN" width="1297" height="185" layout="responsive"></amp-img>

<p>Lo and behold the unsubscribe link didn’t work. Rather than a web page I got a friendly server error indicating “Access Denied” and that I did not have permission to access the unsubscribe page. My suspicion that this was a result of Domino’s blocking access to the site turned out to be true since I was able to unsubscribe using a VPN.</p>

<p>What a wild world. Rather than supporting a global unsubscribe Domino’s has a geofenced site for the UK that just blocks access outside the country (just try going to https://www.dominos.co.uk/ outside the UK). I don’t know what sort of anti-spam laws this violates (am I now <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business">$43,280</a> richer?) but it’s ridiculous that I was not able to unsubscribe from Domino’s email without resorting to a VPN.</p>

<p>The lesson here is that if you live outside the Uk and want to bother someone - sign them up for an account on the Domino’s UK site.</p>

                <p>Good product managers take the lead in selecting the problems they solve for their team and organization.</p><p>As a young PM, a lot of what you work on will be decided by your manager or other stakeholders. But as you mature in the product management role, you should pro-actively start owning the decision to choose the <em>problems that you work on</em>.</p><p>Last month, I finalized the themes (and problems) that I will focus on in 2021. With every passing year, I try to make better, more logical, more meaningful, and exciting choices. To make this selection process objective, I measure each opportunity against the below.</p><ol><li>Business impact - the higher the better.</li><li>New learning involved - new knowledge is a massive motivation for me.</li><li>Improvement vs innovation - a healthy mix is required. A mix with more emphasis on innovation is more appealing for me.</li><li>Difficulty level - solving difficult problems keeps me on my toes and hence motivated.</li></ol><p>We might not always get to work on what we want, but the goal is to have enough items that meet our criterion and keep us motivated throughout the year.</p>

										The Rise and Fall of Getting Things Done									</a>

								</h5>
								
								<p>
									Takeaways
								</p>
								<div>
									<ul>
<li><span>“In the nineteen-nineties, the spread of e-mail had transformed knowledge work. With nearly all friction removed from professional communication, anyone could bother anyone else at any time.” — Cal Newport</span></li>
<li><span>Cal references David Allen and his book “</span><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=QHFss5ZqVH&amp;rank=1"><span>Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity</span></a><span>,” where David talks about a theory on how our minds work that suggests when we try to keep track of obligations in our heads, we create “open loops” that make us anxious.&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><span>“If we could avoid worrying about what we were supposed to be doing, we could focus more fully on what we were actually doing, achieving what Allen called a “mind like water.” — Cal Newport</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Cal also notes the late Peter Drucker (who wrote over 39 books) with how predicted in the mid 1950s how work/productivity would change in the future. “Drucker predicted that corporate profits would depend on mental effort, and that each individual knowledge worker, possessing skills too specialized to be broken down into “repetitive, simple, mechanical motions” choreographed from above, would need to decide how to “apply his knowledge as a professional” and monitor his own productivity.”</span></li>
<li><span>It’s important to not attach your identity to your productivity. Or as Cal mentions, “Productivity, we must recognize, can never be entirely personal. It must be connected to a system that we can study, analyze, and improve.”</span></li>
<li><span>Your days should be structured in such a way that you can spend most of your time focussed on the autonomous, creative, skilled work that Drucker identified as so crucial to growing our economy, Cal adds.</span></li>
<li><span>For teams/companies, Cal asks such a simple question and solution that I think gets glossed over sometimes and especially now that we’re all mostly remote. “What if you began each morning with a status meeting in which your team confronts its task board? A plan could then be made about which handful of things each person would tackle that day. Instead of individuals feeling besieged and resentful—about the additional tasks that similarly overwhelmed colleagues are flinging their way—they could execute a collaborative plan designed to benefit everyone.”</span></li>
</ul>
								</div>
								<p><img src="https://gradually.co/wp-content/themes/gradually/img/two-cents.png">
								</p><!-- end half sqaure arrow -->
								<p><span>I’ve always felt that my productivity has never been top-notch-allstar-level quality. However, my only comparison is my perceived productivity of other people. Those same people, I have no clue whether or not they are struggling just as much as me or if they have a team of help. Productivity is such a weird, but cool space. The humanness of it is very real. </span></p>

<p><span>We all carry an anecdote to share about how stress is affecting our sleep patterns, making us feel irritable, moody or even neglected at times.

<p><span>There is also this other kind of stress, a bad one, that sustains over a length of time called chronic stress. This type hammers you daily, and eventuates when you’re in situations like having a heated argument with our closed ones, when you overwork or when you’re at risk of losing your job.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This low-key stress can trigger the release of all sorts of hormones that can wreak havoc on our physiological functioning. They can give you racing heart, shallow breathing, muscle tension&nbsp; and even slow down the digestive process.</span></p>
<p><span>In fact, these physiological responses are actually part of our survival mechanism called the <a href="https://www.psychologytools.com/resource/fight-or-flight-response/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘fight or flight’ response</a> (also known as the acute stress response) that lets us decide whether we stay and deal with a dangerous situation or to run away to safety. However, when the stress gets chronic and our immune system activates this response too often, it takes its toll on us.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>How Stress Affects The Brain</strong></h3>
<p><span>Chronic stress affects the overall structure of the brain, including size, and its functionality. The damage is discernible right down to the level of genes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Stress originates from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93adrenal_axis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hypothalamic pituitary adrenal</a> (HPA) axis. The HPA axis is our central stress response unit slathered with a series of intertwined channels that connect the brain and the endocrine system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>During a stressful situation, the brain signals our HPA axis <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4263906/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to release a hormone called cortisol</a>, which procures glucose and fatty acids from the liver to prime your body with the energy required to face challenges lying ahead.</span></p>
<p><span>However, if the HPA axis keeps secreting cortisol for an extended period, the elevated levels of cortisol can inflict damage to your brain.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, when you’re under stress, the activity and synaptic connections in the amygdala, the part of the brain that induces aggression or fear, increase. And as the levels of cortisol continue to rise, the electrical rhythms in the hippocampus, the part of the brain’s limbic system associated with emotion, learning, memories formation, and stress control, get disturbed which in turn deteriorate its performance.</span></p>
<!-- Quick Adsense WordPress Plugin: http://quickadsense.com/ -->


<p><span>The hippocampus also suppresses the activity of the HPA axis. Enfeeblement of the HPA axis would lead to your ability to cope with stress being compromised. Furthermore, surge in cortisol levels can cause your brain to literally shrink in size as a result of loss of synapses between neurons; it can also cause your <a href="https://www.thescienceofpsychotherapy.com/prefrontal-cortex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prefrontal cortex&nbsp; (or PFC)</a> to shrink.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The prefrontal cortex covers the front part of the brain. This region of the brain has been implicated in making executive functions, which include things like concentration, self-control, decision-making, social interaction and problem-solving.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Shrinkage in the prefrontal cortex means </span><span>you won’t be as proficient in carrying out certain tasks as you were. </span><span>The damage doesn’t end here, though. Chronically high levels of cortisol have also been shown to slow down the process of neurogenesis – making of new neurons – in the hippocampus.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So it’s evident that if fewer cells are being made in the hippocampus, you would be going through a rough patch trying to learn new skills or remember things. Also, even worse, chronic stress has been shown to accelerate the onset of serious mental disorders like depression, Alzheimer’s and other related forms of dementia.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>The Effect of Stress On Your Genes</strong></h3>
<p><span>The effects of stress </span><span>go right down to the brain’s DNA. Or, let’s say </span><span>– your childhood experiences, or how you were raised – can influence changes in your brains down to the level of genetics.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A <a href="https://www.salk.edu/news-release/early-developmental-experiences-influence-dna-in-the-adult-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study at Salk Institute for Biological Studies</a> in 2018 showed that the amount of care a mouse pup receives from its mother plays a substantial role on how effectively the pup copes with stress later in adulthood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The offspring of more-attentive mice grew up to be calm adults because their brains developed more cortisol receptors, hence were less sensitive to stressful situations. And the pups raised by less-attentive mice grew up to be more sensitive to stress throughout life.</span></p>
<p><span>This dissimilarity in offspring raised by different mothers is not at all genetics, it’s epigenetics, meaning no change in genetic code is involved although the upbringing alters the way <a href="https://sparkonit.com/2018/03/10/genes-express-themselves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the genes are expressed</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>The experiment also found that these epigenetic changes can be reversed when moms are swapped. A week of nurturing is all it takes for the mother mouse to establish these changes in pup’s epigenomes. Surprisingly these epigenetic changes can be passed down through generations, they found.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Stress isn’t inherently evil. It has been wired with us since the dawn of our evolution. But if you ever feel like you’re being overpowered by these ruthless pressures of life, set up a strategy to subdue your stress, before it subdues you.</span></p>
<p><span>There are many ways to deal with stress. Of those, the most effective are exercise and meditation. These two inventions have been shown to <a href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2019.33.1_supplement.581.1#:~:text=Studies%20have%20shown%20meditation%20or,tested%20in%20college%E2%80%90aged%20adults." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reverse the effect of cortisol</a> on the stressed brain and eventually invigorates the full functionality of the hippocampus, thus improving your memory in the process. <a href="https://sparkonit.com/2016/05/09/looking-trees-helps-reduce-psychological-stress-even-crowded-places/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spending time in nature</a>, listening to music, and laughing out loud just about have <a href="https://sparkonit.com/2017/05/15/7-simple-tips-reduce-stress-right-now-according-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the same effect</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Happy lunar new year! Today I would like to share my experience of learning Haskell. It’s been a really long journey but a really wonderful one.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Back in 2000, I was an undergraduate student majoring in computer science. At that time, I was into system programming and enjoyed learning low-level implementation details of operating systems and system applications. My primary language was C and programmed all programming assignments in C. I was proud that I understood how my code was compiled and executed on the machine.</p>
<p>One day my friend told me about <em>Haskell</em>. I wasn’t interested in functional programming at that time, but I became curious because he enthusiastically persuaded me to learn Haskell. I ended up reading two books on Haskell.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.haskellcraft.com/craft3e/Home.html">Haskell: the Craft of Functional Programming</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/hudak/SOE/">The Haskell School of Expression</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both books were really nice and I learned I could program in an entirely different way. However, I wasn’t sure if Haskell could solve the real-world problems I wanted to solve. So my interest in Haskell stopped there.</p>

<p>My first job was mainly about porting and optimizing Java Virtual Machine for embedded systems. My company licensed Sun’s CDC JVM and I was responsible for maintaining it.</p>
<p>It was 2002 and Linux was still a luxury for embedded systems. RTOSes such as pSOS and VxWorks were popular on STBs and I ported JVM to these OSes. These RTOSes didn’t have distinctions between kernel and user space and an application was linked statically with the kernel and ran as a single (kernel) process application on the device.</p>
<p>The implication was profound. I had no safety guarantee provided by modern operating systems. A bug in an application could corrupt the kernel data and crash the entire system. Moreover, because there were dozens of threads competing for shared resources, race conditions and dead locks were a common place. It took hours or even days to find and fix a trivial bug.</p>
<p>The situation was much better when debugging an application written in Java. Thanks to the safety guarantee of Java, certain types of bugs were impossible. A Java program can’t corrupt memory and crash the system. Dead locks are reported systematically by the JVM. It was relatively fun to fix a bug in Java applications.</p>
<p>These experiences motivated me to find systematic ways of preventing bugs and led me to read Benjamin C. Pierce’s <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/">Types and Programming Languages</a>. It was the best computer science text book I’ve ever read. I understood why types were important in statically typed functional languages like Haskell! If universities had used this book as a undergraduate PL textbook, many of the confusions and misunderstandings about dynamic vs static typing would have disappeared.</p>

<p>By fully understanding the merits of type systems, I started to learn Haskell in a different perspective. I read <a href="https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/index.html">A Gentle Introduction To Haskell</a> and many tutorials on monads. It wasn’t very hard to understand specific instances of monads such as <em>Reader</em>, <em>Writer</em>, <em>State</em>, <em>List</em> and <em>Maybe</em>. But I couldn’t figure out how they were related. I managed to write simple applications in Haskell, but wasn’t confident that I could use Haskell productively because I couldn’t fully understand one of the core ideas of Haskell.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I changed my career and founded a tech start-up in 2008. I built mobile web browsers for the embedded systems. I created a port of <a href="https://webkit.org/">WebKit</a> and hacked various components of WebKit to speed up the performance. The primary means for optimization was to leverage the multi-core CPU and GPU.</p>
<p>WebKit performs lots of tasks concurrently but it is mostly single-threaded. Loading a page does not benefit much from having a multi-core CPU. So I offloaded some tasks to separate threads but I only gained marginal performance benefits in exchange for largely increased complexity. I learned a lesson that I must pay very high costs of complexity to get small benefits of performance boost. Considering the already complex nature of WebKit, I ended up abandoning most of performance optimizations to keep the complexity under control.</p>
<p>While struggling to squeeze performance out of WebKit, I learned Haskell again to get some insights on parallel programming because Haskell was the only programming language which natively supported <em>STM(Software Transaction Memory)</em>. Simon Marlow’s <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000929/index.html">Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell</a> helped me understand how Haskell supported parallel and concurrent programming. Though I learned many valuable lessons from the book, I also felt that the lazy nature of Haskell didn’t go well with parallel programming.</p>

<p>I have spent more than 10 years of my career on embedded systems and increasingly got frustrated with the tools available. So I decided to teach myself Haskell again and use it at work. This time I started to read classic papers on functional programming and Haskell.</p>
<p>Philip Wadler’s <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf">Monads for functional programming</a> clicked my mind and I finally became enlightened. The paper is really well written, but I don’t think I could understand <em>Monad</em> just because I read the paper. Years of trials and errors were necessary to understand abstract concepts like monad. It was the most exciting moment of my long journey to Haskell.</p>
<p>Once I understood how I could learn abstractions, the rest was easy. Now I don’t get discouraged just because I don’t understand abstractions at first glance. It takes time and practice to understand abstract things. I also realized that monad was just the beginning. There exist many Haskell idioms that require other abstract concepts such as <em>applicative functor</em>, <em>arrow</em>, <em>profunctor</em> and so on.</p>
<p>Here is the list of papers I found most enlightening when learning Haskell. I also recommend you read any paper with “Functional Pearl” attached to it.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/fold.pdf">A tutorial on the universality and expressiveness of fold</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pearl.pdf">Monadic Parsing in Haskell</a></li>
<li><a href="http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/POPL96-Modular-interpreters.pdf">Monad Transformers and Modular Interpreters</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~W.Swierstra/Publications/DataTypesALaCarte.pdf">Data types a la carte</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/iterator.pdf">The Essence of the Iterator Pattern</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/edu/seminare/2005/advanced-fp/docs/huet-zipper.pdf">The Zipper</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I was confident that Haskell was a good programming language and I was looking for opportunities to use Haskell in production. Bryan O’Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen’s <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real World Haskell</a> was a good reference in this direction. It showed how I could use Haskell to do my daily work such as networking, system programming, databases and web programming.</p>
<p>Finally, I started to read real-world Haskell code available on the hackage and realized that the <em>Haskell I know</em> was different from the <em>Haskell that is actually used</em>. Real world Haskell uses lots of GHC extensions which makes me feel it is an entirely different language. A typical Haskell module starts with:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{-# LANGUAGE CPP                        #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts           #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE ConstraintKinds            #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances          #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies     #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings          #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes                #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE RecordWildCards            #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE TupleSections              #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies               #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes                 #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE DeriveDataTypeable         #-}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It seems sticking to Haskell 98 or 2000 does not have much practical sense because many Haskell packages already use many GHC extensions. So I learned them too. <a href="https://ocharles.org.uk/blog/posts/2014-12-01-24-days-of-ghc-extensions.html">24 Days of GHC Extensions</a> was a really great way of learning this topic.</p>
<p>I like the approach of <a href="http://www.yesodweb.com/book/haskell">Yesod Web Framework Book</a> which explains the GHC extensions used in the library before explaining how to use the library. This is often the first step to learn a new library for many Haskell programmers. For example, you can’t use <a href="http://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Servant</a> unless you understand <em>DataKinds</em> and <em>TypeOperators</em>. So I encourage Haskell library authors to write more about the GHC extensions they use.</p>
<p>I also found that some packages are essential to use Haskell in practice.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>String</code> type has problems. You need either <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text">text</a> or <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring">bytestring</a> for efficient string data processing.</li>
<li>Lazy IO looks nice, but does not work well in practice. To process streaming data properly you need either <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-4.3.2/docs/Pipes-Tutorial.html">pipes</a> or <a href="https://github.com/snoyberg/conduit#readme">conduit</a>.</li>
<li>You will need a custom monad or monad transformer for your application sooner or later. Either <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl">mtl</a> or <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers">transformers</a> is required.</li>
<li>JSON is a really universal data exchange format these days. <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-1.1.0.0/docs/Data-Aeson.html">aeson</a> will help you here.</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck">QuickCheck</a> is a bonus you get from using Haskell!</li>
</ul>

<p>I founded a small Haskell shop this year and started to use Haskell in production. I realized that using Haskell in production was, surprisingly, easier than learning Haskell. It took me more than 10 years to learn Haskell, but I felt confident that I could use Haskell in production only after a few months of experiments.</p>
<p>There is one thing I would like to emphasize. Using Haskell does not mean that you must understand all the dependencies you use. Haskell programmers tend to care much about the implementation details of their dependencies because Haskell makes it so easy to understand the meaning of programs with types and equational reasoning. But in my opinion, this is a blessed curse.</p>
<p>That’s not how civilization works. You can drive a car without understanding how engines work. Python or JavaScript programmers do not care about the implementation details of their dependencies because it is simply impossible. Haskell is no exception. Time and money are limited. Please don’t spend too much time on understanding things. Spend more time on building things. Be practical.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some library authors provide a high-level overview of their library. <a href="https://www.andres-loeh.de/Servant/servant-wgp.pdf">Type-level Web APIs with Servant</a> is a great example. It explains the core concepts and the implementation techniques of the library without involving accidental complexities of implementation details. I would love to see more papers like this.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stackage.org/">Stackage</a> and the <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">Stack</a> are indispensable tools for using Haskell in production. All the hard work of <a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/">FP Complete</a> gave me confidence that Haskell was …</p></article></div>

<p>You would have done better in school, for starters. Instead of turning in your bed unable to sleep terrified of the exam coming the next day, you would soundly sleep with the knowledge that you know everything you need to know to ace the exam. And ace it you would indeed.</p>

<p>You would have spent fewer hours studying. How many times have you opened the textbook only to find that you’ve forgotten all that you’d studied the day before? If you did not forget things then those hours you spent studying would always amount to something, instead of leaving you feeling like you’re swimming against the current. School might even have been fun if you did not forget.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What would your career look like if you did not forget?</p>

<p>Forgetfulness affects us all. There is no one that has not grappled with this problem before. Our lives would be better if we did not forget.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <span>forgetting is inescapable.</span> There is no such thing as a perfect memory. I am not here to sell you on a magic pill that will turn you into Bradley Cooper in the movie Limitless.</p>

<p>However, that doesn’t mean there aren’t things you can do to massively reduce the speed at which you forget things, because there are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Science has known about what it takes to get memories to stick around in your memory for a long time. It has known about it for a while now, in fact. It’s just that it has done a terrible job so far at making sure that you know about it, you whose life would massively benefit from that knowledge.</p>

<p>My intent for writing this is to correct these wrongs and introduce you to spaced repetition, the more than established method that will put you in control of your memory once and for all, and Anki, the software that will help you do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, let’s start at the beginning: <span> What is spaced repetition?</span></p>

<h2 id="the-centuries-old-science-they-dont-tell-you-about">The Centuries Old Science They Don’t Tell You About</h2>

<p>More than a hundred years ago, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus not only started the scientific study of memory, but he also made its most impactful discovery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After all, what discovery could be more impactful than what makes memories stick?</p>

<p>Ebbinghaus created various lists of nonsense syllables that he had to memorize, and once he was able to mouth off the entire list without making a single mistake he would mark on his calendar the day where he had to memorize that list once more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He would have to memorize some lists the day after, others a week and some a whole month after he had first memorized them. Doesn’t sound much fun, does it? This is especially true when you take into account each list must have taken him quite a long time to memorize since by design each of the three-letter syllables he had to study had been chosen so that they weren’t easily remembered. For example, the syllable BOL was out of the question as Ebbinghaus could instead use BALL to recall it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the requisite time had passed, to measure the extent to which he had forgotten the list he’d spent so much time memorizing, he memorized the same list once more. Not only did he have to sit still in his office for a long time trying to memorize a bunch of nonsense words once, he had to do it twice! Throughout his second attempt he did have some help since it would take him less time to memorize the list the second time around if he remembered it from his first foray cramming it into his memory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If by that point he’d already forgotten it, then it would take him at least as much time to memorize the list the second time as it had the first. However, if some memory of it still lingered in the confines of his mind, he would be able to go through the list faster than before. By varying the amount of time between each attempt, and seeing how that influenced how long it took him then to memorize the list the second time, <span>Ebbinghaus was able to measure the effect time had on his memory.</span></p>

<p>And what an effect it had.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first thing he noticed was that memories are at their most fragile when they are still young. From the data he’d collected, he could see that the bulk of forgetting happens in the few moments after the memory is created. Rather than forgetting happening at a linear pace over time, each day that passes nicking a constant amount of the vitality of a memory until it is completely forgotten, Ebbinghaus discovered <span>forgetting happens rather rapidly at first but slows down afterward.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>In the first few hours of its life, it’s as if your newly created memory has jumped out of a flying airplane and is now free-falling through the sky, the wind buffeting its face violently as it quickly loses altitude. As the ground becomes uncomfortably close, our memory activates its parachute and begins to glide, still falling, of course, but much slower than it was when it first jumped out of the plane.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Now, to be sure, <span>the forgetting curve,</span> as this discovery came to be called, is an important landmark in the scientific study of memory, but it’s not a particularly useful one. We forget things over time; what a discovery! You don’t need to be a top-level scientist to come to that conclusion. It’s why we’re here in the first place!</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b79bb8c6906d331e07905d708043194c5288a3bd/e385a/assets/images/agentleintroductiontoanki/forgettingcurve_alternative.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p> Behold, my superlative drawing skills!</p>
<p>But Ebbinghaus didn’t stop there.
&nbsp;
When he first started learning his lists of nonsense syllables, Ebbinghaus, like many a student, crammed all his studying in a single furious session. But then, possibly because he was fed up with all the cramming, he hit upon the idea of spreading his learning over time. Instead of spending the majority of a day learning one of his lists, he spaced out his learning over a few days. <span>What he found when he did so is the most important discovery about memory that no one ever told you about.</span></p>

<p>You would think not much would change if instead of studying a bunch of material in one day you did so over three or more days. But what Ebbinghaus found was that not only did his memory get stronger, but it also took him less time to memorize his lists. This meant that <span>simply by changing when he studied, Ebbinghaus could have the best of both worlds: a better memory with less time spent studying.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>It need not be pointed out how important a discovery this is. If someone came up to you and told you about a revolutionary studying method that would not only cut the time you spent studying but also get you to retain the things you learn for longer, you would think you were being sold on some sort of scam.</p>

<p>Yet <span>the spacing effect,</span> as Ebbinghaus’ discovery is called, is far from being a scam. It is <span>one of the most scientifically supported discoveries in the entire field of psychology.</span></p>

<p>The gist of the spacing effect is rather simple. Given the choice between massing all your studying or spacing it out over a period of time, you are better served by spacing it out. <span>There is no catch. It really is that simple.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>This means if you are a student and you have an exam coming up a month from now, you should start studying now rather than waiting until a single week is left. If, for example, you’re going to spend 50 hours studying, then spreading those hours over the whole month, ensuring that you get re-exposed to the material in sufficiently spaced intervals, would get you much better results than you would if you crammed those 50 hours in a single stress-filled and coffee-fueled week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, that’s easier said than done.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>The spacing effect is one of the most important weapons a learner can have on his arsenal</span> but knowing about its amazing effects does not mean that we will necessarily apply it. After all, we all know not to eat too many processed foods do we not? Yet, that doesn’t seem to stop many of us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pulling an all-nighter to cram for an exam is like binging on a sugar-filled pastry when one is trying to lose weight, yet the fact it continues to be a staple learning strategy of many a student is a testament to how difficult it can be to embrace the lessons of the spacing effect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If only there were an app for that…</p>

<h2 id="this-app-will-turn-your-memory-into-a-superpower">This App Will Turn Your Memory Into A Superpower</h2>

<p>One hundred years ago Ebbinghaus didn’t have a computer, let alone a smartphone. If he’d had them they would have taken care of the task of spacing what he had to learn for him. Instead, he had to do all of that himself, though if we consider that he was the kind of guy that did not balk at the idea of spending hundreds of hours learning endless lists of nonsense, perhaps he wasn’t that fazed by it.</p>

<p>Thankfully, today we have tools that manage all of that for us.</p>

<p><span> And it all starts with a simple flashcard.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Everyone knows how a flashcard is supposed to work. You write something on the front, then something on the back, and then you’re supposed to recall what it was that you wrote on the back after reading what’s on the front.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suppose that in the process of studying for a coming exam, you wrote many of these flashcards. You have a big pile of them sitting on your desk and within them are all the things you have to know if you want to ace that exam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because you know about the spacing effect, you know that cramming those flashcards is a bad strategy, but then how are you supposed to space them out? There are so many cards to keep track of…</p>

<p><span>What    if those flashcards existed on your computer instead?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>If that were possible, then the computer could take care of the task of keeping track when you’re supposed to review your flashcards and you could focus solely on the things that matter, which, in this case, is answering your flashcards correctly and acing that exam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Which is why spaced repetition software was invented: to take care of all the grunt work so you can easily add spaced repetition into your life.</p>

<p>At its core, all spaced repetition software does is keep track of when to present you with the material that you put in it. It’s called spaced repetition software because they use special algorithms to calculate the optimal interval between when you last reviewed the material and …</p></div></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>And by doing that, researchers have observed in many parts of the world that IQ increased from generation to generation. This was called the ‘Flynn effect’, in reference to the American psychologist who described this phenomenon.
</p><p>But recently, this trend began to reverse in several countries.</p><p>It is true that the IQ is strongly affected by factors such as the health system, the school system, nutrition….</p><p>But if we take countries where socioeconomic factors have been fairly stable for decades, the ‘Flynn effect’ has started to wane.</p><p>In these countries, “digital natives” are the first children to have a lower IQ than their parents. It is a trend that has been documented in Norway, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, France, etc.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to determine the specific role of each factor, including for example pollution (especially early exposure to pesticides) or exposure to screens.</p><p>What we know for sure is that even if a child’s screen time is not the only culprit, it has a significant effect on IQ.</p><div>
<p><img data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Why-Mexico-is-one-of-the-countries-with-the-most.gif" alt="" el="" tiempo="" que="" se="" pasa="" ante="" una="" pantalla="" por="" motivos="" recreativos="" retrasa="" la="" maduración="" anatómica="" y="" funcional="" del="" cerebro"",="" source:="" ,="" source="" description:="" image:="" "="" data-lazy-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png"></p>

<p>Several studies have shown that when the use of television or video games increases, IQ and cognitive development decrease.</p>
<p>The main foundations of our intelligence are affected: language, concentration, memory, culture (defined as a body of knowledge that helps us organize and understand the world).</p>
<p>Ultimately, these impacts lead to a significant drop in academic performance.</p>
<p><strong>And why does the use of digital devices cause all that? </strong></p>
<p>The causes are also clearly identified: decrease in the quality and quantity of intrafamily interactions, which are fundamental for the development of language and emotional development; decrease in time devoted to other more enriching activities (homework, music, art, reading, etc.); sleep disruption, which is quantitatively shortened and qualitatively degraded; overstimulation of attention, leading to disorders of concentration, learning and impulsivity; Intellectual under-stimulation, which prevents the brain from unfolding its full potential; and an excessive sedentary lifestyle that, in addition to bodily development, influences brain maturation.</p>
<p><strong>What exactly damage do screens do to the neurological system? </strong></p>
<p>The brain is not a ‘stable’ organ. Its ‘final’ characteristics depend on experience.</p>
<p>The world in which we live, the challenges we face, modify both the structure and its functioning, and some regions of the brain specialize, some networks are created and strengthened, others are lost, some become thicker and others thinner.</p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>Time spent in front of a screen for recreational reasons has been observed to delay anatomical and functional maturation of the brain within various cognitive networks related to language and attention.</p>
<p>It must be emphasized that not all activities feed the construction of the brain with the same efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean? </strong></p>
<p>Activities related to school, intellectual work, reading, music, art, sports, etc. they have a much greater structuring and nourishing power to the brain than recreational screens.</p>
<p>But nothing lasts forever. The potential for brain plasticity is extreme during childhood and adolescence. Afterwards, it begins to fade. It doesn’t go away, but it becomes much less efficient.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Why-Mexico-is-one-of-the-countries-with-the-most.gif" alt="" cuando="" se="" pone="" una="" pantalla="" en="" manos="" de="" un="" niño="" o="" adolescente,="" casi="" siempre="" prevalecen="" los="" usos="" recreativos="" más="" empobrecedores"",="" source:="" ,="" source="" description:="" image:="" "="" data-lazy-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970619_593_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970619_593_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png"></p>

<p>The brain can be compared to a plasticine. At first, it is wet and easy to sculpt. But over time it becomes drier and much more difficult to mold.</p>
<p>The problem with recreational screens is that they alter the development of our children’s brain and impoverish it.</p>
<p><strong>Are all screens equally harmful? </strong></p>
<p>Nobody says that the “digital revolution” is bad and should be stopped. I myself spend a good part of my working day with digital tools. And when my daughter entered elementary school, I started teaching her how to use some office software and looking for information on the internet.</p>
<p>Should students be taught fundamental computer skills and tools? Clear. Likewise, can digital technology be a relevant tool in the pedagogical arsenal of teachers? Of course, if it is part of a structured educational project and if the use of a certain software effectively promotes transmission.</p>
<p>However, when a screen is placed in the hands of a child or adolescent, the most impoverishing recreational uses almost always prevail.</p>
<p>This includes, in order of importance: television, which remains the number one screen of all ages (movies, series, clips, etc.); then video games (mainly action and violent), and finally, around adolescence, a frenzy of useless self-exposure on social media.</p>
<p><strong>How much time do children and young people usually spend in front of screens? </strong></p>
<p>On average, nearly three hours a day for 2-year-olds, about five hours for 8-year-olds, and more than seven hours for teens.</p>
<figure>
<figure id=""><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_55_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.jpg" alt="baby using screen" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_55_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.jpg"><figcaption>A 2-year-old child spends almost three hours a day in front of screens. on average.

</figcaption></figure>
<p>This means that before reaching 18 years of age, our children will have spent the equivalent of 30 school years in front of recreational screens or, if you prefer, 16 years of full-time work!
</p>
<p>It is simply insane and irresponsible.</p>
<p><strong>How much time should children spend on recreational screens? </strong></p>
<p>Involving children is important.</p>
<p>They need to be told that recreational screens damage the brain, impair sleep, interfere with language acquisition, weaken academic performance, impair concentration, increase the risk of obesity, etc.</p>
<p>Some studies have shown that it is easier for children and adolescents to follow the rules about screens when their reason for being is explained and discussed with them.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Why-Mexico-is-one-of-the-countries-with-the-most.gif" alt="" involucrar="" a="" los="" niños="" es="" importante.="" necesitan="" que="" se="" les="" diga="" las="" pantallas="" recreativas="" dañan="" el="" cerebro,="" perjudican="" sueño,="" interfieren="" con="" la="" adquisición="" del="" lenguaje"",="" source:="" ,="" source="" description:="" image:="" "="" data-lazy-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_943_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_943_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png"></p>

<p>From there, the general idea is simple: at any age, the least is the best.</p>
<p>Beyond this general rule, more specific guidelines can be provided based on the child’s age. Before the age of 6, the ideal is not to have screens (which does not mean that from time to time you cannot watch cartoons with your children).</p>
<p>The earlier they are exposed, the greater the negative impacts and the risk of subsequent excessive consumption.</p>
<p>From 6 years of age, if the contents are adapted and sleep is maintained, it can go up to half an hour a day, even an hour, without an appreciable negative influence.</p>
<p>Other relevant rules: no screens in the morning before going to school, nothing at night before going to bed or when with other people. And, above all, no screens in the bedroom.</p>
<p>But it’s hard to tell our kids that screens are a problem when we, as parents, are constantly connected to our smartphones or game consoles.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Why-Mexico-is-one-of-the-countries-with-the-most.gif" alt="" reglas="" relevantes:="" nada="" de="" pantallas="" por="" la="" mañana="" antes="" ir="" a="" escuela,="" noche="" irse="" cama...="" ¡sobre="" todo!="" en="" el="" dormitorio"",="" source:="" ,="" source="" description:="" image:="" "="" data-lazy-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_123_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_123_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png"></p>

<p><strong>Why are many parents unaware of the dangers of screens? </strong></p>
<p>Because the information given to parents is partial and biased. The mainstream media is rife with unsubstantiated claims, misleading propaganda, and inaccurate information. The discrepancy between media content and scientific reality is often disturbing, if not infuriating.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to say that the media is dishonest: separating the wheat from the chaff is not easy, even for honest and conscientious journalists.</p>
<p>But not surprising. The digital industry generates billions of dollars in profits each year. And, obviously, children and adolescents are a very lucrative resource.</p>
<p>And for companies worth billions of dollars, it is easy to find complacent scientists, dedicated lobbyists and enthusiastic traders of doubts.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example.</p>
<figure>
<figure id=""><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_781_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.jpg" alt="boy playing video games" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970620_781_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.jpg"><figcaption>Digital companies hire experts to explain how smart gamers are and how good it is to play video games. (Photo: Tomohiro Ohsumi / Getty Images)</figcaption></figure><figcaption>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>Recently a psychologist, supposedly an expert in video games, explained in various media that these games had positive effects, that they should not be demonized, that not playing could even be a handicap for the future of a child, that the most violent games could have therapeutic actions and be able to quench anger in players, etc.</p>
<p>The problem is that none of the journalists who interviewed this “expert” mentioned that he worked for the video game industry. And this is just one example among the many that are described in my book.</p>
<p>This is not something new: it happened in the past with tobacco, global warming, pesticides, sugar, etc.</p>
<p>But I think there is room for hope. Over time, reality becomes increasingly difficult to deny.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Why-Mexico-is-one-of-the-countries-with-the-most.gif" alt="" en="" una="" investigación="" se="" entregaron="" consolas="" de="" juegos="" a="" niños="" que="" iban="" bien="" la="" escuela.="" después="" 4="" meses,="" descubrió="" pasaban="" más="" tiempo="" jugando="" y="" menos="" haciendo="" tareas"",="" source:="" ,="" source="" description:="" image:="" "="" data-lazy-src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970621_226_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png" src="https://thestateindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603970621_226_Digital-Natives-Children-with-Lower-IQs-Than-Their-Parents.png"></p>

<p><strong>There are studies that affirm, for example, that video games help to obtain better academic results … </strong></p>
<p>Let me put it frankly: that’s sheer nonsense.</p>
<p>That idea is a true masterpiece of propaganda. It is mainly based on a few isolated studies with rotten data, which are published in secondary journals and are often contradicted.</p>
<p>In an interesting experimental investigation, game consoles were given to children who were doing well in school. After four months, they were found to spend more time playing games and less time doing homework. Their grades dropped about 5% (which is a lot in just four months!).</p>
<p>In another study, children had to learn a list of words. An hour later, some were allowed to play a car racing video game. Two hours later they went to bed.</p>

</figure>
<p>The next morning, the children who did not play recalled about 80% of the lesson compared to 50% of the players.
</p>
<p>The authors found that playing interfered with sleep and memorization.</p>
<p><strong>How </strong><strong>believe to be</strong><strong>members of</strong><strong> this digital generation </strong><strong>when </strong><strong>become adults? </strong></p>
<p>I often hear that digital natives know “differently.” The idea is that although they show linguistic, attention and knowledge deficits, they are very good at “other things”.</p>
<p>The question lies in the definition of those “other things”.</p>
<p>Various studies indicate that, in contrast to common beliefs, they are not very good with computers.</p>
<p>A report from the European Union even explains that their low digital competence hinders the adoption of educational technologies in schools.</p>
<p>Other studies also indicate that they are not very efficient at processing and understanding the vast amount of information available on the internet.</p>

When I was younger, whenever I came across books like <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/rich-dad-poor-dad/" target="_blank" aria-label="Rich Dad Poor Dad (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rich Dad Poor Dad</a>, I thought that by just reading what’s written inside I will magically become a millionaire. Or, by studying the lessons presented in <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/" target="_blank" aria-label="The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a>, I will transform into a successful business owner who is not holding any sabotaging habits. After all, these books always came with a step-by-step framework that I diligently followed. And while didn’t come close to becoming an ultra-rich entrepreneur, like these titles promised, how my life turned out eventually, which is not bad at all, is thanks to my reading habit.</em></p>



<p>I actually used to despise reading. My parents were constantly shoving books in my face and forcing me to read literature that didn’t even interest me closely. </p>



<p>The books I had to read according to my folks during my teenage years were either part of my school curriculum or titles that were famous years ago. Of course, like every self-respecting teenager trying to look cool, I rebelled against these rules and did the only thing I could – I stopped reading altogether.</p>



<p>Somewhere deep down though, I knew that reading was good, but spending my time studying historical novels related to my country, or fact-heavy encyclopedia-like hardcovers didn’t seem practical to me.</p>



<p>Probably it’s because I grew up playing video games, or because my brother and I collected choose-your-own-adventure type of books when we were younger. But I always assumed that I should get some sort of outcome when I was reading a book. A book should help me learn a skill, conquer a territory, slave a dragon, and in way level up.</p>



<p>Sadly, this wasn’t the case with the novels that the school system imposed on me. These books were only throwing isolated facts that were not related to my existence here and now. That’s why I was careless about literature when I was a teenager.</p>



<p>Fortunately, later in my life, I re-evaluate my relationship with the libraries.</p>



<p>Things changed when I found out about the existence of the applied psychology category. At least that’s how the libraries of my country label the self-help genre. I was thrilled. Books that can help you master a skill? It sounded magical. </p>



<p>That’s when I found titles like <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/think-and-grow-rich/" target="_blank" aria-label="Think and Grow Rich (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Think and Grow Rich</a>, <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/influence/" target="_blank" aria-label="Influence (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Influence</a>, <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/outwitting-the-devil/" target="_blank" aria-label="Outwitting the Devil (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outwitting the Devil</a>, and similar mind-transforming hardcovers. To me, these books looked like volumes full of spells – filled with practical advice that can change your life when you apply them.</p>



<p>That’s when my reading journey began. </p>



<p>To this date, I’ve probably read more than 150 books. 100 of these titles are carefully categorized and summarized <a href="https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/" target="_blank" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> on my site.</p>



<p>I learned a lot from these books in terms of skills and know-how. But I also learned something that I believe is more valuable – how to approach reading. </p>



<p>When I first started reading, I picked the books that were in front of me – sort to speak. I always grabbed the most talked-about books, thinking, that they hold all the answers in the world.</p>



<p>Now, I know that the best-sellers section doesn’t include the finest titles. Also, I know that reading alone, or reading piles of books, is only half of the battle. I spend a lot of time before I decide what I should read. My approach to books and what titles I should read is completely transformed. But most importantly, I do my best to implement what’s mentioned in the titles I read.</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll share with you 10 thoughts after reading 100 books. The goal is not only to help you become a better reader and better book-picker, but also to share with you some insights about how books can change you for the better.</p>



<p>So, here are 10 things I learned from reading and later <a aria-label="summarizing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://durmonski.com/private/summarizing-books/" target="_blank">summarizing</a> 100 books.</p>







<h2 id="0-10-thoughts-from-reading-100-books-">10 Thoughts from Reading 100 Books </h2>





<h3 id="1-1-best-selling-books-are-usually-crap">1. Best-Selling Books are Usually Crap</h3>



<p>This is not entirely true of course.</p>



<p>There are a lot of exceptions. For example, books like <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/atomic-habits/" target="_blank" aria-label="Atomic Habits (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomic Habits</a> or <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/the-laws-of-human-nature/" target="_blank" aria-label="The Laws of Human Nature (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Laws of Human Nature</a> are nice examples of how good work pays off and how word-of-mouth has the power to bring good literature into the hands of millions of people.</p>



<p>But in general, best-selling books are created with the wrong initiatives.</p>



<p>As strange as it might sound, the usefulness of the content for the authors of best-sellers is not the most important thing in a book – it’s the desire to make money. What I found out is that they usually grab a bunch of blog posts from their site, put them in one place, and call it a book. This means that the content is absent from real meaningful research. You’re basically paying (not always, but a lot of times) for content that’s already free but this time it’s on paper.</p>



<p>Most best-selling self-help books are full of vague conclusions, offer no value whatsoever, and can be summarized in the following sentence: “You can do it!”</p>



<p>Why they are successful then?</p>



<p>If you trace back the wide success of these popular books, you’ll spot that the author is someone who has a large online audience. And when you have a network of people who are following you online, the success of your book is guaranteed.</p>



<p>Also, if the above is true, the publisher will invest a lot of funds to market the book. This basically means that the success of the book relies on the large email list and social media following of the author – the distribution channels – not on the actual content.</p>



<p>Therefore, such books, best-selling books, should be approached with caution.</p>







<h3 id="2-2-read-foundational-books-often-mentioned-in-the-bibliography-section">2. Read Foundational Books – Often Mentioned in The Bibliography Section</h3>



<p>I used to skip the bibliography section of the books I read. You know, the part in the back of the book where the author lists the titles he used in the creation of his work or such that somehow influenced his project.</p>



<p>Now, I can’t wait to check this section so I can add new additions to my to-read list.</p>



<p>Once you spend enough time investigating in this rarely explored section of the back of the books, you spot patterns. You see how the same titles are cited again and again.</p>



<p>And once you read some of these books, you get to see why they are so frequently mentioned in the corner of the most successful books that are full of vague action tips – because these rarely-mentioned by big sites books are the real deal. They are full of insights and valuable thinking patterns that can change the way you approach life.</p>



<p>For example, if you want to increase your productivity, you will surely find a lot of self-help books that promise to boost your overall performance. But if you want to <em>get</em> why you procrastinate, really understand why your body is now one with the couch, you should read <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/flow/" target="_blank" aria-label="Flow (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flow</a> by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.</p>



<p>If you want to find meaning in our crazy world and escape the modern dogma of consumerism, you’ll surely stumble on less than favorable titles like The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, or Girl, Wash Your Face. But if you really want to understand how meaning is formed and what does it take to find your course in life, you should read <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/the-evolving-self/" target="_blank" aria-label="The Evolving Self (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Evolving Self</a> by Robert Kegan and/or <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/to-have-or-to-be/" target="_blank" aria-label="To Have or to Be? (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">To Have or to Be?</a> by Erich Fromm.</p>



<p>Sadly, people don’t want to read these books.</p>



<p>They don’t have enough “social status” and sharing them with others won’t inspire a lot of interest from your peers towards you.</p>



<p>It’s kind of like in the tech industry. You know that a regular phone, a device that costs around 500 bucks will do the job perfectly. But no, you want the latest iPhone because this is what people really value and expect to see.</p>



<p>That’s why we spend our time digesting famous books. We are more interested in impressing others when they check our reading list, not so much ourselves.</p>







<h3 id="3-3-good-books-are-usually-hard-to-get">3. Good Books are Usually Hard to Get</h3>



<p>Hard to read, full of words you don’t really understand, these are usually the best books – especially in the field of <a href="https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/philosophy/" target="_blank" aria-label="philosophy (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/psychology-books/" target="_blank" aria-label="psychology (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">psychology</a>.</p>



<p>At first, if you decide to explore such titles, you’ll blame the author for not using simpler words and for not expressing himself better. And if there are long-winded sections where you don’t get what the premise of the idea is, you’ll most probably ditch the book and find something else to read instead.</p>



<p>But these elaborate creations full of complicated phrases are what you need to level up your thinking.</p>



<p>Surely reading a novel where you can predict what will happen next feels good. But real learning comes from books that flex your mind and prompt you to think about the argument the author is making.</p>



<p>This is something I only recently realized. Before, I was cynical about hard to get books. That’s why I rated one of the most cited books poorly – <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/thinking-fast-and-slow/" target="_blank" aria-label="Thinking, Fast and Slow (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a>.</p>



<p>When I read it 2 years ago, I considered it unrelentingly tedious and pretentious. But the book wasn’t the problem, I was.</p>



<p>My assumption was that books have to be easy to get. Now, after reading more than 100 books and summarizing most of them, I know that’s not the case.</p>



<p>A good book doesn’t have to be easy to understand. A good book should make you stop and think about what is said inside. To confuse you and make you re-read the same passage again and again. If the pages inside don’t prompt you to think and even make you feel lost at times, then you’re not reading the proper title.</p>







<h3 id="4-4-figure-out-what-you-want-to-learn-first-then-search-for-a-book">4. Figure Out What You Want to Learn First, Then Search For a Book</h3>



<p>Most people approach reading the wrong way. They don’t think about what they want to learn and master, they simply read books that are in front of them. Best-selling books, or books recommended by their peers.</p>



<p>This approach is fine if you simply want to relax and unwind from your busy day. But if you want to improve in a specific area, you shouldn’t pick the title that’s sitting on the most popular reading list. You should, first, figure out what you want to learn and then go to the library with a clear goal.</p>



<p>That’s usually how we approach pretty much everything in life. We don’t hop online with clear goals in …</p></div></div></div>

November 20, 2020 | https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/haskell202x/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/haskell202x/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Haskell2020 is the long-awaited sequel to Haskell2010 — a formal, prescriptive standard of the Haskell language, that all implementations should adhere to. Today we have two previous standards, Haskell2010 and Haskell98, but neither is particularly in-line with the language as it’s written in this day and age. The aim of Haskell2020 is to bring these older standards in line with the way the language is actually practiced.</p>
<p>Today, there is only one real implementation of Haskell: the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). GHC is a Haskell2010-compliant compiler, but extends Haskell via <em>language extensions</em> — explicitly opt-in features that deviate from the standard. In GHC 8.6.5, there are 125 different language extensions, and <a href="https://gist.github.com/atondwal/ee869b951b5cf9b6653f7deda0b7dbd8">an analysis</a> shows that 10% of Haskell files in the wild enable 10 or more extensions.</p>
<p>All of this is to say that a good chunk of the Haskell being written in the real world <em>is not Haskell2010 compatible.</em> And the situation is only going to get worse.</p>
<p>It might not be immediately evident to you why this is a bad thing. As excellent a piece of software as GHC is, tying our language to a single implementation is unwise and shortsighted. As long as Haskell is defined implicitly by its implementation in GHC, no other implementation has a chance — they will always be forever playing catch-up.</p>
<p>C++ was in a similar situation in the early naughties; the de facto C++ compiler GCC was the only heavy-hitter in town. While it got the job done, it had some pretty terrible ergonomics — so bad that it spun up a cottage industry of attempting to <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/1956/generate-the-longest-error-message-in-c">generate the worst error messages</a>. In 2007, Clang — an alternative industrial-strength compiler — was released, which strove to be compatible with GCC, but also to dramatically improve the ergonomics. This friendly competition has spurred both projects to become significantly better.</p>
<p>And we have seen similar beneficial competition (albeit certainly less friendly) in the Haskell world. Five years ago, Cabal sort-of got the job done for building Haskell projects, but there was this thing called “Cabal Hell” that bit <em>everyone.</em> It got the job done if you knew how it worked, which all the developers did, but the pain was felt by everyone else. Then Stack was released, which elegantly solved Cabal Hell, and <em>just worked.</em> It wasn’t perfect, but my god was it an improvement on the state of the world. In recent memory, Cabal has seen unparalleled improvements in its usability, after languishing for <em>years</em> with respect to usability complaints.</p>
<p>My point? Competition is a good thing, not just for users, but for the health of the ecosystem at large. And by extension, we should look at the status quo of today’s Haskell world with suspicion. And getting a good, prescriptive specification of what Haskell <em>is</em> would go a long way towards alleviating this issue.</p>
<p>So why do I bring all of this up? It’s my impression that the current Haskell2020 efforts are dead in all but name. The <a href="https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-prime/">official mailing list</a> didn’t see any activity for 12 of the last 24 months. Of the months that did see activity, several of their volumes are measured in <em>bytes.</em> At time of writing, the official Haskell2020 website’s certificates are expired, and have been for two weeks.</p>
<p>None of this is meant to demonize the standards committee. But for whatever reason, it’s pretty clear that Haskell2020 is not going to happen in its current incarnation. After all, 2020 is coming up pretty dang soon!</p>
<p>Forgive the melodrama, but I truly believe that this situation is an existential risk for our beloved language and community. There are already well-founded <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/dpr276/what_is_the_status_of_ghc_linear_types/f5yjg67/">murmurings of dissatisfaction</a>, and <em>lots</em> of complaints about the lack of good tooling (though regrettably I can’t find any links right now.)</p>
<p>So what’s the real problem here? As a complete outsider — reading between the lines of discussions I’ve had with a few of the Haskell2020 committee members — my guess is this: <strong>a lack of leadership.</strong> It’s not that the committee members don’t care, it’s that nobody cares <em>sufficiently</em> to overcome the momentum and push the thing through to completion. Furthermore, these people are busy with their own cool projects, and committee work is always a thankless job.</p>
<p>The good news: a lack of leadership is a <em>very easy problem to solve.</em> If you care about this problem, <strong>just take the reigns.</strong> That’s all there is to it. <em>Anyone can do it.</em> Yes, even you, gentle reader! Nobody needs to elevate you to a position of power. There’s no admissions process. You don’t need to be given any <em>authority</em> in order to take the lead here. This is a thing that everybody wants, but there’s a coordination problem, and the only reason it hasn’t been done yet is that nobody has done it.</p>
<p>If you want more assurance about that: as a member of the GHC Steering Committee, <strong>I will personally ratify any reasonable draft standard of Haskell 202x</strong> and vote in favor that GHC adheres to that standard. I have confirmation from at least two other members of the committee that they will also do so.</p>
<p>As a rough estimate, the effort involved in Haskel202x is about half a person-year. Most of that will be spent doing unsexy, administrative things like setting deadlines, cajoling the right people for opinions, and writing a big, boring document. Not a lot of fun, to be sure, but <em>very doable.</em> The only challenge here is to not lose motivation for six months.</p>
<p>Should you still have doubts, I’d like to give another example: the GHC Steering Committee. Despite some (fair) criticisms, all things considered, the Steering Committee is a pretty successful organization. But <em>literally the only reason</em> for that success is Joachim’s unyielding desire for it to succeed. Without his monthly emails reminding everyone of the work to be done, and who is responsible for what, the Committee would collapse in three months. Nobody gave Joachim this responsibility, he just took it and owned it. In my opinion, the entire Haskell community is deeply indebted to Joachim on this front.</p>
<p>If all of this sounds inspiring to you, I urge you to take up the mantle and <em>make this thing happen.</em> It’s the first step towards a much better Haskell world, and it’s an amazingly actionable one. You can help change the world for the better, and we will all be indebted to you when you pull it off.</p>

They're connected to various servers providing data: from the location of a store to your favourite series. And smartphones can be connected to cars as well. This is hardly surprising in our blissful age of connecting everything to everything. But how exactly does it happen?<br></p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec196171971" data-record-type="106" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T004 --><div><div> <div><div field="text"><p>First, we need to understand what <strong>OBD</strong> is, or on-board diagnostics. This is the ability of a vehicle to self-diagnose and report automotive data. As quite a lot of other nice things, OBD systems started to be widely adopted thanks to California. Initially, it was planned to use them for controlling annual emissions, but lack of standardisation hindered the first attempts. Thankfully, this didn't put an end to OBD systems development as manufacturers and repair technicians use them to check vehicle systems. Also, later attempts to control emissions with the help of OBD systems were successful.<br></p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec196172120" data-record-type="239" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T210 --><div><div><div> <div> <div field="descr"><p>On-board diagnostic interface is mandatory for every car model sold in the US since 1996</p></div> </div> <div><div field="text"><p>OBD systems have several standard interfaces, also referred to as high-layer protocols. Most modern vehicles use the OBD-II interface and its equivalents: EOBD in the EU, JOBD in Japan, ADR in Australia. This version of the on-board diagnostic interface is mandatory for every car model sold in the US since 1996 in efforts to control annual emissions. It's only required by law to transmit emission-related data, but most manufacturers also add the capacity to stream real-time data from ECUs, electronic control units of a car. <strong>OBD-II </strong>is such an advanced system that it can warn about the potential damage of an ECU. For example, it triggers the "engine check" warning well before the actual engine failure. It also allows transferring data back and forth between a vehicle and a device, as well as controlling vehicle systems.<br></p></div> </div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec196173766" data-record-type="106" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T004 --><div><div> <div><div field="text"><p>OBD-II can use one of many <strong>vehicle buses</strong>, internal communications networks, to transfer data from ECUs to a scanner, data logger or even a smartphone via Bluetooth. In this article, I'll describe such means of communication as K-line and CAN since <a href="https://quality-wolves.com/" target="_blank"><span><strong>Quality Wolves</strong></span></a> uses these protocols in projects we develop for automotive and manufacturing verticals.<br></p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec196174202" data-record-type="239" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T210 --><div><div><div> <div> <div field="descr"><p>Nowadays, K-line is mostly used if a vehicle doesn't have the CAN bus</p></div> </div> <div><div field="text"><p><strong></strong><strong>K-line</strong> is a low-speed and single-wire system mostly used as a diagnosis network. It can transfer any data limited only by the broadband capacity (10 Kb/s). For example, K-line can tell you if an ECU is turned on or off. The main impediment of the K-line network is that only one ECU at a time to send a message. As a consequence, any device connected to a K-line can see all the messages queued there, even if it's not intended to receive some of them. This poses a security risk if K-line transfers sensitive data. Nowadays, K-line is mostly used if a vehicle doesn't have the CAN bus or it's not vital for a task to use more than a single wire. <br></p></div> </div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec196174946" data-record-type="106" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T004 --><div><div> <div><div field="text"><div data-customstyle="yes"><p><strong></strong><strong>CAN bus</strong>, or Controller Area Network, is much faster than K-line (up to 1 Mb/s vs 10 Kb/s) and capable of transferring more data in one message. OBD-II mostly runs on CAN nowadays so this vehicle bus standard is essential for cars, trucks, tractors, industrial robots. Unlike K-line that queues messages from all linked ECUs, it unites all electronic control units into a decentralised system and can transfer several messages simultaneously. Though it makes CAN more secure than K-line, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/"><span>some cars are vulnerable to hacking</span></a> and can surrender control over CAN message systems which, in turn, might be dangerous for an owner.</p><p><strong>Here's a simplified scheme of how both protocols work:</strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec196175512" data-record-type="3" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T107 --><div> <div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3633-6339-4031-a163-623832643065/Screenshot_2020-05-2.png"><meta itemprop="caption" content="k-line and can protocols scheme"> <p><img src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3633-6339-4031-a163-623832643065/-/empty/Screenshot_2020-05-2.png" data-original="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3633-6339-4031-a163-623832643065/Screenshot_2020-05-2.png" imgfield="img" alt="k-line and can protocols scheme"> </p></div> </div></div><div id="rec196176072" data-record-type="239" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T210 --><div><div><div> <div> <div field="descr"><p>New vehicle buses and their extensions are changing the ways we interact with the vehicles and robots</p></div> </div> <div><div field="text"><div data-customstyle="yes"><p>There's a wide range of apps developed with the use of K-line and CAN protocols: from ride height controllers to programs that control robots gathering an EV like Tesla. </p><p> New vehicle buses and their extensions (for example, CAN-FD) are changing the ways we interact with the vehicles and robots.

The matter was widely known as the Mathura case, after the minor Adivasi girl who complained that she had been raped by two constables in a police station in rural Maharashtra. </p></div></div></div></div>  <!----></div><section data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><!----> <div data-v-58180b62=""><p>The Supreme Court had agreed that a sexual act had taken place, but thrown out the rape conviction. “There is a clear difference in law, and common sense, between ‘submission’ and ‘consent,’” the open letter stated, addressing Supreme Court Chief Justice YV Chandrachud. “Consent involves submission; but the converse is not necessarily true.” The court had established that Mathura appeared to have submitted to her ordeal. “But where,” the writers asked, “was the finding on the crucial element of consent?”</p><p>The fire lit by that letter swept through the lives of many Indian women. It changed them, and those who came after them. The movement it boosted gave Indians a vocabulary to describe sexism and misogyny that many of us still use. It attempted to unite women outraged by the rape trial of an Adivasi teenager. Its participants thought of its goal as “simultaneously”<a href="" onclick="return!1"><sup id="cx6n3h2gd6fp">[1]</sup></a> fighting sexism, casteism and religious chauvinism. It was a protest against something that slides out of focus even in 2020, when police violence has become a focal point of dissent around the world: the matter of custodial rape.</p><p>Looking back at that movement gives us an unforgiving view of what the 1970s and 1980s were like for many women, as well as how little seems to have changed in the way states exercise their monopoly on violence. In the years since, many Indians, and the media they consume, have changed how we talk about consent and sexual agency. But the realities underpinning our language are stubborn. The roots of injustice persist. Inequality gets in the way, still, of the fundamental re-imagination that began for many women on the day they read that open letter.</p></div></div></div></div></section><section data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><p data-v-58180b62=""><header>Mathura</header></p> <div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><p>

Her home in Vile Parle, where the Socialist Women’s Group often met, was an open house for union workers and committed Trotskyists. </p></div></div></div></div></section><blockquote data-v-6f86352e=""><div data-v-6f86352e=""> <p data-v-6f86352e="">“I’d think, ‘why is she coming and interfering in my private domain, let her go and do the revolution.’”</p>  </div></blockquote><section data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><!----> <div data-v-58180b62=""><p>Shukla herself had provided refuge to Gayatri Singh, who led group meetings and worked in labour law at the time. Shukla watched the action in these gatherings from the sidelines. “My role was just that of a supporter,” she remembered. It was how she’d met Vibhuti Patel, who came into her kitchen one day to offer help cooking for her political guests. “Initially I used to be upset,” said Shukla. “I’d think, ‘why is she coming and interfering in my private domain, let her go and do the revolution.’” But they became friends, and Sonal Shukla became actively drawn into discussions about feminist theory and women’s rights. </p><p>The Socialist Women’s Group was one among many autonomous women’s groups emerging across India. Starting in the late 1960s, women had been increasingly active in rural and regional agitations. Many of these early struggles were related to economic issues: class consciousness, landless farmers resisting economic oppression, lower middle-class women protesting against price rise in the metros. </p><p>These movements connected women with others like themselves, who refused to be passive spectators in their personal and political lives. Chhaya Datar was a homemaker in Mumbai who’d turned to social work, conducting workshops with Adivasi women in rural Maharashtra. Flavia Agnes was regaining control of her life after leaving a thirteen-year-long abusive marriage. In Bengaluru, Donna Fernandes was working on water and housing issues with women from slum communities. In Hyderabad, Vasanth Kannabiran was beginning to address gender issues with a small group of women. </p><p>The open letter about Mathura’s case caused a new awakening among some of these women, who are now among India’s most renowned feminist activists. “It made me so angry, you can’t imagine today. That’s when I felt I couldn’t be an outside supporter as I thought I would be,” Shukla told me. “So far, I was working for women, but now I wanted to work as a woman. That difference came with the Mathura case.”</p></div></div></div></div></section><section data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><!----> <div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><p>

            </p> <p>n March 1972, the orphaned Mathura was between fourteen and sixteen years old. She lived with her brother in Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district and worked as a labourer. She was in a relationship with Ashok, the cousin of a woman at whose house she sometimes worked. Likely opposed to the relationship, Mathura’s brother complained that Ashok and his family had kidnapped Mathura. The Gadchiroli police brought them all to the local station at Desaiganj to record their statements, a procedure that lasted well into the night. At half past ten, as they were about to leave, the policemen asked Mathura to stay back.</p></div><p>The lights of the police station were switched off and doors bolted. One of the constables allegedly raped her inside the bathroom. The other officer, intoxicated, allegedly molested her.<a href="" onclick="return!1"><sup id="fiwebdmqwpvi">[2]</sup></a> A crowd of villagers gathered outside the station brought the head constable from his house and forced him to lodge a first information report.</p><p>A medical examination about 24 hours after the assault claimed to have found no physical injuries or semen in the vagina, though there were traces of seminal fluid on her clothes as well as on those of the constable. The report further concluded that Mathura had had sexual intercourse in the past. </p><p>In the trial court, two years later, the constable argued that the intercourse occurred with consent: the absence of injury proved as much, didn’t it?&nbsp; The court not only ruled in favour of the constable, but declared Mathura to be a woman “of easy virtue.” She claimed rape, the judges said, because she wanted to appear virtuous to Ashok.<a href="" onclick="return!1"><sup id="bpeauo88u1pa">[3]</sup></a> On appeal, the High Court overturned the lower court’s judgement, taking many factors into consideration: Mathura had been summoned to the station in the dead of night; she had immediately communicated the fact of her rape to the crowd outside the station; she could not have successfully resisted her assailants. But the Supreme Court restored the verdict of the trial court. In agreeing with its conclusion, it declared that “stiff resistance being put up by the girl is all false,” and that “the alleged intercourse (was) a peaceful affair.”</p><p>The year was now 1978.

There were gatherings in Surat, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. The Forum gathered thousands of signatures in support of its demands.

        <p><span>Magazine</span></p>
        <p>Scroll through our first article about scrolling. Almost an infinite scroll. ðŸ‘€</p>
        
        <p><img src="https://arsfutura-production.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_posts/images/000/000/020/original/20-deep-linking-2.jpg?1605771405" alt="20 deep linking 2">
    </p></div><div>
        <blockquote>
    <p>This is the second part of our React Native Deep Linking series. Please <a href="https://arsfutura.com/magazine/deep-linking-in-react-native">follow this link</a> to read the first part.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A nice addition to deep linking, mainly with scrollable pages, is the automatic scrolling animation to a specific element. It is mostly used in lists of homogeneous data, such as comments. It helps users see the exact element of their concern in an array of similar data. Say someone liked or replied to your comment and you receive a notification. When you tap on it â€” you are taken to the comment list and scrolled directly to the mentioned comment. Perfect.</p>
<p>This technique is often paired with some sort of a signal to mark the comment, like contrasting color highlights behind it or an animation.</p>
<p>So letâ€™s see your options for creating an automatic scroll to the element of interest.</p>
<h2>FlatList</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get this working is to use the FlatList component â€” if it is compatible with your data on that screen. The important steps are:</p>
<p>1. Adding reference to your <span>FlatList</span>:</p>
<pre>&lt;FlatList
    ref={ref =&gt; {
      this.flatListRef = ref;
    }}
    // â€¦ other props â€¦
/&gt;
</pre>
<p>2. Referring to that list inside your component and execute functions:</p>
<pre><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>flatListRef</span><span>.</span><span>scrollToIndex</span><span>({</span>
    <span>animated</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
    <span>index</span><span>:</span> <span>itemIndex</span><span>,</span>
<span>});</span>
</pre>
<p>3. Defining <span>onScrollToIndexFailed</span>, which is FlatListâ€™s prop:</p>
<pre><span>onScrollToIndexFailed</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>error</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>flatListRef</span><span>.</span><span>scrollToOffset</span><span>({</span>
        <span>offset</span><span>:</span> <span>error</span><span>.</span><span>averageItemLength</span> <span>*</span> <span>error</span><span>.</span><span>index</span><span>,</span>
        <span>animated</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
    <span>});</span>

    <span>setTimeout</span><span>(()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>flatListRef</span> <span>!==</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>flatListRef</span><span>.</span><span>scrollToIndex</span><span>({</span>
                <span>index</span><span>:</span> <span>error</span><span>.</span><span>index</span><span>,</span>
                <span>animated</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
            <span>});</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>},</span> <span>100</span><span>);</span>
<span>}}</span>
</pre>
<p>Iâ€™ll let RN documentation do the talking for why this is necessary:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Used to handle failures when scrolling to an index that has not been measured yet. Recommended action is to either compute your own offset and scrollTo it, or scroll as far as possible and then try again after more items have been rendered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And youâ€™re done with the FlatList version â€” call <span>scrollToIndex</span> when you need it and let the magic happen. ðŸŽ©ðŸ�°</p>
<h2>ScrollView</h2>
<p>If you donâ€™t have the ability to use <span>FlatList</span>, you can go for <span>ScrollView</span> and the following configuration. If you are using <span>ScrollView</span>, you probably have mixed data (e.g. an image, title, some buttons under it, etc.).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in that case, you canâ€™t rely on scrolling to a specific item by using its ID to work â€œout of the boxâ€� because youâ€™re not exactly rendering a list of similar items here.</p>
<p>One of the solutions is to determine the desired elementâ€™s position on the screen and use it as an anchor point for auto-scroll. Here are the steps.</p>
<p>1. Once again, define ref on your view.</p>
<pre>&lt;FlatList
    ref={ref =&gt; {
      this.flatListRef = ref;
    }}
    // â€¦ other props â€¦
/&gt;
</pre>
<p>2. Now you can use another method called scrollTo, which looks something like this:</p>
<pre><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>scrollViewRef</span><span>.</span><span>scrollTo</span><span>({</span>
    <span>animated</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
    <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>viewY</span>
<span>});</span>
</pre>
<p>The next question that might come up is <strong>â€œHow do I get the <span>y</span> value for my element?â€�</strong>. Fear not! You can use <span>onLayout</span> and attach it to your RN component. <span>onLayout</span> is a prop of any React Native built-in component that originates from a <span>View</span>. That method is invoked on mount and layout changes of the component. Bear in mind â€” the <span>x</span> and <span>y</span> values are relative to the top left corner of the screen.</p>
<p>3. This is an example of stuff we can get information about regarding our view:</p>
<pre>&lt;View
  onLayout={event =&gt; {
    const { layout } = event.nativeEvent;
    console.log(â€˜height:â€™, layout.height);
    console.log(â€˜width:â€™, layout.width);
    console.log(â€˜x:â€™, layout.x);
    console.log(â€˜y:â€™, layout.y);
  }}
&gt;
</pre>
<p>The one we need here is obviously <span>y</span>. Store it somewhere accessible and use it in the <span>scrollTo</span> method for <span>viewY</span>.</p>
<p>Et voilÃ&nbsp;! ðŸŽ‰</p>

</figure>
<h2>Pairing it with deep linking</h2>
<p>As per the title, letâ€™s pair this feature with deep linking.</p>
<p>Youâ€™d want to send the itemâ€™s ID or some sort of a primary key through the link like: <span>demo://home/first/:commentId</span></p>
<p>Then, we can call JSâ€™s <span>findIndex()</span> on our array of data:</p>
<pre><span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>commentId</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>navigation</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>params</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>commentIndex</span> <span>=</span> <span>commentsArr</span><span>.</span><span>findIndex</span><span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>c</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>===</span> <span>commentId</span><span>);</span>
</pre>
<p>and use <span>commentIndex</span> in the <span>scrollToIndex()</span> method.</p>
<p>You can find more details in the <a href="https://github.com/nbiscan/deepLinkingExample">GitHub repo</a> and the first part of the blog series.</p>

    <figcaption>Deep-linking with autoscrolling in action.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let me leave you with a bonus tip:</p>
<p>If you need to use the sticky section header with separated data, look no further than React Nativeâ€™s <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/sectionlist">SectionList</a> component. The use case for this is a notification list with the following section: Today, Yesterday, Older, etc., as seen on popular applications such as Instagram and Facebook.</p>
<p>Other than that, definitely check out the <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview">documentation</a> for other commonly used functions for scrolling components like <span>scrollToEnd</span> or <span>refreshControl</span>.</p>
<p>Have fun and stay tuned for more! ðŸ“» ðŸ˜Š</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>AIS data are being integrated in many applications. Managing those data at scale can prove cumbersome. This post introduces TrueSea by SenX, a turnkey solution for AIS data built on the acclaimed Warp 10 Geo Time Series platform.</p><article>
      
<p>Data from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_identification_system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Automatic Identification System</a> (AIS for short) allows the tracking of vessels around the world. They are being integrated into a growing number of applications from insurance companies, defense agencies, or financial services.</p>



<p>These data are emitted periodically by ships at sea or at moorings and can represent millions of daily messages, bringing with them challenges of their own. </p>



<p>This blog post will present some of those challenges and how SenX can help you solve them, creating more value from all those AIS messages.</p>



<h2>What is AIS?</h2>



<p>The Automatic Identification System was created to increase the safety at sea by enabling ships to identify nearby vessels to avoid collisions and by facilitating Search and Rescue (SAR) operations. It was made mandatory by the 2002 IMO SOLAS agreement for all vessels above 300 GT.</p>



<p><strong>Technically AIS is a system that transmits over VHF short messages with information about the vessels.</strong> </p>



<p>There are three main types of information being transmitted.</p>



<ul><li>Static infos about the ship, such as its name and IMO number, its size or type, and the location of the antenna acquiring the position, which is important on a 300m tanker or cargo ship for example. Those informations are transmitted every 6 minutes.</li><li>Voyage informations, also transmitted every 6 minutes. These include the type of cargo, the current destination of the ship and its ETA, its planned route, and some safety-related infos.</li><li>Lastly, dynamic informations which are transmitted more often when the ship is moving and depending on its speed. Those infos include the vessel's speed and course on ground, its heading, its rate of turn, navigation status, and other indicators.</li></ul>



<h2>Where can AIS data be acquired?</h2>



<p>AIS messages are transmitted via VHF radio waves in an unencrypted format. They can be picked up by any station with a line of sight view of the emitter's antenna. This has led to the proliferation of hobbyists on coastal areas deploying cheap <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SDR</a> dongles with Open Source <a href="https://github.com/dgiardini/rtl-ais" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">software</a> able to decode the AIS chatter.</p>



<p>This craze soon led to the creation of web services that offered to concentrate the data coming from individual stations and to redistribute the consolidated stream to all participants. </p>



<p>The two more popular such services are <a href="https://www.marinetraffic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MarineTraffic</a> and <a href="https://www.aishub.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AISHub</a>. The latter is purely a community oriented service while the former has turned into a commercial provider of the data while retaining its redistribution to participating stations.</p>

<p>More recently, companies such as <a href="https://www.orbcomm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ORBCOMM</a>, <a href="https://spire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spire,</a> or <a href="https://www.spacequest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpaceQuest</a> have launched constellations of satellites carrying a payload capable of collecting AIS data. They thus extending the available data to those coming from ships in the open sea.</p>



<p><strong>AIS data can be purchased from those companies, either as a real time stream or as historical datasets. </strong>Their offerings mainly differ by the coverage they can provide and particularities of their own APIs. But the format of the data is common since it is dictated by the AIS standard.</p>



<h2>What usage can be made of AIS data?</h2>



<p>Over the years, AIS data have been used for a growing number of types of applications. The first uses were those for which AIS was invented, the safety of ships at sea. But soon after the data started being collected and consolidated by community websites, uses not at sea started booming.</p>



<p>There are far too many uses of AIS data today to endeavor into naming them all. But we can list a few such as <a href="https://www.e-odyn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e-ODyn</a> computing oceanic currents, <a href="https://www.quiet-oceans.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quiet Oceans</a> forecasting ocean noise, or <a href="https://www.kpler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kpler</a> providing energy market intelligence.</p>



<h2>What is a typical pipeline around AIS data?</h2>



<p>The provider or pool or providers you have selected will make their AIS data available to you via a real-time feed and/or sets of downloadable files.  Your first task will be to listen to those feeds and retrieve those files. Then immediately you will need to start storing those data to start building your AIS trove.</p>



<p>This storage layer will need to be constructed with usability in mind. It means that the data must be accessible by the applications you intend to build.</p>



<p>Your real-time feed may need to be connected to a stream processing engine for on-the-fly analysis and decision.</p>



<p>And lastly, your historical datasets will need to be available for large scale batch processing, whether for detecting specific situations in the past, creating <a href="https://help.marinetraffic.com/hc/en-us/articles/204802167-Display-Density-Maps-on-the-Live-Map" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">custom visualizations</a>, or determining which ships went where in order to gather intelligence from past voyages.</p>



<h2>What are the challenges of working with AIS data?</h2>



<p>Right after connecting to your first AIS feed and getting the first few files, <strong>you may realize that these data may quickly prove more difficult to work with than what you may have expected.</strong></p>



<p>Your choice of database fills rapidly. The developers are demanding more performance. This leads to the creating of more and more indices which in turn increases the rate at which your disk fill.</p>



<p>The way your applications need to access data usually also evolve rapidly. You built your system with requirements for fetching data from a bounding box, but you now get requests for identifying specific types of ships which went through important trade routes such as the Panama and Suez canals over the course of the <a href="https://blog.senx.io/the-covid-19-pandemic-and-the-art-of-geo-time-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19 lockdown</a>, or find how ships called in various world ports over an extended period of time. </p>



<p>New uses of the data you had not planned when you first designed your system and which now occupy your teams more than you had expected and put your cloud bills through the roof as you need more and more power to mitigate bad design choices.</p>



<p>Your team will quickly need to learn more than they want about spatio-temporal indexing, space-filling curves, efficient data representations. All of this so that you can use data that you pay every month.</p>



<p>This type of situation adds a lot of stress to many teams:</p>



<ul><li>product teams which cannot deliver the features they promised to their customers, </li><li>data teams which struggle to scale their databases, </li><li>and finance teams which see costs increasing all over the place with expensive data not being put to work to produce value as it was originally planned.</li></ul>



<h2>How can SenX help?</h2>



<p>You can decide that your team has the time and ability to become top notch spatio-temporal gurus. But if that is not the case or if that objective is not aligned with your business goals we think that SenX can help.</p>



<p><a href="https://senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SenX</a> is the creator of <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp 10,</a> a software suite for managing and analyzing spatio-temporal sequences we call <a href="https://blog.senx.io/tag/geo-time-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geo Time Series</a>, and it happens that AIS data exactly fit this definition!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As it happens, we distribute Warp 10 as open-source so you can grab it and thank us for all the fish, putting it in the hands of your already stressed-out data teams who will surely appreciate they get an extra tool to master.</p>



<p><strong>Or you can decide to contact us to help you solve your AIS issues.</strong> </p>



<p>Over the years we have built quite an expertise in handling spatio-temporal data at scale, whether for aircraft manufacturers, offshore racing teams, or defense agencies. AIS is such a good fit for our technologies that <strong>we have created an offering dedicated to the management of those data, TrueSea.</strong></p>

<h2>TrueSea</h2>



<p>TrueSea is a turnkey solution for AIS data pipelines, handling the ingestion of AIS feeds and files. It makes that data available through powerful APIs and to batch processing tools such as <a href="http://spark.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spark</a> to enable you to perform large scale analytics to power your applications.</p>



<p>TrueSea is compatible with major AIS data providers and can be easily adapted to emerging ones. The solution can also mix AIS data with weather, aeronautical, or road traffic data for a global approach.</p>



<p>TrueSea also comes with visualization options such as our <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Marauder%27s_Map" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marauder's Map</a> like view which can display <a href="https://truesea.senx.io/demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">millions of positions from tens of thousands of ships</a>.</p>



<p>If you are interested in having a conversation about AIS data and how we can help you get the most out of your investment, send us an <a href="mailto:sales@senx.io">email</a>, we will reach back to you rapidly to schedule a video call.</p>



<p>We recently organized a session about AIS during <a href="https://www.seatechweek.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sea Tech Week 2020</a>, the replay is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqqG9VeoqqE&amp;t=1s&amp;ab_channel=SenX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available</a> if you wish to watch it.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div>
<p>Mod­ern ren­der­ing sys­tems are con­fron­ted with a daunt­ingly large and grow­ing set of re­quire­ments: in their pur­suit of real­ism, phys­ic­ally based tech­niques must in­creas­ingly ac­count for in­tric­ate prop­er­ties of light, such as its spec­tral com­pos­i­tion or po­lar­iz­a­tion. To re­duce pro­hib­it­ive ren­der­ing times, vec­tor­ized ren­der­ers ex­ploit co­her­ence via in­struc­tion-level par­al­lel­ism on CPUs and GPUs. Dif­fer­en­ti­able ren­der­ing al­gorithms propag­ate de­riv­at­ives through a sim­u­la­tion to op­tim­ize an ob­ject­ive func­tion, e.g., to re­con­struct a scene from ref­er­ence im­ages. Ca­ter­ing to such di­verse use cases is chal­len­ging and has led to nu­mer­ous pur­pose-built sys­tems—partly, be­cause ret­ro­fit­ting fea­tures of this com­plex­ity onto an ex­ist­ing ren­der­er in­volves an er­ror-prone and in­feas­ibly in­trus­ive trans­form­a­tion of ele­ment­ary data struc­tures, in­ter­faces between com­pon­ents, and their im­ple­ment­a­tions (in oth­er words,&nbsp;everything).</p>
<p>We pro­pose Mit­suba 2, a ver­sat­ile ren­der­er that is in­trins­ic­ally re­tar­get­able to vari­ous ap­plic­a­tions in­clud­ing the ones lis­ted above. Mit­suba 2 is im­ple­men­ted in mod­ern C++ and lever­ages tem­plate meta­pro­gram­ming to re­place types and in­stru­ment the con­trol flow of com­pon­ents such as BSD­Fs, volumes, emit­ters, and ren­der­ing al­gorithms. At com­pile time, it auto­mat­ic­ally trans­forms arith­met­ic, data struc­tures, and func­tion dis­patch, turn­ing gen­er­ic al­gorithms in­to a vari­ety of ef­fi­cient im­ple­ment­a­tions without the te­di­um of manu­al re­design. Pos­sible trans­form­a­tions in­clude chan­ging the rep­res­ent­a­tion of col­or, gen­er­at­ing a “wide” ren­der­er that op­er­ates on bundles of light paths, just-in-time com­pil­a­tion to cre­ate com­pu­ta­tion­al ker­nels that run on the <span>GPU</span>, and for­ward/re­verse-mode auto­mat­ic dif­fer­en­ti­ation. Trans­form­a­tions can be chained, which fur­ther en­riches the space of al­gorithms de­rived from a single gen­er­ic&nbsp;im­ple­ment­a­tion.</p>
<p>We demon­strate the ef­fect­ive­ness and sim­pli­city of our ap­proach on sev­er­al ap­plic­a­tions that would be very chal­len­ging to cre­ate without as­sist­ance: a ren­der­ing al­gorithm based on co­her­ent <span>MCMC</span> ex­plor­a­tion, a caustic design meth­od for gradi­ent-in­dex op­tics, and a tech­nique for re­con­struct­ing het­ero­gen­eous me­dia in the pres­ence of mul­tiple&nbsp;scat­ter­ing.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog">
                    <h2>It is a choice people tend to ignore</h2>
<p>People in life try to do everything at once. They think that the world is so big that it doesn’t matter what they did before or what their choices though.</p>
<p>People think the only thing that matters is that they have tomorrow. Tomorrow they will wake up, and their life will be different.</p>
<p>Well, that is not the case. Human beings only exist because of our past experiences and decisions. These decisions form us both physically and mentally make us into what we are today. We get shaped but what we do and what we choose to be associated with.</p>
<p>If you want to be honest, there is a way for you to be an honest type of person.</p>
<p>If you want to be successful, then you can be a successful type of person.</p>
<p>We are not what we tell ourselves and everyone around us. We are what we do. </p>
<p>This about it this way, an honest person would tell the waiter if your food was bad. An honest person would tell his friend that he thinks that his idea sucks. An honest person would not be very popular among his peers as honesty is a very dangerous thing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a “Nice” person would lie to both waiter and his friend.</p>
<h2>Get complimentary identifications</h2>
<p>If you are looking to improve, then you have to choose wisely <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/understanding-life-16-11-2020">what type of person you want to be.</a></p>
<p>Most of the type, it won’t be a single <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/quality-over-quantity-in-writing">identification</a> as “I want to be reliable”.</p>
<p>It would most likely be “I want to have enough money to be happy, and I want people to think I am reliable.”</p>
<p>This consist of many identifications. What you need to make sure when setting goals for yourself is not to have contrary ones.</p>
<p>One can not be fully honest and fully nice at the same time. He can be a mixture of both, but both of this contradict each other too much to coexist happily.</p>
<p>Think of it as synonyms and antonyms. You either contradict or support your identification.</p>
<h2>Your surrounding</h2>
<p>You must have heard that having a proper environment and good friends is very important. Every singly conference on self-improvement talks about it.</p>
<p>Even great minds of the past 200 years have all been saying the same thing over and over. Warren Buffet and Steve Jobs were heave advocates of the great surrounding.</p>
<p>You might not have realised how old this saying is though.</p>
<p>“Show me your friends, and I’ll show you your future.” Has been around for generations. It’s a Biblical concept.</p>
<p>In Proverbs 13:20, Solomon, the wise-guy, wrote: </p>
<p><code>“He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.”</code></p>
<p>Is this not crazy enough for you to start caring about your friends?</p>
<p>Most of the time, the relationships form because it is very easy. Why do most people have friends that are their colleagues? Because they spend every single day together at work.</p>
<p>Why do people from the same street know each other so well and most of the time become friends? Well, they are right there. </p>
<p>If you want to stick to a habit, make it easy.</p>
<p>With friends though, I would say that you should go for quality over quantity.</p>
<p>We, as humans, can be influenced very easily. We follow what the majority is doing. We think just as the majority does. This instinct is in our blood and bones since ancient times. We always wanted and still want to fit in.</p>
<p>Before if you didn’t have the same opinion on things, you were exiled from the tribe. Back then, this meant sure death.</p>
<p>In the modern world, not fitting in also guarantees us an exile, a monetary and social one. Not many people would want to talk to you. Your prospects of being successful financially also drop close to 0.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Imagine you have a neighbour. But he is not smart, interesting or has anything new to say, who is really missing out here?</p>
<p>There is such a thing as negative progress or degradation. This is exactly what happens when you associate yourself with friends such as that.</p>
<p>You want to spend time with the most amazing people. Those that make your blood boil and those that make you look up to them at everything they do.</p>
<p>Don’t think that one day doesn’t matter. One day become one week and one week becomes a month.</p>
<p>Change things as soon as you get around to it.</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>
<p>Klim Y</p>

<p><span>

02 Aug 2020

</span></p><p>I joined Roblox at the end of 2012 as a rendering engineer; I had just spent more than a year working on various titles from FIFA franchise after years of console game development and was becoming a bit tired of the “big game development”. My work on FIFA was as a contractor and I got an offer for a full-time position, but I also had a friend who worked at Roblox reach out and offer me to move to California and work on Roblox. I knew absolutely nothing about Roblox, but California was nice and my friend told me it would be awesome. The platform was so different (and so strange!) that I decided to take a chance - here I am, 8 years later, still working at Roblox and enjoying it. I started on my first full time job in April 2007 so at this point I’ve worked for 13 years in game development and 8 of them were at Roblox.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>My memory works in interesting ways. I remember my interview pretty well, I remember having lunch at some place in San Mateo downtown near the Roblox HQ - a few people were at lunch including Roblox CEO David Baszucki and I remember him asking many questions about my thoughts about the engines and rendering, and distinctly remember not finishing most of my lunch because I talked most of the time. However I don’t really remember what was going through my head in regards to my perception of Roblox - why did I join besides just thinking I want to do something else for a change? Who knows, but I am glad I did.</p>

<p>I don’t really understand why Roblox is so successful - you can invent all sorts of reasons in retrospect but it’s hard to validate them, and if you came to anybody back in 2012 and asked for an investment to build a platform where all games are user generated and run on a custom engine with a custom toolset and all users participate in a giant virtual economy and …, I think you’d have gotten a blank stare.</p>

<p>But I do understand that I found the perfect place for me, especially at that point in my career - I enjoy working on game technology but I never liked working on actual games, and Roblox maximizes the number of developers who can use the technology you work on while maintaining a good autonomy and a very wide range of problems you’d need to solve. It’s very hard to get bored here.</p>

<p>I think I could talk for hours about Roblox - it somehow became a huge part of my life. I was very fortunate to join at the time when I did and witness the growth of our technology and business. I am really unsure of what the future holds but it’s hard to imagine what, if anything, comes after Roblox - I certainly don’t intend to leave any time soon…</p>

<p>So I thought it might be fun to do what I’ve planned to do for a year or more now, and to go over all decently sized projects I’ve ever worked on at Roblox. This is based on resummarizing and reliving the source control history, which tells me I’ve had 2752 changes that made it to our main branch, with merge commits counting as one, so, uh, this blog might be on a larger side. Hopefully this will be fun!</p>

<p>Before we begin, I just want to conclude this by saying that I’m very grateful to the Roblox leadership for treating me well, for all the friends and colleagues I made along the way, and for the wonderful Roblox community. The reason why I still enjoy what I do is because whenever I write about a new big thing I’m working on or a small feature or even a bug fix, it’s usually met with excitement which keeps me going. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. I don’t think I could have done it without you and I hope this continues for as long as possible despite the current trying and uncertain times.</p>



<p>Notably including half-pixel offset fixes for Direct3D9 which I guess is a rite of passage for rendering engineers. The rendering code back then was based on OGRE rendering engine, so I had to learn that, and this was also my first time using OpenGL professionally - prior to that I’ve used Direct3D 9 and proprietary console APIs, and Direct3D 10/11 as a hobby.</p>



<p>Initially added for “100 player” project, in October it evolved to render all parts and continued to be used as part renderer until the introduction of instancing in 2018. Otherwise known as “featherweight parts”. This was further optimized and deployed around November 2012. Most of this code survived to this day but evolved over time, and is still used when instancing doesn’t apply.</p>

<p>The core idea in this system was to dynamically batch meshes together, for characters this would be based on the character model hierarchy, and for everything else the grouping is spatial. This allowed us to reduce the number of draw calls, which was a big concern due to both driver overhead and inefficiencies in OGRE.</p>

<p>This would pave the way for what eventually turned out to be a complete, but gradual, rewrite of the rendering stack. The main motivation for this was always performance - what we ended up let us port to mobile (the old rendering code was nowhere near fast enough even for relatively simple scenes), and break new grounds on the number of objects we could render in a frame.</p>



<p>One of a few OGRE upgrades we’ve needed to do, this one was to get better GLES support. It was pretty painful to do those, just like any other big middleware update is. Read further to learn what happened to OGRE eventually…</p>

<p>One thing I remember from doing these is that documentation in source code makes the upgrade process that much more painful. I had scripts that changed the copyright years in headers back to whatever they were in our tree just to make merging less painful, but there was some OGRE upgrade where 70% of the changes were documentation, and this was very hard to get through.</p>

<p>The reason why these were challenging in general is that whenever we did an upgrade we had to a) merge our plentiful changes with the new code, b) gate dangerous parts of the upgrade with flags. We’ve used the same system of feature flags (we call them fast flags) since I joined Roblox which allows us to dynamically disable parts of the release based on metrics, but this requires actually isolating changes behind if statements selectively - which for OGRE was sometimes necessary as we didn’t know what the impact of some low level change in OpenGL code would be.</p>



<p>Before this we had hand-translated shaders, which started to be painful to maintain. The first version of the pipeline used hlsl2glsl and glsl-optimizer (same as Unity back in the day). We are using version 3 today, see below!</p>

<p>Since this was done at the point where we used OGRE, the compiler would take HLSL files, preprocess and translate them to optimized GLSL, and save the resulting GLSL back to disk - which would then be loaded by OGRE directly through the material definition file. Eventually we replaced this with a binary shader pack that could store GLSL code for OpenGL and shader bytecode for other APIs, but back then we shipped HLSL and GLSL source and compiled HLSL code on device!</p>



<p>Our equivalent of “Steam Hardware Survey” that went through SQL databases and coalesced various system information bits to help us understand the hardware at the time. This was during my era of obsession with F#, so it was written in F# instead of something like Python. We don’t use this anymore and don’t even have the SQL database in question!</p>

<p>We never published the resulting data, and I’m not sure how often we used it to make decisions, but it was fun to look at the number of graphics cards from various vendors or amount of RAM or resolution a typical Roblox user has.</p>



<p>Although I was hired as a rendering engineer, I had a lot of really deep low-level systems experience and as a consequence ended up engaging in both optimization work and security related work from the very beginning. I don’t do this anymore these days but I was often involved in the security work for the first 3 or 4 years. Now we fortunately have people who can do this full time and better than I could :)</p>



<p>A second part of “100 player project”, necessary to render every character in one draw call (these were really expensive for us back in the day!). A side effect included some resolution sacrifices on character items that shirt creators aren’t fond of. The new system managed the atlas texture memory, rebaking humanoids far away to smaller textures to conserve texture memory. The compositor survived with minor changes to this day, although we’re now working on a new one.</p>

<p>The compositor was built in a very configurable fashion, allowing the high level code to specify the layout to bake, and managing all the complex asynchronous processing and budgeting by itself. This allowed us to switch the composit layout completely years later for R15.</p>



<p>At the end of 2012 we were actively working on the mobile port. Since then we’ve had to do a lot of work in a lot of different parts of the engine to make data structures smaller and algorithms - faster. Of course you’re never done with optimizations so we do this to this day. Curiously, our minimum spec on iOS stayed the same since the initial launch in 2012!</p>

<p>A fun fact is that even though we started with iPad 2 as the min. spec we discussed adding support to iPad 1 after launch. At the time there were a lot of people who couldn’t play Roblox on iOS on older hardware. However the performance characteristics of those devices were just… not good enough. You could touch the screen with the finger and pan the camera, and during panning you lost 30% of a single available core to the OS processing the touch. We decided to not add support for this, and 8 years later it seems like a great decision for sure :D</p>



<p>It was very hard to use Xcode Instruments to profile frame spikes on an iPad; to try to figure out how to get our performance to a better place on mobile, I wrote some ad-hoc code to dump all internal log events to a binary stream, and a desktop UI tool in F# and WPF to visualize it. This included a Lua profiler as well that could display profiles of Lua code in a …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p> <span>This post is part of my <a href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/">Today I learned</a> series in which I share all my learnings regarding web development.</span></p><div><p>While browsing <a href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/notes/1025-shell-command-one-liners-on-one-page/">a collection of shell one-liners</a>, I found out about a command that I haven't seen before: <code>leave</code>.</p><p>The command is straightforward. Run it and define an absolute or relative time, and your terminal will remind you to leave it alone and go at a certain time.</p><pre><code># set the alarm for 2:10pm
$ leave 1410
Alarm set for Fri Nov 20 14:10:00 CET 2020. (pid 3121)

# set the alarm in two minutes
$ leave +2

# set the alarm in two minutes interactively
$ leave
When do you have to leave? +2
Alarm set for Fri Nov 20 09:05:21 CET 2020. (pid 50717)
</code></pre><p>When the time arrives, the command running in the background sends shell notifications and prints new lines telling you to go. And let me tell you the best part: it doesn't do that once; it does that repeatedly every minute after the set alarm time. It will try hard to make you leave!</p><p><strong>You can only stop the running <code>leave</code> process from annoying you by logging out of your shell session (or manually stopping the process).</strong> 😆</p><p>I love that! Maybe I should define <code>leave 1900</code> in my <code>.zshrc</code> to force me to stop doing nerdy things late at night.</p><p><em>Edited:</em> For the adventurous folks – <a href="https://twitter.com/fhemberger/status/1329712452301451264">Frederic Hemberger pointed out</a> that you could also just shut down the system at a specific time using <code>sudo shutdown -h 12:00 "Feierabend!"</code>. But be careful with this command; it could lead to data loss. 😆</p><p>If you're interested in reading comments and alternatives to the <code>leave</code> command, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25158739">this post was trending on Hacker News</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605857085381/5mDUEUFVE.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>If you’ve ever programmed with JavaScript, you definitely know about <code>Promise</code> and <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>. C#, Java, Python, and some other programming languages apply the same pattern using different names such as <code>Task</code> or <code>Future</code>.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Go doesn’t follow the pattern at all. Instead, it introduces <code>goroutines</code> and <code>channels</code>. However, it isn’t difficult to replicate the pattern with <code>goroutines</code> and <code>channels</code>.</p>
<hr>

<p>First, let’s experiment with a simple use case: <code>await</code> a result from an <code>async</code> function.</p>
<pre><code>


<span>const</span> longRunningTask = <span>async</span> () =&gt; {
    
    sleep(<span>3000</span>);
    <span>return</span> <span>Math</span>.floor(<span>Math</span>.random() * <span>Math</span>.floor(<span>100</span>));
};

<span>const</span> r = <span>await</span> longRunningTask();
<span>console</span>.log(r);
</code></pre>
<pre><code>


<span>package</span> main

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"math/rand"</span>
    <span>"time"</span>
)

<span><span>func</span> <span>longRunningTask</span><span>()</span> &lt;-<span>chan</span> <span>int32</span></span> {
    r := <span>make</span>(<span>chan</span> <span>int32</span>)

    <span>go</span> <span><span>func</span><span>()</span></span> {
        <span>defer</span> <span>close</span>(r)

        
        time.Sleep(time.Second * <span>3</span>)
        r &lt;- rand.Int31n(<span>100</span>)
    }()

    <span>return</span> r
}

<span><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span></span> {
    r := &lt;-longRunningTask()
    fmt.Println(r)
}
</code></pre>
<p>To declare an “async” function in Go:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The return type is <code>&lt;-chan ReturnType</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Within the function, create a channel by <code>make(chan ReturnType)</code> and return the created channel at the end of the function.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Start an anonymous goroutine by <code>go func() {...}</code> and implement the function’s logic inside that anonymous function.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Return the result by sending the value to the channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At the beginning of the anonymous function, add <code>defer close(r)</code> to close the channel once done.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To “await” the result, simply read the value from the channel by <code>v := &lt;- fn()</code>.</p>
<hr>

<p>It’s very common that we start multiple async tasks then wait for all of them to finish and gather their results. Doing that is quite simple in both JavaScript and Go.</p>
<pre><code>


<span>const</span> longRunningTask = <span>async</span> () =&gt; {
    
    sleep(<span>3000</span>);
    <span>return</span> <span>Math</span>.floor(<span>Math</span>.random() * <span>Math</span>.floor(<span>100</span>));
};

<span>const</span> [a, b, c] = <span>await</span> <span>Promise</span>.all(longRunningTask(), 
                                    longRunningTask(), 
                                    longRunningTask());
<span>console</span>.log(a, b, c);
</code></pre>
<pre><code>


<span>package</span> main

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"math/rand"</span>
    <span>"time"</span>
)

<span><span>func</span> <span>longRunningTask</span><span>()</span> &lt;-<span>chan</span> <span>int32</span></span> {
    r := <span>make</span>(<span>chan</span> <span>int32</span>)

    <span>go</span> <span><span>func</span><span>()</span></span> {
        <span>defer</span> <span>close</span>(r)

        
        time.Sleep(time.Second * <span>3</span>)
        r &lt;- rand.Int31n(<span>100</span>)
    }()

    <span>return</span> r
}

<span><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span></span> {
    aCh, bCh, cCh := longRunningTask(), longRunningTask(), longRunningTask()
    a, b, c := &lt;-aCh, &lt;-bCh, &lt;-cCh

    fmt.Println(a, b, c)
}
</code></pre>
<p>We have to do it in 2 lines of code and introduce 3 more variables, but it’s clean and simple enough.</p>
<p>We can not do <code>&lt;-longRun(), &lt;-longRun(), &lt;-longRun()</code>, which will <code>longRun()</code> one by one instead all in once.</p>
<hr>

<p>Sometimes, a piece of data can be received from several sources to avoid high latencies, or there’re cases that multiple results are generated but they’re equivalent and the only first response is consumed. This first-response-win pattern, therefore, is quite popular. Achieving that in both JavaScript and Go is very simple.</p>
<pre><code>


<span>const</span> one = <span>async</span> () =&gt; {
    
    sleep(<span>Math</span>.floor(<span>Math</span>.random() * <span>Math</span>.floor(<span>2000</span>)));
    <span>return</span> <span>1</span>;
};

<span>const</span> two = <span>async</span> () =&gt; {
    
    sleep(<span>Math</span>.floor(<span>Math</span>.random() * <span>Math</span>.floor(<span>1000</span>)));
    sleep(<span>Math</span>.floor(<span>Math</span>.random() * <span>Math</span>.floor(<span>1000</span>)));
    <span>return</span> <span>2</span>;
};

<span>const</span> r = <span>await</span> <span>Promise</span>.race(one(), two());
<span>console</span>.log(r);
</code></pre>
<pre><code>


<span>package</span> main

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"math/rand"</span>
    <span>"time"</span>
)

<span><span>func</span> <span>one</span><span>()</span> &lt;-<span>chan</span> <span>int32</span></span> {

        r &lt;- <span>1</span>
    }()

    <span>return</span> r
}

<span><span>func</span> <span>two</span><span>()</span> &lt;-<span>chan</span> <span>int32</span></span> {

    <span>select</span> {
    <span>case</span> r = &lt;-one():
    <span>case</span> r = &lt;-two():
    }

    fmt.Println(r)
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>select-case</code> is the pattern that Go designed specifically for racing channel operations. We can even do more stuff within each case, but we’re focusing only on the result so we just leave them all empty.</p>
<hr>

<p>Because Go’s error propagation model is very different from JavaScript, there aren't clean ways to replicate <code>Promise.then()</code> and <code>Promise.catch()</code>. In Go, errors are returned as return values, there aren't exceptions. Therefore, if your function can fail, you can consider changing your return <code>&lt;-chan ReturnType</code> into <code>&lt;-chan ReturnAndErrorType</code>, which is a <code>struct</code> holding both the result and error.</p>

                    <p>Introduction to Swift 
Get to know the main programming language for iOS development.</p>
<p>While we tend to hear about programming languages like Python and JavaScript all the time, Swift is a language that is a little bit less popular and a bit more niche. This does not mean that it is less importantâ€“itâ€™s the main programming language for a large variety of Apple devices. </p>
<p>In this article, we will introduce you to Swift, its past and its future, and give you reasons why you should start thinking about learning the language and/or building Swift projects. </p>
<h2>What is Swift?</h2>
<p>First released in 2014, Swift is a powerful general-purpose programming language for the Apple ecosystem. Whether you need to develop for iOS or any of the surrounding operating systems like macOS, tvOS, and others, it will be one of the main tools in your toolbelt. </p>
<p>Swift is focused on safety and clarity. By design, Swift eliminates certain classes of unsafe code that are still allowed in languages like JavaScript. Therefore, it enables developers to catch some bugs at compile time before shipping them out to the users. </p>
<p>On the other side, Swiftâ€™s clear and expressive syntax enables developers to write more concise programs than in languages like Java or C++.  </p>
<p>While itâ€™s being used mainly for Apple products, Swift has recently got some market share in areas like machine learning and web. For example, TensorFlow added Swift support because of the increased speed and type safety over Python, while server-side web frameworks like Vapor and Kitura are slowly gaining popularity. </p>
<h2>A brief history of Swift</h2>
<h3>Early brainstorming</h3>
<p>The development of Swift started in 2010. At that time, Chris Lattner (the creator of LLVM and Clang) had just finished adding C++ support for Clang, a compiler for the C-like language family. He was a bit burned out on C and decided that there was a better way of doing development. </p>
<p>Together with Bertrand Serlet, the head of the Apple software team, they came to a new, better alternative to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C">Objective-C</a> through numerous whiteboard sessions. In the beginning, the language was called Shiny (as in â€œthis new shiny thingâ€�).  </p>
<p>More than a year later, Lattner shared his project with his colleagues and managers at Apple. They admired the work Chris had done and assigned a team of developers to continue the project. </p>
<p>A lot of the features(like <a rel="nofollow" href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html">ARC</a>) that were added to Objective-C at that time actually came from Swift, and the team was considering just slowly upgrading Objective-C. But unfortunately, one of the main features of Swift is its memory safety. And if one takes memory management out of a C-like language, thereâ€™s not a whole lot of C left in it. Therefore, they started on a path towards Swift. </p>
<h3>Announcement and open-source release</h3>
<p>Swift was finally announced at Apple WWDC 14 as â€œObjective-C without Câ€�. You can see the full announcement video.
</p><div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MO7Ta0DvEWA?rel=0" width="560px" height="315px" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div>
<p>At the start, it wasnâ€™t open source. But, on December 3, 2015, the Swift version 2.2 was made open-source under the Apache License 2.0. for Apple's platforms and Linux. </p>
<h3>Fight for stability</h3>
<p>Through version 3.0, Swift had some stability issues. It was frequently changed in backward-incompatible ways, leading to older tutorials being too outdated to use. </p>
<p>In addition, the programs written in one version of Swift had problems working together with ones written in another version of Swift. This problem was solved when Swift 5 introduced ABI stability. </p>
<p>But all in all, the core team has expressed that source code compatibility is essential for them at this moment of Swiftâ€™s journey, so problems like these shouldnâ€™t be a thing anymore. Swift is a mature language now and is very well suited for both small and large projects. </p>
<h3>Future of Swift</h3>
<p>Right now, Swift is in 9th place in the PYPL index, just below its predecessor. Itâ€™s widely used for development in the Apple ecosystem, and it is quite clear that Apple itself has moved on from Objective-C to Swift as their language of choice for the future. </p>
<p>Whatâ€™s more, Swift engineers are in high demand among technology companies. Application developers are one of the most sought-after professions in the job market, and Swift is the main app programming language for iOS. Because Apple cares about Swift, it will continue to improve it for a long time and promote it to the top of the programming languages. </p>
<p>There is also a flip side to that. The language and its users are heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, and its future highly depends on the future of Apple. Fortunately, the languageâ€™s open-source nature enables developers to diversify against threats like that by creating frameworks and applications for Swift outside the Apple ecosystem. </p>
<h2>Swift vs. other alternatives</h2>
<p>Since thinking about Swift as the programming language of choice usually means that you are operating in the Apple ecosystem, itâ€™s not that useful to compare Swift to most other modern programming languages. However, Swift does have quite a lot of strong points such as safety and ease of use that makes it as good of a language as other modern programming languages like Rust. </p>
<p>Therefore, we will look at the situation where you are building an application for an Apple product, such as an iOS app. In that case, you have two choices that are not Swift. </p>
<h3>Objective-C</h3>
<p>Objective-C is a superset of the C programming language with OOP capabilities and a dynamic runtime. It was the language of choice for Apple products before, and multiple legacy codebases still use it.</p>
<p>Even though it is more popular according to the PYPL index that tracks searches for language tutorials, itâ€™s clear that Objective-C is in slow decline. Most of the things that Objective-C can do, Swift can do in a more accessible and safer way, so it is not wise to start most of the new projects in Objective-C. </p>
<h3>Cross-platform frameworks</h3>
<p>There are multiple cross-platform frameworks out there that enable developers to develop for Android and iOS systems at the same time. Among them, we can list React Native, Flutter, Xamarin, and others. </p>
<p>These are a pragmatic choice if you need to quickly launch a simple app on both platforms, but do bring performance costs and can raise some problems if you need non-standard components for your app that the framework does not support. If you do not take care when deciding on cross-platform vs. native, you might end up doing three times the work instead of saving half of it. </p>
<h2>Swift as the first programming language</h2>
<p>Each programming language has its unique characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. Among  Swiftâ€™s benefits are its practicality and increased developer productivity, enabling developers to quickly create prototypes and MVPs. At the same time, Swift is a powerful tool for building large applications like Twitter or Waze.</p>
<p>Many developers consider Swift to be a wonderful choice for the first programming language. Apple and the Swift community have put a lot of time and effort into creating easy-to-read documentation, high-quality instructive content, and a supportive environment for new Swift developers. </p>
<p>If you are a new developer thinking about which language to start with, here are some arguments in its favor:</p>
<ul>
<li>If youâ€™re a solopreneur, creating programs for Apple devices gives you access to a well-paying audience of Apple Store users.</li>
<li>If you prefer working as a hired specialist, knowing Swift on an intermediate level already allows you to earn from $2000 per month (depending on the country you live and work in).</li>
<li>Apple is a cutting-edge technology giant, which means you'll always be able to work and experiment with modern tools, features, and libraries.</li>
<li>Swift is used for writing programs for a range of Apple devices, so having learned one language, you can work on all of them.</li>
<li>Thanks to the Swift programming language's community, Swift is relatively easy to learn. You can easily find a large amount of free quality Swift content on the Internet.</li>
<li>Today, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/">there are more than 3 400 000 apps</a> in the App Store. Of course, not all of them are native and written in Swift, but it is safe to say that a least half of them are Swift-based. In 2019, the number of apps was just 3 000 000, and the statistics show constant exponential growth. This will undoubtedly lead to a higher demand for Swift developers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Starting with Swift</h2>
<p>There are multiple great resources available to learn more about Swift. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/">Swift Programming Language</a>. The official Swift book that will give you all the info you need to start creating your own iOS project. </li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcsY1YPBwzQ">Learn Swift Fast</a>. If you learn better through video, thereâ€™s a 3-hour video course on YouTube that will cover all the Swift basics. </li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/">Hacking With Swift</a>. A website that hosts Swift content, including articles, news, example code, and much more. </li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exercism.io/tracks/swift">Exercism Swift track</a>. Eighty-three exercises that will let you boost your Swift skills and receive feedback from experienced mentors, all for free. </li>
</ul>

<p>It’s been nearly three years since the Bitcoin price has reached a benchmark of over $15k and it doesn’t seem to be stopping. But, it’s not just the price of BTC that is overflowing. New Bitcoin addresses have also skyrocketed.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>On November, 18th, one week after Bitcoin broke its 15K boundary, <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1329045245212971010?s=20">Glassnode</a>, a crypto-analysis company, tweeted an unusually high number of BTC accounts being created.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">In the past hour we observed the highest number of newly created addresses in the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> network since January 2018 📈</p>
<p>Chart: <a href="https://t.co/fTmoH5ezNw">https://t.co/fTmoH5ezNw</a> <a href="https://t.co/INq7sEEtoM">pic.twitter.com/INq7sEEtoM</a></p>
<p>— glassnode (@glassnode) <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1329045245212971010?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2020</a></p></blockquote>

<p>According to Glassnode, the address per hour rate increased to almost 25,000, a rate not seen since January 2018 when BTC hit $20k.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To put this number into perceptive, the most Bitcoin address ever created within a 24-hour period was on December 21, 2017 when nearly 600,000 popped up. Will we see this FOMO craze again if <a href="https://coincolony.net/bitcoin-technical-analysis-can-we-see-20k-again/">BTC hits $20k</a> by the end of the year?</p>
<p>We have seen a steady rise in public BTC implementation as well as business incorporation this year. This caused the price of BTC to go from $4k at the beginning of 2020 to $18k currently.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>However, universal usage is still minuscule with as much as <a href="https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2017-04-20-global-cryptocurrency-benchmarking-study.pdf">5.8 million cryptocurrency wallets</a> active in 2017. That equates to less than .1% of the global population own crypto.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It will be interesting to see the adoption rates increase as the BTC price continues to rise and steady at a price that most people feel comfortable enough to buy, use, and save longterm.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

Previously scheduled for late May 2019 in Colombo, Sri Lanka, but moved to Geneva, Switzerland over security concerns, CoP18 is of great importance to Pembient. That is because it potentially marks the halfway point in a global struggle over how to regulate certain wildlife products produced through biotechnology, including biofabricated rhino horns. Surprisingly, this struggle has received little attention in the press despite its possible impact on a range of medicines and materials. Additionally, the broader biotechnology industry has all but ignored it.</p><p>Before continuing, however, it might be useful to review CITES and what is at stake. CITES is an international treaty designed to protect wild plants and animals from over-exploitation. It has been in force since 1975. Almost every country in the world is a party to CITES, and each signatory agrees to pass legislation to implement CITES directives. The result is that rulings made under the auspices of CITES effectively become the law everywhere. Some view CITES as an efficient way to limit and, in extreme cases, halt the trade in endangered species. Others believe it disempowers people, especially indigenous communities, and prevents the development of specialized or localized responses to specific conservation dilemmas.</p><p>Approximately every three years, the parties to CITES gather at a&nbsp;Conference of the Parties (e.g., CoP18). Qualified observers, such as activists, academic institutions, and private sector entities, attend too. Together, they discuss possible changes to CITES in the form of amendments, resolutions, and decisions; although, the parties, and only the parties, actually vote on which ones to adopt. Of the changes under consideration, amendments are the most significant as they usually list a species to one of the treaty's appendices, thus granting it legal protection. Resolutions, alternatively, are aimed at lastingly improving the scope and effectiveness of CITES. Decisions are similar to resolutions, but shorter in duration. The conclusion of a Conference of Parties kicks off a cycle of interim meetings, eventually culminating in another CoP. These interim meetings include meetings of the Animals Committee (e.g., AC29), a group of scientific experts, and the Standing Committee (e.g., SC69), a group of policy experts. The CITES Secretariat, a permanent administrative office based out of Geneva, Switzerland, coordinates all of the above activities.</p><p>When a species becomes CITES-listed, any trade restrictions thereby secured apply not only to live animals but also to carcasses and readily recognizable parts or derivatives thereof. With Resolution Conf. 9.6 (Rev. CoP16), the term "readily recognizable part or derivative" has been expanded to "include any specimen which appears from an accompanying document, the packaging or a mark or label, or from any other circumstances, to be a part or derivative." Interestingly, the same resolution implies that urine and feces are not parts or derivatives as long as they are "naturally excreted." The unstated assumption being that these waste products would be parts or derivatives if they were somehow invasively extracted. In this context, it is unclear whether a biofabricated rhino horn, appropriately labeled, should be considered to be derived from a rhinoceros. The final determination, just as in the case of waste products, may depend entirely upon its production method.</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>The notion that CITES might cover certain bioengineered wildlife products first arose during CoP12 in Santiago, Chile in 2002. It was then that Switzerland, on behalf of the Standing Committee, proposed to exempt synthetically produced drugs and DNA, along with urine and feces, from CITES. That effort, and a subsequent one at CoP13 in Bangkok, Thailand in 2004, floundered. The issue reentered the spotlight in 2015 when Pembient announced its intentions to biofabricate rhino horns. Shortly after that, as chronicled below, a new policy cycle began.</p><p><strong>CoP17, Johannesburg (South Africa), September 2016</strong></p><p>Going into CoP17, the United States circulated <a href="https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/cop/17/InfDocs/E-CoP17-Inf-22.pdf">a document prepared by the International Environmental Law Project (IELP)</a> and endorsed by several activists. The authors of this document argued that CITES already covered trade in bioengineered wildlife products. More specifically, they interpreted the term "readily recognizable part or derivative" broadly. For them, the totality of the circumstances determined whether a product qualified as a specimen of a CITES-listed species. Or, in other words, what mattered was the form of the product, not its production method. Nonetheless, the authors sought to revise Resolution Conf. 9.6 (Rev. CoP16) to include any products that scientifically tested to be specimens of CITES-listed species, even if their physical components did not originate from an actual plant or animal. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed, and the Conference of Parties adopted&nbsp;Decisions 17.89 to 17.91 on "specimens produced from synthetic or cultured DNA." The gist of these decisions was that the Secretariat and the various committees of CITES would further review the issue with the aim of making recommendations for consideration at CoP18 in 2019.</p><p><strong>AC29, Geneva (Switzerland), July 2017</strong></p><p>The 29th meeting of the Animals Committee focused, among other things, on finalizing the terms of reference for a study on "wildlife products produced from synthetic or cultured DNA." The task fell to an in-session drafting group whose membership consisted of the United States, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, and a representative of Europe. What was decided was that the study would have three parts. The first part would describe ways of artificially producing DNA and wildlife products. The second part would explore regulatory options for bioengineered wildlife products, with an emphasis on operationalizing the terms "parts" and "derivatives" in Resolution Conf. 9.6 (Rev. CoP16). Finally, the third part would discuss anti-counterfeiting measures for the detection of bioengineered wildlife products and related technical matters. The Secretariat committed to hiring a consultant to conduct the study using $20,000 donated by the United States.</p><p><strong>SC69, Geneva (Switzerland), November 2017</strong></p><p>During the 69th meeting of the Standing Committee, an intersessional working group on "synthetic or cultured DNA" was established. This group's purpose was to review the consultant's report, once available, and formulate recommendations. Austria, Cameroon, Canada, China, Israel, Peru, Republic of Korea, South Africa, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States joined the working group, and Mexico became its chair. A slew of activists also joined, chief among them the IELP and its clients: the Center for Biological Diversity and the World Wildlife Fund.</p><p><strong>AC30, Geneva (Switzerland), July 2018</strong></p><p>By the time of the 30th meeting of the Animals Committee, the Secretariat had hired a consultant, Dr. Julian Kinderlerer, an esteemed law professor. He presented <a href="https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/com/ac-pc/ac30-pc24/AC30-14-PC24-14-R1-A5.pdf">a partially completed report</a> at the meeting. This draft fulfilled most of the study's terms of reference, except it omitted the second part concerning regulatory options.</p><p>Unfortunately, his report was not well received. Some felt it was overly broad and needlessly detailed. They did not understand the necessity of reviewing technologies ranging from DNA synthesis to cell culture to tissue engineering. Nor did they grasp the salient differences between production methods and how those differences could have regulatory ramifications. Others expressed concern that the draft mentioned potential positive impacts of bioengineering wildlife products despite activists' misgivings. Regardless, there was a consensus that nothing should be done pending the completion of the full report—ostensibly pushing the specter of regulation off until CoP19 in 2022. </p><p>One critical thing that the draft brought to the fore was that the term "cultured DNA" was nonstandard. This realization resulted in a formal change of title for the subject matter from "specimens produced from synthetic or cultured DNA" to "specimens produced through biotechnology."</p><p><strong>SC70, Sochi (Russia), October 2018</strong></p><p>Dr. Kinderlerer submitted <a href="https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/com/sc/70/E-SC70-33-A6.pdf">his full report</a> to the intersessional working group prior to the start of the 70th meeting of the Standing Committee. Nevertheless, even with the inclusion of a section on regulatory options, many concluded that the study did not provide sufficient direction to help the working group advance. So, at the opening of SC70, there was still a need to find agreement on whether and how to regulate bioengineered wildlife products linked to CITES-listed species.</p><p>Two lines of thought emerged. Activists, concerned that bioengineered wildlife products could reach the market before CoP19 in 2022, urged the immediate application of Resolution Conf. 9.6 (Rev. CoP16). Various policymakers, on the other hand, expressed concern that the term "readily recognizable part or derivative" used in Resolution Conf. 9.6 (Rev. CoP16) had become antiquated and needed modernization.</p><p>The Chair of the Standing Committee convened an in-session working group to address these issues and forge a way forward. Four countries and four organizations formed this working group. The countries were Mexico, France, Norway, and the United States. The organizations were the IELP and the Center for Biological Diversity, as per usual, along with China Wildlife and San Deigo Zoo Global. A set of four recommendation came out of the deliberations, the first three of which either affirmed the immediate applicability of Resolution Conf. 9.6 (Rev. CoP16) or explicitly broadened it. Fortunately, the European Union, not always perceived as a friend of biotechnology, blocked the first three recommendations on …</p></div></div></div>

<p>We’re going to be a bit silly this week (in part because the ending of this compressed semester has left me with little time) and talk about the recently released historical action-RPG computer (and console) game, <em>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla</em>, set in 9th century Norway and England.</p>



<p>And, as with the last time we did this, I should note that this isn’t a <em>game review</em>.  As a <strong>game</strong>, <em>AC: Valhalla</em> is perfectly serviceable and quite fun.  I don’t think it got the same amount of developer time as its predecessor, <em>Odyssey</em>, but it is also a more focused experience than <em>Odyssey</em> was, which runs to its benefit.  Everything here basically works and while I find some of the game design decisions puzzling (the largest being how long the game makes you wait <em>hours </em>before you have a full set of all three armor types and all weapon types, given that you may be getting bonuses to them in the skill tree many hours before you find <em>any at all</em>), <strong>it is overall fine.  It’s fun.</strong></p>

<p>But you aren’t here for my game reviews. You are here for me to talk about the <em>history</em> behind the game.  And normally, I would leave a product like this alone (this is only thinly historical fiction, given the crazy background plot that ties the games together).  But each <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game includes not just meticulous recreations of historical <em>places</em> (and to be clear, I mean the physical buildings and landscapes, not the cultures or politics, but also some form of this statement:</p>



<blockquote><p>Inspired by historical events and characters, this work of fiction was designed, developed, and produced by a multicultural team of various beliefs, sexual orientations and gender identities.</p></blockquote>



<p>(yes, the odd decision to use and then not use the Oxford comma is preserved from the original).  That is <em>Valhalla’s </em>version of the statement.  <strong>That statement is making a claim about the product that follows</strong>.  Some of those claims are explicit (this is based on real history at some level) and some are implicit (our diverse team means this game was produced in a careful, sensitive way).  <strong>And those claims deserve interrogation.</strong></p>

<h2>The Nitpicks</h2>



<p>My thoughts on <em>Valhalla</em> fit into two main categories: complaints of historical accuracy that I think are largely unimportant, but fun to note, and<strong> complaints about tone and framing which I think <em>are</em> important and worth discussing</strong>.  <strong>We can start with the frivolous stuff</strong>.  If you want to skip to the meat of the analysis, you are welcome to jump right to the next section, but I know some folks like to know about this stuff, so here it is.</p>



<p><strong>First off, because it is a core area of my specialty: the weapons and armor.  </strong>The military equipment we see here is very hit-or-miss and<strong> there are honestly quite a lot of misses</strong>.  They at least have, for the most part, the relatively light design of battle axes correct, in both their two-handed and one-handed varieties.  And I can understand from a game design standpoint the decision to not give the player a one-handed sword and to instead fill that role with the more iconic one-handed axe; NPCs use one-handed swords, so it isn’t that they don’t exist, merely that our character doesn’t prefer them.  Technically, sword-and-shield and spear-and-shield are both possible, but only with a high level perk, which is pretty silly given that these were the most common non-elite fighting styles of the era by some distance.</p>



<p>But things go poorly from there.  There is a ‘flail’ type weapon, despite – <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/06/07/collections-the-siege-of-gondor-part-v-just-flailing-about-flails/">as we’ve discussed</a>, actually – flail chain weapons being both not of this period, poorly attested in general and also not common in this part of the world in <em>any </em>period.  The large two-handed swords – the only kinds of swords the player can use – are around <em>three hundred</em> years too early and don’t really resemble their later variations either (they are much too thick and heavy, being mostly up-scaled period swords, which makes them look absurd).  And yes, there were two-handed swords in antiquity in Thrace and Illyria (the falx and rhomphaia) but this is both not that part of the world, not antiquity, and these are not those swords.  I am befuddled that, with two other two-handed weapons that fit the period (a thrusting spear and a two-handed axe) that they felt the need to include ‘greatswords.’  Also, they are carried by way of back-scabbards, which…sigh…no.</p>



<p><strong>The armor is generally a bigger ‘miss’ than the weapons.</strong>  There is a <em>lot</em> of soft ‘leather’ armor here of exactly the sort that was not used historically.  What is baffling uncommon is <em>mail</em> – especially among the Norse and Danes (there’s a bit more mail on the Saxons) –  which would have been, in this period, by far the most common metal body protection.  Pretty much all of Eivor’s warrior band ought to be wearing mail.  Instead, there is a lot of scale armor; scale was certainly used in this period in England, but it was a lot less common than mail (there are also things like brigandine armor roughly 400 years too early).  I have noticed a real trend of game developers using lots of scale armor when mail would be more correct; I wonder if it is easier for an art-team to produce the assets for it or if they think it looks cooler.  But in any event, audiences looking for a realistic sweep of ninth century equipment will not find it here.  I would say, for the more ‘exotic’ player armors, that I think the developers here missed a trick – the game sets up early that we have people from the Near East and even the Far East in the player’s clan.  I think that would set up an opportunity to have the honestly rather more varied and potentially visually interesting armors from the Near East – a lot more scale, but also Near Eastern lamellar or even Chinese-style lamellar coats.  Alas, no.</p>

Even vikings <strong>cared</strong> about their appearances!</figcaption></figure>



<p>In terms of <em>clothing</em>, it is both hit and miss, but a bit more hit than miss compared to equipment.  Some of the Norse and Danish wear is ‘hollywood barbarian’ (lots of rough fur, inexplicably low-coverage clothing in freezing climates, lots of random leather) which remains truly frustrating.  But <em>most</em> of the clothing isn’t this way.  One odd area is color: <strong>medieval clothing, contrary to what you often see in films, was <em>colorful</em>, often with lots of bold primary colors</strong> (bright reds, yellows, greens, blues).  In <em>Valhalla</em>, the developers have opted to use clothing color to signify faction (friendly Danes wear green, the Norse blue, hostile Danes red, hostile Saxons yellow) and to keep non-combatants in drab colors.  I get the design reason (they want you to pay attention to enemies, not non-combatants) but it is frustrating, apart from the monks, that this makes so many of the townsfolk drab and dull.  <strong>Still, it was very nice to see Norse and Danes in bright primary colors, often with lovely border-stitching on their clothes and lots of clear care.</strong></p>



<p>In terms of architecture, I very much like that buildings in settlements, especially high status ones, are often well built, with lots of designs and carving work in the wood.  I am less thrilled with the way churches are done: typically in plain stone with plaster; some color is often added by lighting effects through stained glass.  But these are medieval Catholic churches, they should be brightly painted and colored in the interior and in most cases – <em>especially</em> in big towns and monasteries – very well kept up.  If you want to see this done better, <strong><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> is a deeply flawed game that nevertheless does medieval town architecture and clothing quite a lot better</strong> (but maybe watch a Let’s Play; while <em>KC:D </em>is fun once it gets properly going, it’s a case where I don’t think the juice is worth the squeeze; I invested the time to get properly into the game and I don’t think it was really worth it).</p>

Also, why are the big banners so ragged and faded?  This is an active religious center!  It would be kept <strong>clean</strong> and <strong>well cared for</strong>!</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Diversity</h2>



<p>This isn’t really a nitpick or a substantive issue, so I am giving it its own section in between the two.  Let me be frank: <strong>I fully understand the desire of the developers to deviate from history on some of these points in order to make a more inclusive game</strong>.  These games do not market themselves as pure historical simulations, so this does not bother me; in fact I think it is broadly a positive thing that game studios are doing this (so long as they are <em>open</em> about fudging the history).  So if you were hoping for a lot of table-pounding here, you are bound to be disappointed.  Still, we’re assessing the game historically, so it seems worthwhile to point some of these things out.</p>



<p>First, on gender diversity, so far the game has built up a quiet contrast between the English, who are gender-stratified, and the Norse and Danes, who are much less so.  Saxon troopers are all male, but Danish and Norse NPCs include women.  All of the Saxon leaders I’ve met so far in the game are male, while one of the first jarls you meet in England is a woman ruling in her own name.  Saxon clothing is sharply gendered (men in pants, women in dresses), but Norse and Danish clothing generally isn’t (which is a clear design choice, since this is very much <em>not</em> true historically).  And, as with <em>AC: Odyssey</em>, if you play a female main character, absolutely no one seems to care or notice.</p>

Quite the contrary.'</em></p><p><em>'Spinoza, the great monist, objected to dualities in just about every domain. He was everywhere interested in fusing, in unifying, what seemed to be polarities, collapsing dualities.

After all, why is it even worthwhile to struggle to know Reality, to struggle after anything at all, if the self that’s motivating the struggle is ultimately nothing at all?</em>'</p><p><img src="https://static.s123-cdn.com/uploads/2029468/2000_5fb4f9aa5c205.jpg"></p><p><a href="http://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/rebecca-goldstein"><u>Rebecca Newberger Goldstein</u></a> is an American philosopher, novelist and public intellectual. She has written ten books, both fiction and nonfiction. Here she discusses the relationship between science and philosophy, the nature of philosophical progress, Gödel’s theorems, Incompleteness, Einstein, Realism and postmodernism, Gödel and Wittgenstein, Spinoza, Spinoza and his appeal to imaginative writers, the Spinoza War, and Moby Dick.</p><p><strong>3:16:</strong> What made you become a philosopher?</p><p><strong>Rebecca Newberger Goldstein</strong> <strong>:</strong>&nbsp; I started out mostly interested in math and physics. There were problems that obsessed me in both fields—How can math be <em>a priori</em>? How can quantum mechanics be connected to a reality that is recognizably our own? I discovered, while in college, that these were actually philosophical problems. My senior year in college I went to speak to one of my professors, Sidney Morgenbesser, an amazing guy. He was the Socrates of his day. Socrates never published anything, but instead engaged in deeply probing dialogues. That was Sidney’s m.o. as well. Over the course of several long conversations Sidney convinced me that I was a philosopher, rather than a scientist. His clinching argument was that scientists are like the bourgeoisie, never questioning the system, whereas philosophers were like socialists, always examining the system critically: even if it seemed to be working, <em>ought</em> it to be working? That argument struck home. I basically applied to graduate school in philosophy on the strength of Sidney’s metaphor.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://static.s123-cdn.com/uploads/2029468/2000_5fb4ed28d1e2b.png"></p><p><strong>3:16:</strong> In your book <u>‘<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00KEW8KC4/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i1">Plato at the Googleplex</a>’ y</u>ou have Plato brought into our century to discuss philosophy with our contemporaries. So first, can you say what you take philosophy to be and why you think it hasn’t gone away and isn’t going away soon?</p><p><strong>RNG:</strong> I think that philosophy is the systematic and rigorous investigation of one of the deepest urges that we humans have, which is the urge to get our bearings in the most general sense possible. In particular, (1) We want to know where we are. What is the nature of this universe in which we find ourselves? What fundamentally different kinds of things, belonging to different ontological categories, are there, and how do they operate? 2. We want to know our own place in the universe, whether we’re made of the same stuff, are a special category of being, and whether the universe itself has any attitudes towards us. 3. We want to know what we are meant to do with our lives. We want to know what it is to live a life worthy for a human to live, a good life.&nbsp;</p><p>The first two questions are ontological, the third is normative. Science, as it eventually developed, has the lead role in answering the ontological questions, but science is often pushed on by philosophy, in its critical probing role. And the more subtle the science becomes, the bigger the role for philosophy, since it falls to philosophy’s special techniques to figure out what is and isn’t entailed by the science. For example, what changes are we required to make to our concept of time in light of Relativity Theory? And as far as the normative questions go, there the ball falls squarely in philosophy’s court, though it’s sometimes advancements in science and technology that generate the balls, that is, new normative questions.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider the normative questions generated by advances in AI, or the question of what obligations we have to future generations, given the threat of climate change. As long as science and technology advance, philosophers will have new questions to work on.</p><p><strong>3:16:</strong>&nbsp; You place Plato in rooms having philosophical debates with all sorts of people but you never have him decisively concluding a debate or argument. For those hostile to philosophy this might be a hostage to fortune – it suggests that philosophy can’t decide anything and actually we would be better off listening to scientists, historians and novelists. Why should we heed the philosopher in our time if not even Plato can answer its questions? What do you say to those physicists who say philosophy is just pointless and has been supplanted by – well, in their case – physics?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RNG:</strong> When it comes to ontology, I would argue that it’s science that plays the leading role. But I’d have to offer a philosophical argument to support that conclusion. I'd first have to both differentiate what is essential to science, how it differs from other fields of inquiry, including philosophy, and I’d have to argue for scientific realism, that is argue that science is in the business of ontology. Both of those are conclusions that can’t be empirically established, i.e. they are philosophical. So one can’t even make the case for science, ontologically speaking, without engaging in philosophy. And as far as the normative questions go, we are entirely in the philosophical sphere. And here I do think philosophy has offered us answers, answers which have as fundamentally changed our lives, and for the better, as the technological advances that science has given us.&nbsp;</p><p>As just one example, consider the idea of human rights. One of my points in my having Plato engage in those philosophical dialogues in which it’s not he who supplies the answer, but instead he is rather surprised by being philosophically instructed by some “regular” people, was to demonstrate the progress we’ve made since Plato, progress that has been disseminated and seeped into the points of view of non-philosophers. In the first dialogue a rather down-to-earth character, a media escort, explains to Plato in very commonsensical terms why slavery is wrong. Plato had argued that it’s wrong for Greeks to enslave other Greeks, which was an advance over the norm taken for granted by his society, but he never universalized the conclusion. Nor did Aristotle, who argued that some people are naturally suited to be slaves. So if I don’t have Plato having all the answers it’s often to show progress made in the millennia since he lived, or to show that our new conditions, many of them created by scientific and technological advances, generate new philosophical problems--in other words to show that philosophy will never go away. My showing Plato to be often instructed and/or stumped is meant to challenge the view that philosophy remains static.</p><p><strong>3:16:</strong>&nbsp; So this leads to one of the issues you raise in the book - the notion of philosophical progress. So what do you take to be the progress philosophy has made since Plato and why is it invisible to many, unlike science?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RNG:</strong> Philosophical advances in epistemology and in ethics profoundly shape our points of view. We don’t see them precisely because we see with them. It’s like the fish who responds to the question “How’s the water today?” with “Water? What’s water?” When people hold the view, for example, that science has discovered that simultaneity is not absolute, as counter-intuitive as that seems, or that chattel slavery is an abomination, which once also had seemed counter-intuitive, they don’t realize the laborious philosophical reasoning that had laid the groundwork for their views. It takes philosophical work to claim that science can correct our fundamental views of the way the world is. It takes philosophical work to claim that we can discover, without consulting any holy books (that in fact sanction slavery), truths about the way humans can and can’t be treated. Philosophy is committed to the view that we can use human reason to come to ethical conclusions, overcoming biases, tradition, and religious authority. Just the other week the Pope gave his approval to civil unions for gay people. That is the slow progress of the philosophical idea of human rights working its way out. You could even consider such changes in ethical attitudes, eventually making their way even to the Vatican, as philosophy’s own technological products, the practical application of philosophical conclusions, analogous to the technological goodies that have come from science. In fact, you can even regard science itself as one of philosophy’s technological products, the practical application of certain epistemological conclusions.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://static.s123-cdn.com/uploads/2029468/2000_5fb4edb79cae4.png"></p><p><strong>3:16:</strong>&nbsp; You’ve written about <u><em>Gödel</em></u><a href="http://www.bookdepository.com/Incompleteness-Rebecca-Goldstein/9780393327601?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1605692840648&amp;sr=1-1"><u><em>’s incompleteness theorems</em></u></a>. …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div>

            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I reached a point in my career a few years ago where I wished I <em>had</em> an MBA, but it was difficult to <em>get</em> an MBA. It would be hard to stop working and get one, hard and expensive to find the time to do a part-time one, and I wasn't working for a place that would pay for one at the time.</p>
<p>I don't need the structure of an MBA program to provide motivation, and I'm not afraid to read. So I decided instead to just focus my reading practice towards an MBA curriculum.</p>
<p>My focus was on a <em>Tech</em> MBA which to me means learning about how to start, grow, and manage technology companies. The curriculum would need all the typical core classes, but electives that focus on technology leadership.</p>
<p>My research found all sorts of great sources for ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The assigned books of the top traditional MBA programs, and more tech-focused programs such as the <a href="http://www.stern.nyu.edu/programs-admissions/tech-mba/program">Stern Tech MBA</a>, <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/programs/masters-programs/johnson-cornell-tech-mba">Cornell Tech MBA</a>, <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/">MIT Sloan</a> (<em>cool, they used a <a href="https://blog.davidtate.org/clear-and-present-leadership/">blog post</a> of mine in a <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/best-of-this-week-creative-culture-interviews/">weekly link roundup</a></em>), and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/master-science-product-management">CMU's Masters of Product Management</a>.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="content-pane">
  <div>
    
    <p>If you’re reading this post on my new LoneStar Electronics MMDVM hotspot, then you no doubt decided to explore the option of buiding one yourself after noting the price of some of the commercially available hotspots. For example the Zumspot form Ham Radio Outlet retails between $150 - $160, and that’s not including a case to safeguard it. And let’s not forget about BridgeCom Systems who absolutely rape you on the price of their SkyBridge Hotspot; $299 is rip off.</p>
<p>So, “What did you build and what did it cost?” you ask. I built a simple small form MMDVM hotspot using the LoneStar MMDVM Simplex Board. Combined cost for the build is $140, and if you want the OLED screen you can add on another $10 for a total $150. Now before you start complaining there are Jumbospots on eBay for $75, let me remind you that those are made from questionable components. If you want to purchase one of these, fine but don’t be surprised if it underperforms or completely dies on you. That’s the price you pay for not paying full price.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the build, allow me give you a little background of my motivations behind this project and my requirements. To begin with, I believe the cost of commercially available hotspots is too high provided the quality of components used. Second, I didn’t like any of the available options on the market.</p>
<p>I think the OLED screen that’s attached to most MMDVM boards is ridiculously small. During my research on hotspot cases, I came across the line of cases from C4Labs with either 2.4” or 3.5” Nextion screens. This intrigued me because they are so much bigger than the OLED screens attached to the MMDVM boards. Bigger is better right?! Well… it turns out the screen is just a novelty and doesn’t provide any functionally beyond displaying which room/reflector/talkgroup you’re connected to and the callsign of the current person speaking. My Yaseu FT3D already does this for me. I asked around and couldn’t find anyone who thought it was a must have feature. Knowing this, I decided that I didn’t need either the OLED or Nextion screen. However, I still want the option to attach a screen to my hotspot should I change my mind in the future.</p>
<p>One of the biggest complaints against hotspots is the accusation that it isn’t real ham radio because most users operate them within ten feet of themselves. Personally I don’t care what you’re opinion on this topic is, the fact of the mater is that I’m going to be within ten feet of my hotspot when I employ it. With such limited distances between the users and their hotspot, I challenge the need for SMA connectors attached to the MMDVM board. The connectors are just soldered onto the board with nothing more to secure them in place. Luckily the MMDVM board I want to use comes with a ceramic antenna surface mounted onto the board. No need for me to worry about breaking the solder joints on a SMA connector.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s move onto the parts utilized for this build.</p>
<h2 id="parts-list">Parts List</h2>

</figure>

<p>The most essential component of a hotspot is the MMDVM board. I want the most superior performance and quality for my hotspot, so I don’t want to compromise by buying a cheap MMDVM board. The LoneStar MMDVM Simplex Board, designed by N5BOC David Dennis, is considerable more expensive than other MMDVM boards, however it’s constructed of higher-quality components and has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has its own dedicated 3.3V regulator and does not pull voltage off of the noisy Raspberry Pi 3.3V line like all other simplex board do.</li>
<li>The board is a four layer PCB with large ground planes for 3.3V and GND sandwiched in the middle of the PCB. This acts as one very large decoupling cap the size of the entire board. Also this isolates signals between top side and bottom side.</li>
<li>All of the Analog RF signals are on the top side only and the high harmonic digital signals are all kept isolated on the bottom side. Making this board much more stable. It should also make it more sensitive on receive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c4labs-jrz-1s-case">C4Labs JRZ-1S Case</h3>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>I like this case; it’s modest yet does the job very well once it’s completely together. As an added touch of class, I went with the wood inlays. I also sanded the sides of the case with 400 grit sandpaper to give it that frosted glass look. I appreciate how it turned out. The actual case is engineered very well with the components fitting in securely inside. Interestingly enough one layer of the case does include holes drilled in it to support the prongs of an SMA connector. It’s a thoughtful touch, but I’m keenly uninterested in trying to find out how well they work.</p>
<h3 id="raspberry-pi-zero-wh">Raspberry Pi Zero WH</h3>

</figure>

<p>Nothing extremely exceptional about this other than I purchased it from Adafruit. I went with the Zero WH instead of the Zero W, because I don’t know how to solder very well and didn’t want to ruin the thing. One of these days I need to force myself to learn and become better.</p>
<h2 id="the-finished-build">The Finished Build</h2>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here’s the finished hotspot. If you look in the top right-hand corner above the heatsink, you’ll recognize the ceramic antenna. With the hotspot located in my basement, I’m nevertheless able to connect to it will my Yaesu FT3D running 300 mW. Should I want to ever want to attach a screen I can because there are connections present for the Nextion and OLED displays. The only gripe I have remains the location of the micro-USB port on the Pi Zero. If you couldn’t determine from the photo the case is upside down. Well, I can’t do anything about that so, I’ll have to live with it. Overall I’m impressed with the build quality of the hotspot and look forward to using it for years to come.</p>

            <!-- content --><p>ZFS has become increasingly popular in recent years. ZFS on Linux (ZoL) has pushed the envelope and exposed many newcomers to the ZFS fold. iXsystems has adopted the newer codebase, now called <strong>OpenZFS, </strong>into its codebase for TrueNAS CORE. The purpose of this article is to help those of you who have heard about ZFS but have not yet had the opportunity to research it.</p>
<p>Our hope is that we leave you with a better understanding of how and why it works the way it does. Knowledge is key to the decision-making process, and we feel that ZFS is something worth considering for most organizations.<br>
<span id="more-44288"></span></p>
<h2>What is ZFS?</h2>
<p>ZFS is a <strong>filesystem</strong>, but unlike most other file systems it is also the <strong>logical volume manager</strong> or LVM. What that means is ZFS directly controls not only how the bits and blocks of your files are stored on your hard drives, but it also controls how your hard drives are logically arranged for the purposes of RAID and redundancy. ZFS is also classified as a <strong>copy-on-write</strong> or <a href="https://www.ixsystems.com/documentation/freenas/11.2/zfsprimer.html">COW filesystem</a>. This means that ZFS can do some cool things like <strong>snapshots</strong> that a normal filesystem like NTFS could not. A snapshot can be thought of like it sounds, a photograph of how something was at a point in time. How a COW filesystem works, however, has some important implications that we need to discuss.</p>
<figure id="attachment_44997" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44997"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Openzfs.svg_-322x300.png" alt="The Open ZFS Logo" width="322" height="300" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Openzfs.svg_-322x300.png 322w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Openzfs.svg_-800x746.png 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Openzfs.svg_-696x649.png 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Openzfs.svg_-450x420.png 450w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Openzfs.svg_.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-44997">The Open ZFS Logo</figcaption></figure>
<p>Hard Drives work such that the pieces of your data are stored in <strong>Logical Block Addresses</strong>, or LBAs. ZFS is aware of what LBAs a specific file is stored in. Let us say we need to write a file that is big enough to fit into 3 blocks. We are going to store that file in LBA 1000, 1001, and 1002. This is considered a sequential write, as all of these blocks are stored directly next to each other. For spinning hard drives, this is ideal, as the write head does not have to move off of the track it is on.</p>
<figure id="attachment_23424" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-23424"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/western-digital-red-pro-10tb-nas-hdd-review/wd-red-10tb-pro-nas-top/" rel="attachment wp-att-23424"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top.jpg" alt="WD Red 10TB Pro NAS Top" width="800" height="786" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top-305x300.jpg 305w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top-696x684.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WD-Red-10TB-Pro-NAS-Top-427x420.jpg 427w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-23424">WD Red 10TB Pro NAS Top <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/wd-red-smr-vs-cmr-tested-avoid-red-smr/">Use CMR with ZFS, not SMR</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, let us say we make a change to the file and the part that was stored at LBA 1001 needs to be modified. When we write that change, ZFS does not over-write the part of the file that was stored in 1001. Instead, it will write that block to LBA 2001. LBA 1001 will be kept as-is until the snapshot keeping it there expires. This allows us to have both the current version of the file, and the previous one, while <em>only storing the difference.</em> However, the next time we go to read the file back, the read head of our spinning hard drive needs to read LBA 1000, go to the track where LBA 2001 is stored, read that, and then go back to the track where LBA 1002 is stored. This phenomenon is called <strong>fragmentation.</strong></p>
<h2>A Primer on ZFS Pool Design</h2>
<p>To make ZFS pools easier to understand, we are going to focus on using small storage containers as you may have around the house or shop. Before we continue, it is worth defining some terms. A <strong>VDEV, </strong>or virtual device, is a logical grouping of one or more storage devices. A <strong>pool</strong> is then a logically defined group built from 1 or more VDEVs. ZFS is very customizable, and therefore, there are many different types of configurations for VDEVs. You can think of the construction of a ZFS pool by visualizing the following graphic:</p>
<figure id="attachment_45011" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45011"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-800x521.jpg" alt="Nested Storage Containers" width="696" height="453" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-800x521.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-400x261.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-1536x1001.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-2048x1334.jpg 2048w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-696x453.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-1068x696.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-Mirrored-VDEV-645x420.jpg 645w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-45011">Nested Storage Containers</figcaption></figure>
<p>Starting from the smallest container size, we have our drives. We can see that in this visualization we have two drives in each larger container. These two larger containers are our VDEVs. The single largest container, then, is our pool. In this configuration, we would have each pair of drives in a <strong>mirror. </strong>This means that one drive can fail in either (or both!) VDEV and the pool would continue to function in a <strong>degraded</strong> state.</p>

<p>However, if 2 drives in a <strong>single</strong> VDEV, all of the data in our entire pool is lost. There is no redundancy of the pool itself, all redundancy in ZFS is in the VDEV layer. If one <em>VDEV</em> fails, there is not enough information to rebuild the missing data.</p>

<p>Next, we need to define what&nbsp;<strong>RAID-Z</strong> is and what the various levels of RAID-Z are. RAID-Z is a way of putting multiple drives together into a VDEV and storing <strong>parity,&nbsp;</strong>or fault tolerance. In ZFS, there is no dedicated “parity drive” like in&nbsp;<strong>Unraid</strong>, but it instead stores parity across all of the drives in the VDEV.&nbsp; The amount of parity that is spread across the drives determines the level of RAID-Z. It is in this way more similar to traditional hardware RAID.</p>
<p>What can make RAID-Z a better approach than a mirrored configuration is that it does not matter <em>what&nbsp;</em>drive fails in a RAID-Z. Each drive is an equal partner, whereas, in a mirrored configuration, each mirrored VDEV is a separate entity. This benefit of RAID-Z comes at the cost of performance, however, and a mirrored pool will almost always be <em>faster</em>&nbsp;than RAID Z.</p>
<p><strong>RAID-Z</strong>&nbsp;is similar to a traditional&nbsp;<strong>RAID 5. </strong>In RAID-Z you have one drive worth of parity. In other words, if you lose one drive, your pool will continue to function. For RAID-Z you need a minimum of 3 drives per VDEV. You can have 3, 7, or even 12 drives in a RAID-Z VDEV. The more drives which you add, however, the longer it will take to <strong>resilver,&nbsp;</strong>or rebuild.</p>
<p>This increased time increases the risk of your data, as a second drive failure during this process would destroy your pool. ZFS will resilver while the data is still in use, it is a live recovery. The implication of this is that our disks are working harder than usual during this process, and this can increase the chances of a second drive failure. Your data is still accessible and in production, while it is reading all of the parity data from the existing members of your VDEV and then writing it to the new disk.</p>

<p>A RAID-Z2 VDEV is more akin to a RAID 6. In this configuration, 2 drives worth of parity is stored across all of your devices. You can lose up to two drives per VDEV and your pool will still function. Adding more parity drives increases calculations required which means you need more processing performance to operate the array.</p>
<figure id="attachment_45015" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45015"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-800x551.jpg" alt="A Pool with a Single 4-Disk Raid Z2 VDEV" width="696" height="479" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-800x551.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-400x276.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-1536x1059.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-2048x1412.jpg 2048w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-218x150.jpg 218w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-696x480.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-1068x736.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-609x420.jpg 609w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/A-RAID-Z2-100x70.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-45015">A Pool with a Single 4-Disk Raid Z2 VDEV</figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, a RAID-Z3 VDEV provides three drives worth of parity, so you can lose up to three drives per VDEV and your pool will still function. <strong>The more drives of parity you add, however, the slower your performance ends up being</strong>. You need a minimum of four but should use at least five drives to build a RAID-Z3 VDEV.</p>
<h2>The Need for Speed</h2>
<p>There are two ways in which we measure speed or <em>fastness</em>,&nbsp;<strong>IOPS,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Throughput</strong>. In RAIDZ, more drives will give you more throughput, or the actual read and write speed you see when transferring files. However, if you have ever tried to run multiple file copies in Windows simultaneously, you may have noticed the more you do, the slower it gets. It does not always get slower at a constant rate, the more you try to do disks will get exponentially slower. This is because your disk can only do so many Input/Output Operations per Second, or IOPS.</p>
<p>RAIDZ will scale in&nbsp;<em>throughput</em>&nbsp;with the more disks you add, but it does not scale with&nbsp;<em>IOPS.</em> What that generally means is, RAIDZ is not traditionally the best choice for I/O intensive workloads, as the amount of IOPS is roughly limited to the slowest member of our VDEV if we exclude all of the caching ZFS has. Virtualization, as we are discussing here, is highly dependent on I/O.</p>
<p>Earlier, we discussed that ZFS is a COW filesystem, and because of that it suffers from data fragmentation. There are direct performance implications that stem from that fact.&nbsp;<strong>The more “full” your pool is, the slower it will ultimately get.&nbsp;</strong>Write speeds in ZFS are directly tied to the amount of&nbsp;<em>adjacent</em> free blocks there are to write to. As your pool fills up, and as data fragments, there are fewer and fewer blocks that are directly adjacent to one another. A single large file may span blocks scattered all over the surface of your hard drive. Even though you would expect that file to be a sequential write, it no longer can be if your drive is full.</p>
<figure id="attachment_45006" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45006"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Seagate-Mobile-HDD-Crystale-DIsk-Mark.png" alt="Seagate Mobile HDD Crystal Disk Mark Performance" width="482" height="351" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Seagate-Mobile-HDD-Crystale-DIsk-Mark.png 482w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Seagate-Mobile-HDD-Crystale-DIsk-Mark-400x291.png 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Seagate-Mobile-HDD-Crystale-DIsk-Mark-324x235.png 324w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-45006">Seagate Mobile HDD Crystal Disk Mark Performance</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the above graphic, we can see a Seagate 1TB mobile drive that I tested in CrystalDiskMark. It can do about 130 MB/s of sequential read and writes. We can also see that when we start doing random 4k I/O, the speed falls about <strong>100x</strong>. This is meant to illustrate the performance impact of data fragmentation. Additionally, we can see that the latency for these lookups can take about&nbsp;<strong>half of a second, </strong>and we are limited to about 350 IOPS. In order to be fast, virtualization workloads on traditional hard drives need to have many disks in order to compensate for this slowness. It would not be uncommon to see a pool constructed of 10 or more VDEVs of mirrored drives.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is some wisdom we can <a href="https://www.ixsystems.com/community/threads/the-path-to-success-for-block-storage.81165">borrow from the ZFS community</a>. As your pool fills up, and sequential writes become increasingly difficult to accomplish due to fragmentation, it will slow down in a non-linear way. As a general rule of thumb, at about 50% capacity your pool will be noticeably slower than it was when it was 10% capacity. At about 80%-96% capacity, your pool starts to become very slow, and ZFS will actually change its write algorithm to ensure data integrity, further slowing you down.</p>
<p>This is where SSDs come in. They radically change the game because they work very differently at the physical layer. They do not have read and write heads that are flying around a spinning disk back and forth trying to find your data. With the physical limitations of disk-based drives out of the way, SSDs can read and write non-sequential data <em>much&nbsp;</em>faster. They do not suffer the penalties of these rules nearly as severely, fragmentation does not hurt their performance to the same degree.</p>

<p>In another testament to the safety of Tesla vehicles, the driver of a <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/model-3">Model 3</a> was able to walk away from a crash so violent it sent the batteries flying into nearby houses.</p><p><em>Save with big discounts at your favourite Tesla accessories stores, like 10% off at Tesmanian, TesBros and Nikola Pro, plus many more.

<p>The crash occurred late yesterday, November 17 in Corvallis, Oregon. According to the Corvallis Police Department, a 2019 Model 3 (not Model S as noted in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CorvallisPoliceDepartment/posts/1980910832052126" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">press release</a>) was driving at approximately 100mph (160km/h) when the driver lost control of the vehicle.</p>



<p>After leaving the road and travelling more than 300 feet, the Tesla finally came to a rest after “shearing a power pole off at the base as well as striking and knocking over two trees and a telephone junction box.”</p>

<p>The accident was so violent, the Model 3 was barely recognizable with the roof sheared off, the rear end almost completely severed, and doors and even some of the battery cells missing. The force of the crash sent many of the cells into nearby homes, with one of them even landing in the lap of an occupant inside. Another landed on a bed, setting the bed sheets on fire.</p>
<p>Batteries weren’t the only thing missing from the car, as a tire came off the vehicle during the crash causing major damage to a nearby apartment building.</p><p><em>Get 10% off at <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/shop/tesloidcanada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesloid.ca</a> or <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/shop/tesloidusa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesloid.com</a> with coupon code DTC10 at checkout.

<p><em>“A tire was ripped from the car during the collision and struck the second story siding of a nearby apartment complex with such force that it ruptured the water pipes within the wall, destroying the bathroom to the apartment and flooding the downstairs portion of the apartment as well.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miraculously, despite the extent of the damage to the Model 3, the driver was able to flee the scene of the accident on foot. The suspect, Dylan Milota of Corvallis, was found later with only minor injuries. According to police, Milota was impaired by marijuana, and cited for DUI – Drugs, Hit and Run, Criminal Mischief 2, Reckless Driving and Reckless Endangering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authorities were able to collect as many cells as they could find, but are warning nearby residents to check their properties for more. If one is found, residents are being asked to not touch the battery cells and contact the Corvallis Regional Communication Center at 541-766-6914</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Selfish Machines 1.2</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>2019</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Selfish Machines 1.2 explores how convolutional neural networks – machine learning systems used in image recognition and classification software – process, analyse and conceptualize our reality. The installation takes video feed from the space as an input for the neural network and visualises how such networks “see”; giving us an insight into how systems of artificial intelligence compress, dissect and transform our reality into calculable patterns. While we are confronted with the loss of representational image now being reduced to the flickering patterns of the network, the installation points out divergence in vision between humans and machines – as one representation and its meaning are lost, new meaningful representation is formed, however now only understandable to the network itself. </span></span></p>



<p><span><span>The sound element of the installation is a direct amplification of the processing of the hardware through the pickup microphone, which is placed on the computer running the neural network.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The code was written by Matic Potočnik. The project was commissioned by the International Festival of Computer Arts (IFCA) and co-produced by Zavod Projekt Atol.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p></div><div id="comp-k933lb3n" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span><span>​</span></span></p>



<p><span><span>The installation is using Google’s Inception V3 convolutional neural network, which is a widely-used image recognition model trained on the ImageNet dataset. There are more than 21 million simultaneous calculations conducted instantaneously by the network when analysing the live video feed, outputting a visualisation of these calculations as a heatmap on the screen. Lighter the colour on the screen, more “excited” the network was about that specific part of the image, or more precisely, network has matched the part of the image with an already known or familiar pattern of data.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span><span>Convolutional neural networks are structured in layers of parameters, calculations, pattern relations, and dataset compression and processing. In this specific configuration, we have more than 300 consecutive layers, which can be understood as “depth” of the network, therefore, deeper into the network you go, more complex the network itself becomes, finding precise patterns in the slightest details of the analysed data. While we do understand how these systems work in principle, it is hard to fully explain why specific patterns are formed by the network, or further, why a network would match one specific visual pattern with another.</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Instead of speculating on how such systems operate internally, Selfish Machines 1.2 attempts to visualise their internal operations as they are. If you place yourself in front of the camera, you can observe yourself first getting scaled down through data compression </span></span><span><span>into a machine trainable dataset, which is then pushed through the neural network. Focusing on the network’s ability to find patterns based on what it already know, the installation will visualise the strongest recognisable patterns (activations) on each of the network’s layers, slowly transforming you into a flickering pixelated blob, the image of yourself fully understandable only to the network itself.</span></span><br>

<p><span><span><span>"Today computer technology manifests as a broad, hi-tech environment of intelligent, (self)learning systems, that pervade activity in every sphere of society while profoundly influencing not only the global economic but also ecological reality. Contemporary techno-ecology entwines technological and biological systems within which the human subject no longer has a privileged position; he or she is integrated into them fundamentally reconfigured and on a common plane with other (non-human) actors and events. Rather than renounce or interpret complexities of these processes that escape our comprehension, art can be driven by them in order to expand and transform our conceptual apparatus. It can thus develop new ways of interacting with technological and natural systems, investigate the role of new technologies for the empowerment of the non-human world and their potential in the absence of human-oriented goals.”</span></span></span></p>

                <div>
                    <p>Storing authenticated and encrypted data on <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> is a core building block for many Web3 applications, but to date there has not been a standardized way to encode this type of data.</p><p>Without a standard, many developers have been forced to create custom formats for their signed and encrypted data. This has been prohibitive to the openness and interoperability of information stored in IPFS by siloing data to their particular implementation. Another approach to authenticated data has been to put data in IPFS and put the CID of the data in a smart contract on a blockchain, such as <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a>. This is essentially an expensive way of adding a signature on top of the data and persisting the signature record on the blockchain.</p><p>With the introduction of <strong><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2844">EIP-2844</a>,</strong> a standard that allows wallets to support a few new methods for signing and decrypting data based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and the <strong><a href="https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/269"><code>dag-jose</code></a></strong> IPLD codec, we can now simply put authenticated and encrypted data directly into IPFS. In this tutorial, you will learn how you can utilize these primitives with two libraries, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did"><code>js-did</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/3box/3id-connect"><code>3ID Connect</code></a>!</p><h2 id="what-are-dids-and-jose">What are DIDs and JOSE?</h2><p><strong>DIDs</strong> is the W3C standard for <em>Decentralized Identifiers</em>. It specifies a general way of going from a string identifier, e.g. <code>did:3:bafy...</code>, to a <em>DID document</em> which contains public keys for signature verification and key exchange. In most DID methods the document can be updated when keys are rotated for security reasons.</p><p><strong>JOSE</strong> is a standard from <a href="https://www.ietf.org/standards/">IETF</a> which stands for <em>JSON Object Signing and Encryption,</em> and that pretty much explains what it is. There are two main primitives in this standard: JWS (JSON Web Signatures) and JWE (JSON Web Encryption). Both of these formats allow for multiple participants: in JWS there can be one or multiple signatures over the payload, and in JWE there might be one or multiple recipients for the encrypted cleartext.</p><h2 id="building-with-dag-jose-and-eip2844">Building with dag-jose and EIP2844</h2><p>As we have been building out <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic</a> with <strong>dag-jose</strong> and <strong>EIP-2844</strong> as basic building blocks, we've created a few lower-level tools which allow us to more easily use these technologies. This tutorial will show you how to use these powerful tools directly.</p><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js/">IdentityWallet</a></strong> is an implementation of <strong>EIP-2844</strong> using 3ID as the DID method. It can be used standalone as a <em>DID Provider,</em> or more conveniently within the <strong><a href="https://github.com/3box/3id-connect/">3ID Connect</a></strong> library. 3ID Connect allows users to use their Ethereum wallet (support for more blockchains coming soon) to get access to a <em>DID Provider</em>.</p><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did">js-did</a></strong> is a library that allows developers to represent a user in the form of a DID. This is the main interface we're going to be looking at in this tutorial. It allows us to sign data with the currently authenticated user, encrypt data to any user (DID), and decrypt data with the currently authenticated user.</p><h2 id="signed-data-in-ipfs">Signed data in IPFS</h2><p>By using the <strong>dag-jose</strong> IPLD codec we can create data structures that are linked and signed. This is done by creating JSON Web Signatures (JWS) that contain a link to additional data. One of the main problems that the <strong>dag-jose</strong> codec solves is that the payload of a JWS is traditionally encoded as <code>base64url</code> which means that if it contains any IPLD links you can't traverse those links. Instead what we do with <em>DagJWS</em> is enforce the payload to be the bytes of a CID. The codec then transforms the payload into a CID instance and sets it to the <code>link</code> property of the <em>DagJWS. </em>This allows us to easily traverse the resulting DAG.</p><h2 id="setup-your-environment">Setup your environment</h2><p>This section will cover how to set up some specific dependencies needed for this tutorial. If you just want to skip the setup part we have prepared <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">a simple playground</a> which bundles ipfs, 3id-connect, and dids. You can use it by opening the web page, clicking on connect, then opening the developer console where you can run the commands. If you decide to do so, skip the following two sections.</p><h3 id="setup-ipfs-with-dag-jose-support">Setup IPFS with dag-jose support</h3><p>Since dag-jose is a new IPLD codec it's not yet included in js-ipfs by default. It also implements the new IPLD codec API which is also not supported by js-ipfs yet. Therefore we need to do the following when we are creating an instance of IPFS:</p><pre><code>import IPFS from 'ipfs'
import dagJose from 'dag-jose'
import multiformats from 'multiformats/basics'
import legacy from 'multiformats/legacy'

multiformats.multicodec.add(dagJose)
const dagJoseFormat = legacy(multiformats, dagJose.name)

const ipfs = await Ipfs.create({ ipld: { formats: [dagJoseFormat] } })
</code></pre><p>Make sure to install the correct version of multiformats:</p><pre><code>$ npm i multiformats@3.0.3</code></pre><h3 id="setup-did-and-3id-connect">Setup DID and 3ID Connect</h3><p>In the example setup below we use an injected Ethereum provider (such as MetaMask) to create a 3ID Connect and DID instance.</p><pre><code>import { DID } from 'dids'
import { ThreeIdConnect, EthereumAuthProvider } from '3id-connect'

// create 3id connect instance
const addresses = await window.ethereum.enable()
const authProvider = new EthereumAuthProvider(window.ethereum, addresses[0])
await threeIdConnect.connect(authProvider)

// create did instance
const didProvider = await threeIdConnect.getDidProvider()
const did = new DID({ provider: didProvider })
await did.authenticate()
window.did = did
console.log('Connected with DID:', did.id)</code></pre><h2 id="create-a-signed-data-structure">Create a signed data structure</h2><p>We can now start signing and adding data to IPFS! First lets create a simple function that takes a payload, signs it using the <code>did.createDagJWS</code> method, and adds the resulting data to IPFS. As we can see in the code below we get two objects back from this method: <code>jws</code> which is the DagJWS itself and <code>linkedBlock</code> which is the raw bytes of the encoded payload. What happens in the background is that the payload gets encoded using <strong>dag-cbor</strong>, after this the CID of the encoded payload is used as the payload of the created <code>jws</code>. We can access this payload CID on the DagJWS instance as <code>jws.link</code>.</p><pre><code>async function addSignedObject(payload) {
  // sign the payload as dag-jose
  const { jws, linkedBlock } = await did.createDagJWS(payload)
  // put the JWS into the ipfs dag
  const jwsCid = await ipfs.dag.put(jws, { format: 'dag-jose', hashAlg: 'sha2-256' })
  // put the payload into the ipfs dag
  await ipfs.block.put(linkedBlock, { cid: jws.link })
  return jwsCid
}</code></pre><p>Using this function, let's create our first signed data objects:</p><pre><code>// Create our first signed object
const cid1 = await addSignedObject({ hello: 'world' })

// Log the DagJWS:
console.log((await ipfs.dag.get(cid1)).value)
// &gt; {
// &gt;   payload: "AXESIHhRlyKdyLsRUpRdpY4jSPfiee7e0GzCynNtDoeYWLUB",
// &gt;   signatures: [{
// &gt;     signature: "h7bHmTaBGza_QlFRI9LBfgB3Nw0m7hLzwMm4nLvcR3n9sHKRoCrY0soWnDbmuG7jfVgx4rYkjJohDuMNgbTpEQ",
// &gt;     protected: "eyJraWQiOiJkaWQ6MzpiYWdjcWNlcmFza3hxeng0N2l2b2tqcW9md295dXliMjN0aWFlcGRyYXpxNXJsem4yaHg3a215YWN6d29hP3ZlcnNpb24taWQ9MCNrV01YTU1xazVXc290UW0iLCJhbGciOiJFUzI1NksifQ"
// &gt;   }],
// &gt;   link: CID(bafyreidykglsfhoixmivffc5uwhcgshx4j465xwqntbmu43nb2dzqwfvae)
// &gt; }

// Log the payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid1, { path: '/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; { hello: 'world' }

// Create another signed object that links to the previous one
const cid2 = addSignedObject({ hello: 'getting the hang of this', prev: cid1 })

// Log the new payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid2, { path: '/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; {
// &gt;   hello: 'getting the hang of this'
// &gt;   prev: CID(bagcqcerappi42sb4uyrjkhhakqvkiaibkl4pfnwpyt53xkmsbkns4y33ljzq)
// &gt; }

// Log the old payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid2, { path: '/link/prev/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; { hello: 'world' }
</code></pre><p>Note that the values of the CIDs and JWS will be different for you since the payload will be signed by your DID.</p><h2 id="verify-a-signed-data-structure">Verify a signed data structure</h2><p>Verifying a JWS is very straight forward. Simply retrieve the JWS object and pass it to the <code>verifyJWS</code> method. If the signature is invalid, this function will throw an error. If the signature is valid, it will will return the DID (with key fragment) that was used to sign the JWS.</p><pre><code>const jws1 = await ipfs.dag.get(cid1)
const jws2 = await ipfs.dag.get(cid2)

const signingDID1 = await did.verifyJWS(jws1)
await did.verifyJWS(jws2)
</code></pre><h2 id="encrypted-data-in-ipfs">Encrypted data in IPFS</h2><p>Signed data in IPFS is one piece of the puzzle, but perhaps more interesting is encrypted data. With the use of <em>dag-jose</em> and <em>EIP-2844</em> we can encrypt data to one or multiple DIDs and store it directly in IPFS. Below we demonstrate how to use the convenient tools provided by the <em>js-did</em> library to do this.</p><h2 id="encrypt-ipld-data">Encrypt IPLD data</h2><p>There is a simple method to create a DagJWE object which is encrypted to one or multiple DIDs, <code>createDagJWE</code>. This method accepts an IPLD object (a JSON object that may also include CID links) and an array of DIDs. It will resolve the DIDs to retrieve the public encryption keys found in their DID document and create a JWE that is encrypted to these keys. To get going, let's create a helper function that creates a JWE and puts it into IPFS.</p><pre><code>async function addEncryptedObject(cleartext, dids) {
    const jwe = await did.createDagJWE(cleartext, dids)
    return ipfs.dag.put(jwe, { format: 'dag-jose', hashAlg: 'sha2-256' })
}
</code></pre><p>Once we have this function we can create a few encrypted objects. In the example below we first create a simple encrypted object, then we create an additional encrypted object that links to the previous one.</p><pre><code>const cid3 = await addEncryptedObject({ hello: 'secret' }, [did.id])

const cid4 = await addEncryptedObject({ hello: 'cool!', prev: cid3 }, [did.id])</code></pre><p>Note that in the example above we use <code>[did.id](&lt;http://did.id&gt;)</code> to encrypt the data to the currently authenticated DID. We can of course also encrypt the data to the DID of a user that is not locally authenticated, such as another user!</p><h2 id="decrypt-ipld-data">Decrypt IPLD data</h2><p>When the data is retrieved from IPFS we will just get the encrypted JWE. This means that we need to decrypt the data after we fetch it. Since we have created objects that link to each other, lets create a function that retrieves these objects and decrypts them recursively.</p><pre><code>async function followSecretPath(cid) {
    const jwe = (await ipfs.dag.get(cid)).value</code></pre></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    <p>I’m going to try and complete the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> puzzles this year, in Haskell, without bouncing off of those stupid interpreter problems that have always driven me away in the past. Encouraged by a fellow poster on <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/iaqu5l/advent_code_haskell_t_minus_16">lobste.rs</a>, I’m going to try and blog my attempt here.</p>
<p>I don’t have a lot of extra time, but I would like to be better at blogging, and also at Haskell, so let’s hope that this works out. I’m hoping to build the habits here over the next couple of weeks that will enable me to solve the puzzles in a timely fashion, and write up a description of my solution. I’ve done a bit of Haskell, largely in this Advent of Code context, so I’m not entirely a beginner, but I’m nothing like a “Haskell programmer” yet.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">GETTING STARTED</h2>
<p>I use a Macintosh, so I’ll install <code>stack</code> via <code>homebrew</code> –</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">% brew install haskell-stack</code></pre></div>
<p>… and I’ll create a new project:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell">% mkdir -p <span>$HOME</span>/Projects/AOC
% <span>cd</span> <span>$HOME</span>/Projects/AOC
% stack new AOC2020
% <span>cd</span> AOC2020
% stack build AOC2020
<span># a lot of stuff happens ....</span>
% stack <span>exec</span> AOC2020-exe
someFunc</code></pre></div>
<p>When the <code>stack new AOC2020</code> command completed, it created a directory called <code>AOC2020</code>, that has a bunch of directories with stuff in them:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">% ls -1 */*
app/Main.hs
src/Lib.hs
test/Spec.hs
</code></pre></div><p>It sure looks like the meat is here in <code>app/Main.hs</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>module</span> <span>Main</span> <span>where</span>

<span>import</span> <span>Lib</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>someFunc</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This seems to indicate that there’s a <code>Lib</code> module we can import <code>someFunc</code> from, and in fact, if we look at <code>src/Lib.hs</code>, there we go:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>module</span> <span>Lib</span>
    <span>(</span> <span>someFunc</span>
    <span>)</span> <span>where</span>

<span>someFunc</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>someFunc</span> <span>=</span> <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"someFunc"</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="whats-the-problem">WHAT’S THE PROBLEM?</h2>
<p>In keeping with a fellow <a href="https://www.bulters.dev/posts/t-minus-16/">lobste.rs poster</a>, I’ll start with <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1">last year’s Day 1</a>.
The description of the problem is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[fuel] required to launch a given module is based on its mass. Specifically, to find the fuel required for a module, take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems like a pretty clear formula, so let’s write it in Haskell baby-talk, as a function from mass to fuel. Haskell has this equational style where you basically write the equation of the calculation you want in a very straightforward fashion (none of the ceremony of, say, Java’s <code>public static void main () {}</code> foofaraw), so the basic definition is the legal one:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>fuel</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>fuel</span> <span>mass</span> <span>=</span> <span>div</span> <span>mass</span> <span>3</span> <span>-</span> <span>2</span> 
</code></pre></div><p>That looks pretty simple! <code>div</code> is integer division, and operator precedence means there are no brackets needed. The line with the <code>::</code> in it defines the type of the function – in this case, from <code>Int</code> to <code>Int</code>. Let’s write a quick test function that uses the examples given:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a mass of 12, divide by 3 and round down to get 4, then subtract 2 to get 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For a mass of 14, dividing by 3 and rounding down still yields 4, so the fuel required is also 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For a mass of 1969, the fuel required is 654.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For a mass of 100756, the fuel required is 33583.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>… to see if we got the logic right:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>test</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>test</span> <span>=</span> <span>fuel</span> <span>12</span> <span>==</span> <span>2</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>fuel</span> <span>14</span> <span>==</span> <span>2</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>fuel</span> <span>1969</span> <span>==</span> <span>654</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>fuel</span> <span>100756</span> <span>==</span> <span>33583</span>
</code></pre></div><p>OK, but where to put all this code?</p>
<h2 id="a-digression">A DIGRESSION</h2>
<p>I’m going to be writing all my code in Emacs – I use the <a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs">doom</a> distribution (because life is too short to maintain my own pile of elisp), and to doom’s <code>init.el</code> I added <code>(haskell +dante)</code>. Now, I can start an “inferior-mode” interpreter and send my code over to it with <code>C-c C-l</code>.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-the-haskell">BACK TO THE HASKELL</h2>
<p>I’ve decided to start out with one module per day – obviously, this may not be the ideal way to organize everything, but eh, we’ll burn that bridge when we get there. So, let’s create a <code>lib/Day00.hs</code> module, and put our definitions in there:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | </span>

<span>module</span> <span>Day00</span> <span>where</span>

<span>test</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>test</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>fuel</span> <span>12</span> <span>==</span> <span>2</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span>
  <span>fuel</span> <span>14</span> <span>==</span> <span>2</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span>
  <span>fuel</span> <span>1969</span> <span>==</span> <span>654</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span>
  <span>fuel</span> <span>100756</span> <span>==</span> <span>33583</span>

<span>-- see what we did here? We re-wrote `fuel` in "point-free" style! More on this, later</span>
<span>fuel</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>fuel</span> <span>=</span> <span>max</span> <span>0</span> <span>.</span> <span>subtract</span> <span>2</span> <span>.</span> <span>flip</span> <span>div</span> <span>3</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Emacs fills out the <code>module Day00</code> bit, so all I have to do is add the definitions from above. Now, I can load this source into GHCi, with <code>C-c C-l</code>, and run it:</p>
<pre><code>λ&gt; fuel 12
2
λ&gt; test
True
</code></pre><p>So far, so good! Now, let’s look at the rest of the problem definition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the sum of the fuel requirements for all of the modules on your spacecraft?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, we encounter our first real problem: we have a file, with a bunch of numbers, one per line, and we need to sum the result of calling <code>fuel</code> on each of them. We’re going to have to deal with Haskell’s notorious IO system, which could mean learning all about monads and endofunctors and whatnot –  or, I could crib like a maniac from Stack Overflow and figure it out later.</p>
<p>I vote we punt. Let’s assume that we have some mechanism of reading a file, and getting the contents of that file into one big <code>String</code>. Let’s solve the problem in a pure fashion with that <code>String</code> as input, and deal with the IO stuff afterwards. Let’s break this problem down: we have a <code>String</code> and we need to turn that into a list of integer values, representing masses; compute the fuel requirement for each mass; and then sum them together. This sounds a lot like three functions:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>stringToStrings</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>String</span><span>]</span>
<span>stringToMass</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>finalFuel</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>Int</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="hoogle">HOOGLE</h2>
<p>Surely we cannot be the first people who want to split a <code>String</code> into a <code>[String]</code>! Or convert a <code>String</code> into an <code>Int</code>! But how to find out what functions we have available?</p>
<p>This is where <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/">Hoogle</a> comes in. Hoogle is a search engine for Haskell code, and one of the things you can do with it is search by <em>type signature</em>. This is so amazingly cool: you can say, hey, we have a <code>String</code> and we need <code>[String]</code> – and, <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=String+-%3E+%5BString%5D&amp;scope=set%3Astackage">voila</a>. The very first result is <code>lines :: String -&gt; [String]</code> and the description of the function is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lines breaks a string up into a list of strings at newline characters. The resulting strings do not contain newlines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That looks pretty good to me!</p>
<p>How about <code>String -&gt; Int</code>? Hmmm. <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=String%20-%3E%20Int">Nothing here looks reasonable</a>; why is that? Well, it’s because we’re not operating at the right level of generality here. I don’t fully understand how this all is going to work, but I did some Stack Overflowing, and I figured something out. There isn’t a specific <code>String -&gt; Int</code> function; there is instead a function called <code>read</code> that can be used here, with a type coercion/specification (I don’t know the exact lingo here). This has to do with something called “type classes”, which I’m sure I’ll learn more about as we go. The invocation looks like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>stringToMass</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>stringToMass</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>read</span> <span>s</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We can now start to stitch our functions together:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>computeAnswer</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>computeAnswer</span> <span>=</span> <span>sum</span> <span>.</span> <span>map</span> <span>(</span><span>fuel</span> <span>.</span> <span>stringToMass</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>lines</span>
</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Pointfree">Point-free</a> style rears its head again, I see.</p>
<h2 id="revisiting-io">REVISITING IO</h2>
<p>So we have a function that takes a <code>String</code> representing a list of masses, one per (Unix) line, and computes the total fuel necessary for that mass. But that’s not going to be enough! We <em>also</em> need a way to read this data in from a file, and then apply our <code>computeAnswer</code> to it.</p>
<p>The first thing I’ll do is download the data to use into a location in the <code>AOC2020</code> project that makes sense:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell">% mkdir -p <span>$HOME</span>/Projects/AOC/AOC2020/data
<span># copy the data from the web page ...</span>
% pbpaste &gt; <span>$HOME</span>/Projects/AOC/AOC2020/data/Day00.txt
% head <span>$HOME</span>/Projects/AOC/AOC2020/data/Day00.txt
<span>103450</span>
...</code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s try this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>part01</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>raw</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>readFile</span> <span>"data/Day00.txt"</span>
  <span>putStrLn</span> <span>raw</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This now reads the contents of <code>data/Day00.txt</code> and outputs it. Not remotely interesting, but now at least we have read some data from disk and have done <em>something</em> with it.</p>
<p>When I open <code>Day00.hs</code> in my Emacs, it complains about missing top-level type annotations for <code>fuel</code>, <code>test</code>, and <code>part01</code>. You may have seen these type annotations in Haskell source:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>isPositive</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We read this as “<code>isPositive</code> is a function from an Int to a Bool”. We don’t have the definition, but we already know a lot about <code>isPositive</code>.</p>
<p>What are the type signatures for our functions defined above? Well, I can <em>ask</em> Haskell, by navigating to an expression and using <code>C-c C-t</code>  to instruct Emacs to ask Haskell for me, or by using the <code>:t</code> operator in GHCi:</p>
<pre><code>λ&gt; :t part01
part01 :: IO ()
</code></pre><p>So <code>IO ()</code> is apparently the type of the “IO Monad”. I don’t particularly care which metaphor we use to describe it; I think of this as a mechanism for the type system to keep impure code formally distinct from pure code, allowing the compiler to do more work for us; and that’s as much about it as I need right now. If I go deeper, I can see that <code>readFile</code> is of type <code>FilePath -&gt; IO String</code>, meaning that that top-level <code>IO</code> is now also part of the type of the data returned from <code>readFile</code>. But how do we operate on an <code>IO String</code>? This is where the <code>do</code> comes in, I think? We are operating in an sort of “IO context”, so in that context, I can treat an <code>IO String</code> as a <code>String</code>? Is that right? It’s right <em>enough</em> for me, for now.</p>
<p>The basic <code>String</code> type in Haskell apparently is just an alias for a list of <code>Char</code>; in other words, <code>[Char]</code>. So anywhere we see <code>String</code>, we can think <code>[Char]</code>, and vice versa. Looking at this again, we can see that <code>readFile</code> returns an <code>IO String</code>, which because of my handwaving above, we can think of as a <code>String</code> in an <code>IO</code> context, or, an <code>IO [Char]</code>. I think?</p>
<p>Let’s see what the compiler tells us!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>part01</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>part01</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
   <span>raw</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>readFile</span> <span>"data/Day00.txt"</span>
   <span>print</span> <span>(</span><span>computeAnswer</span> <span>raw</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>It runs! It terminates! And it’s the right answer! How about that?</p>
<p>Tomorrow: part 2 of Day 1.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>Whenever I need to quickly look something up (or use a calculator), I open a
new terminal (using a keyboard shortcut) and start typing into it. Slow bash
startup disrupts this workflow as I would often type before the shell prompt:</p>

<p><img src="https://work.lisk.in/img/even-faster-bash-startup/mistype.png" alt="messed up prompt"></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/danpker">Daniel Parker</a> recently wrote an excellent blog post <a href="https://danpker.com/posts/2020/faster-bash-startup/">Faster Bash
Startup</a> detailing his journey from 1.7 seconds to 210&nbsp;ms. I start at 165&nbsp;ms
and need to go significantly lower than Daniel, therefore different techniques
will be needed.</p>

<h3 id="investigation">Investigation</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine">hyperfine</a> is a brilliant command-line tool for benchmarking commands that
I discovered recently (thanks to Daniel!), so let’s see where we are now:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):     165.8 ms ±   0.7 ms    [User: 156.3 ms, System: 12.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):   164.9 ms … 167.1 ms    17 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we need to find out what’s taking so long. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5014823/how-to-profile-a-bash-shell-script-slow-startup/20855353">How to profile a bash shell
script slow startup?</a> Most Stack Overflow answers suggest some
variant of <code>set -x</code>, which will help us find any single command that takes
unusually long.</p>

<h4 id="man">man</h4>

<p>In my case, that command was <code>man -w</code>, specifically <a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/7d14190467fe22bf5d4f85a7b202118d2341e3ed/.bashrc.d/10_env.sh#L8-L10">this piece of my
<code>.bashrc.d/​10_env.sh</code></a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>MANPATH</span><span>=</span><span>$HOME</span>/.local/share/man:
<span># FIXME: workaround for /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/man</span>
<span>MANPATH</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>man <span>-w</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Turns out none of this is needed any more, <code>man</code> and <code>manpath</code> now add
<code>~/.local/​share/​man</code> automatically so I can just drop it and save more than
100&nbsp;ms<sup id="fnref:man-seccomp" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:man-seccomp">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h4 id="death-by-a-thousand-cuts">death by a thousand cuts</h4>

<p>But that’s it. No other single command stands out, it’s just a lot of small
things that add up. Daniel says “it has to take <em>some</em> time,” and he’s mostly
right, but I still have one trick up my sleeve.</p>

<p>My <code>.bashrc</code> is split into several smaller parts in <code>~/.bashrc.d</code>, so I can
profile these and see if anything stands out. My
<a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/68964611b4b578b646cf5f13a47a4ee77e93e740/.bashrc"><code>.bashrc</code></a>
thus becomes:</p>

<p>Let’s see what happens…</p>

<p>118&nbsp;ms in <code>10_env.sh</code> was caused by <code>man -w</code> and we know what to do with that.</p>

<h4 id="completions">completions</h4>

<p>11&nbsp;ms in <code>31_​completion.sh</code> which loads <a href="https://github.com/scop/bash-completion">bash-completion</a>. That’s
certainly better than Daniel’s 235&nbsp;ms, probably because up-to-date
bash-completion only loads a few necessary completions and defers everything
else to being loaded on demand. I couldn’t live without the completions, so
11&nbsp;ms is a fair price.</p>

<p>8&nbsp;ms for <code>50_​git_​dotfiles.sh</code>, which defines a few aliases and
sets up git completions for my <code>git-dotfiles</code> alias, seems too much, though.
Good news is that we don’t need to drop this. We can use bash-completion’s
on-demand loading. Whenever completions for command <code>cmd</code> are needed for the
first time, bash-completion looks for
<code>~/.local/​share/​bash-completion/​completions/​cmd</code> or
<code>/usr/​share/​bash-completion/​completions/​cmd</code>.</p>

<p>Therefore,
<a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/68964611b4b578b646cf5f13a47a4ee77e93e740/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/git-dotfiles"><code>~/.local/​share/​bash-completion/​completions/​git-dotfiles</code></a>
becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>. /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/git
complete -F _git git-dotfiles
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="fzf">fzf</h4>

<p><code>90_fzf.sh</code> loads key bindings and completions code so that <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> is used
when searching through history, completing <code>**</code> in filenames, etc. Well worth
the 11&nbsp;ms it needs to load<sup id="fnref:fzf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fzf">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h4 id="are-we-done-yet">are we done yet?</h4>

<p>After these changes, I got:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ __bashrc_bench=1 bash -i
/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/10_env.sh: 0,001

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s 29&nbsp;ms, brilliant! Or… is it? <emoji>🤔</emoji></p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):      55.7 ms ±   1.0 ms    [User: 47.6 ms, System: 11.1 ms]
  Range (min … max):    54.8 ms …  58.9 ms    53 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="history">history</h4>

<p>Some of those additional 26&nbsp;ms are spent reading my huge
(<code>HISTSIZE=​50000</code>) <code>.bash_​history</code> file. I will skip the details
about how I investigated this, because I didn’t: I stumbled upon this by
chance while testing something else.</p>

<p>We can see that using an empty history file brings us down to a little under
40&nbsp;ms:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ HISTFILE=/tmp/.bash_history_tmp hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):      38.6 ms ±   0.7 ms    [User: 34.0 ms, System: 7.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):    37.8 ms …  42.3 ms    75 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, cutting 17&nbsp;ms by sacrificing the shell history is probably not a good
deal for most people. I settled for setting up a systemd
<a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/f978be7424946afebe56dbe5ecc85c9f36d1e057/.config/systemd/user/liskin-backup-bash-history.timer">timer</a>
to <a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/f978be7424946afebe56dbe5ecc85c9f36d1e057/bin/liskin-backup-bash-history">back up
<code>.bash_​history</code></a>
to git once a day and lowered <code>HISTSIZE</code> to 5000<sup id="fnref:history" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:history">3</a></sup>. This still keeps
my bash startup below 40&nbsp;ms:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):      39.9 ms ±   0.5 ms    [User: 36.1 ms, System: 6.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):    39.1 ms …  42.1 ms    73 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>By dropping unnecessary invocation of <code>man -w</code>, deferring loading of git
completions to when they’re needed, and shortening my shell history file, I
managed to speed up bash startup from 165 ms to 40 ms.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):     165.8 ms ±   0.7 ms    [User: 156.3 ms, System: 12.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):   164.9 ms … 167.1 ms    17 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>Benchmark #1: bash -i

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>More importantly, I no longer type before the prompt, even if I try!</p>

<p><img src="https://work.lisk.in/img/even-faster-bash-startup/corrtype.png" alt="not messed up prompt"></p>

<p>And at this point I can finally agree with Daniel that further tweaking will
only have diminishing returns<sup id="fnref:latency" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:latency">4</a></sup>. <emoji>😊</emoji></p>

<p>Redditor <em>buttellmewhynot</em> (pun intended)
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/jxfm2y/even_faster_bash_startup_165_ms_40_ms/gcxiigg/">comments</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I feel like it shouldn’t matter that the shell starts with a delay. If you
start a shell, the computer should assume that you want further input
directed there and queue somewhere to send it to the shell when it’s up.</p>

  <p>I understand that there’s probably a lot of weird quirks about how terminals
and shells work and how processes get created but surely there’s a way to do
this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They’re right on both points. The input is queued somewhere, and there is a
way to fix the messed up prompt. As some might suspect, <a href="https://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a> handles it
fine: try running <code>sleep 5</code> and type some input in the meantime:</p>

<figure>
  <table>
<thead><tr><th>zsh</th><th>bash</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><img src="https://work.lisk.in/img/even-faster-bash-startup/zsh-nolf.png" alt="zsh no lf"></td>
<td><img src="https://work.lisk.in/img/even-faster-bash-startup/bash-nolf.png" alt="bash no lf"></td>

</tr>
</tbody></table>
  <figcaption>pending input handling without custom prompt</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We can see that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in all cases, the input appears twice (bit annoying, but tolerable)</li>
  <li>zsh prompt is never messed up</li>
  <li>bash prompt is messed up if there’s no newline after the input<sup id="fnref:readline-assumes" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:readline-assumes">5</a></sup></li>
  <li>no input is discarded, in contrast to the first image of this post</li>
</ul>

<p>Turns out <a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/460bdc3c5fa814b874c19d172ce0e3955e278207/.bashrc.d/20_prompt.sh#L13-L27">my PROMPT_COMMAND</a> which was meant to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/19943482/3407728">ensure
the prompt always starts on new line</a> was discarding
the pending input. Zsh uses <a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/blob/19390a1ba8dc983b0a1379058e90cd51ce156815/Src/utils.c#L1599">a different approach</a>,
printing <code>$COLUMNS</code> spaces and then a carriage return
(<a href="https://serverfault.com/a/97543">explanation</a>), which I don’t like as it messes
up copy/paste. But I <a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/compare/a5db1831b37f89e00a637bcc20594a4fcf16de1d^...322ad36ec1d3ee5485c7b637e4c41fff7ea6745c">managed to improve my solution</a> to
correctly detect pending input and not discard it.</p>

<!--and [trying to do what zsh does][new-prompt-command] fixes
it:-->

<p><img src="https://work.lisk.in/img/even-faster-bash-startup/earlytype.png" alt="not messed up prompt after early typing"></p>

<p>It’s not perfect (so I’ll still try to keep bash startup fast), but it’s
definitely an improvement, and it will be useful whenever I get impatient with
a slow command and start typing the next command before the prompt appears.</p>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/buttellmewhynot"><em>buttellmewhynot</em></a> for
nudging me in the correct direction.</p>

Embree’s research led to the development of a top-secret weapon known as the “heart-attack gun.”</p><p>It involved the freezing of shellfish toxin mixed with water to form a frozen dart which would then be fired from the heart-attack gun. Once inside the body, the poison would then dissolve into the person’s bloodstream and cause a heart attack.</p><p>In 1975 CIA Director William Colby presented the weapon at a Church Committee hearing, chaired by Senator Frank Church. The heart attack gun was a handgun with a sight affixed to the top, had a battery in the handle, and used electricity to fire a dart.</p><p>Colby told the committee that the weapon was capable of firing a dart which could enter the body “without perception.” The only way of knowing that the person had been shot by the weapon, was the presence of a tiny red dot at the point of entry. Colby also claimed that the poison would not show up in the autopsy. The official cause of death would, therefore, be deemed a heart attack.

<p>A friend of a relative had brought in their Macbook Air, and kindly asked me to repair it.
This required me to download the latest MacOS for which I didn’t have enough space for.
In a desperate attempt, I decided to clean up my external hard drive, removing files that were taking up too much storage.</p>

<p>This is the exact moment that karma had found its way to my 4 AM adventure to fix this MacBook.</p>

<p>To my surprise I found a folder named “Btc”, where I stored episode of television shows. 
Apparently it has been there since 2015 - this must have been my very first wallet!</p>

<p>Sadly, the wallet wouldn’t open in bitcoin core, it has been corrupted.
The <code>db.log</code> outputs the logs for the BerkeleyDB wallet file, it indicated the following error message:</p>
<pre><code>file wallet.dat has LSN 780/2077553, past end of log at 1/333
Commonly caused by moving a database from one database environment
to another without clearing the database LSNs, or by removing all of
the log files from a database environment
DB_ENV-&gt;log_flush: LSN of 780/2077553 past current end-of-log of 1/333
Database environment corrupt; the wrong log files may have been removed or incompatible database files imported from another environment
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore I was forced to salvage the wallet somehow.
The <code>Bitcoin Core</code> software has an option <code>-salvagewallet</code> which did not appear to help.</p>

<p>A bit of googling around and I found out that uncompressed private keys are prepended with <code>01 01 04 20</code>.
Time to take a quick scroll through the file in <code>HxD</code>, a popular hex editor!</p>

<p><img src="https://kewde.github.io/res/corrupted-bitcoin-wallet/HxD-search.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://kewde.github.io/res/corrupted-bitcoin-wallet/HxD-search-2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I didn’t expect to get 145 hits, but what I certainly didn’t want to do was manually converting all of those hits to private keys and checking the balance.</p>

<p><img src="https://kewde.github.io/res/corrupted-bitcoin-wallet/HxD-search-3.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The private key is 32 bytes long and is just after our prefix.</p>
<pre><code>ffb2b2ed484fa1d5c9b2f4ad8e7ec696
</code></pre>

<p>So I got to work, the result is below.</p>


<pre><code>pip install bit
</code></pre>

<p>Take the code below and put in a file named <code>salvage.py</code>
<strong>Do not forget to uncomment and change the address variable on line 7</strong>.</p>

<p>Finally, run the script!</p>
<pre><code>python salvage.py
</code></pre>

<p>It will output something like this, and if it finds funds, will automatically transfer them over to the address your specified.
PS: do not post this publicly, the first string is the <code>private key</code>, followed by the <code>address</code> and finally the <code>amount of btc</code>.</p>

<p>In retrospect, I could’ve used PyWallet but I decided not to.</p>

<h2 id="stricter-validation">Stricter validation</h2>
<p>The PyWallet implementation does a lot more checks before it decides that a key is “valid”.
It seems to be using a concept of both “prefixes” and “suffixes” for the keys.
Additionally the prefix used in <code>PyWallet</code> is a lot larger, <code>308201130201010420</code> instead of <code>01010420</code>.
If by any chance a single character of the prefix and/or suffix get corrupted, it will not detect it as a key.
My approach is more aggressive in the sense that it will attempt anything that might look like a key.</p>

<h2 id="unencrypted-wallet">Unencrypted wallet</h2>
<p>Additionally, my wallet was not encrypted, therefore it was a bit overkill to use PyWallet.</p>

<h2 id="the-real-reason">The real reason</h2>
<p>I was ony my Windows machine and I didn’t feel like spending an hour to install dependencies like <code>python-twisted</code>, when I could get the job done with less code.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, PyWallet is a great tool and it is worth using for encrypted wallets.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p><em>Part 1: How your user experience changes for the worse as the open web gives way to walled gardens</em></p><p>I hang out in two circles. Open web enthusiasts that are lamenting its demise, and regular users who are happy with their fast snappy apps and couldn't care less. </p><p>These groups have a hard time talking because the "open web" too often comes across as an idealistic abstract notion and most end users just don't tangibly feel the bad consequences. In fact, they're often happier with the snappy, vertically integrated experience of closed app ecosystems. </p><p>My goal here is to make it more palpable how everyday apps, searches and tools get worse when we let big centralized companies take over the web, and explore some paths for reversing it.</p><h2>What is the the open web?</h2><p>Most definitions of the "open web" I've seen are either too technical to be accessible or too abstract to be usable and getting gridlocked in this debate often means watching from the sidelines while actual user welfare slowly diminishes.</p><p>Three characteristics that proponents of the open web will agree to in roughly descending order are:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of publishing</strong>: anyone can publish to it freely or at least very cheaply, and is on the same footing with a globally accessible URL</li><li><strong>Ease of consuming</strong>: Net neutrality — ISP's dont cut deals with corporations to make some websites load faster or cheaper than others.</li><li><strong>Ease of remixing</strong>. You can see the source code. Content licenses and tools are permissive for derived works.</li></ul><h2>Detour: A framework to break down how people use the web</h2><p>I want to focus on the user experience point of view. To do this, I'm going to introduce a framework that divides up all our internet usage into two categories.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/xscGdbWOOPkGjdER.png" alt="Frame 1.png"></p><h3><strong>Unfamiliar problems</strong></h3><p>You have an unfamiliar problem and to solve it you either need to learn something new, or purchase goods or services to solve it</p><ul><li>e.g. taking out a mortgage, a health problem in the family, where to go to college, what skill to acquire next.</li><li>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services.</li><li>These user journeys start with search engines — Google predominantly and **a lot of the time solving them is spent on web pages**.</li><li>When people are looking to solve unfamiliar problems, **revenue is typically higher-margin**, because users can't price the products and services as well.</li><li>These ultimately transition to being familiar problems.</li></ul><h3><strong>Familiar problems</strong></h3><ul><li>e.g. being entertained, keeping the dog food in stock,</li><li>These are best solved with apps like Email, Netflix, Twitter, DTC subscription boxes, etc.</li><li>Solving these needs has a very well defined user interaction journey. You open the app you're familiar with and follow its standard flow.</li><li>Revenue from people solving familiar problems is typically lower-margin and there's more competing products.
</li></ul><h3>How we're spending our time on familiar vs. unfamiliar problems</h3><p>Using time spent in apps vs mobile web on mobile is a way to proxy how we divide up our time.<strong> We spend most of our time on familiar problems but have a constant trickle of unfamiliar problems</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/cPuXkKFELALeIAkI.png" alt="Untitled (1).png"></p><h2>Unfamiliar problems are better solved with the open web</h2><p>Think about the last time you did some research, e.g. choosing a phone plan. You asked your friends, compared on forums, looked at the official sites, scribbled some notes and made a decision. Even if this journey was quick, you likely traversed a dozen services and products to do this.</p><p>Unfamiliar problems have less constraints, require creativity to solve, and thus are better suited to open solutions. Some other things that work for the open web here</p><ul><li>comparing alternatives is easier.</li><li>changing modalities (e.g. from reading to video) is easier.</li></ul><h2>Familiar problems stand to benefit more from tight vertical integration</h2><p>Take Spotify for example. It solves the very familiar problem of listening to music. Spotify just works better as an app because</p><ul><li>Controlling the user experience end to end makes for smoother flows.</li><li>Having all the user data kept with Spotify allows for better recommendation algorithms.</li><li>Spotify can easily hand off between devices.</li><li>It can run in the background</li></ul><p>Sure, the web can do a bunch of these things, but they're simply not first-class considerations in the open-read-close workflow that the browser was designed for.</p><h2>But the open web can be better for familiar problems too, especially for breaking monopolies</h2><p>Let's look at Amazon. Initially you start buying there because of their "always low prices" and the convenience of 2 day shipping. Over the years you keep shopping there, until you've forgotten that </p><ol><li>free 2 day shipping is now near universal</li><li>amazon isn't often the cheapest place</li></ol><p>On the Amazon app, you see the story around the product that best serves Amazon, not the buyer. Meanwhile, over on Insight you can use the web version and do all these things the app can't.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/ZEblynrLvBsutnlQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.42.21 PM.png"></p><p>... and not just that

</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/JVZoTRazmYPZXBQQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.59.22 PM.png"></p><h2><strong>How solving unfamiliar problems gets harder too</strong></h2><p>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services. The incentives to freely create knowledge that solves unfamiliar problems is lost as the web closes down.</p><ul><li>Google increasingly takes a larger percent of ad revenue as they <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/">start extracting answers from pages and showing them on their search result pages.</a><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a></li><li><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a>Publishers have to either a) paywall their content (e.g. NYTimes) or b) subtly sell products (everyone standing a Wirecutter alternative), or c) ask for donations in order to survive.</li><li>Only a few big name publishers survive. Google and Facebook start sending them more of the traffic that's left, and since domain rank plays a big part in Google's ranking, those that survived assimilate more power and rank better.</li><li>and search engines seem more littered with SEO junk and less actually useful information year over year.</li></ul><h2>In conclusion, and where we fit in.</h2><p>And that's how your user experience slowly degrades, and that's why we stand to suffer as users if we give up the ability to remix software that the web brought us and closed apps are now taking away. </p><p>Our goal with Insight is to give the web (in particular on mobile) a fighting chance by exhibiting how it can be more powerful than a closed ecosystem and give more control to the end-user. We do this by showcasing the web's infinite extensibility and customizability for common use cases like <a href="http://insightbrowser.com/collections/search">search</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/shopping">shopping</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/reading">reading</a> and <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/cooking">cooking</a>.</p><p>Insight's advanced features will soon only be available to Pro subscription users but for a limited time we're opening up <strong>lifetime free beta access if you download it via TestFlight below.</strong></p><h3>Coming up in part 2</h3><ul><li>What parts of the open web probably should die off?</li><li>A pragmatic path for what's left of the open web to thrive again.</li></ul><p>We'd love to hear from you, feel free to tweet at or DM us at @<a href="https://twitter.com/insightbrowser">insightbrowser</a> </p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When we started our journey to build Keyper, we were clear from the beginning that we’d bundle keyper as a container. As we progressed with its development, we looked into various container designs. Before this, our experience with building containers was playing with a toy variety and primarily with Docker. Some containerized applications we evaluated were large (over 1GB) and had, in some cases, multiple containers. We aimed to keep the design of the Keyper container simple and its size smaller than 100MB. And, we also wanted Keyper
<a href="https://12factor.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twelve-Factor App</a> compliant.</p><p>Although Linux was a natural choice as a base OS for the container, it took us a while to find the right Linux Distro. Most Linux distribution assumes that it is running on real hardware or a virtualized hardware and not in a container such as Docker. Some distros have a complex init system that is not suitable for a Container. We did not want to treat our Container as VM.</p><p>When we looked around, we found many distros that could fit our bill but were bigger than the size threshold of 100MB (e.g. Ubuntu, CentOS). And, the package repository of some of the smaller distros was not that complete (e.g. many busybox based images). Researching further, we found that Alpine Linux to be a popular base OS for Docker application. The reason is its tiny base image size (5 MB) and completeness of its repository and toolset. Based on this, we decided to use Alpine as a base for Keyper.</p><p>Here is what we found when compared image sizes for various distros.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Image</th><th>Size</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ubuntu</td><td>72MB</td></tr><tr><td>CentOS</td><td>215MB</td></tr><tr><td>Debian</td><td>114MB</td></tr><tr><td>Alpine</td><td>5MB</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Once we settled on the Alpine Linux, we started to think about its tooling. We did not want to use a full-fledged init system like Upstart or Systemd. While working with an OpenLDAP container, we found its service model to be pretty elegant. When we dug deeper, we found
<a href="https://github.com/osixia/docker-light-baseimage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docker-light-baseimage</a> as its base. We found two compelling features in this image:</p><ol><li>Simple way to install services and multiple process image stacks. It uses Runit init scheme. The Runit is a cross-platform Unix init scheme with service supervision. It fits perfectly within a docker container framework keeping the size of the container small. Runit features parallelization of the start-up of system services, which can speed up the boot time of the operating system. We found light-weight service supervision a killer feature.</li><li>Getting environment variables from .yaml and .json files.</li></ol><p>The docker-light-baseimage is based on Debian. So, we migrated its toolset to Alpine Linux.</p><p>Let us take a look at its internals.</p><h2 id="image-directory-structure">Image Directory Structure</h2><p>This image uses four directories:</p><ul><li><strong>/container/environment</strong>: for environment files.</li><li><strong>/container/service</strong>: for services to install, setup and run.</li><li><strong>/container/service-available</strong>: for service that may be on demand downloaded, installed, setup and run.</li><li><strong>/container/tool</strong>: for image tools.</li></ul><div><p>As there was no need, we decided ignore <code>/container/service-available</code></p></div><p>This image creates another directory during the run time:</p><ul><li><strong>/container/run</strong>: To store container run environment, state, startup files and process to run based on files in <code>/container/environment</code> and <code>/container/service</code> directories.</li></ul><h2 id="service-directory-structure">Service Directory Structure</h2><p>A service directory contains shell scripts, with each shell script having a specific purpose. The service directory is added in <code>/container/service</code> to create a service</p><ul><li><strong>my-service</strong>: root directory</li><li><strong>my-service/install.sh</strong>: install script (not mandatory).</li><li><strong>my-service/startup.sh</strong>: startup script to setup the service when the container start (not mandatory).</li><li><strong>my-service/process.sh</strong>: process to run (not mandatory).</li><li><strong>my-service/finish.sh</strong>: finish script run when the process script exit (not mandatory).</li><li><strong>my-service/…</strong> add whatever you need!</li></ul><p>All container tools are located under the <code>/container/tool</code> directory and are linked in <code>sbin/</code> so they belong to the container PATH.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Filename</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>run</td><td>The run tool is defined as the image ENTRYPOINT (see
<a href="https://github.com/dbsentry/keyper-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dockerfile</a>). It set the environment and run startup scripts and images process. More information in the
<a href="https://github.com/osixia/docker-light-baseimage#run" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advanced User Guide</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>setuser</td><td>A tool for running a command as another user. Easier to use than su, has a smaller attack vector than sudo, and unlike chpst this tool sets $HOME correctly.</td></tr><tr><td>log-helper</td><td>A simple bash tool to print message base on the log level.</td></tr><tr><td>add-service-available</td><td>A tool to download and add services in service-available directory to the regular service directory.</td></tr><tr><td>add-multiple-process-stack</td><td>A tool to add the multiple process stack: runit, cron syslog-ng-core, and logrotate.</td></tr><tr><td>install-service</td><td>A tool that execute /container/service/install.sh and /container/service/*/install.sh scripts.</td></tr><tr><td>complex-bash-env</td><td>A tool to iterate through complex bash environment variables created by the run tool when a table or a list was set in environment files or environment command-line argument.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="keyper-container-design">Keyper Container Design</h2><p>Based on what we learned from the docker-light-baseimage, let us look at how we adapted this in the Keyper container design:</p><pre><code>keyper-docker

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3 id="open-source-metrics-stack">Open Source Metrics Stack</h3><p>Metrics are a critical aspect of any system to understand its health and operational state. Design of any system requires collection, storage and reporting of metrics to provide a pulse of the system. We explore how tsdb, prometheus and grafana form that stack for open source metrics reporting in Kubernetes.</p><p>Data is stored over a series of time intervals and needs an efficient database to store and retrieve this data.</p><p><span><a href="http://opentsdb.net/overview.html">OpenTSDB Time Series Database</a></span> is one such time series database that can serve that need.</p><p>While data is stored in a time series database, an standard system to scrape such metrics and store it in the database has emerged in form of <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus </a>. When a data source exports metrics in <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/">prometheus exposition format</a>, it can be scraped by prometheus. While time series database stores metrics, Prometheus collects the metrics and pushes them in the database.</p><p>Any database also needs an efficient and programmer friendy way to query information, eg: SQL for popular transactional databases like Postgres and MySQL. Prometheus defines a rich query language in form of PromQL to query data from this time series database.</p><p>Any form of reporting solution isn’t complete without a graphical component to plot data in graphs, bar charts, pie charts, time series and other mechanisms to visualize data. Grafana serves this need where it can take a data source (like Prometheus) and provides the programmability and flexibility to display data in a form that is useful to the user.</p><p>We broadly cover how the different systems work in tandem, what makes them stick together, some detail of each sub-system and tracing a variable from end-to-end to gain a clear understanding.</p><p>Enroute is built using Envoy proxy and both sub-systems provide a prometheus endpoint to scrape/export the operational metrics in the system.</p><h3 id="discovery-storage-and-querying-of-metrics-data">Discovery, Storage and Querying of Metrics Data</h3><p>This section describes how prometheus uses service discovery to scrape data and store it in TSDB. We then describe how Grafana uses PromQL to query this data.</p><h5 id="finding-instances-to-scrape-using-service-discovery">Finding Instances to Scrape using Service Discovery</h5><p>Prometheus needs a port and path to scrape data from. How does it find that? This problem is addressed by Prometheus service discovery.</p><p>You can set the instance port and path to scrape in a prometheus config file. With dynamic environments like kubernetes where containers, endpoints, pods, services, ip-addresses are transient, a static configuration won’t work. A more dynamic approach is using service discovery and providing instructions about how to work with discovered services. This is where prometheus service discovery can be configured to discover instances (or job which is a collection of instances).</p><p>Prometheus service discovery supports several environments like Kubernetes, Azure, Digital Ocean and several other options. A complete set of service discovery options can be found on <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/">prometheus configuration reference </a>. The <code>&lt;*_sd_config&gt;</code> are all different environments in which prometheus has built-in support and can be configured for service discovery.</p><p>Service discovery returns a list of instances to scrape metrics from. The discovery process may also discover additional metadata about the discovered instances. This additional metatdata may be used by the user to ignore, filter, customize or to<a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/tree/master/discovery"> add attributes to the collected data</a>. Prometheus uses a <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config">relablelling</a> mechanism to achieve that.</p><figure><img height="450" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9e278a0e4469b28dd26f14efcf4181d65b6fdf20/905e4/img/prometheus-discovery.png" alt="prometheus grafana discovery" width="900"></figure><p>In the example above from <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/v2.22.0-rc.0/documentation/examples/prometheus-kubernetes.yml">prometheus github </a>, the configuration file for prometheus specifies kubernetes service discovery using <code>kubernetes_sd_config</code> directive.

When a system that has metric to report, it is broadly classified as the type of data which is either a counter that monotonically increases or a gauge that can increase or decrease over time.</p><p>Such a distinction at the source of where the metric is generated is required to facilitate the metric stack to correctly query, store and retrieve data.</p><p>Prometheus has several libraries in different languages that help facilitate defining the variable type, operating on it and exporting it.</p><h5 id="scraping-and-storage-of-variables">Scraping and storage of variables</h5><p>OpenTSDB supports a multi-dimensonal data model where a data point can be identified using a name and key/value pairs.

Querying is how a tool like Grafana pulls data from Prometheus/TSDB</p><figure><img height="300" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bf35e188bb291182e10be04b5ed7374527109a2f/9dc8b/img/prometheus-q.png" alt="prometheus grafana query" width="400"></figure><p>Note that data variables hold not only time-series value but also an associated key/value. These attributes can be used for querying (eg: <code>envoy_response_code</code> key). This querying is what makes it powerful. There are several ways to look at the same data. While envoy instance from which data was scraped may report a couple of dimensions (or additional key/value tags), additional tags may be added by Prometheus. For instance Prometheus adds kubernetes metadata like service (eg: <code>service</code> key), namespace (eg: <code>kubernetes_namespace</code> key), pod-name, endpoint info etc. when it scrapes and stores information from an instance. All this additional tags can be used to query the data.</p><p>The query language to support rich set of use-cases is critical, and PromQL provides that flexibility. We quickly take a look at how to use PromQL to form queries. More details about PromQL can be found on the prometheus <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/">PromQL</a></p><p>Going back to the original variable <code>envoy_cluster_upstream_rq</code>, it counts the number of upstream requests for clusters.

I set out to figure out how they worked, which lead me on a winding journey through barcode history, patents, packet sniffing, error correction, and Gray tables.</p><h2 id="spotify-uris">Spotify URIs</h2><p>Let’s start with Spotify URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Different pieces of media (artists, albums, songs, playlists, users) all have a URI.</p><p>The ABBA song “Take a Chance on Me” has this URI:</p><p><code>spotify:track:6vQN2a9QSgWcm74KEZYfDL</code>.</p><p>The ABBA Album “The Album” has the following URI:</p><p><code>spotify:album:5GwbPSgiTECzQiE6u7s0ZN</code></p><p>As you can see, the URIs can be broken up into components:</p><p><code>spotify:&lt;media type&gt;:&lt;22 characters&gt;</code>.</p><p>The 22 characters are the numbers 0-9, characters a-z and A-Z. This means there are <code>10 + 26 + 26 = 62</code> possibilities for each character (almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a>).

I used to think academic papers were full of jargon until I read some technical patents.</p><h3 id="the-process">The Process</h3><p>When you visit <a href="https://www.spotifycodes.com/">Spotify codes</a> and input a Spotify URI, a “media reference” is created by Spotify. This media reference is 37 bits long and is the key that links a barcode to a given URI. The media reference may just be the hash of an incrementing index. After extracting a media reference from a barcode, you check with Spotify’s database (a look-up table) to determine what URI it corresponds to.

This makes the decoding process more reliable. Decoding Spotify codes involves going from analog (bar lengths) to digital (media reference), so it is a good candidate for this error correction.</p><blockquote><p>The fundamental principle of [error correction] is to add redundant bits in order to help the decoder to find out the true message that was encoded by the transmitter.</p></blockquote><p>A simple example of error correction would be to replicate each bit twice. So instead of sending <code>1</code>, you would send <code>111</code>. When that triplet is sent across a “noisy” communication channel, some of the bits could get flipped. But since there are 2 redundant bits, the receiver can guess what the value was meant to be:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Triplet received</th><th>Interpreted as</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>000</td><td>0 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>001</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>010</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>1 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>110</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>101</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>011</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The patents don’t specify what forward error correction schema Spotify uses, but they do say that they add 15 bits at this step. The code rate of an error correction scheme is the ratio of the information bits to the total encoded bit length. Spotify adds 15 bits to the 45 bit code, so the code rate is <code>45 / 60 = 0.75</code>. This code rate is high (close to 1) meaning it is fairly weak. It facilitates a limited amount of error correction, but that is okay. If you are sending a message to a deep space probe you want a very strong code. A Spotify code is pretty low risk: it’s easy to ping the server a few times if you decode the wrong media reference.</p><p>The total forward error corrected code is 60 bits long, which is the exact amount of information that can be encoded in the 20 octals (bar heights) in the Spotify barcode!</p><p>The patents do mention that Spotify uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_decoder">Viterbi algorithm</a> to decode the media reference from the forward error corrected code. I won’t go into it here, but that algorithm uses the redundant bits from the forward error correction to determine the best guess of the actual media reference.</p><h3 id="gray-code">Gray Code</h3><p>I really like this part of the Spotify codes.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code">Gray code</a> is an alternative way to represent a binary number. If you look closely at the following table, you will see that Gray code works by changing only one bit at a time.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decimal</th><th>Binary</th><th>Gray</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>000</td><td>000</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>001</td><td>001</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>010</td><td>011</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>011</td><td>010</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>100</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>101</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>110</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>111</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Why does Spotify use Gray code? What is wrong with normal binary representation of the code?</p><p>The difference between 3 and 4 in Gray code is only 1 bit (<code>010 -&gt; 110</code>). In normal binary representation, that difference is 3 bits (<code>100 -&gt; 011</code>). When going from analog (the height of a given bar) to binary, using Gray codes reduces the number of bits that are “wrong” if we calculate the wrong height.</p><p>If the height of a bar is supposed to be 3, but we calculate that it is 3.51 and we round up to 4, the binary representation of that number in Gray code will only be off by one bit. <strong>This makes the forward error …</strong></p></div></article></div></div>

<p>The OpenAI scholars program requires a final open source project. I've been eagerly working on it and I'm happy to present it now. Along with this blog post, my final presentation, code and an academic paper, I present &nbsp;<strong>Semantic Parsing English-to-GraphQL </strong>(SPEGQL). </p><p>I presented this project in my final project proposal. So in this post, I'll cover some of the highlights. The full details can be found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EmAFC2LGxu8zG3LI6vMt8SrGpjwYtBpnDqCtj_AnDJQ/edit?usp=sharing">this paper</a>. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="background">Background</h3><p><strong>GraphQL</strong></p><p><a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is a query language for your api.</p><p>It's become very popular recently because of several reasons. It represents the schema as a graph, nested relations of any depth can be easily queried, it can aggregate data over multiple datasources and responses are predictable among other things.</p><p><strong>Semantic Parsing</strong></p><p>Semantic parsing is the task of converting a natural language utterance to a logical form: a machine-understandable representation of its meaning. In this case I wanted to semantically parse English to GraphQL.<br></p><p>Why this project?</p><p>I had a few reasons to work on this project:</p><ul><li>I wanted to understand the limits of general language models for Semantic Parsing</li><li>This project could potentially ease the learning curve for new developers of GraphQL </li><li>Potential tooling for non technical data users such as managers to gain insights into their data</li></ul><h2 id="objective">Objective</h2><p>Given an English prompt:</p><blockquote><em>“What is the name and date of the song released most recently?”</em></blockquote><p>And some GraphQL Schema</p><pre><code>type song {

<p>Find a corresponding GraphQL Query: </p><pre><code>query {
 song(limit: 1, order_by: {releasedate: desc}) {
   song_name

<p>This objective could be tested by passing the prompt and schema though a model to output a query.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to Thursday! </p><p>I’ve been reading some interesting policy reports about everything from <a href="https://t.co/CxLqshzCAg">maternal mortality</a> to <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/can-we-design-student-loan-forgiveness-target-low-income-families">how to target student loan forgiveness</a> but at the moment there is a lot of demand for me to address the situation at Vox in detail or to assimilate my personal story into a larger narrative about “wokeness” or the culture wars. Personally I’m not a huge fan of navel-gazing. So I’ll just say that my personal interest in reclaiming my status as an independent, blog-like voice transcends any particular issues with any particular publication. I wanted to do <em>this,</em> not go find a different job, and I thank those of you who’ve joined me on this journey.</p><p>But Vox is typical of a few trends that exist broadly in the media industry and that I do think are of interest. </p><ul><li><p>The staff skews very young. </p></li><li><p>The staff is concentrated in big coastal cities, and especially New York.</p></li><li><p>The staff is overwhelmingly composed of graduates of selective colleges (state university flagship campuses and private schools with names you know).</p></li></ul><p>The media industry has long skewed young, educated, and New Yorky. But digital disruption trends have made it more so than ever before. Daily newspapers published in mid-sized cities and small towns are weaker and less significant. A lot of reporters born in the 1960s and 1970s have left the industry as it has shrunk and few of them work at digital native startups. </p><p>Separately from that change, national politics has been polarizing around age, educational attainment and population density in an unprecedented way. A group of young, recent college graduates living in Brooklyn would’ve skewed left in 1990 but this was an era when Al D’Amato could win statewide in New York and Democratic presidential campaigns would win in West Virginia. Today a demographically identical group skews much further left than it used to. None of this is really an outcome that anyone particularly wanted or intended. But it’s put a big thumb on the scales ideologically at the exact same time that economic trends have turned against the startups.</p><p>The result is that I think you should expect the instability we’ve seen this fall to be just the leading edge of the wedge.  </p><h4>Most media isn’t political journalism </h4><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce695ac4-18ca-4c53-a705-9cfd4bf75644_1616x1168.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce695ac4-18ca-4c53-a705-9cfd4bf75644_1616x1168.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ce695ac4-18ca-4c53-a705-9cfd4bf75644_1616x1168.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1052,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2381922,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a><figcaption>Culture criticism today: Calling out various problematic things</figcaption></figure></div><p>Reeves Wiedeman’s recent <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/11/inside-the-new-york-times-heated-reckoning-with-itself.html">article about internal tensions at The New York Times</a> includes this passage, which gets at a dynamic that I think you see across the media landscape. The vast majority of the people who work at any given publication are not professional political journalists, and generally the further you get from the ~~political journalism~~ section of a media organization the more left-wing things get: </p><blockquote><p>Of all the fronts on which the Times was being pushed to change, the strongest insurrectionary energy was coming from legions of newsroom-adjacent employees in digital jobs that didn’t exist a decade ago. The employees responsible for distributing the Times in the past — typesetters, pressmen, delivery drivers — had never been encouraged to speak up about the ethical questions at the heart of the paper’s journalism. But the app developers and software engineers who deliver the Times’ journalism to the world have held their hands up in just as many Ivy League seminars as their editorial peers. They might be too shy to march over to a masthead editor and complain about a clumsy headline, but #newsroom-feedback had opened a digital door to criticism. Reporters found that suddenly it was the Times’ programmers and developers, rather than their editors, who were critiquing their work. During the town hall about the Cotton op-ed, one data engineer said on Slack, “How many such process failures would be tolerated in tech?”</p><p>Many of the techsurrectionists had come from Facebook or Uber or Amazon to join the Times out of a sense of mission, leaving the ethical quandaries of the tech industry for what they thought were more virtuous pastures. “I joined the company for one reason, and it’s because I feel a responsibility to be a part of a mission that I believe in,” a product manager who previously worked at Apple wrote in #newsroom-feedback after the Cotton op-ed. “This feels like the rug’s been pulled out from under us — not just because it feels like that mission [has] been severely compromised by the decision to publish this piece, but even more so because the products we’re building were used to do it.”</p><p>“It’s like making telephone poles,” one software engineer added, “and finding out they’re being used as battering rams.”</p></blockquote><p>People who cover politics professionally, for better or worse, end up spending a fair amount of time talking to Republicans and trying to understand what conservatives think about public policy issues. If we’re doing our jobs at all correctly we can do stories that bring a mostly-progressive audience a greater understanding of what is happening on the other side. And when a professional political reporter does a bad job it’s often because he or she is taking a dive to maintain relationships with sources on the right, or bending over <em>too far</em> backwards to be fair. </p><p>At the same time, we political journalists have our fair share of totally ignorant hot takes about music or cooking or sports or whatever else that we can fire off. </p><p>The flip side is that our colleagues who cover sports or music or cooking also have hot takes about politics. Hot takes that come from the very narrow demographic and ideological niche that dominates the media and is untempered by the need to actually cover politics.</p><h4>Coverage has gotten really weird </h4><p>Ian Walker <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-the-kotaku-review-1845588904">recently ended his PS5 review for Kotaku with this thought</a>: </p><blockquote><p>The world is still reeling under the weight of the covid-19 pandemic. There are more Americans out of work right now than at any point in the country’s history, with no relief in sight. Our health care system is an inherently evil institution that forces people to ration life-saving medications like insulin and choose suicide over suffering with untreated mental illness.</p><p>As I’m writing this, it looks very likely that Joe Biden will be our next president. But it’s clear that the worst people aren’t going away just because a new old white man is sitting behind the Resolute desk—well, at least not&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;old white man. Our government is fundamentally broken in a way that necessitates radical change rather than incremental electorialism.</p><p>The harsh truth is that, for the reasons listed above and more, a lot of people simply won’t be able to buy a PlayStation 5, regardless of supply. Or if they can, concerns over increasing austerity in the United States and the growing threat of widespread political violence supersede any enthusiasm about the console’s SSD or how ray tracing makes reflections more realistic. That’s not to say you&nbsp;<em>can’t</em>&nbsp;be excited for those things—I certainly am, on some level—but there’s an irrefutable level of privilege attached to the ability to simply tune out the world as it burns around you.</p></blockquote><p>The problem here, to me, is not that Walker ought to “stick to sports.” It’s that the analysis is bad. But because it’s in a video game console review rather than a policy analysis section and conforms to the predominant ideological fads, it just sails through to our screens. </p><p>What actually happened is that starting in March the household savings rate soared (people are taking fewer vacations and eating out less) and while it’s been declining from its peak as of September it was still unusually high.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F885debb5-4601-4e59-9232-382c5c1f8250_1494x718.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F885debb5-4601-4e59-9232-382c5c1f8250_1494x718.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/885debb5-4601-4e59-9232-382c5c1f8250_1494x718.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:700,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:94064,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>One result of this is a lot of people have been able to pay off old debts.

In response to a similar barrage of articles about how <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/04/how-should-a-climate-change-reporter-think-about-having-children">maybe you shouldn’t have children because of climate change</a>, I felt inspired to write, at somewhat greater length, my book One Billion Americans. </p><p>The basic dynamic is that if you take a normal distribution (say of political views) and then shift the average a bit to one side, you end up with explosive growth in the number of outliers.

<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>

<p>
To most people, the Amiga is probably synonymous with the Amiga 500 and that 
machine was, above all, a video game: something into which you plonked 
3.5" floppy disks that transported you to strange, wonderful worlds and 
hours of fun. To this group, the gamers, the operating system wasn't 
important. They probably booted Workbench 1.3 
only once, took a good look at the garish blue and orange interface,
and decided that enough was enough, before going back to blasting enemies 
in Silkworm.
</p>

<p>
And why not? The machine was great for games. There are tons of great 
texts about the groundbreaking audio and video capabilities of the 
Amiga.
</p>

<p>
This text is not one of those.
</p>

<p>
This text is about the later versions of AmigaOS produced by Commodore, 
from 2.0 to 3.1. While these newer versions (with majors released in 1990 
and 1992, respectively) certainly carried the Amiga heritage with pride 
and were - mostly - backwards compatible, the advent of AmigaOS 2.0 
marked a paradigm shift. The shift is best symbolized by the fact that 
AmigaBASIC - the ubiquitous and mandatory language of any 
self-respecting eighties home computer - was ditched and replaced by 
ARexx, a professional scripting language without any kind of graphics or 
sound features whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
This paradigm shift is also why so many of us who had the good fortune 
to come across those versions clung to the Amiga so desperately. A lot
of us stuck with it
well into the late nineties, years after Commodore's demise. And we were
fierce: if 
you think Apple fanboys are annoying today, be very happy you didn't meet an 
Amiga zealot in 1995. Things got personal quickly. It was downright ugly.
</p>

<p>
I still think there were some grounds for our fanaticism, though.
</p>

<p>
In a time when home PC:s were single tasking DOS boxes with 8 character 
file names and Ataris and Macs were single tasking GUI boxes, hampering
any hacker  with their glaring lack of a CLI, the Amiga was a champion of both 
worlds: It combined the CLI and GUI, leveraging both their strengths.
But there was more to it than that, something that's hard to convey
in so many words.
</p>

<p>
Many a time have I come across exasperated Amiga users who, on some 
online forum, tries to explain the greatness of the Amiga's operating 
system in a few short sentences. It often, quite understandably, boils 
down to something akin to "It's like UNIX", which I always think is 
unfair to both of the systems.
</p>

<p>
Sure, it was an early multitasking system with a capable command line. 
At the same time, it was also a mature and coherent desktop environment 
with levels of user friendliness much more like today's MacOS X than any 
traditional UNIX. But, contrary to today's MacOS, it never mollycoddled the
end user. It opened the machine up, rather than closing certain parts off.
</p>

<p>
Unlike UNIX, AmigaOS is a system designed for home computer use, lacking a 
lot of what makes UNIX so popular: memory protection, multi user 
support, source code portability and built in networking support.
</p>

<p>
They're very much alike in one aspect, though. Like UNIX, the Amiga's 
operating system is a collection of a lot of little strokes of genius 
that come together to make it bigger than the sum of its parts.
</p>

<p>
I invite you to explore this ingenuity with me. But first, let's get the 
terminology sorted.
</p>

<h3 id="jargon">Jargon buster</h3>

<p>
The Amiga's operating system has been called a lot of things by a lot of 
people, because it consists of many components that different types of 
users interacted more or less with. Let me try to clear things up a bit:
</p>


<dl>
<dt>AmigaOS</dt>

<dd>
This was never an official name during the Commodore days, but it's a 
handy way of describing all of the components below as a whole.
</dd>

<dt>Kickstart</dt>

<dd>
This is basically the firmware of the Amiga, residing in the ROM chip. 
On version 2.0 and up, the ROM chip was 512 kB large and contained not 
only code for self tests and bootstrapping but also quite sizable 
portions of the other parts of AmigaOS.
</dd>

<dt>AmigaDOS</dt>

<dd>
This is, roughly speaking, the command line interface, device drivers, 
file system management and so on. It was originally based on TRIPOS, a 
heritage that still shows to this day. (There are newer versions of AmigaOS
than 3.1, but this text will only cover the ones released by Commodore.)
</dd>

<dt>Intuition</dt>

<dd>
Best likened to a modern desktop compositor, Intuition handles screen 
updates and manages windows. The custom sound and video chips in the 
Amiga had mostly female names (Paula, Denise and later Alice), so I 
suppose Intuition is a fitting name for an abstraction layer that lets 
the OS interface with them.
</dd>

<dt>Workbench</dt>

<dd>
This is often used interchangeably with "AmigaOS" but it's really the 
name of just the desktop environment - which is a workbench, not a 
desktop: Programs are called tools, folders a called drawers and data 
files are called projects.
</dd>

</dl>

<h4>Other terminology</h4>

<dl>

<dt>Requesters</dt>

<dd>
Not really a major part of the OS per se, a requester is the Amiga's 
name for a dialog box. A "file requester" is a file selection dialog, 
for example. I still often use this term to describe any dialog on any 
platform, much to the confusion of friends and colleagues. Old habits 
die hard.
</dd>

<dt>Devices</dt>

<dd>
Devices, much like in UNIX, usually represent peripherals attached to the 
computer, such as storage media, printers, etc. The Amiga has a number 
of built-in devices that are automatically mounted,
for example the internal floppy drive, <code>DF0:</code>
and  the serial and parallel ports, <code>SER:</code> and <code>PAR:</code>
respectively. Other 
common devices are <code>DF1:</code>, the first external floppy drive,
<code>DH0:</code>, the 
common device name given to the bootable hard drive partition, and 
<code>CON:</code>, the text console.
There are also devices that can't
be mounted but only
be accessed using programming languages, such as <code>timer.device</code>
which is used to interface with hardware clocks.
</dd>

<dt>Volumes</dt>

<dd>
Mounted devices (such as <code>DF0</code>, <code>DF1</code>, <code>DH0</code>)
can contain a volume. In the 
case of <code>DH0:</code>, a bootable hard drive partition,
the volume is fixed and 
is represented by the name of the partition, such as <code>System:</code> or 
<code>Boot:</code>.
If you insert the Deluxe Paint program disk into the internal 
floppy drive, the current volume in device <code>DF0:</code>
will be <code>DPaint:</code>.
</dd>

</dl>

applications, placed on the desktop for easy access.

</p>

<h3 id="ramdisk">The RAM Disk</h3>

<p>
The Amiga always has a RAM disk ready for use and the device name is 
always <code>RAM:</code>. No mounting, no third party software - it just sits 
there, waiting. That's clever in its own right, but the really ingenious 
part about it is that it's dynamically allocated. That means the size of the 
RAM disk corresponds to the amount of free memory currently available on 
the system, and that it never takes up more memory than is needed to
accommodate the files currently stored on it.
</p>

<p>
A RAM disk might sound esoteric today, but in the days of slow 
mechanical hard drives and floppy disks, it was a godsend for unpacking 
archives, running test compiles and storing temporary working documents.
</p>

<p>
The downside is that every time you reboot your computer, all the 
contents of the RAM disk are lost. Which brings us to...
</p>

<h3 id="raddisk">The RAD Disk</h3>

<p>
RAD, which (somehow) stands for Recoverable Ram Disk, is another 
testament to the flexibility and ingenuity of AmigaOS. The RAD disk is a 
fixed size RAM disk that can not only survive reboots but also itself
be booted from. It can be used as a small but extremely fast mini hard
drive, or  for extracting disk images to, for checking out their contents.
</p>

<h3 id="propscroll">Proportional scroll bars</h3>

<p>
A proportional scroll bar is a scroll bar that grows and shrinks to 
reflect the size of the scrollable content it represents:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://datagubbe.se/ltmag/gfxs/propscroll.png">
<img src="https://datagubbe.se/ltmag/gfxs/propscroll.png" alt="Screenshot of proportional scroll bars">
</a>
</p>
<p>
<i>Click the image for full resolution.</i>
</p>

<p>
Highlighting a feature like this might 
seem like a silly point to make, because today all scroll bars are 
proportional. Not so in the bad old days: Microsoft 
didn't implement them until Windows 95 and Apple, as far as I know,
didn't make the move until MacOS 9 in 1999. In a time when computer mice 
had no scroll wheels, this was a nifty feature indeed.
</p>

<h3 id="editors">The Text Editors</h3>

<p>
<a href="https://datagubbe.se/ltmag/gfxs/ed.png">
<img src="https://datagubbe.se/ltmag/gfxs/ed.png" alt="Screenshot of Ed in full screen mode.">
</a>
</p>
<p>
<i>
Above, Ed is used to edit S:Shell-Startup, the equivalent of .bashrc for
AmigaShell. The editor is currently in command mode, getting ready to delete
a line of text.
Click the image for full resolution.</i>
</p>

<p>
AmigaOS shipped with three different text editors: Ed, Edit and MEmacs. 
The latter is a port of, you guessed it, Micro Emacs, and will of course 
appeal to Emacs fans. The other two are sort of curiously named: Edit is 
a line editor mostly resembling ed on UNIX. The Amiga's Ed, on the other 
hand, is a full screen editor with both mouse support and an 
extensive command language. Amiga Ed is probably best likened with vi.
</p>

<p>
All three of them are capable and powerful editors. Both MEmacs and Ed 
make use of the Amiga's drop down GUI menus and feature support for 
macros and extensive configuration.
</p>

<p>
Ed's command mode is, as mentioned earlier, somewhat reminiscent of vi. 
Consider the following examples:
</p>

<p>
Change the next three occurrences of "data" to "gubbe":<br>
<code>3 E/data/gubbe/</code>
</p>

<p>
Move to top of file, repeat (RP) replace of "data" with "gubbe" until 
end of file:<br>
<code>T; RP E/data/gubbe/</code>
</p>

<p>
Move to top of file, find all occurrences of "gubbe" and insert three 
blank lines after every occurrence, repeat until end of file:<br>
<code>T; RP (F /gubbe/; 3A//)</code>
</p>

<p>
Ed also has something called an ARexx port, which completely </p></div></div>

<p>One of the most interesting new features is <strong>template literal types</strong>. Back in ES2015, a new string syntax called a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">template literal</a> was added to JavaScript, providing a convenient and readable way to insert values into strings. These are strings delimited by backticks which evaluate any expression surrounded by <code>${</code> … <code>}</code>, inserting the result into the string.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In TypeScript 4.1, you can now use the template literal syntax in <em>types</em> as well as <em>values</em>. This means if you have a type which represents a single string literal or, more likely, a union of multiple string literals, you can use a template literal type to create a new string literal type derived from the old one.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Animal</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>shark</span><span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"</span><span>giraffe</span><span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"</span><span>platypus</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>type</span> <span>BabyAnimal</span> <span>=</span> <span>`baby-</span><span>${</span><span>Animal</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>;</span> <span>// = "baby-shark" | "baby-giraffe" | "baby-platypus"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As the example above shows, the transformation is distributed over the union, being applied to each member separately, then producing a union of the results. If you include multiple union types in the template literal, it produces every combination.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Animal</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>shark</span><span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"</span><span>giraffe</span><span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"</span><span>platypus</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Age</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>baby</span><span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"</span><span>adolescent</span><span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"</span><span>old</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>type</span> <span>BabyAnimal</span> <span>=</span> <span>`</span><span>${</span><span>Age</span><span>}</span><span>-</span><span>${</span><span>Animal</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>;</span>
<span>// = "baby-shark" |</span>
<span>//   "baby-giraffe" |</span>
<span>//   "baby-platypus" |</span>
<span>//   "adolescent-shark" |</span>
<span>//   "adolescent-giraffe" |</span>
<span>//   "adolescent-platypus" |</span>
<span>//   "old-shark" |</span>
<span>//   "old-giraffe" |</span>
<span>//   "old-platypus"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As well as building up new string literal types from shorter pieces, we can also extract parts of the string by matching a pattern. To do this we need to combine template literal types with <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#type-inference-in-conditional-types">conditional types and the <code>infer</code> keyword</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>ExtractVerb</span><span>&lt;</span><span>S</span> <span>extends</span> <span>string</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>S</span> <span>extends</span> <span>`</span><span>${</span><span>infer</span> <span>Verb</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>${</span><span>infer</span> <span>Activity</span><span>}</span><span>`</span> <span>?</span> <span>Verb</span> <span>:</span> <span>never</span><span>;</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Verbs</span> <span>=</span> <span>ExtractVerb</span><span>&lt;</span><span>"</span><span>play chess</span><span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"</span><span>write code</span><span>"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"</span><span>read hacker news</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>// = "play" | "write" | "read"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means we can break down a string into its substrings and return different types based on the contents of those substrings. That is everything we need to implement a simple parser. Let’s look at some potential applications.</p>

<h2 id="routing">Routing</h2>

<p>In Node.js web frameworks like <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, it is common to define URL routing rules by using a path pattern given as a string. These strings can contain placeholders to represent dynamic parts of the path like IDs and slugs. Express uses a colon prefix for these path parameters. You can then access the values of these parameters in the route handler function using the object <code>req.params</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>/users/:userId/posts/:postId</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>res</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>userId</span> <span>=</span> <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>params</span><span>.</span><span>userId</span><span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>postId</span> <span>=</span> <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>params</span><span>.</span><span>posId</span><span>;</span>
    <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>`Requested post </span><span>${</span><span>postId</span><span>}</span><span> from user </span><span>${</span><span>userId</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The code above will be perfectly acceptable to the TypeScript compiler, but if you run it, you’ll notice the server responds with something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Requested post undefined from user 12</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a typo in the function, but TypeScript did not complain. That is because the type of <code>req.params</code> is a <code>ParamsDictionary</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>interface</span> <span>ParamsDictionary</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>key</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>]:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This type just says it is an object with string keys and string values. It knows nothing about which keys the object will actually have at runtime, so it isn’t much better than <code>any</code>. Template literal types allow us to parse the path to produce a safe and accurate type for <code>req.params</code>.</p>

<p>First, we need a generic type which can parse our path string literal to extract the parameters preceded by a colon. At the type level, we don’t have normal data structures like arrays, so we will need to represent the parameters as a union.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>PathParams</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Path</span> <span>extends</span> <span>string</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>Path</span> <span>extends</span> <span>`:</span><span>${</span><span>infer</span> <span>Param</span><span>}</span><span>/</span><span>${</span><span>infer</span> <span>Rest</span><span>}</span><span>`</span> <span>?</span> <span>Param</span> <span>|</span> <span>PathParams</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Rest</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>
    <span>Path</span> <span>extends</span> <span>`:</span><span>${</span><span>infer</span> <span>Param</span><span>}</span><span>`</span> <span>?</span> <span>Param</span> <span>:</span>
    <span>Path</span> <span>extends</span> <span>`</span><span>${</span><span>infer</span> <span>_Prefix</span><span>}</span><span>:</span><span>${</span><span>infer</span> <span>Rest</span><span>}</span><span>`</span> <span>?</span> <span>PathParams</span><span>&lt;</span><span>`:</span><span>${</span><span>Rest</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>
    <span>never</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It may look a little scary, but once you break it down, it’s not too bad.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first case matches parameters at the start or middle of the path.<br>
e.g. <code>":userId/posts/:postId"</code>.</li>
  <li>The second case matches parameters at the end of the path.<br>
e.g. <code>":postId"</code>.</li>
  <li>The third matches strings with some other content before a parameter and strips it away.<br>
e.g. <code>"/posts/:postId"</code>.</li>
  <li>In the fourth and final case where none of the three patterns match, we return the <code>never</code> type, because this behaves like an empty set when used like a union.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first and third cases it recursively calls itself with a shorter section of the string.</p>

<p>Applying this type to the path from above gives the parameter names, as we expect.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>ParamNames</span> <span>=</span> <span>PathParams</span><span>&lt;</span><span>"</span><span>/users/:userId/posts/:postId</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>// = "userId" | "postId"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can use a mapped type to generate an object with those parameter names as keys.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>PathArgs</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Path</span> <span>extends</span> <span>string</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>K</span> <span>in</span> <span>PathParams</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Path</span><span>&gt;</span><span>]:</span> <span>string</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Params</span> <span>=</span> <span>PathArgs</span><span>&lt;</span><span>"</span><span>/users/:userId/posts/:postId</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>// = { userId: string, postId: string }</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Great! That’s the type we want for <code>req.params</code>.</p>

<p>Now all that is left to do is to use this type in the routing method of our web framework.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>get</span><span>&lt;</span><span>P</span> <span>extends</span> <span>string</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>
        <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>P</span><span>,</span>
        <span>handler</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>req</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>params</span><span>:</span> <span>PathArgs</span><span>&lt;</span><span>P</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>},</span> <span>res</span><span>:</span> <span>any</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>void</span><span>,</span>
    <span>):</span> <span>void</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// web framework goes here...</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>// other methods...</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> In a real implementation, <code>req</code> would have many other properties and <code>res</code> would be strongly typed. I have omitted those details to simplify this example.</em></p>

<p>Now, the compiler catches the typo in our route handler. It even provides a suggestion to fix it!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>/users/:userId/posts/:postId</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>res</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>userId</span> <span>=</span> <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>params</span><span>.</span><span>userId</span><span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>postId</span> <span>=</span> <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>params</span><span>.</span><span>postld</span><span>;</span>
    <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>`Requested post </span><span>${</span><span>postId</span><span>}</span><span> from user </span><span>${</span><span>userId</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>Property 'postld' does not exist on type 'PathArgs&lt;"/users/:userId/posts/:postId"&gt;'. Did you mean 'postId'?</code></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="dispatching-actions">Dispatching Actions</h2>

<p>It’s a common pattern in many applications to represent actions in the system as values. This lets you easily track history, pass the actions over a network, and make code easier to test. The types to represent our actions might look something like this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>BakeBrownies</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>tag</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>BAKE_BROWNIES</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>quantity</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>};</span>
<span>type</span> <span>EatBrownie</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>tag</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>EAT_BROWNIE</span><span>"</span> <span>};</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Action</span> <span>=</span> <span>BakeBrownies</span> <span>|</span> <span>EatBrownie</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Eventually we need to do something with these action objects, so let’s write a simple class to handle them.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>BrownieCounter</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>brownieCount</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

    <span>bakeBrownies</span><span>(</span><span>action</span><span>:</span> <span>BakeBrownies</span><span>):</span> <span>void</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>brownieCount</span> <span>+=</span> <span>action</span><span>.</span><span>quantity</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>eatBrownie</span><span>(</span><span>action</span><span>:</span> <span>EatBrownie</span><span>):</span> <span>void</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>brownieCount</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Om nom nom</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
            <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>brownieCount</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Noooooo!</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To glue them together, we’ll need a function which takes the action and passes it to the correct method of our <code>BrownieCounter</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>dispatchAction</span><span>(</span><span>brownieCounter</span><span>:</span> <span>BrownieCounter</span><span>,</span> <span>action</span><span>:</span> <span>Action</span><span>):</span> <span>void</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>switch</span> <span>(</span><span>action</span><span>.</span><span>tag</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>case</span> <span>"</span><span>BAKE_BROWNIES</span><span>"</span><span>:</span>
            <span>brownieCounter</span><span>.</span><span>bakeBrownies</span><span>(</span><span>action</span><span>);</span>
            <span>break</span><span>;</span>
        <span>case</span> <span>"</span><span>EAT_BROWNIE</span><span>"</span><span>:</span>
            <span>brownieCounter</span><span>.</span><span>eatBrownie</span><span>(</span><span>action</span><span>);</span>
            <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is ok for now, but as we add more actions to our program, it’s going to get annoying having to add a new case for every one. Since the method names on our <code>BrownieCounter</code> are just camel case versions of the action tags, we can rewrite <code>dispatchAction</code> to generate the method name and call it. We just need a little <code>snakeCaseToCamelCase</code> helper function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>dispatchAction</span><span>(</span><span>brownieCounter</span><span>:</span> <span>BrownieCounter</span><span>,</span> <span>action</span><span>:</span> <span>Action</span><span>):</span> <span>void</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>(</span><span>brownieCounter</span> <span>as</span> <span>any</span><span>)[</span><span>snakeCaseToCamelCase</span><span>(</span><span>action</span><span>.</span><span>tag</span><span>)](</span><span>action</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>snakeCaseToCamelCase</span><span>(</span><span>snakeCaseString</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>):</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
        <span>snakeCaseString</span>
        <span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>_</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span>map</span><span>((</span><span>word</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
            <span>i</span> <span>===</span> <span>0</span> <span>?</span>
                <span>word</span><span>.</span><span>toLowerCase</span><span>()</span> <span>:</span>
                <span>word</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>(</span><span>word</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>].</span><span>toUpperCase</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>word</span><span>.</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>).</span><span>toLowerCase</span><span>())</span>
        <span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>""</span><span>)</span>
    <span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This avoids the boilerplate, but it’s a step backwards for type safety. As the type signature of <code>snakeCaseToCamelCase</code> only says it returns a string, the compiler has no way to know whether that string will be a valid method name for <code>BrownieCounter</code>, so we have to cast to <code>any</code> to allow it. Even worse, if we add a new action to the program, but forget to add a method to <code>BrownieCounter</code> to handle it, we won’t get a type error. It will not be until runtime that we see this sad message.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>brownieCounter[snakeCaseToCamelCase(...)] is not a function</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Luckily, with TypeScript 4.1, we no longer need to choose between boilerplate and type safety. Using template literal types we can reimplement our case conversion at the type level. This requires another handy new feature - four new types for manipulating string literal types called <code>Uppercase</code>, <code>Lowercase</code>, <code>Capitalize</code> and <code>Uncapitalize</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>SnakeCaseToCamelCase</span><span>&lt;</span><span>S</span> <span>extends</span> <span>string</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span>

        <span>`</span><span>${</span><span>Lowercase</span><span>&lt;</span><span>S</span><span>&gt;</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>;</span>

<span>type</span> <span>SnakeCaseToPascalCase</span><span>&lt;</span><span>S</span> <span>extends</span> <span>string</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>S</span> <span>extends</span> <span>`</span><span>${</span><span>infer</span> <span>FirstWord</span><span>}</span><span>_</span><span>${</span><span>infer</span> <span>Rest</span><span>}</span><span>`</span> <span>?</span>

        <span>Capitalize</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Lowercase</span><span>&lt;</span><span>S</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>;</span>

<span>type</span> <span>BakeBrowniesCamelCase</span> <span>=</span> <span>SnakeCaseToCamelCase</span><span>&lt;</span><span>"</span><span>BAKE_BROWNIES</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>// = "bakeBrownies"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can use this fancy new type to provide a more informative signature for our helper function.</p>
